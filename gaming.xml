		<p>Virtual Reality marque nDreams has announced a brand new shooter, Vendetta Forever, a VR love letter to classic action cinema coming to PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2 and newer in October.</p>
<p>A five-level demo is available right now from the Meta Quest store.</p>
<p><iframe title="VENDETTA FOREVER Announce Trailer | nDreams | Meta Quest &amp; PS VR2 UNLISTED" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGYbI-eHzbs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Building off their growing experience with VR shooters, built up on games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/fracked-review-psvr-shooter/">Fracked</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a>, Vendetta Forever will blend together rapid-fire gunplay with acrobatic style for something a little bit different. This is thanks to the new “Lo-Kill-Motion” system, where players will have to shoot to kill and kill to move, grabbing enemy weapons as you move forward to progress through a level.</p>
<p>Levels have been constructed as maze-like puzzles for players to progress through, using improvised weaponry to takedown enemies in a bloody path to the end of the stage. There will be collectibles to find, modifiers to try-out and online leaderboards aiming to power game replayability through the more-than-60 levels.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221080/activision-call-of-duty-downloads-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty</em> games have famously giant file sizes, but ahead of the October 25th launch of <em>Black Ops 6</em>, Activision is going to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap">make some changes</a> so that <em>Call of Duty</em> titles don’t take up as much space on your hard drive — including separating <em>Warzone</em> from the default download for the annual games.</p><p>The default separation of <em>Warzone</em> is happening soon: on August 21st, alongside the launch of Season 5 Reloaded. As part of that, when you download an annual <em>Call of Duty</em> game, you’ll also be able to opt in to also download <em>Warzone</em> if you want. And if you just want to download <em>Warzone</em>, that will still be an option as well.</p><p>With Season 5 Reloaded, Activision also says that it is going to rely more on texture streaming, and players will be able to pick between “optimized” (the default) or “minimal” streaming. In mid-October, Activision plans to introduce a new user interface for browsing your <em>Call of Duty</em> games, too.</p><p>But to prepare for these changes, Activision says you’re going to have to download a big update as part of the Season 5 rollout that will reorganize game files and add new tech “to prep the way for the full player interface.” After that update is done, Activision says that <em>Call of Duty</em>’s footprint will go down because of the “file optimizations.” (PlayStation 5 players will have to download a series of updates because of “differences in file organization.”)</p><div><figcaption><em>A roadmap from Activision about upcoming </em>Call of Duty<em> updates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Activision</cite></p></div><p>Because of the updates, Activision says that <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be a “smaller download at launch than <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</em>” The company doesn’t have a specific download size for <em>Black Ops 6</em> yet, but it says that the estimated file sizes shown on preorder listings don’t represent the “download size or disk footprint” for the game. (Activision has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-isnt-300-gb-after-all">had to clarify this</a> after an Xbox store page listing showed a jaw-dropping 309.85GB download.)</p><p>Activision will also be hosting a <em>Black Ops 6</em> open beta that starts on August 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Space 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> launched in 2016, but Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-stellaris-has-taken-on-new-life-over-its-six-year-strategy-journey">can't stop adding to the universe</a>. Last time I checked in, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-stellaris-dlc-astral-rift-will-take-you-on-a-journey-to-other-dimensions">school trips to other dimensions</a>. Now, it's Cosmic Storms. Due for release alongside the Stellaris 3.13 Vela update on September 10th, these are a paid "mechanical expansion" (priced at a rather chunky £11, $13 or €13, and available as part of the current season pass) that builds upon the game's existing Space Storms, "providing a deeper experience with strategically meaningful gameplay and beautiful upgraded visuals". Wash that down with new civics, precursor narratives, anomalies, archaeology sites, techs, edicts, a new Ascension perk, and new galactic community resolutions.</p><!--more-->

<p>As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/4346621462131326207">detailed on Steam</a>, there are eight of these new and violent instances of space weather, ranging from more straightforward Electric Storms to Nexus Storms of "unparalleled magnitude". Each may have positive and negative effects upon ships, worlds and civilisations caught in their path. When they sweep over your planets, they may reshape the geography and expose long buried treasures. </p>
<p>The developers are adding a "weather map mode" so you can play, er, whatever the interstellar equivalent of a meteorologist is, forecasting storms and predicting their motion. Ah yes, Astrometeorologist! You can also research technologies and buildings that let you attract, repel and (with an Ascension Perk) even create Cosmic Storms. There's also a new Storm Chaser origin seemingly consisting of nutters in Speedo goggles, who live for the thrill of running face-first into a cyclone the size of a solar system. As for the additional Precursor narrative chains, these "weave tales of civilizations long lost to the cosmic winds, with untold secrets buried beneath the stars".</p>
<p>Storm chasers, eh? It could almost have been timed to intersect with the new Twister movie, which I haven't watched because I think the new male lead is unbearable. Go munch on a hurricane, you smug macho berk. If you enjoy storms but prefer a more hands-on experience, maybe try <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a> - it's an early access simulation of North America's legendary tornado alley.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a bit archaic but will give you the warm fuzzies as you think back to the days of lugging around games in a nylon carrying case.

A series of statues in a glass case were displayed alongside special branding that read, “Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered.” But the event came and went without any official announcement from Crystal Dynamics, leaving some disappointed and others hopeful that the collection was just waiting on an official announcement at GamesCom for another event.<br></p><p>That might still be in the works, but in the meantime it seems like the only way to revisit <em>Legacy of Kain<strong>:</strong> Soul Reaver </em>in any official capacity will be dropping $100  on an Evercade (the first game is on GOG for $1 at the moment).&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver </em>was removed from Steam in 2021, and the original game has never been available on modern platforms. The three later entries in the series, <em>Soul Reaver 2</em>, <em>Blood Omen 2</em>, and<em> Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em> are also still available to play on PC currently. I’m sure the collection for the first two games will land their eventually as well. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's current user-interface isn't very user-friendly, with lots of scrolling needed for blocky menus that are often compared to the Hulu streaming app, but Activision is changing this before the launch of Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher announced that a new interface is on the way, and the Call of Duty app will receive updates to the UI that will make navigation easier. This UI overhaul arrives sometime in mid-October, but a specific date was not given for the big change.</p><p dir="ltr">The new UI will introduce a Call of Duty landing zone where top content will be visible on one clean page without needing to scroll. This page is set to feature Call of Duty's most-recent annual feature as well as Warzone, with past titles still being accessible through the player's game library.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4350674-newcodappui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350674" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4350674-newcodappui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350674"></a><figcaption>A work-in-progress look at the new Call of Duty UI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4350674-newcodappui.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision says, "The landing page's main focus is on games, and gives players the ability to directly access those games."</p><p dir="ltr">The preview of the new UI can be seen above, but the image is of the work-in-progress version, and the publisher says finishing touches are still being made.

                <p>Legendary's cinematic Monsterverse is set to enter the realm of video games in a big way later this year following the success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-has-monster-sized-box-office-debut/1100-6522293/" data-ref-id="1100-6522293">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire at the box office</a>, with three Monsterverse games set to release in the back half of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">One of those upcoming titles is the newly announced Kong: Survivor Instinct, described as a 2.5D action-adventure game set during and after the events of 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong. The game will see players take on the role of a father searching for his lost daughter through the wreckage left in the wake of Kong and Godzilla's battle. Of the three upcoming games, Kong: Survivor Instinct will be the only one released as a standalone product on PC and current-gen consoles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTU_A1MsjfY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CTU_A1MsjfY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In a press release, 7Levels co-founder Paweł Biela said working with the Monsterverse IP has been a "formative experience" for the developer, and that the game will allow the team to "show some of the fan-favorite Titans from a unique perspective."</p><p dir="ltr">As for the other two Monsterverse games on the way, one will be inside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, where players will be able to "become Monarch operatives" and interact with various Titans in an interactive experience. The other is a 4X mobile strategy game, Godzilla x Kong: Titan Chasers. Developed by Hunted Cow Games and published by Tilting Point LLC, players in Godzilla x Kong: Titan Chasers will build bases, recruit Titan Chasers, and battle it out in turn-based combat with monsters on the newly emerged Siren Isles. When players aren't fighting monsters, they'll also be finding ways to engage with and support Godzilla and Kong themselves. The game is already playable in certain regions but will be releasing globally soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Siren Isles are just a small sliver of the world created by the films, but the story that will be uncovered, and the conflict unleashed by players and their competing alliances, promises to be no less momentous," Tomas Gonzales, Tilting Point senior game manager, said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">No exact release dates have been given for the three Monsterverse games, other than the news that they will each release in 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when the Monsterverse will return to the big screen, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-3-may-be-coming-out-in-2026-next-monsterverse-movie-gets-2027-release-date/1100-6524604/" data-ref-id="1100-6524604">next film in the series is slated for a March 26, 2027 release</a> and will be directed by Grant Sputore.</p>

So if you want to run games at 4K or are a professional photographer or content creator, the power offered by the 9950X should be mighty appealing.

These clock in at just $359 and $279, respectively, making them a better option for shoppers on a budget.</p><p>The Ryzen 7 9700X gets you 8 cores, 16 threads, and hits up to 5.5 GHz, so it's still a solid choice for gaming. The cheaper Ryzen 5 9600 isn't quite as robust with 6 cores, 12 threads, and up to 5.4 GHz, but its low price tag makes it appealing to frugal shoppers or folks building their first rig.</p><p>Keep in mind that all of these are new releases from AMD, and they're likely to sell out fast.

		<p>Skydance Games has announced that their upcoming VR melee action game Skydance’s Behemoth will arrive on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 and</a> 3, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and PC VR on 14th November.</p>
<p><iframe title="Skydance's BEHEMOTH - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVTYfIbldAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Skydance will be out in force during Gamescom, offering all and sundry demos to sample the game –&nbsp;head to Hall 10, botth A-042 – as well as debuting a limited-edition graphic novel to delve into the setting of the Forsaken Landsand story. This has been penned by New York Times-bestselling author and game designer Matt Forbeck with illustrations by renowned comic artist Daniele Serra, with a small batch available each day from 21st to 25th August.</p>
<p>Following on from their acclaimed The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners games with an original new world, Skydance Games is shifting focus more in the direction of melee combat through dark fantasy world. The elephants in the room, though, are the titular Behemoths, huge creatures that you’ll have to battle, and which bring inevitable comparisons to Shadow of the Colossus.</p>
<p>We went hands on with Behemoth a few months ago, sampling a trimmed down demo level and encountering the first of these Behemoths. I said that “Whether your VR headset sees regular use or has been gathering dust in recent months, Skydance’s Behemoth is shaping up to be a great reason to pop it on and fight through its blend of human-sized and gigantic enemies.”</p>

Flame Fatales, the all-women and femmes charity speedrunning event from Games Done Quick, returns for another week-long programme of  impressively swift gaming feats this weekend.
</p>
<p>
This year's Flame Fatales (which will be the event's fourth outing since its launch back in 2021) gets underway on Sunday, 16th August. More specifically, things kick off at 6:15pm BST, with a Horizon Forbidden West Burning Shores 100% speedrun by RE_doc19.
</p>
<p>
Seven days - and more than 50 speedruns - later - this year's Femme Fatales comes to a close at 4:06am BST with a Super Mario Odyssey Talkatoo% speedrun by CheeseJay. In between, you can expect speedruns for the likes of Persona Dancing, Sonic CD, Broken Age, Stray, the Resident Evil 2 remake, Rez, and plenty more - as outlined in <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/49">this year's full schedule</a>.

		<p>For all the early promise of PlayStation VR 2, eighteen months on, it feels like Sony’s second crack at virtual reality gaming is already running out of steam. There’s next to no sign of first party support, leaving the console-based VR headset to rely on third parties. So how to build up a fresh head of steam? Well… how about filling your head with SteamVR thanks to a new PC adapter?</p>
<p>The PSVR2 PC Adapter is pretty much exactly what this headset needs to prevent it from becoming a gaming cul-de-sac if and when Sony decide to call it a day.</p>
<p>Setting up PSVR 2 on PC is relatively straightforward, with a few key caveats. Sony has pushed a PlayStation VR 2 app onto Steam to provide drivers, basic setup functionality and updates, and a direct tie into the go-to library for PC VR games. With that installed, you just put cables in the right spots on the breakout box, go through putting the headset on for the first time, connect the Sense controllers, and hop into SteamVR’s built-in hub.</p>


<p>Simple, right? Well… Sony has somehow managed to make it feel more difficult than it should be. For one thing, there’s no DisplayPort 1.4 cable included in the box, so you’ll have to bring your own, which is a bit of daft penny-pinching if you ask me. Conversely, I wish the USB cable was detachable as well.</p>


<p>Then there’s a whole palaver surrounding Bluetooth adapters and the Sense controllers. The minimum requirement here is for Bluetooth 4.0, but Sony has a minimal set of just four recommended Bluetooth 5.0 USB adapters, which crucially are not guaranteed to work – just a quick look at Reddit will tell you that people are not having a universally good time with these four.</p>
<p>This is actually a problem that’s potentially a bit blown out of proportion. USB Bluetooth adapters are tiny and have minimal antennae that are liable to interference, whether from 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi or the electronic noise of a USB 3 port – Sony’s help pages do suggest using a USB 2.0 port far away from USB 3.0, and to use an extension cable for this reason. What’s not stated on Sony’s compatible adapter page is that motherboards with Wi-Fi built in will typically also have Bluetooth in the same chipset and (so long as you connect them) better antennas than a USB adapter, and so are very likely to give a better experience. For what it’s worth, I’ve had no problems with an older Asus USB-BT400 adapter (not the recommended USB-BT500) placed close to my play space.</p>
<p>Of course, much like including a DisplayPort cable, Sony could have built a single-purpose Bluetooth chip into the adapter, given it a half-decent antenna, and made this all as seamless as possible for something like $5 more.</p>

<p>Once you get past any of these hurdles, though, the full breadth of PC VR gaming is open to you. Half-Life: Alyx is sure to be one of the first stops for PlayStation VR players, whose hopes for a PSVR2 port have gone completely unanswered in the past 18 months. I’ve never owned a PC VR headset, and stepping into the distinctive Half-Life setting for an introductory hour of VR has been fantastic –&nbsp;the basic interactivity of picking up a marker pen to draw on a window, the grimy pre-Half-Life 2 setting, it’s still a great showcase for what VR gaming is capable of, four years on from release.</p>
<p>Racing game fans also have an embarrassment of riches to choose from – there’s&nbsp;Dirt Rally and EA Sports WRC from Codemasters, F1 2022 and newer, Assetto Corsa, and more. As good as Gran Turismo 7 is in offering the full fat version of Polyphony’s racing game up for VR, there hasn’t seemed to be much interest from other developers to follow, after the early experiments on the first PSVR.</p>
<p>And speaking of the last generation headset, one of the biggest boons that this PC adapter offers is access to the full back catalogue of VR gaming. For whatever technical or business reasons, Sony didn’t offer a backward compatibility layer for the new headset, relying instead on cross-gen ports, and that means there’s a large number of great VR games trapped on the original PSVR for console players which can be found on PC –&nbsp;and since my PSVR unit suffers from a nasty case of tracking drift, these became games that I struggled to enjoy for more than half an hour.</p>

<p>Of course, this will mean buying these games again, but since they’re older titles now, they’ll often be found in sales. I’ve picked up Star Wars: Squadrons in the past for just a few quid – note, it completely ignores the Sense controllers, so you’ll need a gamepad, and there’s some strange technical quirks that limit frame rates – and I’ve put a pin on Hitman: World of Assassination to see when it falls into what I want to spend on it, since it was never updated for PSVR 2.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of appealing elements for using PSVR 2 on PC, but there are also some drawbacks compared to plugging it into PS5. Games on console can use full HDR, eye-tracking and headset rumble, while the Sense controllers can have haptic feedback instead of more basic rumble and adaptive triggers. Technically, I don’t think there’s much stopping Sony from expanding their drivers to enable these features for developers –&nbsp;HTC Vive added eye-tracking functionality in 2019, for example –&nbsp;but they haven’t for launch, at least.</p>
<p>There is a feeling that Sony are largely just tapping into the industry standard foundations that PSVR 2 was built upon. SteamVR already has support for finger sensing, so that works, and the PC adapter is seemingly equivalent to VirtualLink and USB-C Alt Mode adapters, which is what PSVR 2 uses for its single cable solution on PS5. In fact, PC gamers might well have native support built into their GPU, with reports that GeForce RTX 20 Series GPUs and Radeon 6000 and 7000 series GPUs with USB-C outputs built in work to power the headset –&nbsp;some of these ports and gaming laptops might not provide enough power, and Nvidia ditched USB-C for the 30 Series, so the adapter is still very relevant. It’s a shame that Sony hasn’t publicised this point, though.</p>
<p>And that ties in with my overarching sentiment for the PC adapter. This feels like Sony putting PSVR 2 on life support for their console business, especially given how company executives have spoken about its wider game development plans, and the cuts they’ve made to the overarching workforce. We’ll certainly see some third party support still, but that might also tail off if PS5 VR gaming doesn’t keep up with standalone headsets and PC VR’s audiences.</p>
<p>For all my grousing, having a PC adapter at all is a massive boon for anyone that’s hopped on board with PSVR 2 in the past year, and the problems with it are really just down to some unclear and muddled messaging from Sony. If a gaming PC is part of your life, then having a look to see if you’ve got a USB-C port on the GPU or picking up this relatively cheap adapter is a no-brainer. You get the full Steam and wider PC VR library, and the security that this offers to your investment, and outside of the PS5 exclusive Resident Evil VR modes and Gran Turismo 7, it’s easy to consider going all-in on PC VR.</p>
<p>As for VR curious PC gamers considering just such an investment, we just have to look at the alternatives. The Valve Index and HTC Vive platforms are significantly more expensive, while the comparatively priced HP Reverb G2 is a few years older and only goes up to 90Hz with its screen. Meta Quest headsets are significantly more flexible as they offer both standalone and connected use, but they don’t use USB-C alt modes for video, so can have compression artifacting to the image, which could counter the advantages of their pancake lenses. Compared to the alternatives, PSVR 2 is perhaps now the go-to PC VR headset, and especially if you can get it for a reduced price.</p>

			<p>Today, KRAFTON announced a partnership with Overwolf to bring an official modding program to the upcoming life simulation game inZOI. Hyungjun Kim, Producer &amp; Director of inZOI, stated:</p>
<p><em>inZOI is committed to encouraging easier mod creation and artistic expression from players. By partnering with CurseForge, we are providing a dedicated platform for inZOI mods, ensuring that our community has the best tools and resources to bring their creative visions to life. This collaboration reflects our dedication to fostering a vibrant modding community within inZOI.</em></p>
<p>Overwolf CEO Uri Marchand added:</p>
<p><em>UGC is the present and the future of gaming, driven by a community of passionate creators and players who want to shape their experiences and make gameplay their own. inZOI is the perfect environment for UGC to thrive and we are thrilled to partner with KRAFTON to provide safe, curated modding experiences into highly anticipated inZOI from launch.</em></p>
<p>As part of the partnership, Overwolf will work with KRAFTON to identify early access modders to create content in advance of the game's launch as well as create a safe and curated space for inZOI mods to be hosted on CurseForge.</p>
<p>inZOI is a life simulation game powered by Unreal Engine 5 that emphasizes the user-generated experience, giving players full control over the gameplay to alter any aspect of their world and create unique stories. inZOI ultimately aims to serve as a tool for creativity, with players able to share and discuss their creations through the in-game canvas.</p>
<p>Unlike other life simulation games, inZOI features photorealistic visuals. Key gameplay features include Karma, where players' past actions affect their future lives, City Edit for controlling weather and city billboards, and Group Activities for players to enjoy daily life together.</p>

<p>As a special treat for the inZOI community, KRAFTON is releasing a limited time trial of the character creation feature, inZOI: Character Studio on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Available worldwide from 04:00 UTC, August 21st to 04:00 UTC, August 26th, this feature allows players to create their dream avatar, the 'Zoi', with over 250 customization options.</p>
<p>This isn't the first major Overwolf partnership on user generated content (UGC). Recently, CurseForge also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> premium mods on consoles for Studio Wildcard's ARK: Survival Ascended.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-roadmap-post-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bad Ridge Games and publisher V Publishing have revealed an initial&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>post-launch roadmap, detailing some of the features that are coming to the morally-charged life sim after its release this September.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest addition on the slate for&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>is co-op multiplayer, which will be added to the game as part of a major update at some point next year. Both online and local play will be supported.</p>
<p>Post-launch,&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>will also feature support for modding on PC, and another update will add "heartwarming family dynamics" to let you start and grow a family.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mirthwood-roadmap-festival-of-blossoms.jpg?itok=w02rKtxi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mirthwood-roadmap-festival-of-blossoms.jpg?itok=5gX2lQV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Festivals are just one of the features making their way to&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>&nbsp;at or after launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Festivals are another major feature being added to&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>after its launch (or, technically, at launch). The first of these, the Festival of Blossoms, will start on September 11th alongside&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s launch, and more festivals offering "special activities and quests" will be added later down the line.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to seasonal content updates bringing themed rewards and activities around occasions like Halloween and Christmas. After all, it wouldn't be much of a life sim without Christmas and Halloween!</p>
<p>Naturally, there will be lots of other updates and content drops throughout&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>'s lifetime. The devs have confirmed that the game will feature both paid and free content, so if you're willing to pony up a little extra cash, you'll likely get some more substantial stuff.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Mirthwood</em>, it's a life sim "inspired by&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><i>Stardew Valley</i></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rimworld"><em>RimWorld</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>".&nbsp;</p>
<p>You play a character who flees a war-torn continent in order to start life anew in an unfamiliar land, and so begins the usual life sim day-to-day; befriending locals, exploring your town's surroundings, and generally becoming a part of the community.</p>
<p><em>Mirthwood&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272900/Mirthwood/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a> on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mirthwood-release-date">September 11th</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things life sim.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24220559/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-trailer-gamescom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare is announcing the release date for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176005/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a> and sharing a new trailer to commemorate the occasion. Players will be able to return to Thedas — the name of the game’s world that is simultaneously a clever acronym for The Dragon Age Setting — on October 31st, more than 10 years after the release of the previous game, <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>.</p><p>Oh man, there’s some <em>lore</em> going on in this new trailer. Up until now, fans assumed that Solas, a companion from <em>Inquisition</em> who went rogue during the events of the game’s <em>Trespasser</em> DLC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/2/23152050/dragon-age-dreadwolf-4-bioware-ea">would be the main bad guy</a>. But this trailer confirms a burgeoning community theory that Solas is just a small fry compared to the game’s real big baddies — the Elven gods.</p><p>BioWare announced <em>Veilguard</em> back in 2018 but shared very few substantive updates until 2022. In the intervening time, some senior talent left the studio, including general manager <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151192/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-leaving-dragon-age-mass-effect">Casey Hudson</a>, executive producer Mark Darrah, production director <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567676/bioware-mass-effect-mac-walters-dragon-age-dreadwolf">Mac Walters</a>, and senior creative producer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801037/dragon-age-4-matt-goldman-bioware-ea">Matt Goldman</a>. Several employees, including several BioWare veterans, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843096/bioware-layoffs-dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect">were also lost to layoffs</a>.</p><p>Development on <em>Veilguard</em> was also impacted by changing trends in the video game industry. After the critical and commercial failure of <em>Anthem</em>, BioWare’s MMO-style action RPG with flying exosuits, BioWare’s parent company EA canceled <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301634/dragon-age-single-player-only-ea-bioware-shifts">the planned multiplayer elements for <em>Veilguard</em></a> in hopes of capturing the kind of success enjoyed by other EA-produced single-player games like <em>Jedi: Fallen Order.</em></p><p><em>Veilguard</em> will be available for preorder today for $59.99 on PC and $69.99 on Xbox and PlayStation. Though the long development cycle, layoffs, and departures have fans concerned about the potential quality of the game, <em>Veilguard</em> arrives when single-player narrative games are experiencing huge success, most notably 2023’s game of the year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Comparisons between the two are inevitable, but based on this trailer — <em>we are so very back</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a> is a relaxing, wholly escapist building sim where you can kick back and summon villages, cottages and castles whilst listening to whimsical tunes without the worry of combat or busywork. This cosy game has received a lot of attention, <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1801342217724010897">becoming the fourth most-played demo</a> during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024">Steam Next Fest</a> and earning a place within our own list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-9-favourite-demos-from-the-summer-steam-next-fest">favourite demos</a>. It now has a release date - 23rd September 2024.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We don't have to wait much longer to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">the witchy cottages of our dreams</a>. Better yet, a bunch of new building options and locations have also been shared via the release trailer below. If you're still on the fence or were unlucky and missed out on the free demo, developers Pounce Light will make it available again alongside the full game release. Look out for it on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/Tiny%20Glade%20on%20Steam%20(steampowered.com)">Tiny Glade Steam page</a>.</p>

</span></p></div>
<p>As you can see, Tiny Glade still has the procedural generation system that made the demo so popular. With a brickle brackle clackity clack, out pops different decor that you can cycle through manually, or leave to the fates to choose for you. There's a new water feature where you can add ponds, small fish and ducks (and yes, you can pet them). Trees placed on the water will bloom with reeds, and you'll be able to decorate the waterways with a variety of lilies to really see the biomes thrive.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed players will notice that the trailer offers an entire colour palette of brick options for buildings, including a few more weathered or ivy-spattered surfaces to really pop some character into your builds. A few other details I happened to notice which weren't in the demo are chimneys, balconies (which is fantastic as I had to mess around with pre-fab foundations to try to make this work in the demo), a trapdoor and more decorations such as banners and flags.</p>
<p>The trailer also offers another look at the different seasonal biomes we can expect on release - there are five in total - including a moody winterscape that is just begging to have the castle of Winterfell added to it. Then again, Winterfell has been recreated in a lot of construction sims. What would you build instead?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
