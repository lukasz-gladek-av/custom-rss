More isolationist and feral than other Druid groups, the Druids of the Sharval Wilds unleash primal fury upon their foes, brimming with the chaotic energy of mother nature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521866-diabloimmortaldruidclassfeature.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521866" data-ratio="0.56260720411664" data-width="1749" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521866-diabloimmortaldruidclassfeature.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521866"></a><figcaption>Diablo Immortal's Druid is more primal and chaotic than the one seen in Diablo 2 or 4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521866-diabloimmortaldruidclassfeature.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When it came to making Diablo Immortal's Druid stand out from earlier versions, Blizzard looked to the real world for timely inspiration. There's a reason Diablo Immortal's version of the Druid uses wildfire-inducing fire magic and earthquake-creating earth magic, two elements that can spiral out of control and wreak havoc on the surrounding environment.</p><p dir="ltr">"At Blizzard generally, not even just on this team, we talk a lot about what is the right time for this class, what is the right time for this zone?" Diablo Immortal senior narrative designer Ryan Quinn said in an interview with GameSpot. "Knowing that we're going to this densely wooded place where Druids and witches fight over how to share the land…not to channel too much of the fact that I live in southern California, but a wildfire seems very, very poised to create tension and conflict in that environment."</p><p dir="ltr">While the class maintains many of the familiar aspects of the Druid that fans of the class from previous installments will be familiar with--elemental spellcasting, shapeshifting abilities, and animal companions--how Diablo Immortal's Druid actually looks and plays will be quite different. The class puts an emphasis on constantly transitioning between forms, whether it's diving into the fray as a werebear, repositioning and crowd-controlling enemies as the new stag form, or dissolving into a swarm of dive-bombing ravens.</p><p dir="ltr">Quinn said Blizzard knew this new version of the Druid needed to feel different. Part of realizing that goal came in the form of the Druid's new shapeshifting abilities, going beyond the usual werebear and werewolf forms.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to do stuff that's a little more diverse, we didn't want to just do predator forms," Quinn said. "And we wanted it to look and feel more chaotic."</p><p dir="ltr">Quinn used an example of how earlier in development, the Druid simply transformed into a single raven. But that didn't feel powerful enough, so the team instead opted for the Druid to transform into an entire flock of ravens. That line of thinking can be seen throughout the Druid's toolkit, where each ability feels like it's ready to spiral out of control.</p><p dir="ltr">It also translates to the Druid's gameplay. Blizzard's goal was to make Diablo Immortal's Druid more agile than previous versions, lead systems engineer John Yoo said, with an emphasis on constantly shapeshifting.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to encourage people to have dynamic play by swapping in and out of forms, using abilities," Yoo said. "We wanted it to feel very, very active."</p><p dir="ltr">Players don't have to always be swapping in and out of forms and can be successful just playing as more of a straight spellcaster or sticking to one form, Yoo said. While sticking to one playstyle will be "viable," Yoo said those who want to push the class to its limits and maximize their damage will likely want to change forms depending on the situation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521861"></a><figcaption>In addition to shapeshifting, Diablo Immortal's Druid can wield primal earth and fire magic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4521861-diabloimmortalearthmagic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For fans of older versions of Diablo's Druid, there are still some throwbacks to what fans already know. Diablo Immortal's Druid can use fire magic, like in Diablo 2, and has similar summonable companions, like direwolves (although Yoo said the team did experiment with summonable direboars instead). Quinn said since Diablo Immortal takes place between Diablo 2 and 3, the team is always aware of the legacy preceding the mobile ARPG. With that in mind, Blizzard looks to strike a balance when it comes honoring what came before while also making room for new ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">"Occasionally it is take the familiar thing [in] a very familiar direction," Quinn said. "Sometimes, it's just add. Take the familiar thing, but bolt something new and cool onto it that doesn't contradict it. And sometimes it's whole cloth invention."</p><p dir="ltr">One example of that philosophy in action is the return of the Druid's Oak Sage ability. Previously seen in Diablo 2, Oak Sage is back in Diablo Immortal. Instead of a more passive aura like in Diablo 2, the Oak Sage in Diablo Immortal is instead punched up and depicted as a friendly forest fae that boosts players' health and defense but also attacks enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to push the boundaries, make our Druid feel different from other Druids," Yoo said. "While we wanted to keep the inherent theme and nature of the Druid, no pun intended, we still wanted to make it unique, fresh, and distinctly our own in Diablo Immortal."</p><p dir="ltr">The addition of the Druid is just the latest in a series of updates outlined in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-2025-roadmap-reveals-another-new-class-is-on-the-way/1100-6530052/" data-ref-id="1100-6530052">Diablo Immortal's 2025 roadmap</a> Blizzard has dubbed the Epoch of Madness, all of which continue to explore the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-biggest-boss-battle-yet-is-fittingly-against-diablo-himself/1100-6528355/" data-ref-id="1100-6528355">defeat of Diablo last year</a> and the power vacuum left in his wake. A fourth major update currently shrouded in mystery, titled The First &amp; Last King, is slated to arrive later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4, meanwhile, continues to evolve, as Blizzard looks to update the ARPG's endgame. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Season 8 overhauled Diablo 4's endgame bosses</a>, while the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">Season 9 brings permanent changes to Nightmare dungeons</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sega is now the official gaming partner of McLaren Racing, in a multi-year collaboration with Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with Eurogamer, the partnership promises to "fuse the worlds of motorsport and gaming and engage audiences of all ages both on the grid and screen". It's unknown exactly what this will entail, but it's all part of Sonic Team's 2025 "<a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a>" campaign.</p>
<p>The partnership will continue into 2026, Sonic's 35th anniversary year, as well as the McLaren Formula 1 team's 1,000th Grand Prix race.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time the two companies have joined forces. Back in 1993, the European Grand Prix was held in Donington Park in the UK and was known as the Sonic Grand Prix. McLaren F1 driver Ayrton Senna won the race and received a Sonic the Hedgehog trophy.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to welcome Sonic the Hedgehog to the McLaren Racing family," said Louise McEwen, chief marketing officer of McLaren Racing. "This partnership brings together two iconic names in speed, and opens up our team to a wider, younger global audience. Sonic is a character with incredible heritage and a passionate fanbase, and we are very excited to celebrate our partnership at McLaren Racing Live: London."</p>
<p>The McLaren Racing Live event will take place in Trafalgar Square from 2nd - 3rd July.</p>
<p>The collaboration underlines Sega's key release for the year, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The next in the racing series, it features mid-race portals to other worlds to shake up gameplay, as well as including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Hatsune Miku, Persona's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve in its roster of racers</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a Sega Arcade racer, with the mechanical depth and tightened controls you'd expect from that lineage," wrote Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. "It's also a mad party game to boot."</p>
<p>The partnership also proves the brand power of Sonic and Sega, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">blue blur's star has risen over the past decade</a> through well-received games and films.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sega has partnered with an F1 team, either. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarrely-atlus-will-sponsor-haas-for-this-weeks-f1-singapore-grand-prix-in-honour-of-metaphor-refantazio">Atlus sponsored F1 team Haas last year</a> to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. Why? Both the team and the game share a Hulkenberg.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Patch 8.0 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> today for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, adding several features and new content. The main addition is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-outlines-2025-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siege Mode</a>, a new PvE mode that expands on the existing Operations mode to include endless enemy waves that can challenge even the strongest teams. When players are overwhelmed, they can call for reinforcements. They'll engage in intense battles across three distinctive sectors, each requiring a different strategy. Side objectives emerge during combat, providing the resources needed to summon either elite Space Marines or the formidable Dreadnought, which can drastically shift the balance of power on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Compared to the build previously available for testing on the Public Test Server, Saber Interactive has reworked the wave timer limit so that, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can become very short on higher waves, there is now a timer for the entire session. Each time players beat a wave, the timer increases.</p>
<p>The developers of Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 have also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves, meaning that enemies will become stronger more quickly after the 15th wave. These changes will ensure players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Additionally, the timer may be entirely removed in the future. Moreover, an option has been introduced to disable bot spawning in Private Mode.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 also received some major technical improvements for the PC version. There's now an experimental ray traced ambient occlusion feature (RTAO) that can be toggled on in the graphics settings, and NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is now fully supported, delivering better visuals with the latest transformer model and faster frame rates on GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are also many other balance tweaks and additions in the patch. Last but not least, Saber said they are preparing a significant update to the customization system, which will let players reuse chapter champion armor parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping, and technical restrictions). This will be in a future update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 7 million units sold, and the developers have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> Space Marine 3.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-gets-august-release-date.1228977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Umami Tiger and publisher Deck13 have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the upcoming story expansion DLC for the JRPG-inspired throwback&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will launch across all platforms on August 7th, and that's also when you'll be able to purchase the soundtrack for the DLC if you're musically inclined.</p>

<p>As Umami Tiger (which is essentially just a moniker for solo dev Matthias Linda) says,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled to arrive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025" rel="nofollow">in the second quarter of the year</a>, but "game development is complicated".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=PzOgomru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=vvQzRXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Echoes</em>'&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is arriving in August.</figcaption></figure><p>Linda says that while the DLC itself was ready for release at the end of Q2, "translations were not", and more testing was additionally needed in order to "iron out the last small issues" with&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;you'll get for your money (since&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>isn't a free DLC), it'll add "more of what you enjoyed so much" the first time around.</p>

<p>You'll be getting a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf, a vicious fighter with plenty of damaging moves to test out. Additionally, you can look forward to new areas to visit, as well as "over 40 new enemies and bosses" to battle.</p>

<p>More music will, of course, be added to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC, and you can also expect new gear to collect and new minigames to try out. All in all, if you liked&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, you'll probably want to give this a look.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a throwback JRPG inspired by classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>and SNES-era&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>games. Developed by solo creator Matthias Linda, the game takes you to a "fantasy world where dragons are as common as piloted mechanical suits".</p>

            <p>Ok, so you remember how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> arrived on PC and immediately there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">more smutty mods</a> than you could shake a fleshy stick at?</p>
<p>Well, the new Zone Kit modding tools <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> got as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-broken-a-life-system-is-finally-working-as-designed-according-to-gsc-game-world">yesterday's big patch</a> have done something similar, but with memey jank.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you'd expect given the Zone Kit takes up a very small 700GB of your hard drive and only came out the other day, there aren't too many mods out there that make use of it. However, taking a glance at how its <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2?date_live=Last+year">Mod.IO</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1643320/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a> pages are building up at this early stage, there are still a number of works that'll, er, transform your zoning experience.</p>
<p>Homing in on Mod.IO specifically, 19 of the 61 mods currently up on there are by the same author, Sanekum, whom <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-artist-kickstarts-the-zone-kit-modding-scene-with-a-flood-of-glorious-nonsense-mods-featuring-shrek-cj-and-you-guessed-it-thomas-the-tank-engine/">PC Gamer</a> note looks like they could be GSC 3D Artist <a href="https://www.artstation.com/sanekum">Aleksandr Silantev</a>.</p>
<p>That 31.15% (I have double checked the maths) of the total Stalker mods on the platform include the likes of <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/swampboss2#description">Shrek</a> and <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/cj-bloodsucker#description">CJ</a> from San Andreas cameos, but as a very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mindseye-i-saw-her">serious</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-bond-plays-more-reckless-than-agent-47s-murder-chess-and-after-scissoring-mads-mikkelsen-before-diving-off-a-balcony-i-think-i-get-it">games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">journalist</a> I'm interested in keeping things <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>. To that end, Sanekum offers the chance to pick up an <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/rpg-melee-combat#description">RPG grenade</a>, or an even deadlier <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/melee-nettle-branch#description">nettle branch</a>, and attempt to beat to death some <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sherman-boar#description">Sherman tanks</a> that've been drafted in to replace boars.</p>
<p>What do you mean that's not <strong>totally down-to-earth and realistic</strong>? Clearly the Sherman tanks are being operated by the boars, who've just been magicked inside of them and given the sort of army training required to operate an armoured fighting vehicle with their little hooves. In the same way that <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/sidorovich-handgun#description">this mod</a> which turns a mini-Sidorovich into a handgun makes perfect anatomical sense.
</p>
<p>Aside from those, a fair few of these early Mod.IO works for Stalker look to be <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1312">existing</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/634">things</a> from places like Nexus Mods being <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/weapon-reposition-project-tacticool#description">ported</a> <a href="https://mod.io/g/stalker2/m/main-menu-animated-ferris-wheel-4k60fps#description">across</a>.</p>
<p>It'll be cool to see what Stalker's notoriously enthusiastic modding community can get up to once they've had time to buy an entire new PC just to ensure they've got the space needed to install the Zone Kit and a chance to play around with it properly. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-some-nettles-defeat-wild-pigs-in-sherman-tanks-thanks-to-stalker-2s-new-modding-tools-you-can-find-out]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> has seen a big boost in players after launching its first new class, but complaints over monetization have continued especially after developer Fatshark released a version of the Arbitrator's default helmet with its visor up for $5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/huge-warhammer-40000-darktide-battle-for-tertium-update-goes-live-alongside-new-class-the-adeptus-arbites">Battle for Tertium update</a>, which arrived alongside the new Adeptus Arbites class DLC, reworked the core player experience to provide a new, clearer narrative focus for the co-op first-person melee / shooter hybrid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players now experience a linear campaign with new mission debriefs and embedded cinematics. It’s designed to “ease in new players and gradually unlock features that were previously gated by character level,” Fatshark has said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the big draw for veteran players was the release of the Adeptus Arbites class, and it appears to have done the trick. This $11.99 DLC looks like it’s sparked the interest of players who have stuck with the game since its troubled launch, as well as convinced lapsed players to dip back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch, Darktide hit a peak concurrent player count of just over 43,000 on Steam, the highest it’s been on Valve’s platform for over two years. And this doesn’t even paint the whole picture of the game’s success, given it’s also out on console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement provided to IGN, Product Marketing Manager Rodrigue Delrue said Fatshark had noticed the uptick, but failed to say exactly how many were playing Darktide across PC and console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve seen a high level of engagement across all platforms, even if we don't have exact numbers to share at this time,” Delrue said. “What’s important is that the community remains active and passionate, and we’re incredibly thankful for that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/ss-ab7a23b22d0485c18ca39f259f38bef8d1f9d745-1920x1080-1750940682493.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Arbitrator's default helmet has its visor down. Image credit: Fatshark.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there is one sticking point: monetization. Darktide’s Adeptus Arbites DLC launched alongside a fresh round of premium cosmetics, bought with the in-game currency called Aquilas (the Aquila is the ancient symbol of the Imperium of Man in the Warhammer 40,000 universe). And within that monetization debate, one item in particular has set the community off: a helmet with its visor up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This helmet, specifically for the Arbitrator, is identical to the default visor-down helmet you get with the new class. So, you’re paying 900 Aquilas (approx. $5) just to lift your visor up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/screenshot-2025-06-26-125015-1750940732879.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Arbitrator's patrol helm with raised visor costs $5. Image credit: Fatshark.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d imagine, this hasn’t gone down well with some Darktide players. “We've reached the current peak of Fatshark greed,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1ljb3we/i_think_weve_reached_the_current_peak_of_fs_greed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one thread on the Darktide subreddit</a>, upvoted 3,000 times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, it’s bulls**t that this wasn’t just included alongside the otherwise identical default visor-down helmet,” said one player. “Just give me a button push that lets me do this,” suggested another. “I’m just glad the visor up isn’t default and they make you pay for down,” joked one fan. “You mean I have to pay extra to actually see my character’s ugly face? I was buying skins to cover it up.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put the complaints about this cosmetic and Darktide’s monetization generally to Fatshark, and Delrue explained the studio needs to sell items in order to continue working on the game, but took the feedback on board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cosmetic pricing is always a balancing act,” Delrue said. “As a live service game we want to be able to keep working on the game while respecting what players feel is fair value. We appreciate when these topics are brought up, these conversations help us better understand what the community values and helps inform how we approach cosmetics going forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, how much longer will Fatshark continue to work on adding new content to Darktide, which is approaching its third birthday? Delrue pointed to the studio’s continued support of the even older Warhammer game, Vermintide, as evidence of its commitment to its players, and even confirmed more new classes are on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since launch, we’ve continuously supported Darktide with free updates — and that commitment isn’t changing,” Delrue said. “As we’ve shown with Vermintide, we’re in this for the long haul. Players can naturally expect ongoing support, including new classes and additional free content as the game continues to evolve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<figure><a title="Switch 2 launch games ranked" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/807a505b22ace/switch-2-launch-games-ranked.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-all-day-one-releases">Switch 2's software lineup</a> at launch was filled with various known quantities, the breadth and quality of the games featured at the system's 5th June debut made for a very strong offering - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-does-switch-2-have-nintendos-best-launch-line-up-ever">perhaps one of the best of any console launch ever</a>.</p>
<p>We've done our best since the hardware's launch to review as many of its games as possible, and you can find our verdicts in the relevant <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2">S2 reviews</a>. Today, though, we're turning to you to answer the question: <em>What was the Switch 2's best launch game?</em></p>
<p>The ranking here includes every Switch 2 launch game in the West and is based on User Reviews in our database. With a catalogue of games this strong, even the ones towards the bottom may still be very, very good, and you may be surprised where <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — the first-party jewel in Switch 2's crown — ends up, too.</p>
<p>So, let's see what we've got at the bottom, shall we?</p>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="25 to 21" id="top-25">25. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Under no circumstances is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> a bad game — in fact, it’s a pretty darn decent game that’s filled to the brim with modes and features to tide puzzle lovers over for the long haul. However, that has everything to do with the solid skeleton of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> and barely anything to do with the minimal additions made to this Switch 2 re-release.</p>
<p>For newcomers to the series or those who missed its original release, there’s plenty of fun to be had here. For fans who already have the original version on Switch, we struggle to think of a greater waste of Switch 2 gaming funds than this.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">24. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> is a thoroughly competent, cosy game of cooperative gathering and crafting. It’s not much of a looker, and its ideas aren’t mind-blowing, but it’s all good stuff thanks to its robust controls and easy-to-grasp loop.</p>
<p>We're not sure we’d want to be stuck with it on a desert island, but it’s good company for several happy hours with a friend – especially a less experienced gamer.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">23. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> is a calming, surprisingly engaging hardware exhibition with a handful of cool minigames, a trove of interesting info, and some neat demos that showcase exactly what the little system can do. It makes you feel good about buying the thing, which makes the platform holder's decision <em>not</em> to bundle it with the console utterly baffling. Featuring expensive add-ons you might not own also won't impress anyone who's indignant that the company wants another 10 bucks for this.</p>
<p>That aside, it's an undeniably fine demonstration of Nintendo's thoughtful design approach. It's cute, it's fun, and it's a shame the whole pack-in argument overshadows the delightful software. Anyone interested in tech, design, or Nintendo in general should check it out immediately.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">22. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on Switch 2 fixes all glaring — and not so glaring — issues with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">the Switch 1 version</a> of the game. This is a huge package of activities; from battle royale to survival game, racing, creative modes, music festivals, and more besides. It's a lot, and it now runs at 60fps with crisp, clean resolutions all round.</p>
<p>Mouse mode controls are a revelation, loading times are hugely improved, graphics look very nice indeed, thanks, and, well, I reckon this is now the best way to play this one, regardless of a slight downgrading in visuals.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">21. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>Whether you should take a punt on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> for the Switch 2 will depend on whether you already own it on Switch 1 or not. If you don’t, it's perhaps Sonic's best 3D game, and this is undoubtedly the best way to play it on Nintendo systems.</p>
<p>If you do, however, you should think twice about double-dipping. It’s already a splendid game on Switch 1, and with no upgrade path or new content, you're missing out on very little if you skip it. Personally, we'd wait for a sale if you absolutely cannot live without those 60 frames per second.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="20 to 11" id="top-20">20. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a> is a solid update of one of Square’s finest modern turn-based RPGs. Its combination of a flexible job system, dynamic combat, and unexpectedly interesting story makes for an adventure that no fans of the JRPG genre will want to miss out on, especially any such fans that enjoyed Team Asano’s more recent work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> duology.</p>
<p>That in mind, there isn’t really anything <em>new</em> in this remaster that justifies the price of a double dip—if you already put a lot of time into this one on the 3DS back in the day, we’d caution you to first consider just how badly you want to spend your money on what ultimately amounts to little more than a nice visual bump.</p>
<p>All the same, Bravely Default was and still is a great RPG; if you haven’t had the chance to give this one a shot yet, this port is a great way to see what the fuss is about.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">19. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition">NOBUNAGA'S AMBITION Awakening Complete Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>A little more resolution is always going to be useful in a strategy game, and that's true for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition">Nobunaga's Ambition Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>This 'Complete Edition' builds on the Switch 1 foundation by adding a half dozen new scenarios and all the previously released DLC, plus Mouse Mode functionality and 4K support giving you a better look at the battlefield and more precise control over your campaigns.</p>
<p>If you liked the base game on Switch, the Switch 2 additions enhance the experience in exactly the way you'd expect and hope, arguably fulfilling the game's potential on the handheld hybrid where it struggled before.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:152499 @ 1750942804 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">18. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> is a stunning collection of games that sees Agent 47 at his absolute best. With multiplayer aspects woven seamlessly and smartly into the mix, tons of ways to approach every mission, and some of the best level design in the biz, this is a bonafide belter, no questions asked.</p>
<p>However, this Switch 2 port — as things stand at launch — does need some work to fix its stuttering issues, especially in docked mode, as they are just a little too notable for comfort. Still highly playable, but with some performance problems, then. Let's hope we see improvements in the form of a patch or two ASAP.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">17. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>An updated version of Switch's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hogwarts_legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, the NS2 version bumps the resolution up to 1080p in handheld and 1440p docked, thanks to the console's DLSS upscaling.</p>
<p>Co-developers Krome Studios also added Mouse Mode compatibility, improved load times, and a stabilised 30fps while polishing various other things to bump up the overall quality on the more powerful hardware.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">15. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Arcade Archives 2: Ridge Racer (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p>While it lacks the additional content seen in the PS1 port, the original arcade iteration of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-ridge-racer">Ridge Racer</a> remains a landmark release in the history of the racing genre, and it's just as gripping and playable today as it was back in 1993.</p>
<p>The ability to compete for high scores online adds massively to this version's staying power, and while its long-term appeal does have a fairly low ceiling, it's easily worth the modest asking price just to experience the primal satisfaction you get from pulling off a perfect power slide.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">14. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami</a> was a real surprise. A solid blend of strategy and action that incorporates aspects of Shinto and Japanese folklore to create a visually stunning experience. It's a great showcase for Switch 2, as well, even if mouse controls might not quite work for everyone.</p>
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">13. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition (Switch 2)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2 is a cracker, and in portable mode, it could well become my preferred way to play this fantastic entry in Capcom's storied franchise. The only fly in the ointment with this port is 30fps fights in World Tour. It's a shame, and it's 100% gonna be a dealbreaker for some.</p>
<p>But if you can overlook that, the rest of what's here is crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped. All other modes are fully featured and running at 60fps, and online works a treat.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Steam update</a>,&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has hit the two million sales mark, which means that the game has picked up another million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-1m-sales-first-week" rel="nofollow">since Monday</a>. That's pretty impressive stuff.</p>

<p>In terms of what's next for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, Landfall and Aggro Crab say they're "now looking into possible updates", and that while no information is available about what will be contained in these updates yet, the two studios are paying attention to the community's feedback in terms of changes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/peak-sales-2m-volcano.jpg?itok=E6r9c4Ku 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/peak-sales-2m-volcano.jpg?itok=sGEO9-8j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Peak&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone in just a few extra days.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the two studios, "bug fixes and stability" are still the priority over anything new, so you shouldn't expect anything huge just yet. However, Landfall and Aggro Crab do say that more localization is coming soon.</p>

<p>As well as future updates, merchandise for&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>is also in the works; Landfall and Aggro Crab say they didn't expect&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>to take off the way it did, but that thanks to the community's "excitement", some "pretty great things" are afoot for&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>merch.</p>

<p>More bug fixes and stability tweaks are, of course, also on the way for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>. Issues the two studios are aware of right now include disconnection and reconnection problems, performance and optimization hitches, and audio issues, plus more.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, it's a physics-y climbing sim along the lines of games like&nbsp;<em>Chained Together&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>A Difficult Game About Climbing</em>.</p>

<p>You and your friends (or just you, but the game is best experienced alongside others) will scale a treacherous mountain to reach the top, and each day, the mountain's layout will change, providing a fresh challenge every time.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Peak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

I finished it. I reached its terrible ending after pushing through countless bugs, horrible performance issues, and so many boring phone calls. And yet, after all that, if you were to ask me, “Who was <em>MindsEye </em>designed for?” I wouldn’t have an answer for you. Maybe it was designed for people who like to gawk at wastes of money and talent?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197585" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="120" data-playlist="197585,197589,197586" data-current="197585"><div><p>A Hot-Fix Is On The Way For MindsEye's Frustrating CPR Mini-Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197585/197585_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23106.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cpr-mini-game-hot-fix-coming-1851784478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cpr-mini-game-hot-fix-coming-1851784478"><em>MindsEye</em></a></span> is far too linear to be a good open-world game, and yet it’s also too big and boring to be a fun, fast-paced linear action game. Instead, <em>MindsEye </em>is a collection of various ideas, some good and many bad, molded roughly into the shape of video games you’ve played before, but missing most of what made those games good. It’s bad, yes, and in the worst way possible. It doesn’t swing for the fences and fail in a fashion you can respect and which might at least make it memorable. Instead, it’s a very expensive, below-average, somewhat pretty but totally bland...<em>thing</em> that is completely forgettable and dreadfully boring. </p><h2 id="h309079"><a id=""></a>So, what is <em>MindsEye</em>?</h2><p>Here’s the basic setup for <em>MindsEye</em>: You play as Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a weird cybernetic implant in his brain. During a mission, things go south and a lot of people die, which is mostly blamed on Diaz and his implant. Years later, he gets a job at Silva Corp, the company behind his implant. They are set up in Redrock City, which is this game’s version of Las Vegas, complete with a big dome in the middle of the place. Diaz wants answers from Silva Corp, and eventually his quest for the truth becomes entangled in a plot that involves AI, an evil general, rich tech bros, interdimensional beings, and super robots. </p><p>That might sound cool. Maybe even exciting? Sadly, <em>MindsEye </em>somehow turns this bonkers plotline into one of the dullest things I’ve played in years. </p><p>You want to know what I spent most of my time doing in <em>MindsEye</em>? It wasn’t fighting baddies using the game’s unremarkable cover-based combat system which feels ripped directly out of <em>GTA V</em>. Nor was it causing chaos in big chase scenes against police or robots. Instead, about 60 percent of this game is spent driving to locations and calling people to chat about what happened, what is going to happen, and what will happen after that. It’s the most tedious way to deliver exposition and build out the world. </p><p>And sure, <em>GTA </em>games often do similar drive-and-talk sequences, but they’re usually very short and are sprinkled throughout bombastic missions that take place in highly interactive open worlds. By contrast, in <em>MindsEye</em>, you can’t even steal random cars during missions. At one point, my car got stuck on a rock so I went to steal a parked vehicle. Can’t do that. I shot at a car and the driver got out. I went to get in. Nope. Then one of the characters on my phone call yelled at me for taking too long to drive to the next boring cutscene. </p><h2 id="h309080"><a id=""></a>A beautiful but boring playground</h2><p>To developer Build A Rocket Boy’s<em>&nbsp;</em>credit, <em>MindsEye</em> looks wonderful. Character models are high quality, textures look great, and the lighting in some areas is very realistic. It all runs like crap, especially if more than a few cars are on screen at once, but Redrock City is rendered quite well. Driving around the place during the game’s 12- to 15-hour campaign, I spotted people camping, abandoned locations, police helping people out of a car wreck, and so much more. </p><p>It’s a real shame that there’s no reason to actually <em>explore</em> the city during <em>MindsEye</em>. You can’t even start shooting cops to get a wanted level. It’s a fabulously rendered playground that’s about as interactive as a picture of Las Vegas on your phone.</p><p>When you finish <em>MindsEye </em>you get a final cutscene that doesn’t answer any of your questions or resolve any of the game’s, like, six dangling plot threads, and then you get a post-credits scene that—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902">especially following the horrible reviews the game’s received and reported layoffs at the developer</a></span>—feels very presumptuous to have included. Yeah, I’m sure, we’ll be getting more <em>MindsEye </em>one day...</p><p>I mean, I guess we will, because the game includes (or will include) user-generated missions set in Redrock City using <em>MindsEye’s </em>assets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">The plan is for PC players to make new missions and game types</a></span> and so on, and then for the devs to pick the best and share them with everyone. For now, though, it’s just missions made by the team behind <em>MindsEye</em>. These missions sometimes appear in the campaign, letting you take a break from talking to people while you drive for five minutes to instead shoot some “gangbangers” as a merc or fight off cops to learn more about how criminals live. I uh, didn’t like any of these missions, and I’m not expecting many fans are going to be designing stuff for me to play in the future. </p><h2 id="h309081"><a id=""></a>Here’s your reward: A bad open world</h2><p>Once you wrap <em>MindsEye </em>and roll your eyes at the terrible ending, you unlock an open-world mode that lets you freely explore Redrock City. However, you’re stuck playing as a weird dude in a gas mask, and the city is filled with the most boring, cookie-cutter missions you can imagine. It feels like something added at the last minute because the folks involved knew people would complain about not having an open-world mode. </p><p>Here’s how slapdash this mode is: Your character makes the same noises as Jacob, and it doesn’t even have a map to look at when you pause the action.</p><figure id="" data-id="043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-recommend-id="image://043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-recommend-id="image://043412d623865172a2a867c5c37591c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What do you do in this mode? You mostly drive to highlighted spots, shoot 20 people, grab a thing, and bring it back. Or maybe you drive through 40 checkpoints in races that go on way too long. None of these missions have voice acting or new music, or introduce new features. It feels like playing a weird, unfinished mod of <em>MindsEye </em>someone made. And this is your reward for beating the game. Congrats! You can drive around a boring city with no radio stations to listen to and bad missions to complete. Oh, and you still can’t steal most cars in the world, instead being forced to drive around in a white hatchback. </p><p>Like I said at the top, I have no idea who this game is for, and I don’t think it will find an audience. Perhaps after months of updates, <em>MindsEye</em> will run better and feature fewer bugs. But that won’t change how boring, bland, and utterly unremarkable this game is. <em>MindsEye </em>is a bad game that isn’t even so bad it’s good. It’s just bad, and it will probably be forgotten in a few months, only remembered briefly when the game’s servers are shut down with little warning. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108]]></content:encoded>

No sooner had we introduced you to its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-dev-funcom-is-already-testing-a-radical-change-to-the-pvp-deep-desert-experience"><u>Public Test Client and news that the studio was trialling extending the PvE zone of the Deep Desert from about 10% of the map to 50%</u></a>, Funcom has dropped an update to confirm that the change will be rolling out for all players from today, June 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The PvE area has been adjusted to encompass the entire southern half of the Deep Desert map," Funcom confirmed in its latest <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-1-1-0-5-patch-notes/#11017" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>patch notes, below</u></a>. "This means that players who have no interest in PvP should be able to find what they want without engaging in PvP. Imperial Testing Stations, caves, and so forth found in this area are thus now PvE."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rest assured that we will continue to listen to your feedback and make adjustments in the future," the team said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It follows an AMA in which the studio told players frustrated by the endgame experience that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-developer-is-formulating-a-plan-to-improve-pvp-and-toxic-deep-desert-experiences"><u>"formulating a plan" to improve PvP in the Deep Desert</u></a>. Previously, players branded the endgame as "toxic" due to griefing even after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-patches-out-orni-squishing-in-pvp-by-completely-removing-the-ability-to-damage-players-and-npcs-with-vehicles-and-not-all-fans-are-happy-about-it"><u>patching out the ability for players to squish other people with their Ornithopter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame," said creative director Joel Bylos. "Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert — an endlessly renewing location that resets every week and creates an activity loop for great rewards. The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those wondering, yes, Control Points and Shipwrecks will continue to be PvP "throughout the entire map," which means you will find "localized pockets of PvP within the PvE section still. Similar to how Shipwrecks are PvP in Hagga Basin." Work has also begun on changing the Ornithopters; equipping a rocket launcher module will now decrease the top speed of your Scout Orni by 20%, and Assault Ornis by 10%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the patch has been applied, players will also be able to report other players’ messages from the text chat or report them by using the Inspect menu.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dune: Awakening Patch Notes 1.1.0.17</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Deep Desert</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>A message from the Creative Director on PvE and PVP » Dune: Awakening</u></a>, this hotfix will see the first iteration of the changes to the balance between PvE and PvP in the Deep Desert.

You may find better loot in the more dangerous PvP area located further north on the map. In the PvE area, for example, each player gets their own loot and can expect to receive one schematic. In the PvP area, loot is distributed on a “first come, first served” basis, with higher quantities of everything. Players can expect to find 2–6 schematics there, which are among the rarest.</li><li>Plasteel plates can only be found in PvP zones.</li><li>The amount of active medium spice fields has been reduced from 8 to 5.</li><li>The number of active small spice fields has increased from 20 to 22.</li><li>The spawn rate of Titanium and Stravidium has been reduced in the PvE areas so that large quantities only spawn in the far-out PvP areas.</li><li>The number of nodes in resource hotspots in the PvE part of the map has been reduced.</li><li>The respawn time of Titanium and Stravidium has increased from 30 to 45 minutes.</li></ul></li><li>Some Imperial Testing Stations are still in the PvP region, and players who want all schematics available each week will want to visit both the PvP and PvE Imperial Testing Stations. Keep in mind the loot in them rotates each week, so even if you’re not interested in PvP, you could obtain it at a later date if you’re not able to trade for it or buy it off the Exchange.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Vehicles</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>We have begun work on the outlined changes to the Scout Ornithopters.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Equipping a Rocket Launcher Module will now decrease the top speed of your Ornithopter.<ul data-cy="list"><li>For Scout Ornithopters, the reduction is 20%.</li><li>For Assault Ornithopters, the reduction is 10%.</li></ul></li><li>Infocards for the modules now reflect this change.</li></ul></li><li>Exiting ornithopters mid-air will now cause them to drop straight down instead of gliding away. This should decrease the chance that you lose your ornithopter upon disconnecting from the game or exiting by accident your ornithopter mid-air (yes, we have seen the videos).<ul data-cy="list"><li>Known issue: There is an edge case that if your vehicle ends up in the quicksand you might not be able to interact with it if you are in the quicksand.

The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bylos admitted that the "extremely competitive nature" of the Deep Desert was forcing players to engage when they may prefer PvE, and consequently, "some areas" of the Deep Desert will now be flagged as "Partial Warfare (PvE)" where players can grab rare resources without getting ambushed. The largest spice fields, shipwrecks and Landsraad control points will remain "War of Assassins (PvP)" as "high reward, high risk" areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, just two days later, Funcom's already testing some pretty radical changes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all comes as Dune: Awakening unveils its <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/announcing-public-test-client/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Public Test Client</u></a>, where players can try out the latest patch and features in exchange for accepting builds may have bugs or be a little unstable. As part of efforts to make the endgame more enjoyable, the PvE area near the shield wall has been expanded to cover row A, B, C, D and half of E within the Deep Desert. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare that to how the PvP and PvE are balanced now where <em>only</em> row A is PvE, and that's essentially switching <em>half</em> of the Deep Desert from PvP to PvE. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/that-was-quick-funcom-is-already-testing-a-version-of-dune-awakening-where-the-deep-desert-is-only-50-percent-pvp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a> points out, this doesn't necessarily mean this will be applied in the final game — trying out  new ideas is what test servers are for, of course — but it does at least indicate that Funcom was serious about revising the endgame experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dune: Awakening has enjoyed a superb launch, with a 'very positive' user review rating on Steam.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-fans-upset-over-mario-kart-world-patch-that-makes-a-big-change-to-online-play-%E2%80%94-thanks-i-hate-it.1228926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has updated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> to change how the game handles online course selection, in a move that has gone against many fans' wishes and highlighted the mixed response to the game's open world overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World version 1.1.2 was released last night, and patch notes from Nintendo state that it has "adjusted courses selected in Random when selecting next course in a wireless VS Race." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While confusingly phrased, this change looks to be a deliberate move by Nintendo to nerf the game's Random course selection option when playing in VS mode — something many fans had been using to opt out of 'intermission tracks' whenever possible. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is an intermission track? This fan term relates to the often long stretch of open world players must travel through to get from their current location to another nearby course, before playing just one lap of its track. It's these nearby courses that the game will usually suggest as options for the next race, meaning players typically must play an intermission track, alongside the Random option which alternatively picks a course from elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had been using the Random option to deliberately skip intermission tracks where possible, hoping instead to be transported to a far-away course where they are plonked at the starting line. In these cases, players are then given the classic three-lap Mario Kart course experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with this change, Random also picks from the nearby courses the game suggests — meaning far-away courses are no longer guaranteed to appear, and intermission tracks are now more likely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lengthy thread on forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-updates-mario-kart-worlds-online-removes-the-only-guaranteed-way-to-play-normal-3-lap-races-with-randoms.1228638/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Restera</a> states, the change goes against how many players want to play Mario Kart World online, with the ability to consistantly play three laps of a course in VS mode, rather than only one lap after a long open-world drive through an intermission track.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo seems to have made this decision in response to player behavior as, anecdotally at least, use of the Random option seemed to be on the rise. And now, the patch is prompting a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo has basically stepped in and said 'no, you're supposed to play this way,'" wrote fan GreenMamba. "They saw players clamoring for a more traditional online mode and did... the exact opposite of what they wanted."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The change will likely also make Mario Kart World's brilliant Rainbow Road track even rarer, the user noted. Perhaps World's best course, it is only accessible from the game's main open-world when selecting its specific Grand Prix, meaning fans hoping to play it online must rely on the Random choice option and hope it eventually gets picked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Good luck to ever even playing Rainbow Road online anymore," GreenMamba continued. "Thanks I hate it," wrote another fan. "Let people just play three-lap courses if they want to." "I get the impression that Nintendo isn't open to feedback on this," wrote a third. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have suggested Nintendo should add a bespoke three-lap VS option for those who want it, alongside the game's current offering. Others say intermission tracks should be kept to the game's Knockout Tour mode entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World's open world is not without its charms — it can be a relaxing place to cool off after heated races, and it holds a decent number of things to discover — but fans have consistently said its lengthy sections between main track locations just aren't as good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The highways aren't bad — in fact some of them can be very fun — but they're often extremely wide and straight, leading to long portions of each race that aren't as demanding or enjoyable as the twists and turns of the dedicated levels," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it seems users will be seeing more of these open highways in VS mode play — though it remains to be seen what Nintendo's wider plans are for Mario Kart World over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World guide</a> and learn <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world/How_to_Unlock_All_Characters">how to unlock every hidden Mario Kart World character</a>, plus how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world/Kamek_Unlocks_Explained_(And_Tips_For_Getting_Them_Quickly)">Kamek Unlocks</a> work — you’ll need them to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mario-kart-world/How_to_Unlock_NPC_Drivers_and_Creatures">unlock NPC Drivers</a>.

            <p>Nintendo's 3 v 3 wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive doesn't appear to have support for local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo announced a release date for Drag x Drive, and now more details about the upcoming release have come to light via the game's store page on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s eShop.</p>
<p>While specific multiplayer modes aren't listed, the page reveals the game will retail for £16.99 here in the UK, and support up to 12 players online - online being the key word here. Drag x Drive can only be played by one player per console, meaning split-screen local multiplayer seemingly won't be an option.</p>

<p>This means even if you have an additional pair of Switch 2 Joy Con, you won't be able to participate in a spot of basketball with your friends and family at home. This seems like quite a missed opportunity, if you ask me. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo to comment on Drag x Drive's multiplayer support, and will update when we know more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive was first announced back in April</a>, during Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. The game will make use of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2's mouse functionality</a>, with players using the console's Joy Con to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks".</p>
<p>Drag x Drive is set to arrive on 14th August <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drag-x-drive-wheels-onto-switch-2-as-an-eshop-exclusive-this-august">as a Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-game-drag-x-drive-appears-to-not-support-local-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-records-bloom-rage-developer-dont-nod-hit-by-layoffs.1228896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has become the latest studio to be hit by a wave of layoffs, if a spate of social media posts from now-former employees are anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by journalist&nbsp;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adnanriaz9.bsky.social/post/3lshydxkns22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Adnan Riaz</a> (and collated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-montr%C3%A9al-hit-by-a-round-of-layoffs.1228692/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ResetEra user Maxime</a>), several employees of Don't Nod Montreal, which developed <i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</i>as its first project, appear to have lost their jobs, including technical artist Laurent Dufresne and cinematic artist Mary Pouliot.</p>

<p>It's not clear how many Don't Nod Montreal employees have lost their jobs; Riaz spotted at least three, and it's possible more have been laid off without posting about it on social media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-nod-montreal-layoffs.jpg?itok=cXfm8YSh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-nod-montreal-layoffs.jpg?itok=Tw1zoVb8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod Montreal, responsible for&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Dufresne, the layoff numbers are "non-insignificant", and the team is "relatively small", so it's safe to assume that more than just the three people spotted by Riaz have lost their jobs, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This wave of layoffs appears to be separate to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">wave that hit the studio's Paris office</a> late last year, in which around 70 employees' jobs appeared to be at risk. As a reminder, the Paris location is Don't Nod's main studio; it's responsible for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden" rel="nofollow">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>&nbsp;</em>and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Aphelion</em>.</p>

<p>Don't Nod Montreal's layoffs come after a difficult time for the company. In September last year, the studio admitted two of its major 2024 releases, namely the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Banishers&nbsp;</em>and climbing game&nbsp;<em>Jusant</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">had underperformed</a>, leading to an 11% drop in revenue compared to the prior year.</p>

<p>In April this year, however, Don't Nod <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-revenue-2024-lost-records" rel="nofollow">revealed another revenue dip</a>, but at the time, the company also said that sales of&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>were "in line with forecasts", although the studio stopped short of revealing just how many copies&nbsp;<em>Lost Records&nbsp;</em>had sold at that point.</p>




<p>It's unclear what the future holds for Don't Nod Montreal, but for now, if you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, you can do so on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lost-records-bloom-rage/9n3f1lw9hc6c" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="three new switch ray tracing patents" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d60094e084873/three-new-switch-ray-tracing-patents.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, we already know that the ability to use ray tracing is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/digital-foundry-says-switch-2-running-switch-games-at-4k-is-quite-the-thing-in-performance-breakdown">built into the Switch 2 console</a>, baked into its very fibre, as an entirely untechnical person might say. However, we've yet to be presented with any examples of it in action on the new machine just yet.</p>
<p>Well, as disappointing as it may be to not have had Mario's shiny face reflecting back on itself in real time from the get-go, Nintendo does seem to be up to something, at the very least, with regards to the tech. In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lsisrfobvk2d">recent social media post</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> has highlighted three patents published yesterday in Japan, two of which have ray tracing antics in mind.</p>

<p>So, what are we looking at here, then? Well, as detailed by the post, the first two images show details of ray tracing techniques that improve both the amount of control the tech has on a per-object basis, as well as correctional adjustments for around screen edges. This is on top of a third patent that covers an improved shadow-mapping technique.</p>
<p>So, while we don't have any info on what all this is exactly, it sure does look like tweaks and adjustments, or just some further info, on whatever is already going on inside our Switch 2 consoles (which Nintendo has been vague on so far) with regards to ray tracing.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to seeing how ray tracing actually pans out on Switch 2? What games do you think will, or should, employ it first? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new The First Berserker: Khazan update is now live on PC and consoles, introducing new features, balance, and system changes, and more.</p>
<p>The update, which will go live on PC and consoles later today, introduces AMD FSR 3 and AMD FSR 4 support on AMD Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs. The latest version of the upscaler can be enabled via driver settings with the Adrenalin driver version 25.6.1 or later installed, and will be in use even if the in-game interface says that AMD FSR 3 is instead.</p>
<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3 and 4 support on PC, the new The First Berserker: Khazan brings new free DLC for all users, including new armor sets and hairstyles to customize Khazan's appearance, balance adjustments, difficulty changes, augment gear tweaks, interface improvements, and more. The full update notes can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543361383085900258?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam.</a></p>
<p>Though far from being the most original game, I have found The First Berserker: Khazan to be one of the best soulslike games released recently. Combining features from the FromSoftware franchise with mechanics lifted from Team NINJA's games like Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, the game offers a fast-paced, intense experience that's extremely enjoyable to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">review.</a></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square back in 2003, and his departure impacted more than the popular role-playing game series, as Square reportedly "collapsed" after he left.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-collapsed-after-he-left-final-fantasy-composer-on-how-hironobu-sakaguchis-innate-leadership-skills-held-the-company-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Automaton</a>, the creator of the Final Fantasy series recently spoke on the NOBIYO To Isshoni podcast hosted by longtime series composer Nobuo Uematsu about their time together at the Japanese publisher. The creator of one of the most beloved JRPG series was the "big boss" even in the company's early days, and managed to work even at the beginning when Square was more like a club of university students rather than an actual company. At the time, Square did not have a proper corporate organization, Uematsu-san recalled during the show, but everybody listened to Sakaguchi-san, whom he described as a leader. As such, when Sakaguchi-san left Square, the situation was quite bad, and the entire organization suddenly collapsed, so much so that even Uematsu-san felt that he should leave, but the Final Fantasy series ultimately commends Square Enix for getting back on its feet after so many key figures in the company left right before the merger with the Dragon Quest series publisher.</p>
<p>Although Hironobu Sakaguchi left Square over 20 years ago, the legendary game developer recently collaborated with the publisher again on FANTASIAN: Neo Dimension, the PC and console port of the JRPG originally released on the Apple Arcade service a few years back. Sakaguchi-san's touch is unmistakable in the game, so much so that it feels like a proper entry in the Final Fantasy series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fantasian-neo-dimension-final-fantasy-in-all-but-name/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My friend group and I do our own version of<em>&nbsp;</em>Easy Allies' "<a href="https://easyallies.com/#!/show/the-hall-of-greats" rel="nofollow">The Hall of Greats</a>" every quarter, and we have a grand ol' time. If you don't know what The Hall of Greats is, it boils down to being a celebration of games; essentially, we get together, present what we think deserves to be in The Hall of Greats, and everyone takes a vote using poker chips. We all get five poker chips, and each one is valued from one to five.</p>

<p>Formal apology to my good friend Matt: he brought&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/system-shock-2-embracing-enigma-brief-retrospective" rel="nofollow"><em>System Shock 2</em></a>&nbsp;the very first time and was defeated quite soundly by many other games. I gave&nbsp;his pick a paltry one point, and I deeply regret it now. Not because I hurt Matt's feelings or anything, but because I now believe&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;absolutely deserves the coveted five-point poker chip.</p>

<p>Indeed, I had given&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;a try in the past and acknowledged its worth, but for a multitude of reasons, I lost interest. Still, it was quite a revolutionary game back during its release in 1999, so it has historical value. After playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a>'&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Edition Remaster</em>, I now realize that few games come close to the depth and immersion it provides, even to this day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-wrench.jpg?itok=RxFnL4I_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-wrench.jpg?itok=iXdpDKIq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crisp, clean visuals!</figcaption></figure><h2>A Remaster That Makes an Incredible Game Even Better</h2>

<p>Nightdive is an incredible studio, modernizing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow">beloved</a>&nbsp;--&nbsp;and, well, some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/poed-definitive-edition-review-more-like-pooed" rel="nofollow">not-so-beloved</a> --&nbsp;classics to run on modern hardware. These aren't just your simple ports, no, Nightdive loves to give its titles the VIP treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often, this VIP treatment comes in the form of new, refined sprites and models to revitalize and rejuvenate aging games.&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, which is now certainly an all-timer in my eyes, did start to look and feel a bit dated. In comes&nbsp;Nightdive to save the day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-interface.jpg?itok=sK1S5JAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-interface.jpg?itok=99ybE96M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't get intimidated by the interface. You'll get the hang of it!</figcaption></figure><p>I think I fell off of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;several years back&nbsp;<em>because</em>&nbsp;of it looked quite dated, and it felt like it, too. The&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>is the silver bullet for my previous complaints, resulting in the definitive way to experience a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Visually,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;is faithful to the original developer's vision, while adding some needed touch-ups to enemy models and weapons. Atmosphere is also so incredibly important for an immersive sim, and that is captured so well here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/systme-shock-2-hallway-run.jpg?itok=Zb0pyxNt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/systme-shock-2-hallway-run.jpg?itok=b53kZzGy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Duly noted.</figcaption></figure><p>Lighting, environment textures, and everything in between convinced me that I was actually there on the Von Braun space ship, the main setting of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>. The result from this attention to detail is an atmosphere akin to the movie <em>Alien</em>: a feeling of hopelessness and survival against terrifying odds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One other issue I had with&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2'</em>s non-remastered port was the controls and the clunkiness of its gameplay. The UI makes&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;appear more intimidating than it really is, and while that almost claustrophobic UI is still here, everything feels much smoother to play.</p>

<p>Mouse and keyboard controls are seamless and once you actually get the hang of things an hour or so in, everything clicks. This remaster also has controller support. Nightdive does a pretty good job at making the controller able to navigate menus, making ample use of various controller shortcuts since you're lacking the precision of a mouse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-character.jpg?itok=NF2c6nqw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-character.jpg?itok=GvnMz2JT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get immersed in being this goofy lookin' fella.</figcaption></figure><h2>Get Immersed in the Foreboding Von Braun</h2>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;is an immersive sim, and if you don't know what that is, I forgive you. They really just don't make very many of them anymore... but if I had to put it succinctly: an immersive sim is a broad term for games that allow for a high degree of player choice in approaching its various situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Player choice comes in many forms, especially in<em>&nbsp;</em>this title. Right from the start, you're forced to pick a role without really knowing how it'll benefit you in the long run. You pick a career path in the UNN Marines, Navy, or OSA; following this choice, you go on a choice-filled tour of duty to give you a few extra stat bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each will essentially give you a kickstart on the path to whatever build you want to make in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>. The&nbsp;initial few choices are quite intimidating. The Marines caters more toward your typical run-and-gun playstyle, the Navy is a bit more technical with hacking and maintenance, and OSA focuses on Psi powers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-melee.jpg?itok=big-yzRK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-melee.jpg?itok=5Wx38-BW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guns? Sure, they're useful, but so is this shard.</figcaption></figure><p>For a game from 1999, the amount of freedom you have with your character is quite impressive, and even by today's standards, it holds up. I didn't even&nbsp;<em>touch</em>&nbsp;Psi powers, focusing more on a hybrid between melee and ranged weapons, as well as hacking. I ended up doing just fine, but it's a game that incentivizes multiple playthroughs, since gameplay can vary so much.</p>

<p>Gameplay takes place mostly within the confines of the Von Braun starship. Something&nbsp;<em>horrible</em>&nbsp;has happened on the ship, and you're there to figure out what happened. You've just awoken from cryo-sleep on the starship, and things are, inexplicably, looking worse for wear.</p>

<p>Sneak, shoot, or hack your way through the ship as you follow objectives given to you by various characters in&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>. Polito, a surviving crewmate, gives players a lot of directions at the start, but the Von Braun is a rather confusing maze of pathways. Players have to rely on limited context, a not-so-helpful map, and reading the environment for the path forward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-gun-animation.jpg?itok=NkaOnzaY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-gun-animation.jpg?itok=Z_f1hkT6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Locked and loaded.</figcaption></figure><p>Von Braun is a complex ship, with various sectors like the Hydroponics Deck and Recreation Deck. These areas have their own identity and feel distinct from one another, so as you're scrounging around for supplies and fighting (or avoiding) enemies, there's this exciting feeling of discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was quite gratifying to go from being completely unfamiliar with the ship's interior to memorizing it through hours of exploration. And yet, there are still so many secrets for those who have a keen eye. Exploration is rewarding, giving players new weapons, upgrades, and the like.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-map.jpg?itok=T2mVb5ik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-map.jpg?itok=z1Uajiu6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maps are hard, man.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>As you piece together the fate of the Von Braun ship and simply find a way to survive and escape, you'll have many different tools at your disposal. This is where the freedom of choice and your build come in. Plenty of weapons are strewn about, so you can go in guns blazing if you like. Or use that reliable wrench to whack away at enemies.</p>

<p>You can also try the stealthy path, which relies on patience and some hacking, too. Hacking is a simple mini-game, but it's crucial. Avoiding the ire of Xerxes is essential, as if you're seen by one of his cameras, he'll have hordes of robots and zombie-like reinforcements on you quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=UMTqbjpK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-grenade-launcher.jpg?itok=bO5v1zPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big robot? Nothing an EMP grenade won't solve.</figcaption></figure><p>Shooting played a large role in my playthrough, for when stealth failed, I'd pull out the big guns. Gunplay is not as tight as a boomer shooter or typical FPS, but you can improve the handling of guns and their damage by increasing stats at certain kiosks around the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These kiosks are very important, as you'll want to constantly improve your build. You're not necessarily pigeonholed into being a run-and-gun type versus a psionic soldier, so you're given some freedom to experiment.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-energy-weapon.jpg?itok=Ke7Gxqv5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-energy-weapon.jpg?itok=vEu0jPG6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This energy gun was largely ineffective, as I didn't spec into using this type of weapon.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Narrative That Makes You Think</h2>

<p>Much of your time with this game comprises of utilizing the skillset of your choosing, while exploring the horrors and dangers of the Von Braun. Exploration is another key component here, and it's the means by which the story is delivered.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>&nbsp;relies on environmental storytelling, piecing together the grim fate of the starship by looking at the state of things. It also leans heavily on audio logs, which were a novelty back in 1999 when&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>was first released. Audio logs went on to inspire numerous games to follow this same delivery of narrative.</p>

<p>Audio logs seem tacky, but I mean, it makes sense -- most everyone on the Von Braun is dead. These audio logs range from mundane to intriguing, but the voice acting -- which is, again, from 1999 -- leaves a lot to be desired. Thankfully, the writing is still so well done. Piecing together the series of events that led up to<em>&nbsp;</em>the disaster on Von Braun will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>

With AI being among the primary antagonists, we see the damage it can cause, even if that's far into the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than fighting robots sicced on you by AI, you'll have to contend with The Many. It's a Hivemind organism that's terrifyingly efficient and spreads like some aggressive fungus. This entity has a sort of collectivist mentality, and on top of that, you're contending with an AI that has a god complex. Regular humans are stuck in between these two -- it's a thrilling dynamic that engrossed me.</p>

<p>Like other Nightdive remasters, this version has a vault with an abundance of historical documents, concept art, and videos involving&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s development. I'm particularly fond of scans for a <em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>review from PC Format magazine, but there are also plenty of other fragments from history to enjoy.</p>

<p>For many,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;was considered among the best of the best. With the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, it's more accessible than ever and feels incredible to play -- it looks great, too. If there was ever a time to take the plunge and play it for the first time, it's now, and if you're looking to revisit, well, the Von Braun is ready for boarding!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's old news at this point to talk about just how popular the new <em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> set is, but its for good reason. With a smart IP pairing between Wizards of the Coast and Square, incredible card design, and artwork that feels both true to&nbsp;<em>Magic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, it's no surprise this set is going wild.</p>

<p>We've covered it plenty here at TechRaptor, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow">ranking all of the legendary creatures</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for" rel="nofollow">chatting with the lead designer of the Commander decks</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-final-fantasy-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow">even getting a chance to premiere our own preview cards</a>. Now that the set's settling down, Wizards of the Coast sent us some pre-constructed products to check out - so read on for our thoughts on the&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>Starter Kit and Limit Break Commander Deck.</p>


<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-main-photo.jpg?itok=fnICS15B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-main-photo.jpg?itok=axkj29F9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy </em>Starter Kit contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>2 60-card pre-constructed decks
	<ul><li>1 Traditional foil legendary creature in each deck</li>
		<li>5 Non-foil new-to-<em>Magic&nbsp;</em>cards in each deck</li>
		<li>54 Non-foil cards from the main set in each deck</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>4 Non-foil double-sided tokens</li>
	<li>2&nbsp;<em>MTG Arena</em>&nbsp;code cards (available in select regions)</li>
	<li>2 cardboard Deck boxes</li>
</ul><p>Featuring the famous clash between Cloud and Sephiroth as depicted in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, the Starter Kit contains everything two players need to jump into the action and learn how to play&nbsp;<em>MTG</em>. Let's chat briefly about each of the two 60-card decks, talking about what they do and how they serve as introductory decks.</p>

<h3>Red-White Cloud Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-cloud.jpg?itok=s4sj0I_w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-cloud.jpg?itok=sf5219uL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Looking at this deck's feature card, Cloud, Planet's Champion, gives us a good sense of what this deck wants to do. As you can see from the image above, if Cloud is equipped he gains double-strike and indestructible, which is obviously extremely powerful. The other rares from the deck - as pictured above - also clue is into the fact that this is a deck that's all about attack, attack, attack.</p>

<p>Get your creatures loaded up with equipment and then swing for the fences! The deck plays extremely fast, and once new players understand the nuances of equipping artifacts to a creature, this deck runs pretty smoothly. So you must be wondering, with creatures and equipment so powerful, what hope does my opponent have against me?</p>

<p>haha</p>

<h3>Blue-Black Sephiroth Deck</h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-sephiroth-deck.jpg?itok=YBL7Gmq3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-sephiroth-deck.jpg?itok=_b1IFgDt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If the Red-White deck is all about attacking with creatures armed to the teeth, the Blue-Black deck is all about having an answer for just about whatever your opponent throws your way! Led by Sephiroth, Planet's Heir, the Blue-Black deck does exactly what you'd think Blue-Black does. It draws you cards and slows down your opponent (Blue), and kills your opponent's creatures before they can cause a fuss (Black).</p>

<p>I really like Xande, Dark Mage (pictured above), because he and other creatures like him really want you to not be bashful about casting spells to gain card advantage. If the hurdle for new players with Red-White is understanding equipment, understanding the Stack is going to be a hurdle with this deck. Once you understand the difference between instant speed and sorcery speed spells, and how effects resolve, you'll be slicing your opponents to ribbons with lethal precision.</p>

<h2>Starter Kit Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-two-decks.jpg?itok=DsqLQeFk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-starter-kit-two-decks.jpg?itok=7GVKHYzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I'll admit, I've seen more beginner-friendly pre-constructed decks over the years (remember the glory days of those $15 Intro Decks??), but these are by no means too complicated to wrap your head around. In fact, many newcomers to the game may find themselves impressed by the depth of strategy on hand with <em>Magic</em>, I know I was the first time I sat down to play. The rulebook included here is also a great resource, and is one of the clearest presentations of the rules I've ever seen! So if you're new to the game, or want to get a friend into it <em>and&nbsp;</em>they like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>&nbsp;- this is a phenomenal place to start!</p>

<p>Now let's jump into a more advanced option, the&nbsp;<em>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck - also starring everyone's favorite SOLDIER, Cloud!</p>

<h2><em>Magic The Gathering&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-limit-break-commander.jpg?itok=TgBnK_ba 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-limit-break-commander.jpg?itok=DirKbPzR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic the Gathering Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck includes the following:</p>

<ul><li>1 Ready-to-play 100-card Commander deck&nbsp;
	<ul><li>1 Traditional foil face commander</li>
		<li>1 Traditional foil featured commander</li>
		<li>98 Non-foil cards</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>10 Double-sided tokens</li>
	<li>1 Collector Booster Sample Pack</li>
	<li>1 Reference card</li>
	<li>1 Deck box</li>
</ul><p>Already hard to get ahold of, and selling for around $120 USD at the time of this writing, the Limit Break Commander Deck is a serious piece of precon hardware. Just like the Starter Deck (but completely super-charged), this deck is focused around Cloud and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-two-commanders.jpg?itok=8ai58A77 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-two-commanders.jpg?itok=d-r6A5qL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The deck comes with two potential commanders for you to field, but I think - as is usually the case - you won't get much traction out of Tifa without a fair bit of luck. But Cloud... good lord... what a card! And of course he's a huge target the second he hits the board, but the fact the Cloud has haste&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;lets you auto-attach an equipment to him when he comes in mitigates the fact that you'll be the target here.</p>

<p>I really love a Voltron approach to Commander (I&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;built a nasty little deck with that Secret Lair Wolverine) because I love to turn my creatures sideways. So, this really appeals to me. But what's nice about this deck is that unlike the&nbsp;<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/magic-the-gathering-fallout-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Scrappy Survivors</a> deck from a few years back that saw you focusing on overloading a single creature with tons of equipment, you get a lot of benefit out of spreading your equipment around! Sharing is caring, even in Midgar!</p>

<p>The other cards in the deck are - as you'd expect - a mixture of great creatures, beat-down equipment (plus some good evasion equipment - shoutout to the inclusion of Trailblazer's Boots), and a few key spells to get you out of a jam.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-artifacts.jpg?itok=7kySyqUY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-artifacts.jpg?itok=53wjqWk4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's old hat now to comment on the power creep of pre-constructed decks, but I played this in my pod against some pretty heavy hitting decks and it held its own until everyone realized it was a real threat - and then I was crumpled.</p>

<p>The other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Commander decks also look pretty cool, and each have a big bold approach (<a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists" rel="nofollow">you can check out all the decklists here</a>), but I'm really drawn to this aggressive approach.</p>

<p>The commander deck also comes with a Collector Booster sampler pack, which contains two cards. With single Collector Booster packs selling for $100, this Collector Booster sampler was a fun way to get a tiny taste of the action (like a drop of water in the desert, but still).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-collector-sampler.jpg?itok=g2z0LGZl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-collector-sampler.jpg?itok=nd_kQVCe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Magic The Gathering&nbsp;</em><em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;Limit Break Commander Deck - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The high price retailers are asking for this deck isn't just about chasing valuable cards inside - this deck is a heater! Holy smokes, it really sings - and when it gets grooving you really feel like a big threat at the table, swinging for absolutely silly amounts of damage. Cue the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;victory music - if you can get this for a good price, and you like playing aggressive-leaning midrange, grab it!</p>

In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer.” Full details are in the patch notes below, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500576552635859479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege mode itself, alongside its exclusive cosmetic rewards, are free, but there are new paid cosmetics (White Scars Chapter Champion and Blood Angels Customisation Pack). Elsewhere, Space Marine 2 finally has Ray Traced Ambient Occlusion (RTAO) and DLSS 4 support (better upscale, multiframe generation in Nvidia settings for 50xx series cards) on PC, and there’s the introduction of the Thunder Hammer for the Bulwark class (which the developers added <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-devs-tear-up-the-rulebook-let-the-bulwark-class-use-a-thunder-hammer-only-because-we-think-it-will-be-very-cool">simply because they thought it was cool</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Saber has indicated, it’s working on a “very big” update for customisation that lets players reuse chapter champion armour parts on other classes (with lore accuracy, clipping and technical restrictions). It’s not in Patch 8, so perhaps we can expect it in Patch 9.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 White Scars and Blood Angels Cosmetics</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-sells-7-million-in-less-than-a-year-and-you-can-see-why-space-marine-3-was-confirmed-so-soon">Space Marine 2 has sold an impressive 7 million copies so far</a>. It’s done so well it “changes everything” for Saber, Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN soon after the game came out last September.

But given the huge sales you can see why the project was greenlit so soon. "Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber," Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, said at the time. Still, Focus and Saber had to put out a statement reassuring players of its commitment to Space Marine 2, which is still working through its year one roadmap of content. Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 players are wondering what else is coming to the game. Patch 8 does not add any new weapons or Operations mode maps, so it seems the focus here is squarely on Siege. But Saber has confirmed new content is on the way, including a new class.

Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Side Objectives</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Shop and Reinforcements</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</li><li>Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</li><li>Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower. </li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><em>Note about reinforcements changes from the PTS</em></u>: guardsmen are now cheaper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Boss Encounters</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Every fifth wave introduces formidable boss battles, occasionally facing multiple elite foes simultaneously. Triumph in these encounters to progress to new fortress sectors.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Infinite Waves</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If your resolve endures through fifteen brutal waves, prepare for endless combat of increasing difficulty, reduced resources, and shorter preparation times. Even the Primarch of the Ultramarines understands that ultimate victory here is unlikely — but your bravery will echo through the halls of eternity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><em>Note about timer changes from PTS:</em></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The biggest criticism regarding Siege mode from the community was the wave timer limit. It exists only for technical reasons. In this build we've made some optimizations so the Siege mode can last longer.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Timer got reworked, instead of having a limited timer per wave that can get to a very short time on higher waves, there is a timer for the entire session and each time you beat a wave the timer increases.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We've also adjusted the difficulty curve of infinite waves so enemies will get stronger faster after the 15th wave. These changes will make players die in fair combat rather than due to the timer. Also, with some optimizations coming down later we think we can get rid of the timer entirely.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an option to disable bots spawn in Private Mode</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Perfect if you’re looking for a challenge.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>RTAO experimental feature added — enables in in-game video settings</li><li>DLSS 4  — better upscale, multiframe generation in NVIDIA settings for 50xx series cards.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Season Pass Content</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added White Scars Chapter Champion. </li><li>Added White Scars Chapter Weapon Skin Pack. </li><li>Added White Scars Chapter Customisation Pack. </li><li>Added Blood Angels Customisation Pack.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">GAMEPLAY AND BALANCING TWEAKS</h3><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Extended Weapon arsenal in PvE</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added Thunder Hammer for Bulwark. Picking this weapon won’t allow you to use the Storm Shield.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We are adding this option only because we think it will be very cool and it's a shame that only 1 class can use the Thunder Hammer. We are not done with Bulwark, more interesting gameplay things are to come.</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>New Finishers for Bulwark</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Adding new finishers for Bulwark with shield — 1 for Hormagaunt and 1 for Tzaangor.</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Terminus Update for Absolute Difficulty</strong> </h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>A second Terminus can now appear during a mission.</li><li>Carnifex, Neurothrope and Helbrute HP increased by 33% on Absolute difficulty.</li><li>Level specific Terminus enemies (with the exception of the Hierophant Bio-Titan) HP increased by 66% on Absolute difficulty.</li><li>Additional enemy packs will appear upon Terminus enemies spawn and again when their HP is reduced to 50%</li><li>These additional packs are now slightly more challenging featuring more Extremis enemies</li><li>Mission with final bosses can now also spawn Terminus enemies (previously, missions like “Decapitation” didn't allow any Terminus spawns)".</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This change is made according to the community poll that we made a while ago. We think that Absolute difficulty wasn't that hard to begin with and now with a slight power creep of constant weapons buffs, perk buffs and prestige perks the situation is much worse.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>After doing multiple test we have scrapped the idea of having 2 Terminus enemies in Operations mode at the same time (except in Siege mode), because this meant that you would have to encounter them all of the time, otherwise one run with dual terminus spawns would be much harder than a run with 2 Terminus enemies spawning one by one. We are increasing the health of the Terminus enemies on Absolute difficulty because they often can die before even dealing any damage. While this may seem like it goes against poll results, keep in mind that if we had 2 Terminus enemies, that would effectively be +100%  hp buff. Also we are nerfing Neurothrope base hp across all difficulty levels so its hp pool won’t become a problem for melee classes.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Instead we've tried to make Terminus spawns harder and more intense. We are going to continue to monitor how Absolute Difficulty is, and make necessary tweaks.</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prestige Perks Class Update</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Bulwark Prestige Perks Update</strong></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>“Rally Point”: The perk has been reworked.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> now has a public test client, which offers players an early peak at upcoming changes coming to the game. One of these is a substantial change to the endgame Deep Desert - a vast expansion to the shielded PvE section.</p>
<p>Right now in the live game, the shielded PvE areas of the mostly-PvP dominated Deep Desert covers zones A and B. However in the Public Test Client version of the game, this has been pushed far out into the sands, covering zones A through half of E.</p>
<p>This comes in reaction to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">community-uproar around the Deep Desert</a>, as a substantial chunk of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">game's huge playerbase</a>. In response, Funcom ceded ground on its original vision, with creative director Joel Bylos stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-studio-is-adding-partial-warfare-endgame-zones-to-address-pve-player-woes">Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system [they] have no interest in</a>."</p>

<p>What this means for the dynamic of the Deep Desert is all of the highest tier resources will still be found in PvP-flagged areas, valuable goodies like titanium and stravidium, will still be risky to farm. However PvE players will now be able to venture out into the Deep Desert, farm large spice blows, and explore a selection of challenging bio labs and crashed ships without worrying about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">swarms of enemy ornithopters</a>.</p>
<p>The spirit of PvP still remains strong in the Deep Desert however, especially where the Landsraad is concerned. House control points, a way of winning the weekly Landsraad, are always PvP zones in the Public Test Client.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">Funcom's biggest release in its history</a>, has proven popular yet divisive in its later hours. The developers have also stated they intend to release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">more substantial PvE maps to give those ardent anti-PvPers something to do</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-deep-desert-pve-expansion]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>French studio Don't Nod have laid off workers across multiple departments. The full number is unconfirmed, but multiple affected staff have posted about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adnanriaz9.bsky.social/post/3lshv5ffj6c22/quotes">their departures on LinkedIn</a>, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-records-bloom-and-rage">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a> principal cinematic artist Mary Pouliot, technical artist Laurent Dufrense, and QA lead Sandra Cormier.</p>
<p>It's been a rocky year or so for Don't Nod's staff. Last September, the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-nod-pause-two-game-projects-and-refocus-others-following-jusant-and-banishers-sales-disappointment">paused two unannounced games</a> and said they're altering others, also unannounced, to be more appealing to a "wider audience", following warnings about an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. Chairman and CEO Oskar Guilbert attributed this to (the excellent) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden</a> performing "well below expectations" commercially.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Back in February of the same year, French union STJV alleged mismanagement at Don't Nod, including "contradictory" directions, shifting deadlines, and "no long-term vision" for staff welfare (cheers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-union-report-alleges-mismanagement-at-life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod">Eurogamer</a>). Following September's statements from Guilbert, the STJV published another statement of their own, accusing Don't Nod of creating "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leadership-at-dont-nod-are-creating-an-atmosphere-of-extreme-violence-with-planned-layoffs-says-french-game-workers-union">an atmosphere of extreme violence</a>” with planned layoffs and mistreatment of staff.</p>
<p>(I figure it's worth nothing here, re: the perhaps contentious use of the term "violence" that a.) French works differently to English and b.) the damage caused by extreme stress brought about from job precarity can obviously be genuinely physically harmful. Living under the protective shroud of being one degree of removal and deniability from the most literal definition of violence is how some of the worst people on the planet continue to be allowed to show their horrible little faces in public, after all.)</p>
<p>Sorry about that, had brief <em>commie flush</em>. Must be the weather. Ahem. "Jusant’s developers were left in the dark about their future, many without any work to do, for over 2 months", said the STJV at the time, saying that around 29% of the Paris studio's workforce could be at risk of losing their jobs. This coincided with another statement from Guilbert saying Don't Nod would be undergoing a "reorganisation project". Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-nod-announces-layoffs-that-could-impact-up-to-69-workers">an IGN report</a>, Don't Nod announced they were expecting to lay off employees at this time.</p>
<p>The numbers get a little bit hard to track from that point. In a <a href="https://www.actusnews.com/en/dontnod/pr/2025/04/08/don_t-nod-provides-an-update-on-its-strategy-implementation-to-adapt-to-new-market-conditions">strategy document</a> from April of this year, Don't Nod said that "ultimately, 59 job cuts are planned, including 12 departures that have not been replaced since the announcement". Last month, STJV <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/05/looking-back-on-the-fight-against-layoffs-at-dont-nods/">announced</a> that they'd "secured 23 voluntary redundancies for job categories not threatened by the plan, in order to save as many colleagues from being fired", as well as securing severance and strike pay. "Instead of the 69 layoffs initially planned, there were 46 voluntary departures and 1 layoff," STJV write (Thanks, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/543386/article/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-studio-dont-nod-montreal-has-2nd-round-of-layoffs-after-union-intervened-the-1st-time/">Gameranx</a>).</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current round of layoffs. The STJV have yet to comment publicly. I've reached out to them, as well as Don't Nod to confirm the number of layoffs at the studio, and I'll update this if and when I know. Best of luck to all affected. Again, Jusant was bloody brilliant.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-developers-dont-nod-hit-with-more-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
