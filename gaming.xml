			<p>When you set up a whole new studio and team specifically to create new and better ways to play VR games, you’d better deliver. The aim for nDreams Elevation’s first game was to transfer the classic action-adventure gameplay feel found in games such as Tomb Raider and&nbsp; Uncharted and make it work in VR. The issue for high action in VR has always been keeping you comfortable and without motion sickness, but Reach has put those worries aside, delivering on that classic action-adventure feel with ease.</p>
<p><iframe title="REACH OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER | PS VR2, Meta Quest, and Steam | nDreams Elevation" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3E9uUjL63oQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You play as a reluctant hero Rosa, a stuntwoman who has returned to her hometown to film a new movie.&nbsp; After two fairly short introduction levels she finds herself in a magical underground world populated by living statues who are intent on making it to the surface and destroying the human race.&nbsp; Teaming up with Atlas, a friendly statue, and a Destiny-like Ghost companion, you have to jump, swing, and shoot your way through the world while solving fairly simple physical puzzles. You can play stealthily, sneaking around the corridors and ripping the spines out of unsuspecting statues, or go in all guns blazing. The plot is fairly generic without any major surprises, but it does the job.</p>


<p>You are armed with a crossbow that can fire four different types of shot including ice and fire, a grappling hook mechanism and a Captain America’ style shield. The latter is particularly fun, summoned by a hand gesture and then flung at enemies’ heads, ricocheting around the room and returning to your hand when activated. If you are sneaky, you can also steal the guns off the statues, but all your main weapons have an extra function; You can climb up arrows stuck in walls or jump on a shield wedged in a gap.&nbsp; It’s a shame that your bow requires both hands as it would have been great to take some shots whilst hanging from a ledge by one hand – proper action hero stuff!</p>


<p>I played a couple of hours of Reach at a preview event, including the first two missions. At that time I was taking things quite slowly, but when I fired up the game to review it was only at the end of the first mission that I realised I had speed-run the entire thing, chaining jumps together and flinging myself around like an acrobat. All the behind-the-scenes trickery that nDreams Elevation created really works.</p>
<p>One of their improvements is so obvious that it’s a wonder no one else had thought of it: you have to swing your arm to jump. It’s exactly what you would do in real life, using your arms to gain momentum, and a great extension of the motion controls in other titles where you pump your arms to walk around. It gives a greater connection&nbsp;between your body and the movement, tricking your brain into thinking you are jumping, thus allowing you to leap from platform to platform to ladder to zipwire in one smooth sequence without motion sickness.</p>

<p>The game also simulates your whole body movement rather than just your arms and head and this gives you a feeling of presence and weight, allowing for smoother transitions. For example, when reaching the top of a ladder, you can lean forward and instinctively know when to mantle up to the platform.&nbsp; The sense of freedom and physicality, the climbing, jumping, grappling and zip-lining feel all intuitive and immersive.</p>
<p>Reach has some fairly decent graphics, although some areas do seem a little empty, it’s not going to give Horizon VR anything to worry about, but that is on purpose. You are meant to be belting it through this game and too many extra details would distract you from the parkour.</p>

<p>I have two major issues with the game, one specific to myself and one in general. Firstly, there is no way to set your in-game height, and I would guess Rosa is about 5’6″, a foot shorter than me, so I did feel like I had a compressed spine all the time I was playing. My second issue is probably down to the game being developed for multiple VR platforms. After all the work that has gone in to making you feel like you really are in Rosa’s world, all of which works, you regularly get hit with black loading screens that drag you right out of the game. There is absolutely no need for those on a PS5, the levels are not big, but I would assume the limitations of other headsets forced the developers hand.</p>

<p>Out of this world</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Illumination have revealed the first proper trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, and it's a galactic banger.</p>
<p>We get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosaline, plus a whole bunch of new locations based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>? Yep, there's representation from both games here.</p>
<p>New cast members have also been confirmed, with Brie Larson (<strong>Captain Marvel</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>) taking on the role of Rosalina, and Benny Safdie stepping into the shoes of Bowser Jr. If that name doesn't quite ring a bell, Safdie has acted in a number of projects, but is perhaps more notable for is directorial work on <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> and <strong>The Smashing Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the trailer also reiterates the planned release date of <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, which isn't too far off at this point. Like the first movie, it seems more than likely that we'll get another Direct / trailer at some point in the next few months or so, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>And if you're interested in seeing the whole Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct, you can watch the Shigeru Miyamoto-hosted video below:</p>

<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160456/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Sega and developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are seemingly on a mission to bring as many <strong>Yakuza</strong> games to the Switch 2 in as short a time span as possible. With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> joining <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a>, we’re already at three within five months of the console’s release. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> next February will make it four. Damn, Sega – keep going!</p>
<p>Kiwami 2 was originally released in 2017, and while that seems like a lifetime ago at this point (just ask <strong>Metroid</strong> fans), the underlying Dragon Engine makes it comfortably the most technically demanding entry on Switch 2 yet. I’m thrilled to confirm, then, that it’s a joyous experience from start to finish. It’s easily one of the best entries in the series, one that comes dangerously close to the highs of Yakuza 0.</p>
<p>So once again, you step into the shoes of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu who, after a short period of peace and quiet, is brought back into the criminal fold following a growing conflict between the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance. Kiwami 2 features the familiar sights and sounds of the Tokyo-inspired Kamurocho, but a good chunk of the game also takes place within the Osaka-inspired Sotenbori.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160457/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wielding the might of the Dragon Engine, which made its debut in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life">Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</a>, both main locations look absolutely incredible. Neon lights shine brighter than ever, buildings reflect accurately off Sotenbori’s main river, and streets are filled to the brim with well-rendered residents going about their day.</p>
<p>By keeping the literal size of these cities in check, RGG Studio is able to pack them with things to see and do, and in combining this with realistic diegetic sounds like distant arcade music and the casual chatter of NCPs, it makes for one of the most vividly alive settings I’ve ever seen in a game. Take note, Game Freak.</p>
<p>The notable improvement to visuals does come with one potential drawback: 30fps performance. Both Yakuza 0 and the original Kiwami reach a stable 60fps with the previous engine on Switch 2, and while moving directly from Kiwami to Kiwami 2 did make the drop much more apparent at first, it didn’t bother me at all once I actually started playing properly.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160460/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It remains stable throughout, even during effects-heavy action sequences, and the improvements elsewhere more than make up for any initial disappointment. Not only does Kiwami 2 look <em>much</em> better, but transitions into fights and (most) interior locations are seamless, making for a significantly more modernised experience.</p>
<p>General gameplay is a familiar mix of exploration, minigames, and melee combat, with a sprinkling of RPG mechanics thrown in for good measure. Yakuza games have a remarkable ability to distract you from completing your primary objectives at every turn. So one moment you might be laying the smackdown on a formidable boss before watching the dramatic aftermath in a couple of sumptuous cutscenes, and two minutes later you’ll somehow find yourself in the men’s toilets having a literal peeing contest. It’s absurd, and I love it.</p>
<p>That’s just one of the <em>many</em> minigames. You can play darts, win prizes on claw machines, master mahjong, sing karaoke, clean up in a game of poker, and more. A true highlight was stumbling upon a Club Sega arcade joint, which houses fully playable versions of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/virtua_fighter_2">Virtua Fighter 2</a> and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/virtual_on_cyber_troopers">Virtual On: Cyber Troopers</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160455/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The authenticity really helps the overall setting sing, and you can also buy real-life beverages like The Yamazaki and Hibiki, or dine in at a real-world eatery like Zuboraya. Stocking up on food and drink is encouraged to maintain your health, but I hardly need the excuse to browse Kiwami 2’s extensive, hunger-inducing range.</p>
<p>Watching your health is vital, mind you, since you’ll be getting into fights left, right, and centre. Naturally, a lot of scraps will take place as you progress through the main story, but the streets of Kamurocho and Sotenbori are also riddled with gangs of thugs who won’t hesitate to start wailing on you at any given moment.</p>
<p>Unlike previous entries, Kiwami 2 doesn’t feature multiple fighting styles to switch between. You’ve only got the one here, but as someone who never really bothered with the Beast style much in the first Kiwami, I appreciate the more streamlined approach. You still have melee weapons like knives and baseball bats, while upgrades add whole new abilities to your arsenal.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 2 Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160454/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each fight grants a bunch of experience points, which you can spend on general stats, battle skills, heat actions, and life skills. Overall, it feels far less fiddly than previous entries' overwhelming upgrade paths, and you’ll find yourself purchasing upgrades at frequent intervals. Once you’ve added a few new moves to your belt, powered up your heat meter, and unleashed a blistering flurry of combos, you’ll feel just like a dragon.</p>
<p>Of course, none of this would matter one lick if it weren’t for the story at Kiwami 2’s core. It’s full of wild twists and turns, but the exceptional performances from Takaya Kuroda, Aya Hisakawa, Satoshi Tokushige, and more wonderful voice actors help keep everything grounded. RGG Studio's team are masters at storytelling, and they're only getting better with each new entry.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re particularly fond of the fan-favourite Goro Majima, you can play as the character once again with a short but sweet side campaign accessed via the main menu after a certain point in the main game. This covers what Majima was up to after the first game, and it proves to be a strong, albeit inessential detour.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 2 is a wonderful experience on Switch 2. The improved visuals and streamlined mechanics make for a delightful gameplay experience bolstered by a compelling narrative at its core.</p>
<p>There are so many ridiculous minigames to keep you entertained, and exploring Kamurocho and Sotenbori remains enjoyable five or even fifty hours into the game. It stands alongside Yakuza 0: Director's Cut as one of the finest entries in the series.</p></section>

              <p>After a brief tease earlier this year, Nintendo and Illumination have finally released the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. We see a fair bit of returning characters, but we also get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosalina, who are debuting in the sequel.</p>

  <p>After the events of the first movie, Bowser is still tiny and a prisoner of Mario and company, and his son Bowser Jr. is taking on the major villain role to save his father from the Mushroom Kingdom’s clutches. Rosalina is voiced by <em>Captain Marvel </em>star Brie Larson, and Bowser Jr. will be played by <em>Uncut Gems </em>co-director Benny Safdie. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8">During the Direct</a>, we heard both actors’ performances as Rosalina read bedtime stories, seemingly about Mario and Peach, to several Luma, and Bowser Jr. gave a villain monologue.</p>

 <p>Surprisingly, we didn’t hear anything today about Yoshi, who was teased in the first <em>Mario </em>movie’s post-credits scene. The character’s design was leaked earlier this week <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">by a cookie dough box</a>, and while it wasn’t anything surprising, it did make me think Yoshi might be making his grand debut during today’s Direct showcase. A lot of&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>fans are wondering if Yoshi will have a full speaking role like certain other characters in the films who don’t usually speak in the video games. Mario himself usually doesn’t utter more than a series of “wahoo!”s and the occasional “Let’s-a go!” But Chris Pratt’s voice is forming full sentences in the films, unfortunately, so it’s not out of the question that Yoshi might speak in <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>.</p> <p>The sequel will premiere in theaters on April 3. Pratt is one of several returning actors reprising their roles from the original film. Jack Black made an appearance in the Direct presentation introducing Safdie as Bowser Jr., and his voice can still be heard as Bowser in the trailer, though pitched up because the pathetic little simp has been shrunken down by a Mini Mushroom.</p>

<p>The first trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been released ahead of its debut in theaters later this month. </p>



<p>The trailer was released as part of a special Nintendo Direct for the movie and gave fans a first look at the overall story that sees Mario and his crew head into space. In addition to a look at the overall story, the trailer officially confirmed two new characters that weren’t in the original: Bowser Jr, and Rosalina</p>







<p>Bowser Jr., if you recall, was leaked just days ago thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-bowser-jr-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">box of Pillsbury cookies</a> on a grocery store’s website. Yoshi was also leaked on the box, but he wasn’t in the trailer as it appears that Nintendo is waiting to officially debut the popular green dinosaur. </p>



<p>Two new cast members were also confirmed for the movie. Rosalina will be voiced by Brie Larson, while Bowser Jr. is played by Benny Safdi. Larson is known for her roles in Captain Marvel as the titular character and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Safdi, on the other hand, is best known as a director in films like The Smashing Machine and Uncut Gems. He has played roles in various movies, however, such as the main protagonist, Frank Manatee, in Happy Gilmore 2.</p>



<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself, below. The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026, exactly three years after the original.</p>

                <p>Remember when we thought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s DLC would launch by the end of March 2026? Well, developer From Software said that's way too long and announced that the roguelike/souls-like's next add-on content, The Forsaken Hollows, hits consoles and PC on December 4. Happy holidays, you Nightfarers.</p><p>The Japanese developer made the announcement during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-november-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7248/" data-ref-id="2900-7248">PlayStation's State of Play livestream</a> on November 11. The trailer, which made its way onto publisher Bandai Namco's official X account, isn't that long. But it does reveal two new playable characters, a new Shifting Earth event, and some new enemies.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1988378607698186705" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">In our war against the Night, every battle left a scar.<br>These wounds were given will. A foul life, born of cast-away souls.<br>Steel your resolve, Nightfarers. This hunt must be seen to its end.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> The Forsaken Hollows launches on December 4, 2025. <a href="https://t.co/q7WB94urfh" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/q7WB94urfh</a></p>  — Bandai Namco US (@BandaiNamcoUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1988378607698186705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Following its reveal, From Software marketing representative Miku Watanabe <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took to the PlayStation Blog</a> to break down The Forsaken Hollows a bit more.</p><p>The two incoming Nightfarers are the book-wielding Scholar who "gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation" and the hooded Undertaker who "sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency." Watanabe didn't detail the new enemies, instead merely teasing that they're "tormenting Limveld." Meanwhile, the new Shifting Earth event, The Great Hollow, will produce a "great cavity in the depths of Limveld" that features exotic ruins and temples, sacred towers, and crystals emitting life-draining miasma. Yikes.</p><p>The Forsaken Hollows will cost $15 by itself if you already own Elden Ring Nightreign. However, if you own the $55 Deluxe Edition or the $200 Collector's Edition of the the game, then you get access to The Forsaken Hollows as soon as it launches. Be wary, though: Watanabe noted that the Deluxe Upgrade Pack will be renamed to The Forsaken Hollows DLC on November 12, warning of potential duplicate purchases.</p><p>From Software's parent company, Kadokawa, had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-could-launch-by-end-of-march-2026/1100-6536096/" data-ref-id="1100-6536096">revealed in a recent earnings report</a> that Elden Ring's Nightreign DLC was "planned for release in FY2025." Since both companies are Japanese, and fiscal years are slightly different in Japan, the initial thought was that the the game's add-on content would be released by the end of March 2026. Well, we stand corrected.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. Once again, the game's DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on December 4--just in time for Christmas.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has revealed the first full trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>.
</p>
<p>
The follow-up to the record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie from 2023, it's heavily inspired by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> games (of course, as the name suggests). This trailer introduced Galaxy's cosmic heroine Rosalina, as well as Bowser Jr as the antagonist. Rosalina will be voiced by Marvel star Brie Larson, while Bowser Jr will be voiced by Uncut Gems co-director Benny Safdie.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo previously provided a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-first-look-at-the-mario-movie-sequel">first look at the film sequel</a> in its September Direct showcase, announcing its release date of 3rd April 2026 in the US and 24th April in Japan.

<p>Fans had been expecting a reveal of Yoshi, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doh-the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-leaks-come-from-the-most-unlikely-place">leaks earlier this week thanks to some Pilsbury cookie packaging</a>. But the green dinosaur is yet to be seen in an official capacity.</p>
<p>
Ahead of the film, Nintendo recently released ports of the Wii classics Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. It's the first time the game sequel has been available on Switch consoles, although the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-galaxy-1-2s-ports-bring-two-all-timers-to-the-switch-2-but-i-wish-nintendo-made-that-just-a-little-easier-to-celebrate">ports do compromise on their controls</a>.
</p><p>
The Super Mario Bros. Movie remains the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game adaptation ever</a> in terms of worldwide gross, though it's closely followed by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-jockeys-past-550m-at-the-box-office">more recent A Minecraft Movie</a>. Nintendo will surely be hoping the Galaxy sequel smashes its own record.

<p>Out of this world</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Illumination have revealed the first proper trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, and it's a galactic banger.</p>
<p>We get our first look at Bowser Jr. and Rosaline, plus a whole bunch of new locations based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>? Yep, there's representation from both games here.</p>
<p>New cast members have also been confirmed, with Brie Larson (<strong>Captain Marvel</strong>, <strong>Room</strong>) taking on the role of Rosalina, and Benny Safdie stepping into the shoes of Bowser Jr. If that name doesn't quite ring a bell, Safdie has acted in a number of projects, but is perhaps more notable for is directorial work on <strong>Uncut Gems</strong> and <strong>The Smashing Machine</strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the trailer also reiterates the planned release date of <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, which isn't too far off at this point. Like the first movie, it seems more than likely that we'll get another Direct / trailer at some point in the next few months or so, so be sure to look out for that.</p>
<p>And if you're interested in seeing the whole Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct, you can watch the Shigeru Miyamoto-hosted video below:</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690"><span>Novelty popcorn buckets</span></a><span> are a real hit-or-miss trend, with many being so clumsily aggressive as pure marketing for whatever film they’re themed around that the actual utility for holding the salty, buttery goodness of your favorite theater’s popcorn falls by the wayside. But now and then, something interesting pops up and you see why movie studios are investing in these buckets of popcorn. </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is heading to theaters this weekend, and the magic-based crime drama has one of the better popcorn buckets I’ve seen lately, both because it’s actually practical as a popcorn bucket, and because it manages to capture the spirit of the movie without just being a replica of a character or item in the film.</span></p>

 <p><span>At a glance, the bucket looks like a pretty standard box with the </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>poster on the sides. However, it also uses an optical illusion to make it look as if the popcorn disappears, like it would in a magic trick. There’s a hidden compartment that helps sell the trick, and if you’re looking at it from the right angle, it does truly look like the kind of illusion you’d see in a magician’s stage show.</span></p>   <p><span>Like most optical illusions, if you know the secret, your eyes will probably adapt and see the truth, but it is still a pretty cool popcorn bucket that doesn’t just feel like an elaborate collectible statue with a popcorn-shaped hole on the side. The next question is: Is it worth going to see </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</span></i><span> to get it? Eh. Despite the series’ stacked cast and neat premise of magic-based heists, they’ve never really gotten much critical acclaim. </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is sitting at a series high on review aggregate site </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_2025"><i><span>Rotten Tomatoes</span></i></a><span> with a 60 percent approval rating. So I guess they’re getting better? </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is a great game</a> with a complicated legacy thanks to its use of generative AI to voice NPCs. It’s the same strategy Embark Studios used with <em>The Finals</em>, and the CEO of publisher Nexon now says fans should get used to it.</p> <p>“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” Junghun Lee told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><em>Game*Spark</em></a>, according to a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>. “But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.”</p>

 <p>He believes generative AI will increase the capabilities of game studios across the board, thus increasing the “average” quality of games.&nbsp; “AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations,” Lee said.</p>

 <p>His comments come after fellow South Korea game publisher Krafton revealed an “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">AI first</a>” plan to invest roughly $70 million in GPU clusters and related resources to build out an infrastructure for deploying agentic AI across the company. Krafton happens to own the makers of <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p>

 <p>But the deployment of AI in games remains controversial and confusing, as proven by Nexon’s own <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <h2>No one agrees on what counts as generative AI</h2> <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em>&nbsp;in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with&nbsp;<em>PCGamesN</em></a>. But in addition to using machine learning during the development process, the hit Steam extraction shooter also uses text-to-speech models to voice all of the NPC barks for every random item and situation.</p>

 <p>“[Text-to-speech] allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it’s needed, or where there’s tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work,” Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer last month. “So it’s a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn’t use any generative AI.”</p>

 <p>Others disagree, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><em>Eurogamer</em>, &nbsp;whose review</a> became a flash point on social media this week after it critiqued <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ use of AI voices. “[Machine learning] is an interesting technology, and the effects it produces during matches are undeniably convincing,” wrote Rick Lane. “The same cannot be said about Embark’s generated voice lines, which are aggressively mediocre and a stain on the experience.”</p> <p>There are also those who take issue with the assumption of Nexon’s CEO that everyone must be racing to embrace generative AI more generally. “Hello, not only do we not use AI, we would rather cut off our own arms than do so,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3m5fpw7lp7s2d">wrote</a> indie team <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong/">Necrosoft Games</a>. “<em>Demonschool</em> is 100% human made.”</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Drift 36 monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free cash and other rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drift 36 is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-grow-a-garden-film-adaptation-story-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that drops players into the middle of a high-octane drifting and car racing circuit. Players are required to buy their first car upon launch, and from there, progress through the game to get the best automobiles available. With Roblox versions of highly sought-after vehicular brands like Porsche, Lamborghini and Koenigsegg on offer, car enthusiasts will have a fantastic time playing Drift 36.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having been released in the early months of 2025, Drift 36 has gradually gained traction over the course of the year and now boasts a fairly dedicated player base. Although simply participating in the various events the game offers is enough for players to keep upgrading their cars, using redeem codes to get some extra cash is never a bad idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New codes for Drift 36 are released regularly, albeit not at consistent intervals, which means that players will have to be on their toes to keep track of all the new codes.

                <p>It is understood that Sony and Microsoft are working on new console platforms--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">PS6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next Xbox</a>--but when might they be released? According to Piers Harding-Rolls, the research director for games at Ampere Analysis, these new consoles could launch later than expected due to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> delay. This could happen, but it's not what Ampere expects.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that the delay of GTA 6 will have a "significant impact on console sales dynamics in 2026." This is because, with GTA 6 now coming in November 2026 instead of May 2026, console sales will be "even more back-loaded" than normal. How does the GTA 6 delay impact the next-generation console release dates? Harding-Rolls said his company is modeling the new systems to launch in late 2027, but that could change if the platform-holders want to squeeze more juice out of GTA 6.</p><p>"Might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the GTA 6 wave and waiting until 2028? The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the GTA franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies," he explained.</p><p>Harding-Rolls went on to say that GTA 6 is going to be "such an important driver of hardware sales," and not just when the game comes out, but for multiple years to follow. "Sony and Microsoft will have wanted a much earlier release than late 2026 so they could generate momentum earlier in the cycle," he said.</p><p>One of the reasons that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">GTA 5 sold so well</a> was because the game launched later in the PS3 and Xbox 360 lifecycles, coming multiple years after those consoles arrived. This meant that the install base of those machines was big at the time, and then Rockstar re-released GTA 5 for PS4 and Xbox One when those consoles came out in 2014. Then Rockstar put the game on PC in 2015 and then brought it to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2022.</p><h2><strong>What do we know about the PS6 and next Xbox?</strong></h2><p>Both Sony and Microsoft have confirmed that they are working on new consoles, but neither has been officially announced. Sony, for its part, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/" data-ref-id="1100-6535332">showed off some new experimental technology that could power its next console.</a> Microsoft, meanwhile, announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">partnership with AMD earlier this year</a> for future platforms. Rumors have swirled recently that Microsoft could quit the console business, but the company says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-xbox-consoles-not-canceled-microsoft-says/1100-6535237/" data-ref-id="1100-6535237">that's not true.</a></p><p>For now, GTA 6 is confirmed only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but if Rockstar follows a similar playbook to GTA 5, fans can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-fans-waiting-for-the-possible-pc-edition-now-have-to-wait-even-longer/1100-6536055/" data-ref-id="1100-6536055">expect it to come to PC later</a> and possibly new consoles.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders’ latest update brings the Duo Matchmaking table along with adjusted cosmetic prices and a free Raider Deck. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ latest extraction shooter, ARC Raiders, has blown the competition out of the water, with the game hitting a concurrent peak of over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-reveals-arc-raiders-player-count-steam-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">700,000 players across all platforms</a>. As the game continues to break records, the developers have released a new update that adds a much-requested feature to the title, along with some additional changes. </p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-duo-matchmaking-was-being-silently-tested-since-the-beginning-of-this-week">ARC Raiders Duo Matchmaking Was Being Silently Tested Since the Beginning of this Week</h2>



<p>According to a new <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, ARC Raiders’ duo prioritised matchmaking has been silently tested since earlier this week. The developers first prioritise solo and squads to play separately. Post that, duos are prioritised to play with other duos, and the same applies to trios. The developers have also cautioned players that “this is not a 100% guaranteed system”, which means that they “may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own.” </p>



<p>Along with the duo matchmaking for ARC Raiders, the developers are also making adjustments to store cosmetic prices based on feedback. They have reviewed the prices and “made adjustments to lower prices where applicable”. The new prices will be reflected from Thursday, November 13, at 10:30 CET. Moreover, Raiders who have already purchased at the old pricing will receive compensation for the difference, and their Raider Tokens will be refunded to their account within the coming week. </p>



<p>Lastly, one free Raider Deck is available to all players, and in the future, both free and premium decks will be offered. Players should note that gameplay items will be reserved for free decks as they help new raiders along the way and can be unlocked through progressions. Moreover, there will be no pay-to-win items in premium decks, and they will be based on cosmetics and convenience. </p>



<p>In other news, Embark Studios has defended ARC Raiders’ AI voices by saying ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-nexon-ceo-defends-ai-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every game company</a>‘ does it. Additionally, this game is the perfect extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-perfect-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for gamers new to the genre</a>.

                <p>Capcom has announced a new collaboration with KFC in Japan, themed around Monster Hunter Wilds. Starting on November 19, KFC branches will sell two limited-edition meals with unique packaging and codes for in-game items redeemable in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>The packaging shows off art of a Felyne partner that accompanies players in Monster Hunter Wilds (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/monster-hunter-wilds-is-teaming-up-with-kfc-in-japan-for-exclusive-in-game-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), with the little critter cosplaying as KFC icon Colonel Sanders--complete with a trendy outfit and facial hair. The Feast Set comes with codes for a Luxury Ingredient Set of campfire cooking ingredients and the KFC Colonel Sanders Felyne charm, while the Spice Up Set includes a Hunting Item Set of consumable items and a KFC Barrel Felyne Charm. Upgrading a meal from standard to large will also get a themed sticker set.</p><p>Four KFC stores will also be decorated to make customers feel like they've entered the world of Monster Hunter, and the promotion will conclude on December 16. This isn't the first time that KFC has partnered up with a well-known video game, as back in 2021, there was a crossover with Genshin Impact in China. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-kfc-real-life-crossover-event-canceled-due-to-covid-concerns/1100-6488787/">That collaboration was unfortunately cut short</a> over COVID-19 protocol violations.</p><p>Capcom has also teamed up with McDonald's Japan last month to release a line of Street Fighter-themed burgers alongside free ketchup-and-mustard-inspired costumes for the game's roster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TkDxFIsI-g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TkDxFIsI-g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Monster Hunter Wilds sales have continued to decline since launch, with Capcom reporting that it only sold 160,000 units of the game over its last financial quarter that ended on September 30, 2025. This is a major dip from the previous quarter that saw 477,000 sales of Monster Hunter Wilds, and Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto suggested that the high price of the PS5--the "main platform" for Monster Hunter Wilds players in Japan--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">was hurting sales of the game</a> in that region.</p>

<p>In Japan, at least</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Folks will no doubt be aware of Kazutoshi Iida from the cult-classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> for 64DD and GameCube, but now two of the creator's earlier titles are heading to the Switch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_tail_of_the_sun">Tail of the Sun</a> (1996) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/artdink_game_log_aquanauts_holiday">Aquanaut's Holiday</a> (1995) both launched for the PS1 with western publication from Sony itself. Now, Artdink is reviving both titles as part of its ARTDINK GAME LOG preservation project. Tail of the Sun will launch in Japan on <strong>16th December 2025</strong>, while Aquanaut's Holiday will follow in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"ARTDINK GAME LOG is a project to port and re-release game titles previously developed by ARTDINK onto modern gaming hardware.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"It serves as a record (log) of ARTDINK's game development journey. By reviving past masterpieces using current technology and platforms, it delivers nostalgia and rediscovery to longtime fans, while offering an unprecedented experience to new players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're unaware of what these titles entail, Tail of the Sun is an open-world game of sorts in which you play as a caveman with an aim to reach the sun by stacking 'ivory' from mammoths tusks. Meanwhile, Aquanaut's Holiday is an underwater simulator set in the first-person perspective in which you explore the ocean, find treasure, and interact with deep-sea creatures.</p>
<p>No release has been confirmed for western audiences at this time, but we wouldn't be surprised to see both games at some point in the future.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, Bradley Lynch, a reliable leaker of the company's projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-may-announce-steam-frame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that we would get an announcement this week not only on Deckard (whose final name appears to be Steam Frame) but also on a new Steam controller. The Steam Frame is expected to feature the following specifications:</p>



<ul>
<li>CPU: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (SM8650)</li>



<li>Display: 2160×2160 @ 120 Hz panel from JDI</li>



<li>Features: SLAM tracking, eye tracking</li>
</ul>



<p>As for the controller, it will reportedly feature a 'capsense' feature to detect how far the user's fingers are from the gamepad's handles. </p>



<p>The announcements might land in a few hours. YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://x.com/mooreslawisdead/status/1988432610951852284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that Valve fans should prepare for the reveal to drop at around 19 UTC. But gamers are not-so-secretly hoping to learn about more than just new hardware. </p>



<p>Other rumors had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization-trailer-prepared/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that Valve was also hard at work on a new Half-Life project. Another leaker, Kurakasis, has <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1988309847046340713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gaben, do it 😈</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 is arguably a mythological figure in the games industry at this point. It's been twenty-one years since Half-Life 2, and although Half-Life Alyx was released in 2020 alongside the Valve Index VR headset, gamers would like a proper sequel to be available as a non-VR exclusive game.</p>



<p>Another leaker, Shpeshal Nick, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1988221134622630153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>:</p>



<p><em>If what I was just DMd is actually true (big if), next week GTA 6 could actually have its thunder stolen on the hype scale</em></p>



<p>Half-Life 3 could certainly steal a bit of attention away from GTA VI, at least for hardcore gamers (certainly not for the mainstream). It doesn't perfectly align with the other teasers, which all indicate an announcement coming later today. Then again, his sources might have been incorrect regarding the timeline. </p>



<p>Anyway, we should learn more about what's coming from Valve very soon. Sit tight.</p>

              <p>The LEGO Star Wars line has been the crown jewel of the brick builder’s empire for decades and good discounts on these sets are rare. That’s what makes this current deal so good: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary Edition down from $84 to $67</a>&nbsp;which is an all-time low for a set that boasts an impressive<strong> 4.9 out of 5-star rating</strong> from over 1,900 reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Stunning LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is not your typical LEGO build that gets assembled once and then tossed into a closet: The <strong>921-piece recreation of the Millennium Falcon</strong> captures the ship as it appeared in <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>, complete with authentic details that will make any fan smile. The cockpit sits exactly where it should, the iconic satellite dish perches on top-the round one, naturally and the quad laser cannons are positioned to defend against Imperial TIE fighters.</p>
<p>The base also includes a <strong>nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary commemorative brick</strong>, and celebrates a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars collaboration. Angled dynamically, the stand sets the ship in motion even when it’s just sitting on your shelf or desk. This thoughtful design transforms the model from a simple toy into legitimate home décor that sparks conversations. Measuring <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide,</strong> the completed build claims enough presence to anchor a bookshelf or entertainment center without overwhelming the space.</p>



<p>The building experience itself has that meditative quality LEGO has nailed with its adult-oriented sets. <strong>Each of the 921 pieces</strong> clicks into place with satisfying precision, while the instruction manual walks you through a logical construction sequence that builds excitement as the recognizable shape emerges. You’ll spend several hours immersed in this project, which is exactly the point for those seeking a creative outlet after a long day.</p>
<p>Timing makes this discount appealing as a gift option: For yourself or someone who considers Star Wars a lifestyle rather than a movie franchise, this set delivers on real value at this price point.&nbsp;At this historic low price, the barrier to entry for owning a piece of LEGO Star Wars history has never been lower.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A fresh duo of characters have arrived in Marvel Rivals, with Gambit the first to join the fray at the start of Season 5, and we’ve got all the details on who the voice actor is.</p>



<p>Season 5 in Marvel Rivals kicks off on November 14, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-trailer-officially-reveals-rogue-and-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gambit and Rogue joining as playable characters</a> this season, and the trend of boasting an impressive voice cast in the game continues.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for all the details on who the voice actor of Gambit is in Marvel Rivals, or are wondering where you recognize the voice from, we’ve got everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-voicing-gambit-in-marvel-rivals">Who is Voicing Gambit in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Familiar sound. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The voice actor for Gambit in Marvel Rivals is AJ Locascio, a familiar name for fans of the X-Men character.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio also voices Gambit in X-Men ’97 on Disney+, which continues the story set out in the animated series from the 1990s. However, he was not the voice actor for Gambit in the original series; that role was performed by Chris Potter.</p>



<p>Though X-Men ’97 was the first time Locascio filled the role of Remy LeBeau, he more than made it his own with a stellar performance of the fan-favorite character.</p>



<p>That made him a natural choice to fit the role of Gambit in Marvel Rivals and joins a host of other names who have portrayed a character elsewhere before reviving the role in Marvel Rivals, alongside the likes of Yuri Lewanthal, Laura Bailey, Nolan North, and Troy Baker.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-other-roles-does-aj-locascio-have">What Other Roles Does AJ Locascio Have?</h2>



<p><strong>AJ Locascio boasts a host of recognizable roles throughout his career, including the role of Marty McFly in Back to The Future: The Game, and Skjolder in God of War Ragnarok.</strong></p>



<p>Locascio’s career has also seen him play the role of Owen Grady in the Jurassic World: Evolution franchise, Han Solo in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, and Jorund in Horizon Forbidden West.</p>



<p>He has also featured in other LEGO Star Wars animated titles, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers, Doom Eternal, Voltron: Legendary Defender, and Dawn of the Croods.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> publisher Nexon has defended the game's use of generative AI, suggesting players should "assume that every game company is now using AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders, like developer Embark's 2023 shooter, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-finals"><u>The Finals</u></a>, declares it uses AI in development, stating on its Steam store page: "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark expanded on this with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PCGamesN</u></a> recently, saying Arc Raiders "in no way uses generative AI whatsoever" and stressed that it instead used "something called machine learning, or reinforcement learning, and that's to do with the locomotion for our larger drones with multiple legs, but there's no generative content whatsoever." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, in the same interview, design director Virgil Watkins added that with regards to its controversial text-to-speech system, it "hire[d] and contract[ed] voice actors for it — it's part of their contract that we use [AI] for this purpose, and that allows us to do things like our ping system, where it's capable of saying every single item name, every single location name, and compass directions. That's how we can get that without needing to have someone come in every time we create a new item for the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a fresh interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>), Junghun Lee, CEO of Arc Raiders' publisher Nexon, not only championed AI for improving "efficiency in both game production and live service operations," but also stated: "I think it's important to assume that every game company is now using AI."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI," Lee said. "But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly feels as though Lee's comments ring true. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI</u></a>." Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conversely, Nintendo has bucked the trend, with Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto previously stressing that the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction"><u>would rather go in a “different direction” than the rest of the video game industry</u></a> when it comes to AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, its use of AI clearly hasn't held Arc Raiders back. It's now sold over 4 million copies worldwide less than two weeks since its release date, cementing its commercial success. Nexon also revealed that the extraction shooter had reached <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms"><u>a huge concurrent count of 700,000 players across all platforms</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"ARC Raiders raises the bar for extraction shooters pretty much across the board, with an incredibly gripping progression grind, tense fights against NPCs and other players that make for memorable matches, and loot that feels completely worth all the work and stress it takes to obtain it," we wrote in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>IGN's Arc Raiders review</u></a>, which returned an 'Amazing' 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The fact that it manages to also run well and look amazing all the while is just downright impressive, even if a few bugs here and there lead to the rare rage quit. For years I’d been wondering when someone would take the awesome promise of this genre to the next level, and ARC Raiders is without question what I’ve been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this has tempted you into jumping into Arc Raiders, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Best_ARC_Raiders_Settings"><u>best settings</u></a>, find out what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Skill_Tree_and_Best_Abilities"><u>skills we recommend unlocking</u></a> first, and see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/How_to_Deliver_Field_Depot_Crates"><u>how to earn loot by delivering field depot crates</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

<p>Plus an increase for new-hires</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ba04dbd7d6d21"><a title="Sonic Mania" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ba04dbd7d6d21/sonic-mania.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sega</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sega <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/release/251112_1.html">has announced</a> that it is raising the salary for its full-time staff along with increasing the starting salary for new-hires over in Japan (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-raises-starting-salaries-for-new-hires-and-base-pay-of-existing-full-time-employees-in-japan-again/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Starting from 1st April 2026, the base salary for full-time employees will raise by an average of around 10%. Sega is introducing a more flexible pay structure while also converting annual bonuses into base pay.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the starting salary for new university graduates will see a similar 10% increase from 300,000 to 330,000 yen (approx $2,140).</p>
<p>In the press release (via machine translation), Sega said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[SEGA] will revise the salary levels of full-time employees at its Japanese subsidiary and raise the starting salary for new employees, with the aim of creating an environment in which employees can work with peace of mind amid recent social changes such as rising prices, and of recruiting and developing attractive human resources to strengthen its global competitiveness."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sega had already increased its employees' base salaries back in 2023 from 222,000 to 300,000 yen, so this latest news will no doubt be very welcome to workers over in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/square-enix-hit-by-mass-layoffs-as-part-of-global-restructuring">Square Enix recently announced widespread restructuring of its international workforce</a>, leading to layoffs across the UK, Europe, and the US. The progress report provided notes that the changes will lead to a saving of around around 3 billion yen, or roughly $19.6 million.</p>

            <p>Gah! I've lost them again. My precious brows and burns, they've gone walkabouts! Luckily, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> latest patch aims to take care of instances of misbehaving hair. That's far from the only fix in what's a very beefy list, with companion buffs, crash corrections, and instances of weird NPC antics also having been tended to. </p>

<p>The near 5000 words of bullet points which make up Outer Worlds 2 <a href="https://outerworlds2.obsidian.net/news/the-outer-worlds-2-patch-1050">patch 1.0.5.0</a> make for surprisingly fun reading, with as many fun bugs having been squashed by Obsidian as serious issues. "The player's eyebrows no longer disappear when using the inventory screen or idle camera," was the first note which caught my eye, followed by: "The player's eyebrow color will now be properly saved and applied to their in-game characters after character creation. Note: this unfortunately will not retroactively fix incorrect eyebrow color for existing characters."</p>
<p>Tragedy. Pour one out for all the space adventurers who're stuck explaining why the brows don't match their blonde, brown, or black barnet until the end of time. The hair-raising fixes don't end there. Obsidian have "made adjustments to side burn facial hair so that it no longer disappears at certain angles". Great relief for those roleplaying as American civil war generals or Victorian businessmen.</p>
<p>Getting serious for a moment before I shout out a bunch more wacky ones, Obsidian have fixed a couple of issues which could prevent saving and generally "increased Companion survivability", meaning that they should be more effective especially on harder difficulties and if your leadership skill's high. A number of crashes and scenarios that could see NPCs get stuck have had failsafes put in, while characters should "no longer unexpectedly take explosive damage through walls or objects". Companions should now properly follow you through vents and not get stuck wanting to talk to you when they've got nothing new to say. The studio have also nixed some references to cut content which were causing errors.</p>
<p>Right, more silliness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the Order of the Ascendants members were found to be having conversations with each other at very long distances on Cloister, this wasn't part of the grand equation and has been addressed</li>
<li>Preventing your VALERIE unit from 'beep bop booping' into Ladders if you have climbed it</li>
<li>Player arm doesn't freak out anymore after sliding into a forced cinematic or conversation</li>
<li>Marisol is no longer able to teleport to the rooftop of Scientician's Surplus and enter a problematic state</li>
<li>Characters will no longer make noises before they have been spawned into an encounter</li>
<li>Player can no longer sprint while being mentally refreshed</li>
<li>Glued shoulder pads back onto our 2-handed handgun users so they no longer fly</li>
</ul>
