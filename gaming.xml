Preorders at Target are already sold out as well, while Best Buy’s selection is merely marked as “Coming Soon”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that, outside of keeping up with deal trackers, you’ll very more than likely have to pay above retail price for the time being. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, we’ll give you a full breakdown of the best places to get your buy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/pokemon"><u>Pokémon</u></a> preorders for whichever Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes products you’re looking out for. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection — Charmander &amp; Ghastly</h2><div id="234434"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234434" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection - Charmander - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><div id="234435"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234435" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection - Gastly - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a handful of Pokémon TCG products for the Ascended Heroes expansion are launching right away on 30 January, with the Charmander and Ghastly Tech Collections preorders being the best to buy first — the cheapest being at Walmart for $39.97 each (random), or at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJVNw?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon </u></a>for around $43 each. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each collection gets you three Ascended Heroes booster packs, a titular promo card, and a tech sticker sheet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pre-orders for individual Ascended Heroes booster packs are sold out over at <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5AP7?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> and aren’t listed at Amazon or Walmart, so the Tech Sticker Collections give you the best value for money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ascended Heroes Collection Blisters — Erika &amp; Larry</h2></div><div id="234443"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234443" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution: Ascended Heroes Collection - Larry - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the first Ascended Heroes products releasing with the set’s launch on 30 January, the Erika and Larry blister packs are arguably the second-hottest to buy right now —  and pre-orders can be bought cheapest for <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56y15?object_uuid=289eb6e5-519f-468b-9e7b-aed2f1917205&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>$34.99 at Amazon</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, whichever one you get between the Larry and Erika edition (Larry’s has a Komala promo card, and Erika’s with Tangela).

In the meantime, though, Walmart’s the best go-to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

Some have been of its own making, but others have come from forces outside the city (and country) it calls home.</p><p>Being based in San Francisco, which<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/01/san-francisco-big-tech-workers-industry?ref=aftermath.site"><u> in a generation has transformed itself into a techbro’s utopia</u></a>, has meant that the cost of attending GDC has skyrocketed, to the point where many developers and associated industry professionals based outside the US<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23679081/gdc-2023-price-affordability-game-developers-conference?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>have found it difficult, if not impossible, to attend</u></a>.</p><p>Then last year<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/24/pushing-buttons-game-developers-conference?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the conference revealed a controversial rebrand</u></a>, pivoting into a ‘festival of gaming’ that has been criticised for spreading itself too thin, making its pricing even more impenetrable and for scattering key events out across the city, making them more difficult to attend.</p><p>Both of those factors, the first especially, have led to more and more developers from outside the US deciding to skip what was not long ago an unskippable event, but over the last twelve months the political climate in the United States has become so hostile that it isn’t just keeping international developers from attending this San Francisco show, it’s keeping them from entering the country at all.&nbsp;</p><p>As the Trump administration rages unchecked through what were once assumed to be a robust series of checks and balances, its disdain for the rights of anyone outside its lunatic base has left international workers, and even visitors, at the mercy of immigration agents and a border system that has detained <a href="https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/i-was-detained-and-deported-for-opinions-trump-s-america-didn-t-like-20251211-p5nn13?ref=aftermath.site"><u>journalists</u></a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/i-was-a-british-tourist-trying-to-leave-america-then-i-was-detained-shackled-and-sent-to-an-immigration-detention-centre?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tourists</u></a> alike, while ICE agents lawlessly roam major cities <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/immigration-ice-raid-andrea-velez?ref=aftermath.site"><u>kidnapping</u></a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/man-shot-and-killed-by-federal-officers-in-minnesota-was-an-icu-nurse-his-parents-say?ref=aftermath.site"><u>murdering</u></a> American citizens at will.</p><p>Given that for many global developers GDC has escalated from being something that’s important but too expensive (which, incidentally, it still is) <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil/"><u>into an event that could lead to detention and deportation</u></a>, I wanted to hear from international games workers and industry professionals about how this threat has impacted their plans to attend the revamped 2026 edition of the show.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil/"><div><p>International Game Developers Cancel GDC Plans As US Government Snatches A Pro-Palestine Student, Threatens Canada - Aftermath</p><p>“It seems insane to travel to a country that has all but declared you its enemy”</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure><p>For this story I spoke with nine people, none of whom will be attending this year's GDC:</p><p>For this story I spoke with nine people, all of whom have attended GDC before, but who won’t be at this year’s show in March:</p><p><strong>Vee Pendergrast </strong>is Industry Development Manager at the New Zealand Centre Of Digital Excellence, aka CODE NZ, which is the country’s national video games industry development body.

There was a pandemic-based gap, but I was there last year.</p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: My first time was in 2018 as a student. From 2021-2024 I attended as a speaker, then most recently last year as an<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Games_Festival?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>IGF jury member</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Paul Dean</strong>: My first GDC was in 2014 and I believe I’ve been to five, which means it became a regular part of my experience of the games industry for a while. I would often host/organise a panel called<a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025689/Board-Game-Design-Day-The?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>The State and Future of Board Games</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Cassandra</strong>: I’ve attended once, but also had a talk accepted for 2020 before that edition was cancelled.</p><p><strong>Harold</strong>: I first attended GDC in I think 2007 or 2008 and went almost every year up to 2020. Of all the post-pandemic GDCs, I believe I attended every one except last year's.</p><p><strong>Will Overgard</strong>: I've been going yearly since 2016.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chantal Ryan</strong>: In my four years in the industry, I’ve attended GDC twice (2022-2023), in various speaking roles (I had to skip last year for personal reasons).</p><p><strong>Zane:</strong> I've been twice. The last time was in 2023.</p><blockquote>Every time I've been to the States in the past year, I've had some kind of discriminatory encounter...I do not feel safe in the country</blockquote><p><strong>Do you think you would have attended GDC this year if the political climate wasn't as hostile to international visitors?</strong></p><p><strong>Vee Pendergast</strong>: Inevitably. We work extensively with a company called "Representing Games" where we bring a cohort of developers to pitch to a room full of publisher and investor scouts. Last year's event (2025) was the most successful we have ever had, and led directly to several publishing agreements being signed. Of course, we have previously hosted NZ-lead networking functions and all sorts of other side business.</p><p><strong>Mathew Kumar</strong>: It's difficult to say. I hate to miss it, but costs to attend have gotten absolutely absurd. I think originally I was considering attending to try and show face; the industry is completely brutal right now for hiring, and trying to remind people I'm still alive was probably a focus. But with costs being what they are, and the general climate, it just didn't make any sense.</p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: Absolutely. GDC isn't just about the professional opportunities, but it's one of the only ways for me to see my friends and colleagues from all over the globe.</p><p><strong>Paul Dean</strong>: Quite possibly. I’m financially able to, and it would improve my employment prospects. It’s a relatively short trip from Vancouver to San Francisco and the reality of North America is that there is much more of a games industry in the US, not least because about nine times as many people live in the US as in Canada. The majority of the work that I’ve done in games the last five years has been for or with folks in the US, while even previous to that I was regularly visiting for all sorts of work-related events and opportunities. My experience of the Canada/US games industry is that there’s a fair amount of overlap and what I believe used to be at least a somewhat fluid movement of people between the two.</p><p>The US games industry can be quite inward-looking, and attending events in the US does a great deal to pierce that bubble, connect you with opportunities and show people that you’re much more than a two-page freelance resume.</p><p><strong>Cassandra</strong>: We were intending to ship in Q3 last year and our publisher would have been showcasing the game; we would also have been hopeful to receive IGF nominations, so if that had transpired then ideally yes, I would have attended in 2026. Attending is made impossibly unsafe in the current climate. As it stands, we delayed [our game] substantially, and the reasons for that delay in itself are partially related to the existentially punishing impact of the current politics as well.</p><p><strong>Harold</strong>: I have no reason to think I wouldn't. More broadly, I would of course be very much in favour of GDC relocating to a city that isn't as eye-wateringly expensive as San Francisco. But the event otherwise affords so many opportunities to reconnect with folks I rarely see or keep in touch with otherwise, it's normally worth paying the price, literally and proverbially.</p><p><strong>Will Overgard</strong>: Honestly no. The political climate is extremely bad, like getting killed or shipped to a nightmare super prison bad, but there's nothing to be gained at this GDC. No one has money to make deals. Hell, it used to be that "You make the deal at GDC and you sign it at E3" but now it’s "You make the deal at DICE and you drink about it at GDC". Unlike the awful P2E swindlers, the AI tech scene has no money to throw at games, and everyone else has battened down their hatches. Outside of some outliers, I'd guess most indie publishers are already fully set for 2026 into 2027. Risking it all to go to an openly dangerous county could be worth it if there's a chance you could get your game fully funded, but that's not happening at this GDC.</p><p><strong>Chantal Ryan</strong>: Yes, absolutely. While I think GDC as a convention is a bit of a hellscape, it’s indisputably one of the best places to network and scout investment. I also have many adored industry friends I only get to see there. As director of my studio, it’s my responsibility to attend these kinds of events to create professional opportunities for the team, so skipping out is a big deal.</p><p><strong>Zane</strong>: Yes. Although, the conference's decision to increase ticket prices and open it up to the public was also a factor I should mention.</p><blockquote>As far as the US is concerned, I have nothing to lose. I can't and won't be going back to the US without radical change.</blockquote><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Regarding your decision not to attend, is it out of a personal concern, or just a broader case of not wanting to travel to/support anything taking place in the US at the moment?</strong></p><p><strong>Vee Pendergast</strong>: For me, there's the first and most obvious concern, I am an out transgender woman and I don't completely pass due to my voice. In early 2025, Trump signed an Executive Order that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/travel/trans-people-travel-advisories-united-states?ref=aftermath.site"><u>trans people can only enter into the US</u></a> on a passport of their birth sex. Obviously for trans people living under their legal gender in their country of origin this creates an impossible situation, as someone would then have to go through the process of getting a passport under what may be a previous legal name and gender. Not to mention how uncomfortable that is for the person in question, and frankly the US is actively hostile to trans people in most states. San Francisco is notably queer friendly; however, given the aggressive paramilitary actions of ICE that have taken place in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2025_Los_Angeles_protests_against_mass_deportation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Californian cities</u></a>, I have a record low confidence in the safety of any trans person in the country, let alone a foreign national. The US is not safe for trans people, which is the unassailable truth of the matter as we are already being disproportionately targeted by Trump's brazen thuggery.</p><p>Trump's reasoning for this ridiculous Executive Order was to "stop men competing in women's sports", which is so stupid as to simply be an obvious excuse to enact a law rooted in hate and prejudice. Which, let's face it, is his calling card anyway, so we're not that special.</p><p>Given I have heard from friends in the publishing fraternity at Gamescom last year that they were lukewarm at best about attending GDC 2026 due to the US' hostility to visitors, we decided to make the hard decision to pull back on our GDC intervention. We have reason to believe several of our staff would be turned around at the border at best and cannot guarantee the safety to a reasonable standard of any developer in our cohort. Which is disheartening given how good our outcomes were last year.</p><p>And then there's the next problem: Device searches on entry. We are bound by confidentiality agreements with our developers, partners and ultimately to the government of Aotearoa New Zealand. No, I will not be handing over my passcodes to my devices to have invasive personal searches done, much less submit my private social media logins, let alone handing over a <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/travel/news-and-advice/us-border-checks-social-media-dna-esta-b2882386.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>DNA sample</u></a> (those laws may not be affecting us yet, but it's coming). It is at a stage where I have heard people stopped for bringing in burner/clean phones and devices too. For a country of so-called "freedom of speech" this is an act of authoritarianism, to put it mildly.</p><p>Why am I being so candid as far as this interview is concerned? As far as the US is concerned, I have nothing to lose. I can't and won't be going back to the US without radical change, which is a prospect that saddens me, and I am not important enough to feel the weight of any ire that will hurt my career or personal life outside the US. I have been doxxed for being an out trans woman in games before who dared to have opinions, but it was mostly just annoying US-based trolls typing anti-trans abuse into their non-US made devices.</p>

<p><strong>Mathew Kumar</strong>: It's not <em>so </em>much about personal concern other than I'm aware that pretty much anyone can be disappeared for any reason now, and in the post-Gaza genocide, post-"rule based international order" there's a decent chance no one will do anything about it. Frankly, it's more in solidarity. I lived in the US, and honestly, I'd live there again, but I'm very clear-eyed about the place of the US in the world, and right now if I'm not hopping across the border to get Trader Joe's I'm not suddenly going to put thousands of dollars into the US economy so I can hand my resume to some poorly staffed booths in convention hall.</p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: GDC is long due an overhaul. I heard that in the past there were events like <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/gdc-europe-announced?ref=aftermath.site"><u>GDC Europe</u></a>? Bring it back! My heart goes out to the industry professionals that work so hard on the advisory boards, but they have an impossible task in my opinion. Until the US economy completely collapses, GDC is here to stay.</p><p>Personally I'm wishing a non-US country would take up the torch, I just don't know if it'll happen.</p><p><strong>Paul Dean</strong>: I have big feelings around this. First, my chief considerations around these things is always a personal concern rooted in previous experiences crossing the border.</p><p>In spring 2015, as I was attempting a pretty routine trip down to GDC, I was stopped at the US/Canada border and then held and questioned for about eight hours, before being walked back to Canadian customs. It’s still not entirely clear to me why or how this opaque decision was made, but it began with a border guard yelling at me, then placing his hand on his sidearm, then searching through all my possessions (even down to examining an old postcard being used as a bookmark) and moving me to a separate holding area. A lot more questions came from a supervisor and, for a while, I was sat next to someone’s lawyer who advised me that everything in the border crossing building was monitored and being recorded all the time.</p><p>I’ve experienced secondary inspection when crossing the border several times since, including a few times when border guards were sure I had a DUI (I don’t even have a driving license). These days I have a redress number and usually have a relatively okay time, but I’m left with the impression that US immigration (and indeed a lot of immigration) can be arbitrary, error-prone and liable to make rash, incorrect assessments that can be life-changing for the people affected (I had to appeal my first Canadian immigration rejection, which was found to be full of procedural errors). In the last ten years I’ve watched with alarm as the massive budget for the Department of Homeland Security has grown and grown, concerned at its broad range of powers, invasive searches, relative lack of oversight and increasing probing of things like people’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dz0g2ykpeo?ref=aftermath.site"><u>social media history</u></a> or <a href="https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/what-do-when-encountering-law-enforcement-airports-and-other-ports-entry-us?ref=aftermath.site"><u>political positions</u></a>.</p><p>Second, I don’t see travelling to the US, or visiting any event/person in the US, as implicit support of the US government and its choices. Indeed, I want to keep supporting events that are inclusive or queer and minority-led, as well as stay connected to the people doing that work, and there are still so many Americans working hard to make these things happen, as well as people who obviously don’t support the administration and who are suffering. Increasingly limiting my travel has been absolutely heartbreaking for me because I feel like I’m losing access not just to opportunities and interesting places, but to so many friends, including some of the most important people in my life. It’s absolutely true that those of us visiting the US should feel safe and deserve far fairer, far kinder treatment, but it’s also true that Americans themselves deserve so much better than what their country is currently giving them. I don’t see this as an “us and them” issue where a border delineated by other people who never knew and never cared about us is the chief divide.</p><p><strong>Cassandra</strong>: My personal safety navigating both the ESTA and arrival/border control process would be extremely jeopardised by current US federal policy regarding trans people, as well as people who speak out politically on social media.</p><p>The Trump administration went out of their way to make it clear that they do not want transgender travellers from overseas, whether for tourism or business. I am a US taxpayer - a partner in a business headquartered in the United States - but as I understand it, the current orders for border checkpoints are that any instance where the sex marker on somebody's passport does not match their birth certificate should be considered an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/visa-ban-transgender-athletes?fbclid=IwY2xjawI9ODlleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHSIsmgQfKh-T1MkZTfMxbrtoh-_uotmeg_czy9DBITQ3bhme5wPzt14Xqw_aem_s9VqVkxSycCrNGodHdzveA&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>instance of fraud</u></a>.</p><p>There are all kinds of jeopardy that could put me in when travelling for GDC, including potentially a ban from entering the country again in the future. Likewise the administration have indicated that they require people to submit their social media for scrutiny, tacitly for expressing sentiments in opposition to the US government's policies, which of course I have, quite openly and reasonably. Naturally the denial of entry on the basis of free expression is in my view clearly unconstitutional, as well as highly irregular when we look at the status quo of transatlantic relations over the last century.</p><p>Whether they would in fact follow through on these threats against me on the basis of immutable facts about my identity, as well as my political expression, remains something of an open question. However, the presence and force of the threats themselves make it impossible to justify taking a trip which is in itself already economically difficult to justify.</p><p><strong>Harold</strong>: It's both. As mentioned, having renounced my US citizenship, it's impossible to know if that would suddenly be an issue with some random customs agent. With<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/jasmine-mooney-ice-detainee-canada-mexico-border-work-visa-1.7501758?ref=aftermath.site"><u> multiple</u></a><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/canadians-ice-detention-politics-1.7589414?ref=aftermath.site"><u> instances</u></a> of Canadians not just being denied entry to the US, but getting jailed by DHS without even the thinnest facsimile of due process, the rest is absolutely not worth it. But beyond the peril of getting disappeared into an ICE concentration camp, the grotesque and bellicose conduct of the current administration not just toward Canada but now also Denmark/Greenland is beyond tolerating in any form. I'm just one person, there ain't that much I can do, but refusing to engage with American entities as much as possible is within my power. And my heart breaks for all the Americans I know who are just as disgusted and enraged by what they're seeing and having to endure. But yeah, I ain't crossing the 49th parallel as long as this persists, that's for damn sure.</p><p><strong>Will Overgard</strong>: It’s not just what's taking place right now. What else will be going down in a couple months’ time? There is no small chance that San Francisco could see a surge in ICE raids the same week we all fly out and at that point it doesn't matter if you have your passport on you or not, if you get stopped it could be all over. I'm not trying to be a fear-monger here, it’s just how insanely volatile the situation is.</p><p><strong>Chantal Ryan</strong>: While I encourage everyone to take a stand against any sort of fiscal support toward the US, my decision is primarily based on personal safety. I’m a person of colour and have been detained by US immigration before on the grounds of racial profiling (I’m half-Indian, they assumed I was Middle Eastern). I’ve also been publicly outspoken against Trump’s fascism for over a decade now, and given the fact US immigration is searching social media for Trump criticism, I don’t want to travel 30+ hours to be turned around upon entry to the US, or worse. And even if I make it in, the idea that I might be stopped on the street, attacked, abducted because of the colour of my skin… well, the list goes on. We skipped our family US Christmas (my husband is American) because the risk seemed too big. This stuff is very real for some of us.</p><p><strong>Zane</strong>: Personal concern is the main issue. Candidly, I am a white male who has hispanic grandparents, so I do not necessarily look white. Every time I've been to the States in the past year, I've had some kind of discriminatory encounter, including from airport staff and law enforcement. I do not feel safe in the country, and that's doubly so with everything happening with ICE.</p><blockquote>...holy hell, I ain't going to the US any time soon.</blockquote><p><strong>Luke Plunkett:&nbsp; GDC has faced increasing criticism in recent years on stuff like cost, even before the current administration was sworn in. Do you see a way forward for GDC now that global politics are also playing a part in keeping international visitors away? Or would it be best if alternatives, like a different show in a different city, country or even continent, were explored?</strong></p><p><strong>Vee Pendergast</strong>: The reality is the US has become increasingly hostile to foreign nationals regardless of origin, so as a regular leader of a trade cohort, my suggestion is that the only viable pathway forward is to move the conference outside of the US if they care about international visitors. Previously, we have had Māori developers (the Indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand) stopped and aggressively questioned as to whether they are Mexican because they are "brown people" at US passport control despite NZ passports and names that are obviously not Hispanic, they're Māori in origin. This is completely unacceptable for any nation seeking inbound trade on a number of levels and speaks to a level of racism inherent in the system. For context, nearly 20% of NZ's population is Māori or Pasifika, and our cohort reflects that so it would inevitably happen again, with potentially worse outcomes than an unpleasant experience as it seems the US' rules change on an arbitrary and near-daily basis.</p><p><strong>Mathew Kumar</strong>: I love GDC. I've covered GDC as a writer, attended as a speaker, worked <em>with</em> GDC; it has always been one of my absolute favourite events on the calendar, the only one I made the most effort to attend. And I also know there are plenty of people at GDC who are doing their absolute best to make the event still amazing, even with the rebrand (which, to be honest, I don't really grasp), but I do think GDC is in a really precarious position, because a lot of the value of the show was just hanging out and meeting people, and if people aren't going to be there, what's the point?&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, let's face facts: San Franscisco fuckin' sucks (Oakland is cool though). Every hotel rips your arse off during the GDC window. Is hanging out in a park really worth it considering you're not going to want to go anywhere else? In a different political climate, I'd probably say just move it to Vegas like DICE, because there's a billion hotels there and it's not like the city is any worse.</p><p>But it's a bit like E3. Is there still room for a single event that draws <em>everyone</em> now, with the industry spread across the world, talks easy to do online, and (frankly) all the big money having moved on? I'm not sure, and maybe it's just nostalgia talking, I wish there would be. I think other international events, MIGS for example, don't and can't have quite the same draw (plus it's in Montreal in November), but it's still possible GDC is diminished to a kind of an event for the US-based industry only.</p><p>That said, I think the existential crisis that's facing GDC is one that's facing the Western video game industry in general. It seems like it's becoming unfeasible to sustain a US-equivalent salary for video game development now. So it's not like purely a political climate issue. It's also an issue of the economy and the industry.</p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: All of the above. It's everything,&nbsp; there's no divide for me anymore. US fascism affects me on a personal level; hell, it should affect everyone.</p><p><strong>Paul Dean</strong>: First, it sure has faced increased and repeated criticism and I’m not sure it’s really needed to address any of that, because it seems like it’s been able to continue doing business as usual. I don’t think any previous criticisms have had GDC feel compelled to significantly change anything, and I think the reality is that the current political situation may not, either.</p><p>Yes, I think GDC better acknowledging the current situation (or even any of the things I mentioned above) would be a start, for sure, but I also don’t think they necessarily need to, certainly not as long as enough people inside the US continue to attend. I don’t know what the full demographic breakdown of attendees is, but my experience of being at GDC was that of mostly meeting Americans, with a smattering of people from the rest of the world, which has also been my experience at PAX or GenCon or just about any other US expo/show since I first began attending events in the early 2010s. I’m not entirely sure what the impact of fewer international attendees or exhibitors will really be, and I think the decision internally may well be something like “Will we lose more money from dwindling international attendees, or will we lose more money if we make accommodations or relocate?” Many shows will address these things when or if they feel financially impacted.</p><p>Second, I think global politics was playing a part before even Trump’s first term. US immigration and the Department of Homeland Security has harboured all sorts of problems and biases for years, we’re just seeing an escalation of that these days and, unfortunately, these things tend to hit the news more once they increasingly affect middle-class white people. Or corporate profits.</p><p>So yes, I think it would be great to have alternative events that are global draws hosted elsewhere, but I also think this has been something we’ve needed for a long time now.</p><p><strong>Cassandra</strong>: GDC has always been inaccessible. We were only economically able to attend previously as a wholly independent self-published studio because of our IGF nominations (which included some event tickets) and a fundraiser. Our win at the IGF helped cover some of the costs retroactively, but that obviously can't be relied upon. The IGF themselves have made some positive changes, including (I believe?) a stipend for all nominees, and a more equitable cash prize structure. However, this does not add up to making GDC itself a more accessible event in general.</p><p>The token stipend Informa offers for speakers doesn't cover travel nor accommodation, let alone both. It is also questionable whether it's a breach of the terms of the visa waiver (ESTA) to receive that payment as an individual whilst in the country.</p><p>The only way we could consider attending the event itself is by getting complimentary tickets via the IGF, or if our publisher covers that cost for us, which would still be a substantial outlay to add to our recoup.</p><p>Self-published international studios are essentially out of luck in most cases if they wish to attend off their own back.</p><p>We need more regional events, but equally, there are and have always been problems with the way that networking and knowledge-sharing is centralized at conferences like GDC, and the vault which is gated behind ticket prices.</p><p>Informa have become the de facto custodians of the collected knowledge of this industry, at least for one hemisphere. To me, the control of that information is perhaps the more egregious issue which warrants a more equitable access solution in the medium-term, whereas attending the conference itself may be becoming less and less desirable and useful over time. The decreasing prominence of GDC may be a positive thing for the health of the industry in the long-term.</p><p><strong>Harold</strong>: It's really unclear what GDC this year is even going to be like with its... "pivot" or "reimaging" or whatever to be a "festival of games." It might be that even with a more sane US administration, GDC still would be changing in a way that lost some of its identity.</p><p>It's unfortunate because having a single event that was <em>the </em>industry-facing gathering (in contrast to something like Gamescom which obviously has an industry angle but is also very much a E3-of-years-past-esque audience-facing promotional event) was such a magnet for having so many people in the same place at the same time. It's really hard to imagine anything just fully replacing that. And a handful of inevitably smaller events in other countries almost by the definition won't create the "Wow, <em>everyone</em> really is here" feeling GDC had.</p><p>All of this remains incredibly rough, because I still remember what a sense of pride and accomplishment I felt the first time I spoke at GDC. It felt like I'd done something worth sharing with peers I respected tremendously and had moved the ball forward, just a little bit, in one aspect of games as a creative form. And being nominated for (and even winning a couple) of Game Developers Choice Awards remains an extremely profound and meaningful moment of recognition, that we'd made something that really resonated and touched people. The idea of that not really being possible any more, not in the same way at least, is certainly a bit of a bummer.</p><p>But also yeah, holy hell, I ain't going to the US any time soon.</p><p><strong>Will Overgard</strong>: I don't see those people running GDC ever moving it, so it feels like fantasy to speculate. As the US games industry craters and the situation in the US gets worse, GDC's response has been to make it a big VIP deal and try to nickel and dime everyone else.&nbsp;</p><p>What really scares me is that there is one group with enough cash to supplant GDC with their own event and it’s the Saudi PIF (or to be more accurate, Savvy Games Group), but that's another topic.</p><p>Could GDC be moved to Canada? Sure, that would be the smart play but it won’t happen. They've painted themselves into a corner with the location and whatever deal they have with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscone_Center?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Moscone</u></a>, so that's really it.</p><p><strong>Chantal Ryan</strong>: I honestly don’t think GDC has much life left in the contemporary climate. For years it’s already been receiving criticism for the eye-watering cost of attendance in what has become one of the most expensive cities in the world, despite the city being relatively unsafe and unscenic—and that’s prior to Trump’s regime. I’ve had an All Access pass both years I attended and never bothered to go into the convention area itself — most people are there for the people, and the people can easily travel elsewhere.</p><p>In normal times, I would have advocated for GDC being held in a different, more cost-effective state. Today, given how difficult visa acquisition is on top of the danger of being sent home upon arrival or being accosted or kidnapped on the street by ICE scum, I think a self-declared international industry conference has no place being held on US soil. The safety of attendees needs to be paramount, and industry professionals from all countries should have the right to equal opportunity, which means not disbarring them from attendance due to racist visa restrictions.</p><p><strong>Zane</strong>: I think it'll be harder for GDC given the political environment and the event's operational changes. Gamescom and smaller events (like Pocket Gamer Connects London) are much safer ways to network and do deals these days.</p><hr><p>In addition to those above, I also spoke briefly with a few other developers. One, an international employee at a Japanese company, said that, with previous customs encounters having already been an issue trying to enter the United States, this year--after attending the last few GDCs--they were staying at home. "I was born and raised in a not-so-safe part of the world, so being this fearful of the streets in the US is weird", they told me.</p><p>Indie developer and advisor Rami Ismail, meanwhile, says, "Unless you're white, and fit the racist, sexist, and supremacist ideal of Trump's US - or can pass as such–you already have reasons to be rejected. Even if you are 'perfectly' Trump-approved, you are at risk of being the next news story of a foreigner being rejected or detained at the border."</p><p>Ismail--who<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/31/muslim-video-game-developer-us-trump?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>has been raising issues with travelling to the US for almost a decade now</u></a>--posted on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417543649065861123/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>his Linkedin page last week</u></a> that his advice for any prospective international visitor to GDC was to "Cancel. Genuinely. Cancel", before adding for anyone who insisted despite this some travel tips like "do not speak a single word to law enforcement outside of requesting your lawyer", and to "know your embassy or consulate details by heart", because you have to "assume your phone might be taken".</p><p>This story isn't a comprehensive survey of the thousands of international workers potentially affected by the United States' authoritarian turn; we won't get even a rough idea how many regular attendees opted not to show up until after GDC 2026 is over and the ticket sales can be counted. But as someone personally affected by this (as an Australian, I've had to skip Aftermath functions in New York because of border concerns), I didn't want to collect numbers, I wanted to hear people's thoughts and concerns.</p><p>Each one is telling a different side of the same story: Much of the games industry, much like the rest of the world, has spent decades centred around the United States of America, its people and its politics. To see that centre of gravity spun off its axis in a matter of months has been shocking, an upheaval few could have expected, and it's impacting games workers the same as it's hitting families, governments and companies the world over.</p><p>The world as GDC once knew it in 1988, when the show first began as the Computer Game Developers Conference and the video game industry revolved in large part around America, is gone. In 2026 the USA is not a safe nor welcoming place for international visitors, particularly marginalized ones, and so for these former attendees, neither is GDC.</p>

<p>We thought we'd see the same from Sony's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show 26</a>, which has <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-reveal-aaron-judge/">been confirmed</a> for a <strong>17th March 2026</strong> release alongside the reveal of cover star Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees, who is returning to front for the second time.</p>
<p>But Sony Interactive Entertainment's next entry is opting to stay on the Switch 1 and isn't coming to the Switch 2 right now. Of course, it may be that developer San Diego Studio doesn't have access to Switch 2 dev kits, but it's a rather strange decision from the outside.</p>
<p>As usual, a gameplay reveal will follow next week on <strong>3rd February</strong>, where you'll likely get a small glimpse at Switch gameplay. We're not holding our breath for any improvements, so <em>maybe</em> a Switch 2 port is coming later in the year.</p>

<p>Besides that, pre-orders for the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions — the latter of which will grant Early Access, allowing you to play the game from13th March (unlikely on Switch, of course) — open after the gameplay reveal on 3rd February at <strong>12 pm EST/ 9 am PST</strong> at certain retailers, digital storefronts, and on the game's <a href="http://theshow.com/">official website</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-big-shake-up-just-dance-price-increase-fans-screwed-2000663578</link>
            <guid>1417969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, Ubisoft announced it was canceling numerous games and laying off more employees as part of a brutal restructuring of the entire company. It turns out even Ubisoft’s super successful <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-four-years-a-just-dance-streamer-hits-the-breaki-1828839468"><em>Just Dance</em></a> franchise isn’t immune to the company squeezing everything it can for more money, as Ubisoft has confirmed price increases are coming for the dancing series.</p> <p>On January 27, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3MdXqG1y9GD3DvMr1Sf8OD?">Ubisoft announced</a> that its Just Dance+ streaming service, which allows people to pay a monthly or yearly fee to access a large catalog of new, old, and exclusive songs, is getting a price hike in April.</p> <p>One month of Just Dance+ will soon cost $5. Previously, it was $4. Three months of the service is going up in price from $10 to $13. And finally, a full year of Just Dance+ will increase from $25 to $30.</p>

 <h2>Why Just Dance+ is getting a price increase this April</h2> <p>In a press release announcing the price changes, Ubisoft claimed costly song licensing agreements were behind the increase in subscription fees.</p> <p><span><span lang="EN-GB">“Just Dance+ is built around music, and that comes with some important truths,” said Ubisoft. “Every song available in the service relies on licensing agreements that evolve over time, and these conditions directly affect what we can keep, renew, or add to the catalogue. Taking this into account, we’ve had to make a few adjustments to ensure the service can keep growing in the long run.”</span></span></p>

 <p>As for Ubisoft’s massive restructure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">some employees aren’t convinced it will bring about the positive change the company needs</a>. Ubisoft has done <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">this sort of thing before,</a> but the shake-up of two years ago has failed to turn the company’s fortunes around. It’s lost the overwhelming majority of its value in the past eight years and is now relying on a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">$1.25 billion bailout from Tencent</a> to keep the lights on. With that in mind, it makes sense that Just Dance+ is getting a price bump. Ubisoft leadership is looking around for any place to save some cash or squeeze out some more money. If people want their songs, they’ll be paying a bit more this spring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, the nation witnessed federal officers wrestle a man to the ground and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/heres-what-to-know-about-federal-agents-killing-of-alex-pretti-in-south-minneapolis/601570797">shoot him roughly 10 times</a> on a busy street in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The shocking killing, which came just weeks after President Trump threatened the state with a “day of reckoning and retribution,” has sparked a growing backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, including from the voice of PlayStation’s Spider-Man.</p> <p>“We must speak out against injustice,” actor Yuri Lowenthal said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yurilowenthal/reel/DT7AxWNDGHd/">a recent Instagram video</a>. “I know that this is not new for large swathes of the American people but every day that we stay silent, it makes it easier for them to shoot us in the streets and round us up and genocide entire people. We must speak out and we have to take care of each other. I implore you, if you are an American citizen, call your senators every day next week and tell them ‘no more money for ICE.’ We will not stand for it.”</p>   <p>Lowenthal has played Peter Parker in each of Insomniac Games’ <em>Spider-Man</em> releases, and is seemingly set to return for an eventual, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-3-has-plenty-of-ways-to-bring-back-venom-1850976956">unannounced <em>Spider-Man 3</em></a>, plans for which <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">leaked back in 2023</a>. His plea to fans and fellow Americans comes as the death of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/868567/alex-pretti-minneapolis-childhood-friend?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IktWYlQ1a1F1ZUUiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGljeS84Njg1NjcvYWxleC1wcmV0dGktbWlubmVhcG9saXMtY2hpbGRob29kLWZyaWVuZCIsImV4cCI6MTc2OTk2NDA1NSwiaWF0IjoxNzY5NTMyMDU1fQ.FrZ0NlULSpVamKAg761dJTzxcH4-LkVYlrvVVZb2ZFc&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">37-year-old Alex Pretti</a> at the hands of masked agents has put pressure on lawmakers to block an increase in funding for ICE. Judicial scrutiny of ICE’s actions in the state has culminated in the acting head being summoned to appear in court this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/27/ice-director-judge-minnesota">or risk being held in contempt</a>.</p>

 <p>“The more we stay silent to try and shore up a failing illusion of normalcy, the more we trade pieces of our soul and the easier we make it for them to shoot us in the street,” Lowenthal wrote on Instagram. “Call your reps every day this week. Tell them how furious you are, how scared you are, and that they must speak out against what’s happening. The simple message they need to hear is ‘no more money for ICE’.”</p> <p>ICE, which didn’t exist until 2002, was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/21/nx-s1-5674887/ice-budget-funding-congress-trump">recently awarded a $75 billion funding increase</a> on top of its existing annual budget of $10 billion. Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino wrote over the weekend that the real victims in Pretti’s killing <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015535669175541906">were the agents</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[US Congress Members Want FTC To Review EA Sale To Saudi Arabia]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/us-congress-members-want-ftc-to-review-ea-sale-to-saudi-arabia/</link>
            <guid>1417942</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over three dozen United States (US) lawmakers want the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to dive deeper into the pending sale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Arts</a> (EA).</p>



<p>In a press release recently shared online, the leaders of the Labor Caucus along with over 40 members of US Congress are asking FTC chair Andrew Ferguson to take another look at the sale. In the letter, the Labor Caucus chairs say they have “serious concerns” regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sale of EA to the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund</a> (PIF). </p>







<p><strong>“We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction,”</strong> <a href="https://laborcaucus.house.gov/media/press-releases/labor-caucus-calls-for-review-of-electronic-arts-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the letter reads</a>. </p>



<p><strong>“Workers in the video game industry are already navigating an environment marked by instability, shrinking opportunities, and repeated rounds of layoffs. EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States, and evidence suggests the company already wields significant wage-setting power.”</strong></p>











<h2 id="h-congress-worried-ea-sale-could-lead-to-more-layoffs">Congress Worried EA Sale Could Lead To More Layoffs</h2>



<p>The lawmakers add that with the deal including $20 billion in debt being added to EA after the sale, the new owners would be incentivized to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-employees-publicly-oppose-sale-saudi-arabia-equity-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hold more layoffs</a> in order to recoup money. They also express worry that more offshoring, restructuring, and studio closures could come after the closing of the deal.</p>



<p><strong>“These actions would not only jeopardize thousands of high-skilled American jobs, but also further concentrate already fragile labor<br>markets for software engineers, artists, writers, testers, and other professionals whose skills are essential to the industry,”</strong> they said.</p>



<p>The Labor Caucus chairs say that FTC’s 2023 merger guidelines explicitly state that any mergers that harm workers or allow firms to reduce labor demand “may violate antitrust laws”. Due to the size of the deal—$55 billion—the group feels that extra scrutiny is essential to protecting the rights of American workers that are involved. </p>



<p>They are asking the FTC to <strong>“conduct a thorough investigation into the labor market consequences of this proposed acquisition, including EA’s existing wage-setting power, the likelihood of post-transaction layoffs, the degree of labor-market concentration in relevant geographic and occupational markets, and the role of cross-ownership in shaping labor outcomes.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<p><strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> isn't ready to release its next mainline entry into <strong>The Witcher </strong>series just yet, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-will-not-appear-at-the-game-awards-2025/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong> was absent from recent shows like <strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">won't arrive until "<em>at least</em>" <strong>2027</strong> according to CDPR</a>. That said, we are getting a new Witcher game much sooner than next year, with <strong>Reigns: The Witcher</strong>, a new "<em>swipe'em up</em>" game from developer <strong>Nerial</strong> and publisher <strong>Devolver Digital</strong>, arriving on PC and mobile devices on <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Reigns: The Witcher takes you back through Geralt's adventures, though not exactly in the same way they played out in the original story. Instead, all of his adventures are told through the bard, Dandelion. You'll swipe left or right at different points in the adventure to steer the story one way or another, before the tale ends with Geralt faced with an untimely demise, in one way or another.</p>



<p>At the end of every run, Dandelion adds to his log of tales to be told on stage, increasing your ability to string together a truly gripping story, even if it's one that doesn't exactly stay true to how you remember it happening originally.</p>

<p>This is the sixth entry in Nerial's Reigns series, which will officially be a full decade old this coming August 2026. After the initial <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/?curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns </a></strong>title and its <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/717640/Reigns_Her_Majesty/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Her Majesty</a></strong> follow-up, Nerial immediately started applying the formula to other franchises, to great success, with Reigns games based on <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/897820/Reigns_Game_of_Thrones/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Game of Thrones</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437040/Reigns_Three_Kingdoms/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Three Kingdoms</a></strong>. The studio also has a sci-fi variant called <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663400/Reigns_Beyond/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Reigns: Beyond</a></strong>, which was the most recent release before the upcoming The Witcher variant.</p>



<p>Nerial is also the same studio behind one of 2022's more intriguing indie games, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371720/Card_Shark/?snr=1_1056_4_18_curator-tabs&amp;curator_clanid=39063225">Card Shark</a></strong>, which turned plenty of heads with its striking visual style and deceitful gameplay.</p>



<p>Even though we'll have to wait until 2027 for The Witcher 4, hopefully, this spin-off Reigns title isn't the last we hear about The Witcher in 2026, and we'll have an official word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/">on the rumoured <strong>The Witcher 3 DLC</strong> </a>that is said to arrive sometime this year.</p>

Maisy the Cow? We're less sure about that last one.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here, Geralt's quests are retold as plays by Dandelion, who holds the hero's fate in his hands. Whether sticking to the facts or stretching the truth, you'll need to keep Geralt's infamy in balance to ensure your run continues for as long as possible. And while your adventures with Geralt are likely to end in many deaths, each run will reward you with songbooks to perform on ever grander stages in the hope of ultimately reaching narrative immortality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reigns: The Witcher is developed by Reigns series developer Nerial, and set for launch on February 25 for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651600/Reigns_The_Witcher/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and on mobile via Google Play and the iPhone App Store. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of Reigns: The Witcher this spring feels well-timed, amid a temporary lull in the launch of CD Projekt's bestselling series.

It's a mixture of cinematics and gameplay. Check it out above. And if you know anything about this universe, you probably won't be surprised that the Orks are literally driven by mayhem and sporting a reckless, no-nonsense offensive playstyle. What you may not have been expecting is the scale of the carnage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In particular, we get a great look at the Ork superunit, the Gorkanaut, which can crumple up dreadnoughts and go toe-to-toe with the likes of an Imperial Knight. Towering over the battlefield at a scale that sets Dawn of War apart from its predecessors, the number of guns on this thing could be described as both bewildering and hilarious. And that's just what the Orks are about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 has been our IGN First "cover story" all January long.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868711/spry-fox-netflix-game-studio-indie-spirit-crossing</link>
            <guid>1417882</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23433526/netflix-spry-fox-cozy-gaming-studio-acquisition">Netflix first acquired cozy game developer Spry Fox in 2022</a>, it made a lot of sense. The studio had been around for over a decade and had several hits with mobile games like <em>Triple Town</em> and <em>Alphabear.</em> That approachable style of puzzle game seemed like a good fit for Netflix’s mobile-first strategy, and, as Spry Fox cofounder David Edery tells me, the partnership also meant that the team could focus on making the experiences they wanted to build without having to worry about monetization. “We just never were that good at making money from our games,” Edery explains.</p><p>Now, three years later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837632/another-change-for-netflixs-games">Spry Fox is once again independent</a> after buying itself out from Netflix. The news comes as the streaming service’s fledgling gaming efforts are shifting, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/820289/netflix-casual-party-game-multiplayer-tetris-pictionary">a focus on TV-based games</a> as opposed to mobile titles. Even studios behind successful games, like <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/806303/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-entertainment-studio-shut-down">have been shuttered</a> as part of the changes. But for Spry Fox, the decision to separate from Netflix was done for a different reason: to reach as large an audience as possible with the studio’s upcoming MMO <a href="https://playspiritcrossing.com/"><em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>.</p><p>“At some point, I increasingly became concerned about the fact that being a Netflix member-only game was a real issue for it,” Edery explains. “It’s a highly social game. People want to be able to play with their friends. If their friends are not Netflix members, that’s kind of a problem.”</p><p><em>Spirit Crossing</em> is a large-scale multiplayer game about fostering friendship and community in a fantastical and adorable world. It’s the biggest experience the studio has ever made, but also feels like a natural progression; after achieving success with those early mobile titles, Spry Fox pushed further into the so-called “cozy” genre with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352488/cozy-grove-review-apple-arcade-switch-ps4-xbox-steam">the <em>Animal Crossing</em>-style series <em>Cozy Grove</em></a>. While those games are single-player, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> aims to do something similar but in a virtual world filled with lots of players. The goal is ambitious. “We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world,” says Edery. “That’s the sum total of everything that we care about.”</p><p>Development on <em>Spirit Crossing</em> predates the Netflix deal, and in fact represents something of a brief history of indie game funding over the last few years. The game’s initial prototype began life as an exclusive for Google’s Stadia streaming service. After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond">Stadia’s high-profile implosion</a>, Spry Fox retained ownership of the project, and eventually <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicgames.com%2Fsite%2Fen-US%2Fnews%2Fepic-games-announces-publishing-partnerships-with-eyes-out-and-spry-fox" rel="sponsored">Epic picked up the game</a> as part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside">its relatively new publishing initiative</a>.</p><div><p>“We genuinely believe this is our chance to reduce loneliness in the world.”</p></div><p>“That was great because they were very supportive and they gave us a big budget,” Edery says of working with Epic. “And then the Netflix thing kind of came out of nowhere. I wasn’t looking to be acquired at the time, and I certainly didn’t think it would be Netflix of all companies, but they came by and it seemed like a good idea for a few different reasons.”</p><div><p>From the outside, Netflix’s efforts in gaming have seemed chaotic. The company has tried everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645952/black-mirror-game-thronglets-season-7-netflix">games based on its shows</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">building a AAA studio</a> without much success. Last year at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview">Netflix’s president of games, Alain Tascan, outlined a new plan</a> focused on specific types of games, including what he called “mainstream” titles aimed at large audiences, of which <em>Spirit Crossing</em> was shown as an example. Of late, however, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845965/netflix-fifa-soccer-football-game-tv-delphi-interactive-world-cup">Netflix seems mostly focused on cloud-based games played on TVs instead of phones</a>.</p></div><p>Despite all of that, Edery says the team at Spry Fox wasn’t impacted much by Netflix’s changing priorities. “We were essentially brought in to make and launch <em>Spirit Crossing</em>,” he says. “We just kept doing what we were doing, so I think we were less affected by changes than maybe other folks internally would have been. We had a pretty clear vision and, for better or worse, we weren’t going to be steered off of that.”</p><p>Edery says that at each stage, from Stadia to Netflix, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> grew in scope and ambition. And eventually it became clear that a game built around connecting as many people as possible didn’t fit so snugly in Netflix’s plans, which limit the platforms a game can launch on. Edery notes that <em>Cozy Grove</em>, for example, was most successful on the Nintendo Switch, where cozy games are very popular. “Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation, possibly a really problematic limitation,” he says of <em>Spirit Crossing</em>.</p><div><p>“Not being able to be on the Switch is a real limitation”</p></div><p>So the split from Netflix was done in the best interest of the game; while a Switch version has yet to be announced, <em>Spirit Crossing</em> will be coming to PC in addition to the iPhone and Android. And there’s still a partnership with Netflix in place, as the mobile version will still be free and exclusive to subscribers. “It still has to make sense for Netflix,” Edery notes. But there are obvious risks involved in going independent, and already the team is making sacrifices. <a href="https://spryfox.com/a-16-year-old-baby-is-born-miracles-do-happen/">Edery says that he and fellow cofounder Daniel Cook have reduced their salaries to $20,000 a year</a>.</p><p>The majority of development on <em>Spirit Crossing</em> was finished during the three years Spry Fox was under the Netflix umbrella, and the team expects to launch the game this year. (<a href="https://playspiritcrossing.com/">You can currently sign up to play an alpha of the game</a>.) Even before <em>Spirit Crossing</em> launches, Spry Fox’s long journey back to independence represents a rare positive story in an industry plagued with layoffs, cancellations, and studio closures. But there’s one big thing the team still has left to do, and it’s not something Edery is looking forward to: “We have to figure out how to make money now.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868711/spry-fox-netflix-game-studio-indie-spirit-crossing]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Anime AI Closed Captioning Situation Is Crazy]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/anime-ai-subtitles-closed-captioning-no-gun-no-life/</link>
            <guid>1417870</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Closed captioning</u></a> has been around since the 70s with the express purpose of creating subtitles as a “transcription or translation of the dialogue when sound is available but not understood” by the viewer, whether sound is muted, drowned out by ambient noise, or the user is deaf or hard of hearing. Closed captions by and large are all but essential in today’s media landscape, either because actors whisper or a show’s dynamic range is screwy. A lot of people watch TV with subtitles these days, including English-speaking anime fans. Unfortunately for those anime fans, the closed captioning for Crunchyroll shows over the past couple of years has severely declined in quality, and it looks like it's going to become an even bigger problem for how we watch anime industry-wide.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/crunchyroll-fails-to-meet-industry-standards-for-closed-captioning/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Crunchyroll fails to meet industry standards for Closed Captioning - Anime Feminist</p><p>Despite having a near-complete monopoly on the anime streaming industry in 2024, Crunchyroll does not offer closed captioning for the majority of its English dubs.</p><p><span>Vrai Kaiser</span></p></div></a></figure><p>These issues were first brought to light by <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/crunchyroll-fails-to-meet-industry-standards-for-closed-captioning/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anime Feminist back in 2024</u></a>, where writer Vrai Kaiser wrote that in the wake of Crunchyroll’s huge merger with Funimation for <a href="https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/sony-pictures-tv-funimation-acquisition-1202511492/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$143 million</u></a>, the anime streamer didn’t meet the industry standard for closed captioning with its English-dubbed shows. In the piece, Kaiser noted that outside of a few Toonami shows like <em>Attack on Titan</em> and <em>My Hero Academia</em>, most shows don’t have closed captioning. It was an issue Funimation remedied back in the day to ensure all of its English-dubbed shows had closed captioning options in accordance with the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (<a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/closed-captioning-video-programming-delivered-using-internet-protocol-ip?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CCVAA</u></a>), but that change didn’t carry over when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-workshopping-solution-for-funimation-users-lost-digital-libraries?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Crunchyroll merged Funimation’s library</u></a> into its own in 2022—a merger that led to fan outrage over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crunchyroll-president-responds-to-concerns-over-lost-digital-copies-due-to-funimation-merger?ref=aftermath.site"><u>losing digital anime content they once owned on Funimation</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Kaiser reported that as of February 2024, a Crunchyroll spokesperson said it was still working to add more closed captions to its catalog.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-DX0Zolr6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Absolute State of Crunchyroll"></iframe></figure><p>At worst, Crunchyroll’s subtitling creates the annoying scenario where you’re given two options: English and English CC. The first option translates Japanese text written within the show, where things like text messages, signage, and the like are translated in concert with dialogue—something that’s especially helpful for readers who are either curious or need to know <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwOvgfpI7Xo&amp;pp=ygUTY3VsbGluZyBnYW1lcyBydWxlcw%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>all the fucking rules in <em>Jujutsu Kaisen Culling Game Part 1</em></u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter, in theory, provides viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing with captions that convey information about background noise and speaker changes within a show. But more often than not, Crunchyroll’s closed captioning, alongside its subtitling as of late, has become a far cry from what the company used to offer. This is a result of the popularity of anime rising exponentially. Crunchyroll as a company has an insatiable need to beef up the quantity of its shows in its streaming catalogue without giving a damn about the quality of its localizations. While Crunchyroll has claimed it doesn’t use AI for its subtitles or closed captions, the kinds of errors being made in these captions have made viewers suspicious. Especially, because, well, they have been caught red handed before.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:g3lhmk72xsmti52dckfnclef/app.bsky.feed.post/3lswcbtkwec2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigmeoi7mwfovh7r6w2jhbygbly4kiyxeextt4qyupnfcsybrth4qq"><p lang="en">Beyond disappointed to find Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show's subs on @crunchyroll.com are blatantly and openly ChatGPT.

This is not acceptable. How can we be expected to pay for a service that clearly doesn't care about the quality of its products?</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:g3lhmk72xsmti52dckfnclef?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Brain Pixeld (@pixeldoesthings.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:g3lhmk72xsmti52dckfnclef/post/3lswcbtkwec2t?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-07-01T18:10:35.620Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Crunchyroll’s first AI incident saw users catch the German subtitles for the show <em>Necronomico and the Cosmic Horror Show</em> with the words <a href="https://aftermath.site/chatgpt-crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-necronomicon/"><u>ChatGPT explicitly written in its subtitling</u></a>. Speaking with Aftermath, a spokesperson provided a statement saying the “AI-generated subtitles were employed by a third-party vendor, which is in violation of our agreement.” After that, the show’s German subtitles no longer include the ChatGPT prefix, according to <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-07-01/crunchyroll-german-necronomico-and-the-cosmic-horror-show-subtitles-listed-chatgpt/.226206?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anime News Network.</u></a> However, that hasn’t stopped the anime from having a bit of a tarnished reputation as the “AI” show online in the wake of its subtitling incident.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crunchyroll's episode 6 dub release of The Banished Court Magician was  late, probably due to some internal issues. When it finally went up, the  primary JP-EN subtitle track had been accidentally replaced with a dub  closed caption track revealing Ollang in the file headers. <a href="https://t.co/sNpp1a5QeG?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/sNpp1a5QeG</a></p>— Daiz (@Daiz42) <a href="https://twitter.com/Daiz42/status/1993599878925046112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The second time was last November, in a report from <a href="https://animecorner.me/crunchyroll-appears-to-use-ai-generated-closed-captioning-in-fall-2025-anime-the-banished-court-magician-aims-to-become-the-strongest/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anime Corner</u></a>, where former Fakku developer <a href="https://x.com/Daiz42/status/1993599878925046112?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Daiz</a> posted on Twitter that Crunchyroll appeared to have used AI in the closed captioning for the sixth episode of the show, <em>The Banished Court Magician Aims to Become the Strongest</em>. Upon further digging from Daiz, they discovered that the episode’s screwy closed captions were because Crunchyroll was working with <a href="https://ollang.com/?lng=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ollang</u></a>, a San Francisco-based company that, you guessed it, touts its usage of AI to get the job done using buzzy corpo speak like “optional human-in-the-loop” and “localization, reimagined for the modern enterprise.”&nbsp;</p><p>Mind you, Crunchyroll president Rahul Purini told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robsalkowitz/2025/04/08/inside-crunchyrolls-latest-plans-to-expand-the-anime-universe/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Forbes</u></a> last April, “We are not considering AI in the creative process, including our voice actors. We consider them to be creators because they are contributing to the story and plot with their voice.”&nbsp;</p><p>Forbes also noted that Purini added that they are, however, looking at AI to improve back-end systems and enhance the customer experience through features such as discoverability, recommendations, and personalization, rather than touching the shows themselves.</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Crunchyroll/Madhouse)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The most recent example came from the folks in the Highlight Reel Discord <strong>(Correction, 1/27/26, 3:47pm--</strong>This story initially misstated which Discord the example was from). In the third episode of <em>No Gun No Life</em>, an anime about a detective with a gun for a head, eagle-eyed viewers pointed out some really weird closed captions. In this scene, two characters approach the gun-headed detective, with one of them saying, “So you’re Juzo, the Resolver?” However, with the English closed captioning on for the show, the pair instead approach him saying, “So your Jews are resolver?” A slip-up, sure. But given that Crunchyroll has been caught using AI for its captions before, it has set a precedent for fans to believe any mistranslation in their closed captioning <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-goonswarm-fortnite-postal/"><u>must be due to AI</u></a>. Aftermath reached out to Crunchyroll for comment about its closed captioning and whether AI is involved in the process.</p><p>There have been instances where bullying has convinced companies like Amazon to reverse its AI initiatives, such as abysmal <a href="https://aftermath.site/prime-video-ai-beta-english-dub-anime-banana-fish-no-game-no-life/"><u>AI dubbing</u></a>. But companies tend to follow the leader, and one of Crunchyroll’s major competitors in the anime market, Netflix, has had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-is-now-using-ai-for-subtitle-localization-custom-ads-and-more?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter"><u>no qualms about publicly stating that they will use AI in subtitles</u></a>. </p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Getting a New Ban System, But Players Don’t Think It’s Tough Enough]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/</link>
            <guid>1417837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders underwent a major update today as Embark Studios delivered Headwinds, the first of <strong>four </strong>content drops coming between now and April. It introduced seven new quests, a minor map condition, two new Augments, and some other bits and pieces. The team at Embark also revealed that, very soon, a new anti-cheat <strong>ban system </strong>will be implemented to combat malicious players.</p>



<p>In a footnote in the patch notes for the recent ARC Raiders update, the team explained that a permaban is the result of a cheating spree, but players don’t think getting to that point is happening <strong>fast enough </strong>for it to be effective.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-need-tougher-anti-cheat">Does ARC Raiders Need Tougher Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>Over the festive period, ARC Raiders players were suffering under the weight of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploits, cheaters</a>, and a bit of content stagnation brought on by everyone at Embark Studios going off on a well-deserved break.</p>



<p>Now that they’re back, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-four-months-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive roadmap</a> has been revealed, detailing content up to April 2026.</p>



<p>Today, the first part of that roadmap, an update dubbed ‘Headwinds’, was delivered. It introduced some fresh content, a map condition that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fills Buried City with birds</a>, and seven short new quests for players to conquer. It effectively opens up some of the game’s lore, too.</p>



<p>However, one element in the recent patch notes hasn’t filled players with the joy that the positive notes have.</p>



<p>Almost at the end <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of the update</a>, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A three strikes progressive ban system is in the process of being implemented. Bans will progress from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Those who tussled with these more malicious players in recent weeks feel that the ban loop isn’t strong enough for anyone <strong>caught cheating</strong>. The item was subtitled ‘Anti-Cheat’, but it reads like this is a <strong>general </strong>approach to banning players caught breaking the rules, and not <em>just </em>cheaters.</p>



<p>In any case, a cheater being banned for just 30 days feels like little more than a slap on the wrist. The second infraction earns them a 60-day penalty, but it takes <strong>three offences </strong>for them to receive a permanent ban. That’s three times that somebody could be caught <strong>using cheats to manipulate the game </strong>before Embark Studios says, ‘Enough.’</p>



<p>Other extraction shooters, like Escape from Tarkov, issue permanent bans upon <strong>a single detection </strong>of cheating, and they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly reveal which users</a> have been kicked from the game. Sure, they might make a new account and come back, but the strong-arm approach is there at the initial stage.</p>







<p>Do you think ARC Raiders needs tougher anti-cheat, and that Embark Studios is risking displeasing the majority of its userbase? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
