            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> was blessed with several excellent animated trailers, each one produced by French animation studio Bobbypills. Now the slick metroidvania is getting a full animated television series from the same folks, and the first trailer is below.

<p>It's in French, but you can turn on English subtitles. Also, the animation style is different from the trailers.

<p>I think I approve of everything about this. I like that it's not treating the subject matter overly seriosuly - because who really cares about Dead Cells lore when the game is mostly about the wonderful feeling of rolling, dashing, and exploding enemies. I like that it's a comedy. I like that several of the gags in the trailer above are derived from the animation itself. (I'd guess many Dead Cells fans will not agree with me.)
</p>
<p>The Dead Cells animated series is due to release on June 19th on ADN (France). That's the <a href="https://animationdigitalnetwork.fr/">Animation Digital Network</a>, an online streaming service. An English version is due later in the year - but it's fine, you can watch it with subtitles, don't be afraid.

<p>Dead Cells recently received <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-to-receive-its-final-update-as-devs-move-on-to-new-secret-projects">its final update and DLC</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-escape-from-tarkov-full-of-cheaters-%E2%80%93-answered.874800/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-full-of-cheaters-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When you have an immensely popular first-person shooter—a genre known to draw cheaters—you’ll find that many of your rounds include a hacker or two. The more popular the game, the more money flowing behind the scenes to facilitate cheating. Unfortunately, Escape From Tarkov cheaters prove to be some of the most prevalent and dug-in bunch. Is the extraction shooter full of cheaters today?</p>



<h2 id="h-are-escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-in-every-lobby">Are Escape From Tarkov Cheaters in Every Lobby?</h2>



<p>I wouldn’t say every single lobby in Escape From Tarkov includes cheaters. Is it possible? Yeah, if you listen to the community on Reddit. Does the game have a cheater problem? Absolutely!</p>



<p>There are too many Escape From Tarkov cheaters to count, and despite Battlestate Games reportedly banning tens of thousands of them, it seems like there are more each day. How and why? We’ll dive into that more shortly. For now, however, know that Escape From Tarkov has a problem with hackers plaguing the game.</p>



<p>They use all manner of hacks commonplace in competitive first-person shooters, including wallhacks, aimbots, and speedhacks. But in Tarkov, where loot reigns supreme, you’ll find many with a vacuum-like cheat that sucks up the loot from every container in the map, then deposits it in front of the cheater. They may then pick and choose what they want while utterly untouchable. </p>



<p>How can the average player compete with hackers? You have a few options. You can report them to BSG and hope they take action, try to avoid a known cheater, and consider playing single-player. BSG themselves recently launched the PvE mode, but there’s a fantastic single-player Escape From Tarkov mod, known as SPT, that genuinely instills me with excitement to play once more!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-do-escape-from-tarkov-cheaters-keep-coming-back">How Do Escape From Tarkov Cheaters Keep Coming Back?</h2>



<p>The amount of money flowing from the cheating scene proves rather tremendous on all fronts. You have cheat creators actively seeking workarounds to any anti-cheat software in their favorite games. In this case, EFT. Then, you have the cheaters themselves. They buy the cheats, use them for days or weeks before they receive a game ban, and sell the loot they receive, or even the account, for real money. Using that money, they turn around and buy another key for EFT on the cheap from a gray market website or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-buy-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly from BSG during a sale</a> and continue the process.</p>

<p data-characters="396" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Along with increasing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-magic-the-gathering-sets-in-2024-mtg-2024-release-schedule-and-sets-explained/">frequency of their <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> (MTG) releases</a> over the years, Wizards of the Coast have also begun to provide consistent updates to their <strong>Banned</strong> and <strong>Restricted</strong> card lists for each format. In a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/december-4-2023-banned-and-restricted-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2023 update</a> by Wizards designer Dan Musser, he confirmed that banned and restricted announcements will now be made within two to five weeks after the release of a set. </p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Whether you’re playing <strong>Commander</strong> at your Local Games Store (LGS) or preparing a decklist for a <strong>Modern</strong> Challenge tournament, it’s essential that you’re up to date on what cards are legal in your format of choice.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-the-difference-between-banned-and-restricted-cards" data-injectable="false">The Difference between Banned and Restricted cards</h2> <h3 id="h-banned-cards" data-injectable="false">Banned Cards</h3> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">Banned cards in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> are exactly what they sound like. These cards can’t be used in your deck or sideboard, otherwise your deck would be considered illegal to play. You’ll be expected to play with a legal deck even in casual settings unless you’ve discussed it with your playgroup or players at your LGS.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-restricted-cards" data-injectable="false">Restricted Cards</h3> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Restricted lists are currently only used in the <strong>Vintage</strong> and <strong>Timeless</strong> formats. If a card is on the restricted list, only a single copy can be included within a deck and sideboard. This keeps the most powerful cards from being used over and over again, making it much more important for players to time their casts wisely.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-why-does-wizards-of-the-coast-ban-or-restrict-cards" data-injectable="false">Why does Wizards of the Coast ban or restrict cards?</h2> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">In many competitive games, balance changes are necessary in order to sustain a healthy gameplay environment; <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is no exception. But with over 30,000+ cards and counting, reprinting cards with minor changes isn’t feasible. And let’s face it, no player wants to take a Sharpie to their foils and adjust the power or toughness of their creatures.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="782" data-injectable="true">MTG’s solution is simple: Ban or restrict the cards that are disrupting the play environment or simply take the fun out of games. This policy has worked well for decades and isn’t likely to change anytime soon. Due to MTG’s rapid growth, some cards have managed to become unbanned due to the release of more forms of counterplay, effectively making previously overpowered cards reasonable for play.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="172" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Having a large library of game adaptations can be considered one of the biggest testaments to a franchise’s success. In this regard, only a few can rival <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/one-piece/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a>. </p> <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">But surprisingly, for the flagship of the Shonen demographic, the games based on the series can vary from sleeping hits to entries even die-hard fans struggle to love. Here are all <em>One Piece </em>games, ranked.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">All One Piece Games, Ranked From Worst to Best</h2> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">To be fair in our rankings, we decided to only focus on games that made it to the West officially with an English localization. We also won’t be including crossovers such as <em>J-Stars Victory Vs</em>+ and <em>Jump Force</em>.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">24. One Piece Grand Cruise</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 (PlayStation VR)</li> <li>Released on: 2018</li> </ul> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Grand Cruise</em> is a VR title that<em> </em>allows you to interact with and assist the Straw Hats in two scenarios. But although both will involve battles, you won’t be able to jump into the fray directly. Instead, you will be in charge of operating a canon to face either a Kraken or stop a Marine attack. A short experience that offers very little, <em>Grand Cruise </em>feels like a missed opportunity. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">23. <mark>One Piece: Run, Chopper, Run!</mark></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bandai Namco Entertainment YouTube. </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Released for mobile devices</li> <li>Released on: 2015</li> </ul> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece: Run, Chopper, Run! </em>was a 2.5D endless running game that put fans in the role of everyone’s favorite cotton candy-loving reindeer. The game also allowed players to equip multiple costumes. Once equipped, each costume offered a new ability to Chopper. Unfortunately, the game was not successful, and its service ended in 2016. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">22. <mark>One Piece Bon! Bon!

Bon! Journey!!</em> was a puzzle gacha game. In it, players were tasked with assembling combinations of at least three matching bonbons within rows. Doing that would then allow your characters to perform attacks and damage enemies. The game was a success upon its release, but <em>Bon! Bon! Journey!! </em>was discontinued two years later. </p>
 <h3 id="h-21-one-piece-grand-battle-ps1" data-injectable="false">21. One Piece: Grand Battle!

As the first in the series, the game features impressive visuals for its time and follows the <em>Super Smash Bros</em> format. Nostalgia aside, the title did not age well and offers a pretty basic experience by today’s standards. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">20. One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP / SP2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Images via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo 3DS</li> <li>Released on: 2011 (SP) / 2012 (SP2)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="881" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Unlimited Cruise SP</em> and<em> SP2</em> are localizations released after the debut of <em>SP’s</em> Japanese version. Each game features half of the title’s story, as well as some exclusive features. Among them, we have the Marineford Episodes. The mode adapts the arc it’s named after and brings many of its protagonists as playable characters. Unfortunately, that is overshadowed by how both <em>SP</em> and <em>SP2 </em>feature considerable downgrades when compared to the original <em>Unlimited Cruise</em> episodes. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">19. <mark>One Piece: Thousand Storm</mark></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via DeNA</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Released for mobile devices</li> <li>Released on: 2016</li> </ul> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">A gacha action RPG, <em>One Piece Treasure Cruise</em> won the hearts of many through its simplistic gameplay and F2P-friendly approach. The latter is seen in how the game did not have a character-pulling system. Instead, players could pull for Cards, which could then be equipped to characters to provide buffs or skills.&nbsp;<em>Treasure Cruise</em> was discontinued in January 2024.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">18. One Piece: Grand Battle!</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Platforms: PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube</li> <li>Released on: 2005 / Released in Japan as <em>One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush</em></li> </ul> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece: Grand Battle!</em> is the western version of <em>One Piece: Grand Battle! Rush</em>. Unlike the latter, however, the game only adapts the events up to the first portion of Alabasta. The title also shifts from the platform style present in previous entries in favor of an arena fighter approach. <em>Grand Battle! </em>was the first title in the series to debut in North America and features 16 playable characters. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">17. One Piece Gigant Battle</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo DS </li> <li>Released on: 2010 (Japan) / 2011 (Europe)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="814" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Gigant Battle</em> is a platform fighting game whose combat heavily resembles that of the <em>Super Smash Bros </em>series. The game also plays very similarly to <em>Jump</em> <em>Super</em> and <em>Ultimate Stars</em>. Here, you can take any characters from its roster of 20 to the field and join up to 4v4 battles. You can also use dozens of supports to get the upper hand. The title was the only game in the <em>Gigant Battle</em> series to be released outside of Japan. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">16. One Piece: Romance Dawn </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo 3DS (also PSP in Japan)</li> <li>Released on: 2012 (PSP) / 2014 (3DS)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">A turn-based RPG,<em> One Pìece: Romance Dawn</em> allows you to follow Luffy from the beginning of the <em>OP</em> story to the heartbreaking end of the Marineford Arc. The title features solid combat mechanics, but it’s hurt by its map designs and lack of side content. Nonetheless, <em>One Piece: Romance Dawn</em> offers a unique experience sure to at least entertain fans. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">15. One Piece: Pirates’ Carnival</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS2 and GameCube</li> <li>Released on: 2005 (Japan) / 2006 (United States)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">Any successful manga/anime is guaranteed to receive a minigame-centric title at one point. In <em>One Piece’s</em> case, that’s <em>Pirates’ Carnival</em>. The game allows up to 4 players to participate in 40+ minigames. All of which can be played either as standalone experiences or as part of its Board Game mode. A casual experience that follows the formula made famous by the <em>Mario Party</em> franchise, <em>One Piece: Pirates’ Carnival</em> brings a niche but fun experience to all. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">14. One Piece: Grand Adventure</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS2 and GameCube</li> <li>Released on: 2006</li> </ul> <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="822" data-injectable="true">A direct sequel to <em>Grand Battle!</em>, <em>One Piece: Grand Adventure</em> was released exclusively in North America and Europe. Apart from its versus mode, the game allows you to take part in mini-games and tournaments and dive into a story mode (known as Grand Adventure). Although the latter is geared toward younger audiences. <em>Grand Adventure</em> also deserves a special mention for featuring characters like Zeff within its 24-playable characters roster. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">13. One Piece: Unlimited Adventure</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Gamestop</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo Wii</li> <li>Released on: 2007 (Japan) / 2008 (North America)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">An open-world action RPG featuring an original storyline and set after the events of Enies Lobby. <em>One Piece: Unlimited Adventure </em>follows the Star Hats after they come into contact with a glowing orb. The game brings a good degree of exploration to players. Being able to play as all Straw Hats is also a plus.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Apart from the above, <em>Unlimited Adventure </em>also relies heavily on crafting and building. Both of which would become staples for the series. For fans of fighting games, you can also take control of more than 40 characters in up to 7v7 versus battles here. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">12. One Piece World Seeker</h3> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC</li> <li>Release Year: 2019</li> </ul> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false"><em>One Piece: World Seeker</em> is an action RPG that puts players in the control of Luffy after he finds himself in Jail Island. This time, the plot takes place after Dressrosa but before the Zou arc. Players can also play as Law, Sabo, and Zoro through Extra Episode DLCs. </p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">Like the <em>Unlimited</em> series, <em>World Seeker</em> allows you to fully explore its open world map and features a simple combat system. You can also use multiple traversal abilities to cover ground fast and add more flair to exploration. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">11. One Piece: Unlimited Cruise</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Images via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Nintendo Wii</li> <li>Release Year: 2008 (Japan) / 2009 (Europe)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="816" data-injectable="true">The second game in the <em>Unlimited </em>series, <em>One Piece: Unlimited Cruise,</em> features a non-canon story that takes place after the Thriller Bark arc. The action RPG was released as two episodes and features many of the mechanics present in its predecessor. All while also benefiting from some quality-of-life upgrades. Like <em>in Adventure</em>, the game allows you to take part in an open-world single-player mode, as well as face friends in Versus. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">10. <mark>One Piece Bounty Rush</mark></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Mobile devices</li> <li>Released on: 2018</li> </ul> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Bounty Rush </em>is a gacha real-time action game that overcame its troubled launch to become a fan favorite. The game features many modes, with its most well-known being its PVP 4v4. In it, you are tasked with capturing treasures on the battlefield and then guarding their areas from your opponents. A feat you can accomplish by performing explosive combos and characteristic attacks. <em>Bounty Rush</em> also boasts a roster of more than 250 characters going from East Blue to Egghead.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">9. One Piece Pirate Warriors (PS3)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS3</li> <li>Release Year: 2012</li> </ul> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="830" data-injectable="true"><em>Pirate Warriors </em>is the title responsible for starting what many believe to be the greatest <em>One Piece</em> game series of all time. Developed by Omega Force, the game features the musou style made famous by the developer’s <em>Destiny Warriors</em> franchise. On it, you can take a multitude of characters and battle against hordes of hundreds. This was a match made in heaven, as <em>One Piece’s</em> larger-than-life attacks were a perfect fit for the genre. </p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Except for Skypea and Thriller Bark, players can experience all of the arcs up to Return to Sabaody in <em>Pirate Warriors</em>. Its small roster, however, might cause it to become repetitive relatively fast.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">8.

The game also features another original non-canonical story, this time situated between Punk Hazard and Dressrosa. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true">Overall, the core of the <em>Unlimited</em> experience remains almost the same here. Although <em>Unlimited World Red </em>shakes things up by focusing way more on combat. The latter of which is still as straightforward as it was in the Wii installments. The franchise’s building and crafting mechanics are also taken to another level. Now, you can upgrade a whole town. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">7. One Piece (GBA)</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames, assembled by Destructoid </figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Game Boy Advance</li> <li>Release Year: 2005</li> </ul> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="775" data-injectable="true">Sometimes less is more. An action platformer developed by Dimps and released exclusively in North America,<em> One Piece </em>allows players to follow through the events of the East Blue saga. Featuring a solid but simple beat ’em-up combat and well-made sprites, this game is a blast. Honestly, the only downsides here are its length and how you cannot battle with any Straw Hat apart from Luffy. </p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">6. One Piece Pirate Warriors 2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MobyGames</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: PS3 and PSVita</li> <li>Release Year: 2013</li> </ul> <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="950" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Pirate Warriors</em> 2 further polishes the combat system featured in the original game while also increasing its roster to 37 characters. The former is not an understatement, as the game feels faster, more consistent, and way more responsive. The title also removed QTEs and the divisive platform sections players came to hate in <em>Pirate Warriors</em>. On the other hand, <em>Pirate Warriors</em> 2’s most debatable point lies in its main story, where you don’t play through the series’ arcs. Instead, the game features an alternative What If original scenario.</p>

One Piece Treasure Cruise</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li>Available on: Mobile</li> <li>Release Year: 2014</li> </ul> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece Treasure Cruise </em>is a gacha turn-based RPG that allows you to revisit the whole story of the franchise. The title also allows you to take more than 200 characters to the field in various modes. Most of the characters must be pulled in true gacha fashion.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">The game’s biggest differential, however, lies in its combo mechanic.&nbsp;When in battle, the mechanic will allow you to perform sequential attacks by&nbsp;tapping.<em>&nbsp;</em>You can also find a deep team-building system here. This can be seen in how players, more often than not, need to completely rework their teams based on the opposition. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">4.

The game won the hearts of fans by featuring a straightforward but still entertaining combat system. Here, understanding how to efficiently counter your opponent will be key. Another huge highlight lies in its roster. The version released for the PS4, Xbox One, and PC offers 44 playable characters and 50 supports. That helps make up for the fact that <em>Burning Blood</em> features an extremely compact main story (covering only the Marineford Arc).</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">3.

Differently from the latter, however, the game’s story mode covers the canon of the series until the Dressrosa Arc. As the arc was still ongoing when the game was released, <em>PW3</em> features an original non-canonical ending for it. </p>
 <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false">There are very few things not to love here, as the added mechanics —such as the Kizuna Rush and Overdrive— made the game as fun as it can be. Its 46-character-long roster also helped. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">2. One Piece Pirate Warriors 4</h3> <figure data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>

You can find some wild names here, such as Big Mom, Kaido, and Gear 5 Luffy —the latter available via a DLC. The game also made significant changes to combat. Among the tweaks, the biggest one lies in how players can now perform aerial combos. </p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><em>Pirate Warriors 4</em> also features a bulky story mode. In it, you can go through the Alabasta, Enies Lobby, Marineford, New World, Whole Cake, and Wano arcs. Like <em>PW3 </em>with Dressrosa, the game features a unique non-canon story for Wano. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">1.

The game brings players a true-to-form RPG experience that takes place between the Whole Cake and Wano arcs. Among its highlights, we have a huge amount of explorable areas and activities. That is then paired with a fine-tuned turn-based combat system. You can also control all the first nine Straw Hats while exploring and in battle.</p>
 <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false"><em>Odyssey</em> also set itself apart for the quality of its original storyline. The latter of which segments the title as the best <em>One Piece </em>game released in the West to date. </p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-call-of-duty-campaign-ranked">Call Of Duty</a> will arrive on Game Pass on day one, according to anonymous sources. Microsoft's strategy has long involved releasing all their first-party games on Game Pass, but there had been doubt over whether the same would be true of the first Call Of Duty to be released since Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of publishers Activision.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-call-of-duty-game-pass-53e8930c">the Wall Street Journal</a> (paywalled), who cite "people familiar with the matter", the plans are due to be announced at the Xbox showcase next month. A Microsoft spokeswoman declined the WSJ's request for comment.
</p>
<p>Call Of Duty remains a top seller every year, and even the critically-derided Modern Warfare 3 was the second best-selling game of last year in America. Not bad considering it was released on November 10th.
</p>
<p>There's plenty of evidence to suggest that releasing a first-party game on Game Pass reduces the number of people willing to cough up the premium fee, and so there had been doubt that Microsoft would risk slaughtering the golden goose by putting Call Of Duty on their subscription service. 
</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not surprised. Microsoft's entire Xbox strategy is based around Game Pass, and buying Activision Blizzard seems like a clear effort to get Game Pass subscription numbers growing again after years of stagnation. Microsoft only get the benefits of their investment if Call Of Duty joins Game Pass, just as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-is-coming-to-game-pass-on-march-28th">Diablo 4 did earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>Those stagnant Game Pass numbers have also been blamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-xbox-studio-cuts-likely-to-follow-tango-and-arkane-austin-and-game-pass-looks-like-the-culprit">for the recent closure of the beloved Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks</a>, two studios Microsoft picked up in their earlier acquisition of publisher Bethesda.
</p>
<p>Microsoft's Xbox Showcase will take place on June 9th, amid the week of game announcements formerly known as E3.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/adult-friendships-can-be-tough-babes-gets-it.874782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159206/babes-movie-ilana-glazer-michelle-buteau-adult-friendships<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="HE2lBB">In one of the first scenes of the new comedy <em>Babes</em>, free-spirited Eden (Ilana Glazer) gets down on her knees to peer at her best friend’s vagina. Pragmatic Dawn (Michelle Buteau) is going into labor, and Eden is trying to gauge how far along she is, to figure out whether they can continue to eat brunch, or they need to get Dawn to a hospital right away. It’s immediately clear that director Pamela Adlon is not holding back when it comes to the grosser details of pregnancy and childbirth, and using them to full comedic potential. </p>
<p id="GaKOaW">That scene also speaks to what the movie actually is: an honest look at the strain adulthood puts on friendships, especially as life tugs individuals along separate journeys. Eden and Dawn’s relationship feels authentic — their bathroom-routine updates, their full conversation where all they say is “Bitch!” in different tones, Eden immediately volunteering to buy Dawn sushi for her first post-birth meal. It made me nod along and think <em>Ha ha, I’m like that with my best friends</em>.</p>
<p id="lqUgY5">That also means that during their arguments with each other, I thought <em>Oh no, I feel like that, too. </em>I’ve never gotten mad because my friend showed my child <em>The Omen</em>, as Eden does with one of Dawn’s kids, prompting him to write demonic symbols all over his bedroom wall and scare off the new nanny. But I do get frustrated when weekend plans with my friends don’t align, because one of us has a standing commitment that the other just doesn’t understand. Adlon keeps Dawn and Eden’s frustrations grounded (albeit with some hilarious, over-the-top inciting incidents), so they never escalate to the point of destroying their friendship. That just makes their grievances resonate even more. </p>

<p id="Qb6ZJ3">Eden and Dawn have been best friends since they were kids. Though Dawn is a married mother of two and Eden is single and living her best noncommittal life, they still make time for each other, even if that means Eden has a four-train journey across New York City if she wants to meet Dawn for their annual Thanksgiving tradition of watching a movie in a theater. </p>
<p id="DUy5L9">When Eden ends up pregnant from a one-night stand, she decides to keep the baby, much to everyone’s surprise. Dawn promises to support her. But Dawn has her own life to juggle, with her family, work, and marriage, and she can’t always be there when Eden needs her. And Eden admittedly needs her constantly for appointments and other pregnancy-related things, since she doesn’t have a lot of other meaningful relationships in her life, particularly not with other parents. The tension unearths buried frustrations; Eden doesn’t admit it at first, but she feels abandoned and betrayed that Dawn and her husband moved to Manhattan, away from where she and Dawn grew up in Astoria, Queens. </p>
<p id="TZ3ZPE">As someone who recently moved to a different borough from most of her friends, I felt that struggle so deeply. Instead of walking 10 minutes to meet up, now my friends and I need to find a middle point, or else commute via a stupid number of trains. (Seriously, why doesn’t the M train connect Queens and Brooklyn?!) I’m happy with my move; it was the right decision for me and my partner. Likewise, Dawn moved because living in a nice brownstone that could fit her entire family was the right choice for them. </p>

<p id="MPDHn4">But eventually, Eden confesses that she’s sad Dawn never considered her feelings when making the move. That moment made me confront a fact I’d been trying to ignore: I didn’t consider how far away I’d be from my closest friends when I moved, either, and I didn’t consider the toll it would take on my relationships. I insisted that overall, the move made sense because it’s what me and my partner wanted. Societally, we tend to accept that people will consult their spouses, immediate family, and their jobs when moving, and no one else. But with <em>Babes</em>, Adlon comes right out and says it: best friends get totally shafted in adulthood. </p>
<p id="iA3cV5">Sitcoms like<em> Friends</em> or <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> have a very rose-colored view of how friendship works for people in their 20s and 30s, in which people’s lives revolve around a tight-knit group of friends who somehow all have free schedules and live in the same neighborhood. But actual adulthood is busy! And you sometimes need to take four trains on a holiday weekend to get to a convenient meeting place. Your priorities start to shift, and they may not align with your friends’ priorities.</p>
<p id="ENq658">It’s a slow strain, but maybe one friend is starting a family, so they can’t afford New York City rent anymore; maybe another joined a club and their weekends are full of commitments; maybe another insists on staying in Bushwick, despite living in a tiny apartment (it’s rent-stabilized, though!) and outgrowing the hip nightlife scene. Those frequent weekend hangouts become more and more sparse, a fact you try to ignore because you love your friends so much, but one that eventually does alter your relationship. </p>

<p id="vzEzr2">Unlike in <em>Bridesmaids</em>, where tension escalates to a huge relationship-ending fight, Adlon take in <em>Babes</em> is that, most of the time, fighting with a best friend doesn’t mean totally cutting them out of your life. Even when Dawn and Eden argue — and their personal frustrations do escalate into pretty big blowouts — they never stop being friends or talking to each other. Usually, when friends fight in movies, it involves a big, dramatic declaration that the friendship is over, sometimes accompanied by an angsty life-without-each-other montage to really solidify that they aren’t talking. But in <em>Babes</em>, even after some arguments, Dawn and Eden still hang out, and are still friends. </p>
<p id="hfcNUK"><em>Babes</em>’ view of adulthood friendships isn’t idyllic, but it also isn’t overblown drama, in a way that’s easy to dismiss as heightened, unreal movie fiction. Having a fight with a friend that only sort of gets patched up as you continue to be in each other’s lives feels much more real, especially when that argument is built on beautifully realized tension, where neither side is <em>wrong</em> exactly, but neither of them are right, either. At its core, <em>Babes</em> is a love story between Eden and Dawn, two best friends who struggle to keep their friendship strong as adulthood threatens to pull them apart. Never once does Adlon lead us to doubt that these women mean a lot to each other.</p>
<p id="GcwMUf">It’s telling that this movie never veers into finding a romance for Eden as a way to fix her relationship with Dawn. Dawn is married and her husband is incredibly supportive, but Eden doesn’t magically find a similar partner who shows her the importance of family, or who reframes her friendship with Dawn as a secondary consideration. A lesser movie might have Eden realize that her new baby and possible new beau are her priorities now, and tell Dawn that she finally understands where Dawn is coming from. Instead, Adlon declares that friendships are just as important as family.</p>
<p id="E2OQ0b">Society constantly prioritizes romantic relationships and the nuclear family over friendships, which we see over and over again in media. So to see a movie celebrate the importance of adult friendship, and have both friends reach a new, realistic understanding of how their relationship has evolved — but not disintegrated — is immensely satisfying. It’s an important perspective on friendship — one that often gets overlooked in a youth-focused cultural landscape, but that speaks to something a lot of us have experienced in some form, or will eventually experience, sooner than we might like. </p>

</header>  <div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">Redfall</a> is getting a final update which will add an offline mode and singleplayer pausing, among other changes. The news was announced via the Redfall account on X, which also thanked players for their "supportive messages" in light of developer Arkane Austin's imminent closure by Microsoft.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Thank you for all your supportive messages," begins <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040">the message on X</a>. "We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. 
</p>
<p>"We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all."
</p>
<p>It was reported <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-redfall-offline-mode-was-imminent-before-microsoft-shut-down-arkane-austin-according-to-report">last week that Arkane Austin had been working on an offline mode</a> when news of their closure came down. There was also planned DLC in the works. At the time it was assumed that the closure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced earlier the same week</a>, meant the updates would never see the light of day. Thankfully that's not the case - although the DLC is still no longer coming, and there's still no confirmation of <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/?linkId=100000260400360#en/answer/65606">what compensation 'DLC pass' owners will receive for its absence</a>.
</p>
<p>Redfall launched a little over a year ago to severe criticism - including in our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">Redfall review</a> - and poor sales. Much of the criticism focused on its barren-feeling world, poor AI, and lack of stability, issues which have been somewhat addressed via updates released so far. An offline mode would also have moved it one step closer to the kind of singleplayer experience Arkane Austin are best known for, although no amount of retrofitting was ever going to turn it into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remembering-prey-arkane-austins-masterpiece">the wonderful Prey</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-10-best-board-games-to-play-with-kids.874767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/board-games-to-play-with-kids/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=board-games-to-play-with-kids<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="351" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Board Games will always be a mainstay of family entertainment. They offer not only bonding time, but learning experiences and a lot of laughter. For younger children, they may not always have the longest attention spans, so playing long winded, strategy-based games is pretty much out of the question, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t options.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">Whatever the age of the kid you’re trying to play with, there’s a board game suitable for them. As a parent, I feel qualified to discuss some of our favorite choices, the ones that get pulled out of their dedicated cupboard more often, and why we love them. The suggested ages here are all the ‘official’ ones suggested by the game itself.</p> <h2 id="h-clue-junior-ages-5" data-injectable="false"><em>Clue Junior</em> (Ages 5+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Of course, the original, adult version of <em>Clue</em> is wildly inappropriate for children. Nobody wants to introduce their five-year-old to the concept of murder. However, the Junior version of<em> Clue</em> involves a much more child-friendly ‘whodunit’ – find out who ate the last slice of cake, when, and what they drank to wash it down.&nbsp;The main characters are still there, even if we’re missing out on the iconic murder weapons.</p>
 <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"><em>Clue Junior </em>promotes critical thinking, discovery, and discussion, so it’s perfect for a spot of family bonding. It’s even better if you decide to partake in a slice of cake as you play.</p> <h2 id="h-monopoly-junior-ages-5" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly Junior</em> (Ages 5+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">I debated whether or not any form of <em>Monopoly </em>should make an appearance on this list, due to my own memories of how competitive this game would become during family Christmas celebrations. However, there’s now a Junior version of the game that would have prevented many tantrums back in my day.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">In the Junior version of <em>Monopoly</em>, children have the chance to buy properties such as the Pet Store and the Video Game Arcade using only single dollar bills, to avoid too much math-based confusion. The biggest argument that will come out of <em>Monopoly Junior</em> will be ‘who gets to play as the Dinosaur?’</p>
 <h2 id="h-scrabble-regular-junior-ages-5" data-injectable="false"><em>Scrabble</em> (Regular &amp; Junior) (Ages 5+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Mattel</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="89" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">I’m not sure this one needs too much explanation, but I’ll give it a go anyway.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true"><em>Scrabble</em> is an amazing way of expanding a child’s vocabulary and helping them with their spelling. There’s no better way of inspiring a child’s desire to learn than doing it with them, and I have many fond memories of sitting with my Grandparents, a dictionary beside us, as we battled it out for domination of the <em>Scrabble</em> board.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">There’s also a Junior version of <em>Scrabble</em>, which aims to promote independent thinking by giving some half pre-made words for children to fill in the gaps. The board is cuter, too, with animals and other illustrations to inspire their love of words.</p> <h2 id="h-mouse-trap-ages-6" data-injectable="false"><em>Mouse Trap</em> (Ages 6+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">I never claimed that everything on this list would be a learning experience for the children in your life, and <em>Mouse Trap</em> might be the most fun of any of the games here. That said, it does help children to practise their construction and fine motor skills as they work to set up the board and, short of anything else, it might help them to gain some patience.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">That said, if your kids are anything like mine (or myself, as a youngster) they might get more fun out of <em>Mouse Trap</em> purely by setting it up and then watching everything fall apart to trap the mouse. Laughter is pretty much guaranteed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-candy-land-ages-3" data-injectable="false"><em>Candy Land</em> (Ages 3+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">A simple game of counting and racing, <em>Candy Land</em> is suitable for very young children and will help them to develop not only their counting skills, but also their ability to take turns, which is always welcome in the eyes of any parent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">In case you’re wondering, Sugar Rush, the arcade game that’s home to Vanellope lives in <em>Wreck It Ralph</em>, was very much inspired by <em>Candly Land</em>. The board game, too, involves characters such as King Kandy and locations such as Candy Cane Forest and Gumdrop Mountain. If your kids love <em>Wreck It Ralph</em>, this game might just blow their minds.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-chutes-and-ladders-ages-3" data-injectable="false"><em>Chutes and Ladders</em> (Ages 3+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">This one is pretty self explanatory and a staple of childhood worldwide (although known by different names, such as ‘<em>Snakes and Ladders</em>’ in the UK). It’s simple, you roll a dice and move that number of spaces. If you land on a Ladder, you go up. If you land on a Chute, you go down.</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">To this day, I’m not entirely sure what this teaches kids. Perhaps that, it’s okay to lose, sometimes, and things often happen that we can’t control, like falling down a Chute and ending up miles from where we were. That’s life, I suppose. Regardless, this one is a fun and quick game to play with the kids when they’re bored and feeling restless.</p>
 <h2 id="h-guess-who-ages-6" data-injectable="false"><em>Guess Who?</em> (Ages 6+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">At first glance, <em>Guess Who</em> might just seem like a fun game to get the kids focused and talking about something. However, <em>Guess Who</em> builds memory retention, helps very young children work on their vocabulary, and also helps them to build the skill of critical thinking.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">As a side note, there’s also many variants of this game which work on the same concept and you’re likely to find one for your childs favorite franchise – the Paw Patrol version is a favorite in my house. If your child is a fan of potty humor, there is a version called “<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boxer-Gifts-Guessing-Poop-Tastic-Christmas/dp/B08G8YPLWR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1MUEK3A74HVI2&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.o7WQqz-IbJJxrLL4cr7y3ZkfXK_Lnki-At57jhtX0AO2pies8YW7tOOn_20A4kagITqMrxOn0PGNDucwhbApOet_YYBFblSda3N0khSCObpH3F4Q1Bsza91yjqHRx5wzj3XxTOgkqravm37JiEXlLoKztNcyv6G1QSmfl99HONz9XjOkCMYXMD7IlDWyQoFOPOSgrTOhcB59PN5mhDp6aDhFsJ3jlPZiNfa4lHVqhkwvKvzzGNptI9-9vRLUnIF1-yyL0autMhxe_Vmz8vdGElFU8qbXdZjxEOC9sq3tVSY.AA7t1E-hvQyZmglT16CyDJJQ3DMNlpVFHd8iF2-NVeE&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=guess+poo&amp;qid=1715956077&amp;sprefix=guess+poo%2Caps%2C192&amp;sr=8-1">Guess Poo</a></em>” which I won’t try to describe, but I’m pretty sure you can figure out the aim of that game.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-jumanji-ages-5" data-injectable="false"><em>Jumanji</em> (Ages 5+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">Okay, so maybe this one isn’t the best for very young children and, if I may offer some sage advice, maybe don’t let them watch the movie before picking up the game to actually play. I probably wouldn’t disappear for too long during play either, lest the kids start to think you’ve been sucked into the jungle.</p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">However, with that said, <em>Jumanji</em> is excellent for teaching critical thinking as it involves cracking codes and also encourages children to take turns, as all good board games do. Perhaps the biggest draw of <em>Jumanji</em>, though, is the fact that it’s nostalgic for parents who were young when the movie was released in 1995.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-trouble-ages-5" data-injectable="false"><em>Trouble</em> (Ages 5+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">Any game that has a dice or multiple involved carries a certain amount of risk of losing said dice. That’s just a fact of life, especially when you’re playing with kids. However, <em>Trouble </em>removes this risk by enclosing the dice in a little dome in the middle and, as someone with a bag full of extra dice, that’s a solid selling point.</p>
 <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">I mean, it’s also good for helping kids perfect their counting skills, at least as far as six, instills what I would consider a healthy amount of competitiveness and the race to win is always sure to get kids excited.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Fun fact, <em>Trouble</em> is known as ‘<em>Frustration</em>’ in the UK and I can confirm that the name is appropriate.</p> <h2 id="h-operation-ages-6" data-injectable="false"><em>Operation</em> (Ages 6+)</h2> <figure data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false"><em>Operation</em> is an undeniable classic for children. It’s got jump scares, which never fail to elicit laughter, is a great way of helping little ones fine tune their motor skills and, of course, it’s simply fun. The design has been the same since I was a child, and I can’t see it changing any time soon.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="false">Any game with a jump scare element is sure to be beloved by kids. <em>Buckaroo</em> and <em>Pop-Up Pirate</em> are in the same vein and get honorable mentions, here.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next generation of consoles might be closer than we thought, at least for Xbox fans. Today, Call of Duty leaker TheGhostofHope <a href="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1791524663807328666?s=46&amp;t=FG7zD0B3Xfxq2JkN5xhL0Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relayed a rumor</a> from trusted sources that the next Xbox console might launch in late 2026, way earlier than most analysts and fans predicted, with Call of Duty as a launch day title.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is not the first time we have heard of a potential late 2026 launch for the console. YouTuber RedGamingTech <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generaton-xbox-zen-5-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported the rumor</a> in December 2023, adding that Microsoft could pick an AMD Ryzen Zen 5 CPU as the Zen 6 wouldn't be released in time. That report also suggested Microsoft would ditch the double SKU strategy used this generation with the Series S and X, going for a single SKU instead.</p>
<p>The goal would be to try replicating Microsoft's most successful Xbox generation so far, the Xbox 360, which launched a full year before Sony's PlayStation 3 and reaped the benefits of this strategy. As of 2014, the Xbox 360 sold 84 million units, whereas the original console only sold 24 million units, and the Xbox One stopped at around 58 million units. The Series S and X duo is currently at just over 27 million units.</p>
<p>Getting to the market ahead of its main competitor in the console market is a risky tactic, but it's also one of the few available to Microsoft as it is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lagging far behind in console sales</a>. Interestingly, Xbox president Sarah Bond recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Microsoft is focused on delivering the largest technical leap ever with the next-generation console.</p>
<p>To do that, Microsoft seems to be ditching the mid-generation refresh (unlike Sony, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/latest-ps5-pro-specs-are-real-says-insider-sony-still-targeting-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to launch the PS5 Pro later this year</a> with an announcement possibly due in the next few weeks) to focus everything on a powerful next-generation console to launch in late 2026. With Sony unlikely to be able to follow with its PlayStation 6 before 2027 or even 2028, Microsoft would then be able to cut the pricing to maintain competitiveness. A mid-generation refresh for the next Xbox would also be likely at some point to address the fact that the PS6 will inevitably be more powerful if it launches a year or two later.</p>
<p>NPU and AI will likely play pivotal roles in how Sarah Bond keeps her promise, though it's too early to discuss the specifics. Even if the late 2026 release window turns out to be correct, there's still two years and a half and a lot can change until then.</p>

If you’re looking for a fantastic film to tide you over until then, you’ve come to the right place, as we’ve once again dug into Netflix’s catalog to bring you the best sci-fi movies to stream on the platform this month.</p>
<p id="SUrqcE">We’ve got a brutal and hilarious cyberpunk revenge thriller starring Logan Marshall-Green (<em>Prometheus</em>) as a vengeful mechanic being controlled by a malevolent A.I., Ang Lee’s underappreciated Marvel movie, and a chilling sci-fi thriller about the horrors of suburbia and parenthood.</p>

<p id="KiYqJk"><strong>Director:</strong> Leigh Whannell<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Logan Marshall-Green, Betty Gabriel, Harrison Gilbertson</p>
<p id="kNkASa">Leigh Whannell’s cyberpunk action thriller feels like the type of movie destined for reappraisal and appreciation; a brutal, bare-knuckle tech nightmare about a borderline luddite whose body is hijacked by an amoral A.I. in a dystopian future. </p>
<p id="OfEomL">After witnessing the murder of his wife and suffering a near-fatal gunshot, Grey (Logan Marshall-Green) is seemingly given a second chance at life when he’s implanted with an experimental chip that allows him to walk again. Determined to hunt down his wife’s killers, Grey’s mission is complicated by the fact that the chip, known as STEM, isn’t just an ideal passenger, but a fully sentient entity that takes sadistic satisfaction in the pain of others. Whannell’s film is a fantastic, violent revenge drama that imagines a world where A.I. assistants are the devil on your shoulder, preying a person’s grief and anger to further their own inscrutable schemes. Come for the brutality, stay for the inventive cinematography and gorgeous production design. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="oouYx1"><strong>Director:</strong> Ang Lee<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott</p>
<p id="LWs7tO">Quickly following <em>Spider-Man</em>, <em>X-Men</em>, and<em> Blade II</em> as a part of the turn-of-the-century superhero movie boom, Ang Lee’s <em>Hulk </em>is largely left out of the conversation of the best of that era. But it deserves to be there as a highly-stylized comic book adaptation that doesn’t shy away from the visual influences of the source material.</p>
<p id="3IFFnZ">You know the Hulk story – Bruce David Banner is a mild-mannered scientist who is exposed to a lot of gamma radiation (this movie earns its spot this list as a far more sci-fi superhero story than most), and then you won’t like it when he gets angry. This time, Banner is Eric Bana, assisted by a game supporting cast including Sam Elliott, Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, and Josh Lucas.</p>
<p id="2GqBfL">While some of the CG hasn’t aged well, Ang Lee’s commitment to comic book visuals certainly has, standing out in a genre that has lost some of that visual luster. (This was his follow up to <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em>!) With split screens set up like comic book panels, edit transitions that look and feel like turning the page, and an appropriate combination of goofiness and epic stakes, Lee absolutely nailed it. A planned sequel was turned into the significantly less effective <em>The Incredible Hulk </em>starring Edward Norton, which in turn led to Mark Ruffalo being the Hulk in <em>The Avengers</em>. While there are certainly a few highlights from Ruffalo’s run as the character, Ang Lee’s <em>Hulk </em>will always be the pinnacle of Hulk silver screen goodness to me. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="AtmAUj"><strong>Director:</strong> Lorcan Finnegan<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg, Jonathan Aris</p>
<p id="WKsjwV">The sci-fi horror movie <em>Vivarium</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/27/21196861/vivarium-review-jesse-eisenberg-imogen-poots-jonathan-aris">lacks the sense of polish</a> or the sense of relatability that might land it among the sci-fi greats, but it sure doesn’t lack for unnerving chills. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star as a young couple trying to come to grips with the commitment of buying a house together. When they agree to tour an eerily homogenous new housing development, they fall into a surreal, nightmarish world that’s better experienced one beat at a time than described — but expect plenty of leaning on the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">creepy-kid arena of horror</a>.</p>
<p id="UyGPif">A little bit <em>Twilight Zone</em> and a little bit <em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>Vivarium </em>is one of those “the suburbs are hell” movies that push back against all the American stereotypes about 2.5-kids-and-a-dog domesticity as the ultimate in comfort and pleasure — but it pushes back with a shrill, violent edge that’s genuinely fascinating, unsettling, and likely to turn up in your dreams somewhere down the line. <em>—Tasha Robinson</em></p>

Between crappy AI replacing real humans and billionaires controlling more and more of the world, things seem a bit bleak, I’d say. So<em> Mullet Madjack</em>, a new retro-inspired, anime-themed, first-person shooter on PC, comes at a perfect time. It’s a fast-paced, action-packed game where you use guns, knives, kicks, and bombs to kill rich AI-powered robot billionaires who have turned humanity into a massive, ever-consuming audience. In other words, it’s catharsis in the form of a boomer shooter. Oh, and it’s also one of the best games I’ve played this year.  - Zack Zwiezen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4a974c1852fb69631ef26793a1e1ec85" data-recommend-id="image://4a974c1852fb69631ef26793a1e1ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Akuma stands in a cavern." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Akuma stands in a cavern." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4a974c1852fb69631ef26793a1e1ec85" data-recommend-id="image://4a974c1852fb69631ef26793a1e1ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Akuma stands in a cavern." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span><em> </em>was one of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-video-games-2023-baldurs-gate-3-cyberpunk-sf6-1851113163&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-games-2023-baldurs-gate-3-cyberpunk-sf6-1851113163">favorite games of last year</a></span>, and I’m so convinced I’ll get back to its sublime, best-in-its-class fighting that I still haven’t uninstalled it from my PS5 despite months away.

            <p>"There will be changes" to Xbox Game Pass once Microsoft adds its newly acquired flagship Call of Duty franchise to its subscription services.</p>
<p>That's according to industry insider shinobi602, who recently suggested that changes were coming in a thread on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot30-why-so-series-x-s.820296/post-123109182">Resetera</a>.</p>

<p>When poster biglo25 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot30-why-so-series-x-s.820296/post-123108978">posited</a> that Microsoft would "for sure" add a "new fee" and "reorganise the tiers to be [a] less confusing mess than it is now" – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">especially in light of plans to append this year's Call of Duty release to Game Pass</a> – Shinobi062 responded quickly to agree, saying: "There will be changes, yes".</p>
<p>Despite being pressed by other posters, though, shinobi602 wouldn't be drawn on what, exactly, the changes could be, but as Tom reported for us earlier this week, the key questions now are whether Xbox Game Pass remains at its current price point, or whether Call of Duty might only be included in a as yet unannounced pricier tier.</p>
<p>While Xbox has always brought new first-party games to Xbox Game Pass on day one, and Activision Blizzard is now a Microsoft first-party publisher following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">completion of its $68.7bn takeover</a>, there had still been a question mark over whether Call of Duty would be included.</p>
<p>This year's Call of Duty remains unannounced, though is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">widely expected to be a fresh Black Ops entry set in the early 1990s during the Gulf War</a>. Microsoft will detail more about the game next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">dedicating an entire hour to it following its main Xbox Showcase event on 9th June</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-%E2%80%93-season-3.874719/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-enters-fortnite-in-chapter-5-season-3/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1791499072789979575" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> an upcoming Fallout crossover with Fortnite in Chapter 5, Season 3. This is entirely unsurprising, as Epic has always tried to bring the hottest entertainment franchises across all media to Fortnite in an attempt to maintain interest in the game.</p>
<p>In a way, it is further confirmation - in case it was needed at all - that the massively acclaimed Fallout TV show (now <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewed</a> for a second season) helped propel Bethesda's post-apocalyptic franchise into the mainstream.</p>
<p>Fallout 4 shot to the very top of the sales charts in both the United States and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europe</a>, with Fallout 76 and Fallout New Vegas also surging back to the Top 10. On April 25, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-breaks-1-million-players-in-a-day-whole-franchise-nearly-hits-5-million-players-in-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that Fallout 76 had registered over a million players that day, while the franchise as a whole had nearly reached five million daily players.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, quite understandable that Epic would want to bring the franchise to Fortnite. However, there are no current official details or even rumors of what will be introduced to the game. Could it be a wearable Power Armor? Perhaps some Vault Boy/Girl emotes and skins?</p>
<p>We're left to speculate for now. At any rate, the Battle Pass for Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 will end on May 24. Fans expect the next Season to be released shortly after that date, and this is also when we'll know for sure what kind of Fallout crossover Epic has cooked.</p>

		<p>As the Formula 1 circus heads to Imola this weekend, there’s a mixture of excitement and sombre remembrance. Are Red Bull on the back foot again? Will Ferrari and Mercedes’ upgrade packages slingshot them to the front? And was McLaren’s win last time out a flash in the pan or can they keep fighting for the top step?</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s 30 years since the death of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger, and the shockwaves that were felt in 1994 are still felt in the sport to this day.</p>

            <p>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut is PlayStation's fourth-biggest launch on Steam in terms of concurrent players.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=24h">SteamDB</a>, the highly anticipated PC port has had more simultaneous players than several notable Sony games since its launch on Thursday, 16th May, boasting a concurrent record of 61,453 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>Only Helldivers 2, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered sport higher concurrent stats at 458,709, 73,529, and 66,436 players, respectively.</p>
<p>That means Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut has debuted to a bigger concurrent count than other Sony games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection, and The Last of Us Part 1.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut has been well-received, too, securing a "very positive" user review score as aggregated from over 6000 Steam reviews.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-multiplayer-crossplay-will-come-with-beta-label-attached-following-psn-debacle">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut developer Nixxes released a statement</a> saying that the game's crossplay functionality - which controversially requires a PSN login on PC - will now launch with a "beta" label attached.</p>
<p>Legends, the game's cooperative online multiplayer mode, was previously assumed to be a fully-functional part of the upcoming PC release. Now, however, Legends is described as being "functional on PC at launch", but cross-play won't be automatic.</p>
<p>Originally, Ghost of Tsushima's developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-developer-wants-you-to-know-you-can-play-it-on-steam-without-linking-to-a-psn-account">Sucker Punch was forced to make clear that Steam players would not be required to sign up to PSN</a> if they only wanted to play the Director's Cut's single-player campaign. But then – presumably due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' decision to retrospectively add in a PC PSN log-in requirement</a>, which went down so badly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony was forced to u-turn on its original plans</a> – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">Steam began auto-refunding players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>. It similarly did not go down well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-msi-claw-is-an-embarrassment.874710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>No one should buy an MSI Claw. It’s not technically broken: the first 7-inch Intel Core Ultra handheld gaming PC doesn’t regularly crash or anything like that. But the Claw falls so far short of the competition that it’s effectively dead on arrival.</p><p>In almost every way, the $750 MSI Claw feels like an inferior clone of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus ROG Ally</a> — except it costs more, not less! You could get a far better experience while saving hundreds of dollars if you choose a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> instead.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve spent weeks searching for a silver lining. In the end, I only found three tiny ways the Claw improves on the competition.</p><p>I didn’t start my MSI Claw journey by running benchmarks. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106945/my-expectations-for-the-msi-claw-have-hit-rock-bottom">My expectations were already at rock bottom</a>, so I began with an easier test: making the Claw my daily driver for the not-particularly-intensive games I’d already been playing on other handhelds. I fired up the PC port of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/23/3906010/studio-ghibli-ps3-game-ni-no-kuni">Studio Ghibli’s <em>Ni No Kuni</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23930889/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>, and<em> Fallout New Vegas</em> — a game that’s nearly 14 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Every one of them runs smoothly on a $549 Steam Deck OLED. Not one ran smoothly on the $749 MSI Claw. They would stutter or hitch, even when the system told me they were hitting 60fps or above and despite a 48–120Hz variable refresh rate screen that should have smoothed things out. The Claw would also drop frames when the Deck stayed stable and delivered fewer frames to begin with.&nbsp;</p><p>So, I fired up some more repeatable benchmarks. How bad could the Intel Core Ultra 155H really be compared to rivals? Here’s a peek:</p><div><p><em>Tested at 720p low, save</em>&nbsp;Dirt Rally<em>&nbsp;at 720p ultra, using each handheld’s various power modes.</em></p></div><p>In case your jaw has not yet hit the floor, let me bottom-line it for you: the less expensive Steam Deck OLED all but completely wiped the floor with the MSI Claw in power <em>and</em> performance.&nbsp;</p><p>The Claw, set to maximum power and plugged into a wall for a turbo boost, ran some games slower than my Steam Deck did on battery power alone. Can you imagine paying two hundred dollars more to play games like <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> at 45 fps instead of 60 — and only when you’re plugged into the wall?</p><p>Against Windows gaming handhelds, the Claw fared no better: the competing Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go offered anywhere from 10 percent more performance to <em>over</em> <em>double</em> the perf depending on the game and power mode.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The functional quick access menu is one of the handheld’s very few bright spots.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There was one bright spot: <em>Returnal</em>, one of the most intensive PC titles I tried, actually ran better on the Claw than it did on the Deck or Ally. But not well enough to be playable… and when I sat down to play an hour each of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, I didn’t find them playable either. Both are playable on the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go at identical (low) settings, so the Claw has no excuse for delivering a choppy mess.</p><p>I even fired up 3DMark Time Spy and Fire Strike to see if MSI might have accidentally sent me a lemon, but no — my Claw scored slightly higher than MSI’s own internal benchmark. And yes, I ran these benchmarks on the recent Intel graphics driver that was supposed to deliver big improvements, not the one the Claw originally shipped with.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>One USB-C port and micro SD slot, next to the fingerprint reader power button.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>At least the Claw doesn’t seem to have worse battery life than Windows peers. MSI gave it a 53-watt-hour battery pack, slightly larger than Legion Go and notably larger than Ally, and I saw roughly the same 1.5 hours of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> on a charge. I got 2 hours and 25 minutes of <em>Fallout New Vegas</em> and achieved a maximum runtime of 4 hours and 19 minutes in <em>Balatro</em>, one of the least demanding games I’ve yet played on a handheld. (My first run lasted 3.25 hours; I got an extra hour by setting the system to Super Battery mode and aggressively dimming the screen.)</p><p>But compared to the Steam Deck OLED, which can easily go twice as long in <em>Balatro </em>and lets Lara Croft raid tombs for over two hours, it’s not great — and I have no clue how MSI can justify saying the Claw “<a href="https://us.msi.com/Handheld/Claw-A1MX#:~:text=Power%20that%20Lasts%2050%25%20Longer">lasts 50 percent longer</a>” than the average handheld in its marketing campaign.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The backs of the ROG Ally and the MSI Claw show differences and similarities.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s worth noting that MSI <em>did</em> put a decent amount of thought into the Claw’s UX. While the hardware may <em>look</em> like a low-rent Batman edition of Asus’ ROG Ally, cribbing the same exact button layout and most of the same curves, it can feel a tad better in the hands. I appreciate its larger grips, more substantial face buttons, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button#:~:text=Sega%20famously%20fixed%20this%20decades%20ago%20with%20the%20Dreamcast%20and%20Saturn%203D%20by%20using%20Hall%20effect%20joysticks%20instead%2C%20which%20measure%20magnetic%20fields%20that%20don%E2%80%99t%20require%20direct%20physical%20contact">its Hall effect joysticks and triggers for longevity</a>. Like the Ally, the Claw has some of the best speakers on a gaming handheld, here augmented with surprisingly good Nahimic virtual surround sound that delivered delightfully all-around-me echoes as I failed to delve through tombs.&nbsp;</p><p>I do wish MSI hadn’t adopted a stiffer yet sloppier D-pad or added so many unnecessary spikes to its vents — they’ve repeatedly kept me from finding its charge port in a dark bedroom. The Claw’s rumble feels awful, too. At least MSI lets you turn it off!&nbsp;</p><p>But the main thing I’d like to turn off is Windows.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The fronts of the ROG Ally and MSI Claw show almost identical curves and layouts.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s been almost a full year since Asus released the ROG Ally and over two years since the Steam Deck, but Microsoft has done nothing meaningful to make its operating system friendlier for a gamepad-operated screen. I could practically copy / paste <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review#:~:text=Windows%20still%20feels%20largely%20foreign%20on%20a%20seven%2Dinch%20gamepad%20gadget">my criticisms from the ROG Ally review</a>: I ran into the same exact issues summoning virtual keyboards and playing games — things that mostly just work on a Steam Deck despite and / or because of its Linux underpinnings.</p><p>And, I ran into very similar sleep issues to the ones <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review#:~:text=Many%20times%2C%20I%E2%80%99ll%20find%20it%20wakes%20itself%20up%20right%20after%20I%20put%20it%20to%20sleep">I saw on the Lenovo Legion Go</a>: I simply can’t trust this portable not to wake itself up when I put it down or drop it into a bag. Only here, it’s slightly worse because the MSI Center utility has a tendency to hang when waking from sleep — sometimes disabling my gamepad controls until I reboot it.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>MSI Center M, the company’s quick launch software.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>While MSI Center also buries important features like remappable controls, I like that it includes launchers for every major PC game platform, comes with lots of handy Quick Access shortcuts that work right out of the box (like a switch that turns off RGB lighting), and is relatively snappy. The Deck, Ally, and Legion Go all had buggier, more sluggish interfaces at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, though, all of them are far more full-featured, and all let you natively install updates — while the Claw still expects you to navigate to MSI’s website and download important bits manually or wait for Windows Update to deliver the goods.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The MSI Claw vs. the Steam Deck. They’re roughly the same thickness, though the Deck’s joysticks are taller and there’s more grip underneath.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The MSI Claw<em> isn’t</em> the worst handheld gaming PC I’ve ever touched. Years ago, I played with some that didn’t even deserve a review, handhelds so poorly thought out and narrowly marketed I didn’t feel the need to warn you. But stores like Best Buy actually carry the MSI Claw — and in the current crop of competing handhelds, it’s the worst buy of them all.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-works-at-creative-assembly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by DualShockers</a>, Creative Assembly is working on a Total War: Star Wars game. The sources actually mention this is one of three Total War projects and they do not know exactly when each game will be released.</p>
<p>However, the report was later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/total-war-star-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by Tom Henderson, who said he first heard about a 'futuristic' Total War game in late 2022. Moreover, several 'second-hand sources' have since told him this is indeed set in the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>This is the second licensed IP picked by Creative Assembly for his once-historical-only franchise. The Warhammer trilogy turned out to be extremely successful for the studio, though, which is probably why it chose to try again with another extremely popular sci-fi IP.</p>
<p>This won't be the first real-time strategy game set in the universe imagined by George Lucas. The first one, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, was developed internally at LucasArts and released in 2001 to fairly positive reviews. Five years later, Petroglyph Games released Star Wars: Empire at War; it was their first game, and they would go on to make many acclaimed RTS games, such as 2019's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/conan-unconquered-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Unconquered</a>, 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/command-conquer-remastered-collection-the-best-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection</a>, and 2023's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-great-war-western-front-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Great War: Western Front</a>.</p>
<p>There's also been a very active Star Wars modding scene for Total War games, the most prominent of which is certainly the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/star-wars-total-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Total War mod</a> for Rome: Total War. It will be interesting to see Creative Assembly tackling the problem of space battles in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received several cuts from parent company SEGA</a> following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancellation of Hyenas</a>) is also working on a big free update for Total War: Pharaoh. According to Creative Assembly, fans can expect significant new additions to the campaign that will increase its size.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Tier Changes Are Inbound Due to Call of Duty, Insiders Claim]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-cod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Changes to Xbox Game Pass tiers are inbound due to the rumored inclusion of the new Call Duty on Microsoft's subscription service.</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we covered</a> a report from outlet WSJ that claimed that this year's Call of Duty entry would be coming to Game Pass. Possibly the news is to be announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-2024-june-call-of-duty-indiana-jones-gears-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during next month's Xbox showcase</a>. Following this report, several sources are now claiming that Microsoft is planning to make changes to the Game Pass tiers, possibly even a price hike, mainly due to the inclusion of Call of Duty.</p>
<p>On the ResetEra forums, known insider 'Shinobi' first <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot30-why-so-series-x-s.820296/page-540?post=123109182#post-123109182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that "there will be changes" when responding to a comment that Microsoft will introduce a new price, and reorganize the Game Pass tiers. Additionally, talking on X, Spanish insider 'eXtas1s' (who <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">often writes</a> for outlet Exputer) <a href="https://twitter.com/eXtas1stv/status/1791468893925417436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims</a> that "changes" are coming to the Game Pass tiers, mainly due to Call of Duty. No additional details have been shared just yet.</p>
<p>Another insider who shared 'information' about the rumored changes to Xbox Game Pass is 'NateDrake' who collaborated on the above claim from '' eXtas1s'. Answering a question on the ResetEra forums from a user who asked whether these changes include tier changes as well as a price hike, the known insider said that Microsoft will be making changes to pricing and tiers.</p>
<p>"Changes are coming in the form of pricing and a tier change", 'NateDrake' <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/extas1s-changes-are-coming-to-game-pass-with-the-inclusion-of-the-next-call-of-duty.874206/?post=123118203#post-123118203" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on the forums.</p>
<p>As always with these kinds of rumors, take the 'info' provided with a pinch of salt for now. Then again, these sources have proven to be quite accurate in the past, and it would only make sense for Microsoft to make changes to its subscription service if the company would indeed include the Call of Duty series on Game Pass.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? Will Microsoft change the Game Pass tiers? What would be a good price point? Hit the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23916193/aggro-dr1ft-review-travis-scott-harmony-korine-incel-gamer-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="X8EDwA"><small><em>This review of </em></small><small>AGGRO DR1FT</small><small><em> was originally published after its screening at the 2023 New York Film Festival. It has been updated and republished for the film’s limited theatrical run. </em></small></p>
<p id="xSLyh3">It’s rare to see a movie that challenges basic ideas about how films are made or what they should look like. It’s even rarer to see a movie in that mode that’s actually enjoyable. <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, from <em>Spring Breakers</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/29/18286004/the-beach-bum-review-matthew-mcconaughey"><em>The Beach Bum</em></a> director Harmony Korine, made in collaboration with <a href="https://www.travisscott.com/utopia-world/">rapper and music producer Travis Scott</a>, certainly doesn’t look like any kind of conventional movie, but it also isn’t an exception to the rule. It’s strange and mostly eventless — some viewers will probably jump ship on after five minutes or less. But it’s also utterly fascinating in the rare moments when it’s actually coherent. </p>
<p id="zCf2k7"><em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> follows BO (Jordi Mollà), a middle-aged man who loves his wife and children deeply. He’s also the world’s greatest assassin. He tells the audience both of these things directly, via omnipresent voice-over narration. The majority of the movie has BO wandering aimlessly around Florida from one meeting to the next. The encounters are only linked by his narration, which seems related to the plot only about half of the time. The plot, such as it exists, is about BO’s attempt to assassinate The Beast, a demonic villain with giant wings who has two katanas and hangs out with scantily clad women who he sometimes keeps in cages. </p>
<p id="bWdCcR">It isn’t really clear what The Beast did to earn the contract put on his head, but at one point, he stands between two women in bikinis and chants, “Dance, bitch. Dance, bitch” over and over again until the scene finally cuts and BO’s narration says, “There’s magic in this brutality.” I can’t say what that means for sure, but I can say that Korine seems to believe it’s true, and also that it’s exactly in keeping with the tone of the rest of the movie. More than once we see several uninterrupted seconds of The Beast pelvic thrusting while holding his sword and yelling, only for BO to cut in with narration telling us how terrifying The Beats is.</p>

<p id="hGKnuc">BO rolls around southern Florida buying sniper rifles, telling the audience to be careful of strippers because if you stare into their eyes for too long, you’ll lose your soul, and meeting with other assassins, including Travis Scott’s character, Zion, who BO seems to take under his wing. But after every brief trip, BO always returns to his home base, where his wife has been waiting in bed for him, while her voice over talks about how much she misses him and wants to have sex with him. </p>
<p id="FuOYFy">What makes all this fascinating, though, is <em>AGGRO DR1FT </em>is accidentally a more insightful look at an incel’s fantasies than most of the movies that actually attempt to portray incel life. </p>
<p id="uJNf09">BO is a bit of a schlub, but he has a cool, sexy job, a cool, sexy wife, and a family he loves very much, and would do anything to protect. He also sees evil everywhere in a cruel and horrible world. It just happens to look like a demon in a mask, holding samurai swords. His wife is perfect and must be protected, but strippers are evil sirens who exist to steal men’s souls. </p>
<p id="EGaaHX">All this performative hyper-masculinity feels like it’s been filtered through the lens of a 14-year-old boy screaming on Xbox Live over a game of <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. Evil is something you vanquish with a special sniper rifle, and women are made to be protected, not spoken to. The movie doesn’t create a coherent ideology, but it’s clear BO’s worldview is inherently self-righteous, and the world of the movie contorts itself around justifying him. </p>
<p id="0qalyd">What’s unique about <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is seeing all of this presented so brazenly, and without the defense of irony or sarcasm to dress it up. Like most of the movie, though, it’s fascinating to think about, but an absolute slog to actually watch.</p>
<p id="tiyqGF">The most uncomplicatedly interesting thing about <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, though, is the way it looks: Shot entirely with an infrared camera, with morphing neon colors that are often inverted, moving characters from bright featureless red to bright featureless blue, the movie looks unique. These aren’t entirely successful choices — the movie often just looks like an ugly mess of colors. But it’s a style that a different, more carefully conceived and directed movie could use well. The blocky neon vagueness of the bright colors often used in infrared photography also grants space to the movie’s best and most interesting feature: shifting illustrations that show up inside of the colors. </p>

<p id="YcCGiK">When a character or space (like the sky, for instance) slips all the way into a deep red hue, ink-like illustrations start to appear inside of the color, creating demonic heads, intricate machine parts, or presumably any other design Scott or Korine thought looked neat. These moments sometimes mean things, like when a massive demon-monster appears as BO commits a particularly nasty bit of violence, which seems to reflect his own self-image. Though these illustrations pop up constantly throughout the movie, especially in the second half, they feel criminally underthought, and like a disappointing waste of a great stylistic choice.  </p>
<p id="fJ2jqz">Reading all this, it might be tempting assume that, in spite of its flaws, <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is at least entertaining or exciting. I cannot stress enough that it is not. For all the movie’s talk about demons and assassinations, most of the movie’s nearly 90-minute runtime is taken up by characters driving from place to place, awkwardly standing around, or walking around southern Florida. </p>
<p id="mndGai">Writing a review of <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is already letting Korine win. It’s defiantly non-traditional and deliberately provocative. I can’t say that the movie really made me mad, but I can say I’m happy to let Harmony Korine win. He’s earned it;<em> AGGRO DR1FT</em> is an obtuse, ridiculous, headache-inducing movie to watch. It’s nearly impossible to tell whether any moment of the movie is entirely a joke or entirely sincere — it’s called <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, for God’s sake. It’s a meaningless phrase, rendered in all capital letters with a 1 standing in for an I; for all we know, it might as well be Travis Scott’s Gamertag. But the movie is more than that too. It’s as clear a depiction of a certain kind of distinctly male-coded interior life as I’ve ever seen, and there is value to making that in such a weirdly unfiltered way. <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> isn’t an enjoyable or particularly well-made movie, but it is the movie I’ve thought about most this year. For better or worse, that’s worth something. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-6-everything-we-know-so-far<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> officially in the rearview mirror, our next major slice of Persona-branded high school student simulation and turn-based dungeon battles will come via a presumed Persona 6. But when exactly will we see this next Persona game? And what will it be?</p><p>In truth, we know very, very little right now, but that doesn't mean we can't take a look at some early rumours and comments from the teams over at Atlus regarding Persona's next mainline entry. So, let's run through all the brief bits of information we've learned so far about what's next for the series.</p><h2>Persona 6 Isn't Confirmed Just Yet, but Atlus Wants to Make a New Entry</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/30/persona3reloadalt2-review-blogroll-1706584896935.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although Atlus hasn't come out and officially confirmed that Persona 6 is on its way, the team has gone on record to confirm that there will be future additions to the franchise. Back in 2018, the Persona studio's chief director, Kazuhisa Wada, told Dengeki Playstation (later translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/kazuhisa-wada-interview-excerpts-on-persona-series-developments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Persona Central</a>) that it was working on "mid-to-long term plans, including new numbered entries."</p><p>Since then, the company has alluded to the release of a new mainline entry several times, whether that's through job postings or hints that the company is working on something new. Although even without Atlus continuing to make clear that a sequel is in the works, it feels somewhat inevitable. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-series-passes-10-million-units-sold-after-tactica-launch">Persona 5's sales recently crossed 10 million units</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-becomes-fastest-selling-game-in-atlus-history-with-1-million-sales">Persona 3 Reload became the fastest-selling game in Atlus' history this year</a>, amassing a million copies sold in just one week. With recent entries pulling in record profits, it's hard to imagine Persona 6 isn't in the studio's future.</p><h2>Persona 6 Doesn't Have a Release Date, But Leaks Suggest It Could Come in the Next Few Years</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/27/persona5-1656362448085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Considering we don't have an official reveal of Persona 6 just yet, there's very little to go off regarding how far along it is and when it will hit shelves. That being said, one prominent leak seems to imply we can expect the game in the next two years. <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midori</a>, A reputable insider who has shared multiple leaks pertaining to Atlus, SEGA and the Persona franchise in the past, shared on X that they'd <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1699205462766326233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heard the game will either launch in 2025 or 2026</a>. They went on to claim that 2026 seems the most likely candidate, especially as the series' 30th anniversary falls within the same year.</p><p>As with any leak, it's worth taking the release window with a grain of salt until Atlus officially confirms anything, however, Midori has been a reliable source of information when it comes to early Persona news in the past. Considering Atlus has been rapidly releasing Persona content as of late, with Persona 5 Tactica, Persona 3 Reload and Persona 5: The Phantom X's China-exclusive open beta all launching in the space of a year, the studio seems to be ramping up its output of Persona titles, so a new mainline release in the next few years feels pretty fitting.</p><h2>There's a Very Good Chance Persona 6 Won't Be PlayStation Exclusive</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/08/metaphorthumb-1701998361881.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Without an official Persona 6 reveal from Atlus, we don't currently have any firm information about the platforms the sequel will release on, but a major change in Atlus' attitude towards exclusivity could likely mean the next mainline release is the first to debut on multiple systems. </p><p>In the past, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">every mainline Persona game</a> has debuted exclusively on PlayStation. However, Atlus' focus on Sony's systems has changed significantly in the past few years. Following the studio's decision to release Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal on PC, Xbox and Switch, it has trended towards releasing its major, tentpole titles on as many platforms as possible.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload was not only available on PS5, Xbox and PC when it hit shelves, but was added to Xbox Game Pass at launch. Meanwhile, the team's next major release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-playstation-steam">Metaphor ReFantazio, is slated to hit all major platforms bar the Switch this fall</a>. With the team catering to a wider audience when releasing its biggest games, it seems Persona 6 could well be the first mainline entry to debut across a range of different platforms.</p><h2>Atlus's Goal is to Have Persona 6 "Exceed" Persona 5</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/01/persona7jpg-a6e80f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although Persona has always had a large, loyal fanbase, Persona 5 was the game that launched the series into the stratosphere. From glowing reviews to millions of sales, it was a huge hit and is still considered one of the best RPGs of the modern era. However, Atlus is aiming to outdo it in their next game, and has even brought on a bigger team to ensure they do.</p><p>As spotted and translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/atlus-discusses-desire-to-grow-within-the-industry-persona-6-needing-to-surpass-persona-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Persona Central</a>, Atlus posted a job recruitment page back in 2017. Alongside listings for different roles within the company were interviews with staff at Atlus, including the studio's director: Naoto Hiraoka. In his interview, he claimed the team's goal was to "create a [Persona] 6 which exceeds [Persona] 5," and that the recruitment drive was imperative because "exceeding 5 will be difficult with the current staff." Considering Persona 5 was the team's biggest and most ambitious game yet, it'll be interesting to see what Atlus does to up the ante in the sequel.</p><h2>The Game's Colour Scheme Will Allegedly Be Green</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/04/08/persona-1712577088693.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the major calling cards of a Persona game is its bold, attention-grabbing art style. Each game has its own take on the Persona aesthetic, usually themed around a specific colour. Persona 3 heavily featured a gothic blue, Persona 4 went for a more uplifting yellow and Persona 5 bathed itself in a chaotic red. For Persona 6, it seems <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-4-and-5-were-blue-yellow-and-red-and-persona-6-will-seemingly-be-green">the developers are aiming to add a splash of green to the franchise</a>.</p><p>Once again taking a look at Atlus leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midori</a>'s recent tweets, they claimed in April that <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1777240240824197390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The color theme for Persona 6 is green."</a> Interestingly, the leak adds fuel to the fire of a long-running fan theory that started after Atlus posted some artwork for the series' 25th anniversary event. The image showed a lineup of all the lead characters throughout the franchise's six mainline games. Next to Joker from Persona 5, you can see a bucket filled with green paint.</p><p>Ever since the image dropped, fans were convinced the bucket confirmed that the next game would feature a green color-scheme, and if Midori's claims are true, it seems the theories were correct all along.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="348" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The year was 2015 and I was sitting on an uncomfortable futon in my living room at 3 am when I saw an advertisement for a free weekend of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny</a></em>. With my curiosity piqued, I made a Titan, woke up in the Cosmodrome, and followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTQp6loFEkM&amp;t=52s">Dinkle-bot</a> to the Last City. I unknowingly had found my favorite game and would spend nearly a decade playing it wrong.</p> <h2 id="h-the-cosmodrome" data-injectable="false">The Cosmodrome</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/destiny-2-the-cosmodrome-shuttles.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">By the time I got into <em>Destiny</em>, both <em>The Dark Below</em> and <em>House of Wolves</em> expansions had been released, and Bungie was prepping for the release of <em>The Taken King</em>. It was the prime time for someone to be introduced, gorge themselves on the story, and then seamlessly dive into one of the greatest expansions in the franchise.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">This is where I got the notion that <em>Destiny</em> was a story-driven game with an incredibly strong core gameplay loop. Everything I did was guided by the narrative, from escaping the Fallen in the Cosmodrome to stealing Eris Morn’s ship and infiltrating Oryx’s Dreadnaught.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">Sure, there were Strikes, but those were story snippets for me. Since weapons were leveled up to unlock additional perks from columns, there wasn’t much, if any, of a loot chase in my mind. It wasn’t even until the <em>Rise of Iron</em> expansion that I even got into raiding.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">This trend continued with the release of <em>Destiny 2</em> in 2017 up until the release of <em>The Witch Queen</em> in 2022. No matter what you thought of their quality, Bungie regularly released expansions and Seasons. However, after two years of the drip-fed seasonal model, I was becoming starved.</p> <h2 id="h-neomuna" data-injectable="false">Neomuna</h2> <figure data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/destiny-2-neomuna-skyline.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The Seasons leading up to <em>Lightfall</em> were turbulent as I began recognizing that activities and their mechanics were essentially being reused. With the story being reduced to meager weekly updates, I was only logging in at reset to experience a 30-minute or less story beat. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Despite this, Bungie had the hype machine working at full steam, and I was optimistic. <em>The Witch Queen</em> was an amazing expansion, and I was fully expecting Bungie to deliver with <em>Lightfall</em>. After all, the studio was surely skimping with seasonal content in favor of more resources for the expansion.</p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">This wasn’t the case. I wasn’t kind in <a href="https://progameguides.com/destiny/destiny-2-lightfall-review-the-light-has-abandoned-us/">my own review of <em>Lightfall</em></a> and my overall interest sharply declined. As the Seasons came and went, my play time came to a standstill as it felt like Bungie was just phoning it in at this point. Additionally, rumors had begun swirling that the developer had been poaching the <em>Destiny 2</em> staff for <em>Marathon</em>.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="790" data-injectable="true">Then came the <a href="https://progameguides.com/destiny/a-full-recap-of-the-bungie-layoff-situation-and-what-it-means-for-players/">October 2023 layoffs</a>. Without warning, Bungie laid off roughly 8% of its staff. While that is the worst part of that story, additional information surfaced suggesting those aforementioned rumors were accurate. Bungie leadership was bleeding <em>Destiny 2</em> dry and doing the bare minimum to keep it generating revenue so that money could be redirected to the development of <em>Marathon</em>. All of my worst fears had been proven true.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">It was a betrayal on every level, and while I had suspicions that Bungie was cheating on me as a player, it hurt all the more to get that confirmation. I had my doubts before, but now I was confident that my beloved decade-long saga was going to crash and burn.</p> <h2 id="h-the-tower" data-injectable="false">The Tower</h2> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/destiny-2-tower-titan-ramen-shop.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Outside of work obligations, I was done with <em>Destiny 2</em>. I had no faith the story would be brought to any meaningful conclusion. It was depressing and this continued for months until I hit a breaking point. Remembering the days when I would come home exhausted from work and finding solace in exploring Mars and Venus, I set aside my feelings regarding Bungie leadership and booted up <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">I like having a checklist of things to do in a game. Completing a Triumph releases the good chemicals in my brain, and chasing something like a Title is an easy recipe for that tasty dopamine. So, that’s what I did. I started with the most recent Season and began knocking out the Triumphs for the Titles. </p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">This led me down a rabbit hole of content whose surface I had barely scratched. I began paying attention to rolls with the hopes of either bolstering a loadout or finding something to build a new one around. I was now toying with Exotics that had never left my Vault prior. Old content became fresh as I was tackling it not only with new loadouts, but different builds on classes I hadn’t touched in ages.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">A whole new side of <em>Destiny 2</em> opened up as I was no longer shying away from higher-difficulty content. Instead, I was using it as a proving ground for my builds and refining them. This led to me connecting with different parts of the community and becoming more active overall. By no longer letting the story lead me, I saw the broader appeal of a robust gameplay loop full of options.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="869" data-injectable="false">At the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/">everything is looking bright for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em></a>. <em>Into the Light</em> is going strong and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-trailer-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape-showcases-environments-inside-the-traveler/">what’s been shown of <em>The Final Shape</em></a> looks promising. Sure, this is all the result of Bungie breaking the “in case of emergency” glass, but I’ll take it. I have zero faith that the story will be brought to anything resembling a satisfying conclusion, but I’m not going to let that detract from things like an Onslaught Rat King run.</p>

From the first console with defining titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> to the PlayStation 5 with smash hits like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, PlayStation is still today one of the key pillars in the games industry. Numerous consoles have been released over the last 29 years, with revisions, portable consoles, and new generations included. Below, we've compiled every single PlayStation console ever released. Take a stroll down memory lane and dive into the history of PlayStation!</p><p><em>Looking to save on a new PlayStation 5 or new titles for your system? Be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals"><em>best PlayStation deals</em></a><em> available today.</em></p><h2>How Many PlayStation Consoles Have There Been?</h2><p>In total, <strong>fourteen PlayStation consoles</strong> have been released since the first PlayStation released in 1995 in North America. This list includes Slim revision models for consoles and the two portable consoles that Sony has released under the PlayStation branding. </p><h2>Every PlayStation Console in Order of Release</h2><h3>PlayStation - September 9, 1995</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/playstation-1-1715925648913.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Sony PlayStation is the console that started it all. In a major departure from the industry leader Nintendo's cartridge-based approach, the PlayStation utilized CD-ROM. These discs had much more space on them, which led to major developers like Square Enix crafting games for the console. The PlayStation is forever remembered for titles like Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 2, Vagrant Story, Crash Bandicoot, and many more <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps1-games-playstation">great PS1 games</a>.</p><h3>PS One - September 19, 2000</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps-one-1715925609306.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PS One is a redesigned model of the PlayStation, offering the same features in a smaller form factor. The one major change with this model was the removal of the reset button. In 2002, Sony released an attachable screen for the PS One called the Combo. This was made possible due to the removal of a few miscellaneous ports on the back of the console. It's also worth noting that the PS One outsold the PlayStation 2 in 2000, which is wild looking back.</p><h3>PlayStation 2 - October 26, 2000</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/27/playstation-2-1695822857065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PlayStation 2 took to the scene in October 2000 offering a massive increase in visual fidelity compared to its predecessor. Long gone were the days of polygon-shaped figures, and in were the days of detailed character models and 3D action titles. To this day, the PlayStation 2 is still <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-video-game-consoles-nintendo-playstation-ps5-xbox">the best selling console of all time</a>. Although, the Nintendo Switch is slowly inching closer and closer with each update. You can check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps2-games-ever-top-playstation-2-games-ranked">best PS2 games</a> of all time to see why it was so beloved.</p><h3>PlayStation 2 Slim - November 2004</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps2-slim-1715928531977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The PlayStation 2 Slim made monumental improvements across the board in performance, efficiency, and design. First off, the disc drive was changed to be top-load, which fixed some issues players ran into with dual layer discs on the standard PlayStation 2 consoles. Additionally, Sony reduced the power draw for the PS2 Slim by reworking the internals to be more efficient. PS2 Slim was much smaller than the original PS2, hence the 'Slim' name. This was the first Slim revision by Sony, which has been utilized in every PlayStation generation since.</p><h3>PlayStation Portable - March 24, 2005</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/playstation-portable-1715928720661.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">PlayStation Portable</a> was the first portable console Sony ever released under the PlayStation name. Also referred to as the PSP (not to be confused with the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">PlayStation Portal</a>), this console had capabilities of playing games, watching movies, and listening to music. It utilized UMDs as its method of physical storage for games and movies. The device was even capable of connecting to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 in some capacities, with certain titles allowing for the PSP to be utilized in-game. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">best PSP games</a> of the time were also really solid entries in various franchises.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 - November 17, 2006</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps3-fat-1715926934428.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-ps3-games-of-all-time">PlayStation 3</a> was a massive step up from the PS2, with all sorts of new capabilities. The major shakeup came with the new online features, specifically with PlayStation Network. PSN brought online multiplayer, digital downloads, and much more. This console was also backwards compatible, so PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles could be inserted and played rather than just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-ps3-games-of-all-time">PS3 games</a>. Lastly, PS3 introduced support for Blu-ray discs, which allowed players to insert movies and watch through their console. This addition is one of the reasons consoles have become some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-blu-ray-players">best Blu-ray players</a> on the market in 2024.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 Slim - September 1, 2009</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/15/ps3-1552660016477.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PlayStation 3 Slim arrived three years after the release of the original PS3, dropping over 33% of the weight, bulk, and power consumption of the original model. The cooling system was completely redesigned to save space, which also provided better thermals for the system. By far, the biggest departure of this release was the lack of backwards compatibility. Sony dropped support for PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles in this model, and this is a feature that has never returned.</p><h3>PlayStation Vita - February 22, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/playstation-vita-1715926692269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vita">PlayStation Vita</a> marked Sony's first new entry in the portable gaming space in nearly seven years. A key draw for many was the ability to play hundreds of incredible titles across both the PS3 and the Vita. At the time of release, it was the most advanced portable system on the market, with dozens of features no other developer offered. Later in its life, Remote Play for PlayStation 4 was added, allowing players to stream PS4 games to the Vita anywhere in their homes.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 Super Slim - September 25, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps3-slim-1715907474134.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PlayStation 3 Super Slim was the final revision for PlayStation 3. Releasing just a year before PS4 hit the market, the PS3 Super Slim featured a top-load Blu-ray drive, better power efficiency, and an even slimmer design. Looking back on this release, the PlayStation 3 Super Slim ended up being the most durable PS3 that Sony released, which was largely due to the disc drive design and slimmer body. </p><h3>PlayStation 4 - November 15, 2013</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/05/51roi4d4pul-sl1280-1686009312538.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-4-1st-gen">PlayStation 4</a> offered internals that were over five times faster than PS3, allowing for a massive jump in visual quality for games. PS4 saw the release of incredible titles like Uncharted 4, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and many more. Another quality feature available on PlayStation 4 was the addition of a removable HDD, which allowed players to swap hard drives in and out for more storage. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/DualShock_4">DualShock 4 controller</a> was also a massive step up from the DualShock 3, offering a more ergonomic design to aid in comfort during long play sessions. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps4-games">best PS4 games</a> are still some of the best modern games you can play.</p><h3>PlayStation 4 Slim - September 15, 2016</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/51t0bpwu8ul-1715906977543.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In short, <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-4-slim">PlayStation 4 Slim</a> was just a smaller and better version of the PlayStation 4. The PS4 Slim was much more power efficient than its predecessor, which allowed for the internals to be shrunk down into a smaller form factor design. While there was no difference in performance between this console and the standard PS4, the smaller design and quieter cooling system was a huge draw for many.</p><h3>PlayStation 4 Pro - November 10, 2016</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/09/07/ps4700003jpg-5ebd03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/playstation-4-pro">PlayStation 4 Pro</a> was a monumental step forward from the standard PlayStation 4. The console marked Sony's first entry into 4K support, with upscale technology utilized to create a 4K image. Combined with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-hdr">HDR support</a>, the PS4 Pro finally allowed players to take advantage of their 4K displays. With twice the GPU power of PS4, this console was able to provide boosted frame rates for many titles. </p><h3>PlayStation 5 - November 12, 2020</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps5-1715906405961.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> marked the most powerful PlayStation console to date, with support for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-ray-tracing">ray tracing</a>, 120FPS, steady native 4K output, and more. By far, this is the largest PlayStation ever released, though it comes just under the PlayStation 3 in terms of weight. Alongside the console, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-dualsense-controller">PlayStation DualSense Controller</a> brought loads of new features, including adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and a USB-C charging port. Our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-games">best PS5 games</a> dives into some of the greatest console titles to be released in this decade.</p><h3>PlayStation 5 Slim - November 10, 2023</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/10/ps5-slim-1696956567005.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-slim">PlayStation 5 Slim</a> brought new changes to the PlayStation 5 without drastically changing any of the hardware inside. First, the console is much smaller than the original PlayStation 5, which is a bulky console that can be challenging to fit in shelves. The major change with PS5 Slim is the modular design, which allows you to buy a console without a disc drive and buy the attachable drive separately later on.</p><h2>Upcoming PlayStation Consoles</h2><p>Although the PS5 Slim was released just last year, we are already expecting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">release of the PS5 Pro</a> at some point during the holiday season in 2024. As for the next generation of PlayStation consoles, we don't really have an exact date of when to expect them to arrive. Some speculation puts the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-6">release of the PS6</a> anywhere between 2026 and 2030.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-immortals-new-tempest-class-wields-wind-and-water-to-fun-effect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Step aside, Mother Nature. There’s a new master of the environment in town.</h2></div><section><p>Diablo Immortal has had its ups and downs, just as its big brother Diablo IV has, but I have to admit the team working on Immortal has constantly been adding things that pique my interest. The Blood Knight was the first new class added to the Diablo franchise in nine years and it was an interesting spin on what I’d imagine a Castlevania protagonist would play like in the Diablo world. The Tempest is next and after playing for a while, I’m happy to report that the class adds an interesting set of new abilities and moves that make it a compelling option for players. I couldn’t tell if it would land in the S-tier category during my playtime, but it’s certainly got a lot of style that sets it apart from the others.</p><p>The Tempest’s main ability is focused on duplicating your character to set up an attack from all angles, as each clone (aka Zephyr) will mimic your attacks, which makes for some great gameplay moments that make you feel like a powerful trickster running laps around the demons on the map. The waterblades your character wields gave me God of War vibes for a moment, but in practice, the Tempest is a bit more like a trickster, zipping around the map and making it hard for enemies to get a bead on you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Diablo Immortal Tempest Release</h3></div></output><p>Using the power of wind and water, combined with your Zephyr’s, you’ll find that the initial Wave Edge and Mist-Touch combo will make great building blocks that help you get a feel for the playstyle. Some of the first skills like Squall and Crosswinds are wave and wind attacks that will propel you in a direction and spawn a Zephyr once cast. From there you can finish off that initial setup with an attack like Cascade which makes “you and your Zephyrs slam your edges into the ground, unleashing a crashing wave around you.”</p><p>In practice, with these abilities I found the early game had me quickly zipping around the map to spawn my Zephyrs before setting up this trap over and over again to take me through the first few missions. It was a lot of fun to figure out a good flow and watch enemies melt as you did so. Not only are the movements interesting, but the overall design style is something I really like. These dual dagger-wielding Tempests look sleek and stylish, with vibes from other games and classes in the mix. The Zephyr mechanic could be compared to a Necro minion build, but for the Tempest, the Zephyrs act on a cooldown as opposed to having a set health meter – meaning you’ll need to set them up with each encounter as opposed to simply having them follow you around. That said, on a late game build they provided us with the Samilian WIndbrush and a 5-Star Echoing Shade that added a 15% chance to "summon a shadow clone for 17 seconds that attacks nearby enemies with one of your Primary Attacks." This addition did give you closes that romed along side you for a short period of time. These touches mean it's definitely a class I could see myself having a lot of fun with. The Tempest has a short origin quest when starting out with the character too, giving you a bit more history about the Tempest origin. </p><p>The other notable part of this preview was the huge change to the Paragon system. Blizzard tells us that all progress made on the Paragons so far will be retained, and that the 15 Paragon trees have been reduced to five. The goal is to give more options to mix and match your skills and because your progress is retained it’ll be nice to keep building it out as you grind the endgame. The trees you could stat into now include Frenzy of Battle, Soul of Conquest, Grind Expedition, Invincibility, Stringed, and for the Tempest there was a Wind tree. Add the skills you want to use to your new skill tree and take them for a spin. I like this new system, as in the retail build it does feel like you get locked in a bit more, and now you can, at Paragon level 300, choose six skills to put into your build.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ign-2024-05-09-station-12-00-03-21-25-still004-1715981627251.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The new Paragon System in Diablo Immortal</figcaption></figure></output><p>The main criticism I have so far, strangely, is that Immortal feels incredibly easy. I know I’m the target audience, but progression has been ratched up so much that in the span of about an hour I had hit level 20 while everything around me melted. I realize that Blizzard wants to get you to endgame faster when rolling a 2nd or 3rd character instead of using the Class Swap option introduced a year after launch, but it doesn’t really give you a chance to learn by failing. You’re thrown so much loot and information a bit fast. Even trying out a Blood Knight at home after the event, I took him past level 30 by playing a mission here and there passively with minimum time put in. The ease of which takes away from the rewarding feeling you get when conquering something challenging.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main criticism I have so far, strangely, is that Immortal feels incredibly easy.</p></div><p>All that said, when I asked about the health of the player base for Diablo Immortal, Blizzard told us that it “has been very healthy the whole time” during our interview. And because player counts saw a huge spike with the Blood Knight release, I’d imagine that we see one again with the Tempest. They also let us know that they’re already working on another character class addition and that they’d love to bring back characters they used to have as well</p><p>While I’ve had my criticisms about some of the mechanics Diablo Immortal uses, I do admit that I am impressed with the sheer amount of additions made to it in two years. There’s so much to dive into that it’s almost overwhelming when you sign back in. But because they’ve added two classes that are entirely new to the franchise, it’s worth trying them out for a few levels to see how they feel. I know I’ll be taking a peek in between my Diablo IV time when the Tempest and Paragon changes come to Immortal on May 23rd.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Cenat announced that he had finished Elden Ring on Friday afternoon after 166 hours with a post on X/Twitter exclaiming, "I FINALLY BEAT ELDEN RING."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I FINALLY BEAT ELDEN RING.</p>— AMP KAI (@KaiCenat) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat/status/1791573793099436394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Cenat's achievement felt especially notable became, as he pointed out, he doesn't normally play these types of games. He's best-known for streaming games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a>, though he has also sprinkled in Red Dead Redemption 2, Minecraft, and other games. </p><p>Neverthless, Cenat's stream has been a hit, bringing with it a seemingly endless stream of reactions and clips as he has his cursed his way through each difficult encounter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— d r e w (@its_nadaaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/its_nadaaa/status/1790156423038738592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Despite his inexperience, Cenat perservered, even managing to defeat the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Malenia,_Blade_of_Miquella_Location_and_Guide">notoriously difficult Malenia</a> on his 271st try following a struggle that lasted more than 20 hours.</p><p>After rolling credits, Cenat celebrated by watching the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/15-hidden-details-in-the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer">trailer for the Shadow of Erdtree DLC</a>, which he roundly applauded, then he watched a speedrunner finish the game in less than two minutes. In all, Cenat's run lasted roughly 167 hours and took some 1,700 deaths to finally complete.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After nearly 167 hours and over 1,700 deaths, Kai Cenat has officially beaten Elden Ring <a href="https://t.co/IQqb5JQGFC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IQqb5JQGFC</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1791576240471884186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In his final review, Cenat thanked the Soulsborne community and called Elden Ring "a masterpiece." </p><p>"To the people who watch on the regular, thank you. Because y'all gave me a chance to explore a new game that is not in our category that we don't normally play and we had a great time...gaming is really huge and I really respect Elden Ring," Cenat said. </p><p>"[T]o the Souls community, y'all are some gamers. Second of all, this game is a masterpiece. Does it deserve game of the year? Yes. I love God of War. I love it. This game is cinema...I literally enjoyed every boss battle...I don't know what game compares to this now. This is absolute cinema."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This game is cinema...I literally enjoyed every boss battle...I don't know what game compares to this now. This is absolute cinema</p></div><p>Cenat also vowed to return for Shadow of the Erdtree, which is due out in a little more than a month.</p><p>"If this one thing that you learned from watching this, do not give up. Listen to me. DLC? We're playing," he said.</p><p>One way or another, it doesn't sound like Cenat's journey is over just yet. Elden Ring: Shadow of Erdtree releases on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on June 21.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/redfall-offline-mode-coming-one-final-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox fans, and some of their employees, were blindsided earlier this month when <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft announced a number of their studios were being shuttered</a>, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-director-arkane-austin-closure-gut-stab-redfall-development-ceases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“gut stab” closure of Arkane Austin</a>, developer of the acclaimed Prey and the more troubled <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/redfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfall</a>. Following the announcement Arkane Austin was shutting up shop, it was reported that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-in-very-rough-state-rumor-redfall-big-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team had been working on additional updates for Redfall</a>, including one that would deliver a long-promised offline mode. Unfortunately, at the time, it seemed unlikely any of these promised updates would come to fruition.</p>
<p>Well, thankfully, it seems there’s a glint of light amongst the darkness here, as it seems the Redfall team will indeed get to complete one last update, which will usher in that offline mode, single-player pausing, revamps to how enemies spawn, and more. Here’s what the <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfall X account had to say on the matter</a>…</p>

<p>The shuttering of Arkane Austin is just part of wider change and turmoil going on at Xbox, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included widespread layoffs</a>, the closure of other studios like Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatling Xbox Series sales</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting of some older games</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-plans-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly even some top-of-the-line titles</a>, to other platforms. On the other hand, Microsoft now owns Call of Duty and it seems they’re <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning to bring the blockbuster series to Game Pass</a>, so they’re far from out of the game. As for Arkane themselves, their main team in Lyon, France will continue onward as they're working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/marvels-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade game for Marvel</a>.</p>
<p>Redfall can be played on PC and Xbox Series X/S. There’s no official word on when the final update will arrive, but previous rumors stated it was being prepared to launch sometime in May.</p>

<p id="YTiIUY"><strong>Genre:</strong> Superhero action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 54m<br><strong>Director: </strong>S.J. Clarkson<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced</p>
<p id="bhlqkr">Sony’s latest entry in its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071940/madame-web-post-credits-sony-marvel-mcu-comics">Spidey-less Spidey Universe</a> stars Dakota Johnson as Cassie Webb, a paramedic living in Manhattan who gains the ability to see visions of the future after a near-death experience. When a mysterious superpowered stranger (who was with Cassie’s mom when she was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23964014/madame-web-ezekiel-marvel-in-the-amazon-with-my-mom">in the Amazon researching spiders right before she died</a>) begins hunting a trio of young girls, Cassie takes it upon herself to protect them.</p>
<p id="0lsZkj">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24071362/madame-web-review-post-credits-scene-sequel-teaser-bad">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="qJDKn2"><em>Madame Web</em> might be the most shameless superhero movie of all time. Far from just the cash-in that it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23962097/madame-web-movie-trailer-spider-man">seemed like a few years ago</a> when this movie headlined by an F-tier superhero was first announced, Sony’s latest Marvel offshoot is a two-hour post-credits scene, made only intermittently tolerable by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX_Rxvg8vdo">Dakota Johnson’s underappreciated knack for comedy</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p id="mDw1V3"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dystopian action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 37m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Francis Lawrence<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Peter Dinklage</p>
<p id="64kMuC">Francis Lawrence returns to the world of The Hunger Games to tell the story of the early years of Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), who would go on to become the president of Panem and the nemesis of Katniss Everdeen.</p>
<p id="Cfw1Cc">Set 60 years before the events of the first film, <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes</em> recalls the fateful meeting between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from District 12 who would leave a profound impact on his life and worldview.</p>
<p id="3dMDbl">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952899/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-review">review</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p id="3zPjB6">Collins’ book and Lawrence’s movie don’t redo the action of the Hunger Games events; they dissect them, then force us to sit on the Capitol side of the equation. They demand to know why we were even drawn to the love triangle, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2sXXG3tTaI">the pretty dresses</a>, and the themed arenas in the first place. We’ve always been the spectators, after all, watching Katniss’ story from a safe distance. <em>The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes </em>shows us what happens if we get too carried away by propaganda, luxury, and the promise of safety. In that way, it’s a fitting end to the franchise — and a fitting end to the way the genre evolved into a beast of its own.</p></blockquote>

<p id="ZbSuUQ"><strong>Genre:</strong> Sports drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 11m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Luca Guadagnino<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Zendaya, Josh O’Connor, Mike Faist</p>
<p id="J7i5tZ">Luca Guadagnino’s sensual sports drama, about a love triangle in professional tennis, has set certain circles of the world on fire since its release in late April and is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24064917/best-movies-2024">one of the best movies of the year</a>. Now, you can enjoy it at home.</p>
<p id="VqxjVF">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="BJ2hPN">That script is a terrific three-course meal for Faist and O’Connor. They get to trade off face and heel roles from scene to scene and era to era, as Art and Patrick help and hurt each other in equal measure. But it’s an absolute smorgasbord for Zendaya, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091605/dune-2-zendaya-movie-star-best-performance">even in starring roles</a> has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22268795/malcolm-marie-review-netflix">never been given this much room</a> to stretch. Tashi is a gratifyingly rich character, both righteously angry over the thwarting of her ambitions and cruelly angry at all the men who have the nerve to keep on playing the game that was taken away from her. She’s hungry for affection and withholding it at the same time, by turns sensually curious and coldly dispassionate, ambitious and exhausted, conflicted and confident. She’s the kind of character that media master’s theses are made of, and unpicking Tashi’s conflicting motives and how she integrates them is likely to become a pop culture obsession in the months to come.</p></blockquote>

<p id="XO70Mz"><strong>Genre:</strong> Monster action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 55m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Adam Wingard<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Godzilla, Kong, Rebecca Hall</p>
<p id="ARjsIF">The boys are back in town — the boys being Godzilla and Kong, of course. <em>Godzilla vs. Kong </em>director Adam Wingard returns for this team-up movie, where the big lads must work together to stop an invasion from Hollow Earth.</p>
<p id="lAzoOV">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24114548/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-review">review</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="6wqRzU"><em>Godzilla x Kong</em> (yes, it’s styled like that, like a streetwear collab) is beyond “good” or “bad” or “movies.” It’s an arena show, a pro wrestler shouting in the squared circle, thumping their chest and raising the jumbotron hype meter before doing their signature move. Through brutally efficient pacing that minimizes what the script doesn’t care about (people, mostly) and maximizes what it does (giant monsters doing wrestling moves), it constantly eschews connection in favor of escalation. It’s an achievement in absurd spectacle, a comically silly way to spend $135 million. I hope Warner Bros. keeps burning money this way.</p></blockquote>

This all started on May 7, when Adobe’s lawyers sent Testut a “firm” but “kindly written” email requesting Delta change its icon, explaining that the emulator might “not wish to confuse consumers or otherwise violate Adobe’s rights or the law.” </p><p>But before Testut could reply, the next day Apple sent Delta an email and suggested that the emulator might be at risk after it was contacted by Adobe, which alleged that Delta was infringing on its IP. </p><p>“We responded to both Apple and Adobe explaining our icon was a stylized Greek letter delta—not an A—but that we would update the Delta logo anyway to avoid confusion,” Testut told <em>The Verge. </em><br></p><p>The current Delta icon on the App Store now is just a temporary one. The plan is to launch a new permanent logo in the future alongside update 1.6. As pointed out by the outlet, Delta’s old icon most closely resembled Adobe’s Cloud Experience app icon. Since the ‘80s, most of Adobe’s logos and branding have included a stylized A featuring a gap, a design that does look similar to Delta’s old, now-defunct icon. </p><p>Hopefully, Delta’s next icon doesn’t share anything in common with some other giant and litigious corporation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 2:single/related:5b6bb85477df652b6bb8d9bc4f030696 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Apple’s initial pitch for the tvOS and the Apple TV as it currently exists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/tvos-17s-extra-column-of-icons-is-its-most-useful-new-feature-in-years/">was centered around apps</a>. No longer a mere streaming box, the Apple TV would also be a destination for general-purpose software and games, piggybacking off of the iPhone's vibrant app and game library.</p>
<p>That never really panned out, and the Apple TV is still mostly a box for streaming TV shows and movies. But the same App Store rule change that recently allowed <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PPSSPP</a>, and other retro console emulators onto the iPhone and iPad could also make the Apple TV appeal to people who want a small, efficient, no-fuss console emulator for their TVs.</p>

<p>So far, few of the emulators that have made it to the iPhone have been ported to the Apple TV. But earlier this week, the streaming box got an official port of RetroArch, the sprawling collection of emulators that <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">runs on everything</a> from the PlayStation Portable to the Raspberry Pi. RetroArch could be sideloaded onto iOS and tvOS before this, but only using <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/install-ios/">awkward workarounds</a> that took a lot more work and know-how than downloading an app from the App Store.</p>
<p>Downloading and using RetroArch on the Apple TV is a lot like using it on any other platform it supports, for better or worse. ROM files can be uploaded using a browser connected to the Apple TV's IP address or hostname, which will pop up the first time you launch the RetroArch app. From there, you're only really limited by the list of emulators that the Apple TV version of the app supports.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The main benefit of using the Apple TV hardware for emulation is that even older models have substantially better CPU and GPU performance than any Raspberry Pi; the first-gen Apple TV 4K and its Apple A10X chip date back to 2017 and still do better than a Pi 5 released in 2023. Even these older models should be more than fast enough to support advanced video filters, like <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/runahead/">Run Ahead</a>, to reduce wireless controller latency and higher-than-native-resolution rendering to make 3D games look a bit more modern.</p>
<p>Beyond the hardware, tvOS is also a surprisingly capable gaming platform. Apple has done a good job adding and maintaining support for new Bluetooth gamepads in recent releases, and even Nintendo's official Switch Online controllers for the NES, SNES, and N64 are <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-adds-nintendo-online-classic-controller-support-to-the-iphone-ipad-mac-and-apple-tv/">all officially supported</a> as of late 2022. Apple may have added this gamepad support primarily to help support <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1490288609?ign-itscg=20201&amp;ign-itsct=acd-sem-153300447325-683554519918&amp;mttnagencyid=c1a&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnpid=Google%20AdWords&amp;mttnsiteid=47267711&amp;mttnsubad=acd-sem-153300447325-683554519918&amp;mttnsubkw=kwd-349709206040&amp;mttnsubplmnt=c_adext%3A">its Apple Arcade service</a>, but all of those gamepads work equally well with RetroArch.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, another upside of using the Apple TV for retro gaming is that you can also still use it as a modern 4K video streaming box when you're finished playing your games. It has well-supported apps from just about every streaming provider, and it supports all the DRM that these providers insist on when you're trying to stream high-quality 4K video with modern codecs. Most Pi gaming distributions <a href="https://kodi.tv/download/raspberry-pi/">offer the Kodi streaming software</a>, but it's frankly outside the scope of this article to talk about the long list of caveats and add-ons you'd need to use to attempt using the same streaming services the Apple TV can access.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Obviously, there are trade-offs. Pis have been running retro games for a decade, and the Apple TV is just starting to be able to do it now. Even with the loosened App Store restrictions, Apple still has other emulation limitations relative to a Raspberry Pi or a PC.</p>

<p>The biggest one is that emulators on Apple's platforms <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">can’t use just-in-time (JIT) code compilation</a>, needed for 3D console emulators like Dolphin. These restrictions make the Apple TV a less-than-ideal option for emulating newer consoles—the Nintendo 64, Nintendo DS, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation Portable, and Sega Saturn are the newest consoles RetroArch supports on the Apple TV, cutting out newer things like the GameCube and Wii, Dreamcast, and PlayStation 2 that are all well within the capabilities of Apple's chips. Apple also insists nebulously that emulators must be for "retro" consoles rather than modern ones, which could limit the types of emulators that are available.</p>
<p>With respect to RetroArch specifically, there are other limitations. Though RetroArch describes itself as a front-end for emulators, its user interface is tricky to navigate, and cluttered with tons of overlapping settings that make it easy to break things if you don't know what you're doing. Most Raspberry Pi gaming distros use RetroArch, but with a front-end-for-a-front-end <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/EmulationStation/">like EmulationStation</a> installed to make RetroArch a bit more accessible and easy to learn. A developer could release an app that included RetroArch plus a separate front-end, but Apple's sandboxing restrictions would likely prevent anyone from releasing an app that <em>just</em> served as a more user-friendly front-end for the RetroArch app.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's still pretty cool to be able to play retro games on an Apple TV's more advanced hardware. As more emulators make their way to the App Store, the Apple TV’s less-fussy software and the power of its hardware could make it a compelling alternative to a more effort-intensive Raspberry Pi setup.</p>

                <p>Epic is teaming up with renowned singer Billie Eilish to introduce three new songs from her newly released album, Hit Me Hard And Soft, to Fortnite Festival. The newly added songs from the album are playable today as of 5 PM PT/8 PM ET.</p><p>This marks the first time music has come to Fortnite Festival on the same day it released elsewhere. The upcoming songs that players will be able to jam out to will consist of "Chihiro," "The Diner," And "Lunch."</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Fortnite Festival season 3 is centered around Billie Eilish, similar to how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-adds-lady-gaga-skins-and-songs-for-season-2/1100-6521229/">season 2 was with Lady Gaga</a>. Several songs of hers, as well as three in-game skins and other accessories, are available for purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Billie Eilish isn't the only singer Epic has collaborated with. As previously mentioned, the studio recently partnered with Lady Gaga. But in the past, Epic has worked with artists such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-will-exclusively-debut-the-weeknds-new-popular-music-video/1100-6521121/">The Weeknd</a>, Travis Scott, J Balvin, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-brings-eminem-to-the-game-next-week-as-skins-leak/1100-6519403/">Eminem</a>. Although not all of them have songs in Fortnite Festival they all have skins in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the only announcement Fortnite made today.

On May 8th, one day later, Testut got another email <em>from Apple</em> that suggested his app might be at risk because Adobe had reached out to allege Delta was infringing its intellectual property rights. </p><p>“We responded to both Apple and Adobe explaining our icon was a stylized Greek letter delta — not an A — but that we would update the Delta logo anyway to avoid confusion,” Testut tells us. </p><p>The icon you’re seeing on the App Store now is just a temporary one, he says, as the team is still working on a new logo. “Both the App Store and AltStore versions have been updated with this temporary icon, but the plan is to update them to the final updated logo with Delta 1.6 once it’s finished.”</p><p>Adobe does have <em>one</em> logo that’s pretty similar to Delta’s, and all of Adobe’s logos contain stylized triangles with an almost identically shaped gap. They’ve <a href="https://adobe.fandom.com/wiki/Marva_Warnock?file=Adobe_logo_design_by_Marva_Warnock.jpg">had such a gap since 1982</a> when Marva Warnock, the wife of company co-founder John Warnock, first designed the mark.</p><p>But Adobe adopted a negative space version of the logo in 1993 and has used it ever since, one that’s harder to confuse with Delta:</p><p>I certainly didn’t think of Adobe when I first saw Delta’s logo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
