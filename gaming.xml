This game is set within the same universe as Lost in Random, a Gothic fairy-tale-inspired action-adventure that was released in 2021 as an<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-announces-originals-it-takes-two-lost-in-random-rocket-arena/"> EA Original</a>. If you want to see what you can expect from Lost in Random: The Eternal Die, there is an official gameplay trailer below to introduce you to the world and combat.</p>
<p>This game is the leading project for Stormteller Games, the recently rebranded studio that was previously known as Thunderful Gothenburg.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost in Random: The Eternal Die | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsxC6L4k-kE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those on PC, the first public demo is available now on Steam, with the demo also being available on Xbox as of tomorrow, February 14. There is no word as to whether there will be a demo for this game on PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch as of yet.</p>
<p>In Lost in Random: The Eternal Die, Aleksandra, who was once known as The Queen, has been captured alongside her companion Fortune and jailed inside the Black Die by Mare the Knight, who is plotting their final chapter. As a result of this, you have to fight your way through a randomly generated gauntlet, where there will be pawns to take on and giant board games. As you explore, you will be given the opportunity to claim treasure, which will improve your improve your chances of dealing with Aleksandra's tormentor, much like typical roguelikes.</p>
<p>The roguelike element comes in with the randomly generated gauntlet, as well as the ability to combine over 100 relics that have powerful card-based abilities that can then unleash devastating synergies. You get to pick between four unique weapons as you explore four randomly generated worlds, with each of them being home to unique secrets and challenges to undertake. There are over 30 different enemy types that you will encounter on your journeys, with some really challenging bosses that will pull you out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die is set to stand out from the crowd with a fully voiced story that takes place in a Tim Burton-inspired world, which is brought to life with gorgeous Gothic landscapes and a fitting soundtrack that encompasses the energy of Tim Burton's work.</p>
<p>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam in Summer 2025. As a reminder, there is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a demo</a> available on PC right now, with the demo set to release on Xbox tomorrow.</p>

It’s easy to lose moments watching the ambience of the gameboard change in the demo for haunted house RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-horror-at-highrook">The Horror At Highrook</a>. The colours alter from daytime greyness through winey shades of sunset into pale lavender moonlight. There are little details to notice and zoom on: a fleeting embroidery of rain, the seep of flames in the kitchen and guest rooms, a fidgeting of moths in the archives. Ah, nice. The last time I felt so beguiled by a view of a house was while looking out from the hamlet of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You can’t just sit and stare, however. Left idle, your characters will grow hungry, fatigued and unhinged, while useful items such as potent breeds of fungus will disintegrate. So move your cards around. Put somebody in the kitchen to make a meal out of that sack of grain you found, while somebody else combs the archives for the door code to the locked laboratory, and somebody else fumbles around in the courtyard with a trowel.</p>

<p>Once your party’s basic needs are met, you can spare a thought for the mysteries of the game’s house, beginning with the disappearance of the Ackeron family who once lived here. Notes hint at secrets in the sealed chapel and deep underground. Tunnels and “tears” and worrying designs upon the walls. Yes, this is like Darkest Dungeon in many more ways than one.
</p>
<p>
It’s also quite a lot like Cluedo, if Cluedo has been written by Poe or Lovecraft. In The Horror At High Rook, you plonk your characters down in rooms and give them items so they can complete tasks, ranging from deciphering books to running a spyglass over the crags beneath the mansion. These tasks have resource requirements corresponding to character stats, which can be amplified by means of other, supporting cards - some representing artefacts, some "visions", tendencies, qualities.</p>
<p>The “Gift of the Bee”, for example, might help your plague doctor Caligula with her lab work. “My blood buzzes, as if my body is a hive,” the card description explains, adding “I am in awe of the simple alchemies of the everyday”. There’s another “vision” card with simian properties that makes life easier in the machine shop, ensuring that your Mecanist always finds the correct spanner at her elbow.</p>
<p>These representations of the paranormal, together with the visual design of the cards themselves, put me heavily in mind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultist-simulator">Cultist Simulator</a> - a game I loved but haven't played since its primary creator, Alexis Kennedy, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alexis-kennedy-denies-allegations-of-abusive-or-coercive-behaviour">accused of harassment by several women</a> (allegations he has denied). I'm still thinking about how that association shapes my feelings about The Horror Of Highrook. It's very much a case of one game being haunted by another.
</p>
<p>
The writing so far is wordier than you'd find in Cultist Simulator - a bit too opulent when you’re trying to process a bunch of card timers or attend to several characters who need resting or feeding, but there’s always the pause button. There are some more obvious rough edges. Atticus Hawk, the streetwise muscle in my group of occult investigators, has an accent I can’t quite hear in my head. Is he from Blighty or the States? It feels like the developer, former Big Robot lead programmer Tom Betts, hasn’t quite decided. But perhaps I just need to get used to Atticus. I’ve barely played this game for half-an-hour and there are many more layers to peel away.

<p>NetEase has <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1890096608580366518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the biggest and most lucrative Marvel Rivals tournament series to date. The Marvel Rivals Invitational will see teams across the world compete in one of four regional tournaments, with $400,000 on the line across the whole series.</p>



<p>Could this be the first major step toward a serious Marvel Rivals esports scene?</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-invitational-announced">Marvel Rivals Invitational Announced</h2>



<p>The Marvel Rivals Invitational will consist of four separate tournaments, one for each major region. Each region’s tournament will feature its own $100,000 prize pool, meaning a total of $400,000 will be given out across the five week span. The Marvel Rivals Invitational will begin with the Oceanic tournament, then Asia, then EMEA, and finally North America.</p>



<p>The matches will be broadcast on both the official Marvel Rivals <a href="http://twitch.tv/marvelrivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch channel</a> and <a href="https://youtube.com/@MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>. Here are the dates for each region:</p>



<ul>
<li>Oceania – February 15-16</li>



<li>Asia – February 22-23</li>



<li>EMEA – February 28-March 2, March 7-9</li>



<li>North America – March 14-16, March 21-23</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Full schedule for Marvel Rivals Invitational</figcaption></figure>



<p>NetEase and Marvel Rivals have been hesitant to jump head first into a dedicated esports scene. Many point to the rushed creation of the Overwatch League as something that did more harm than good, as OWL was announced the same year that Overwatch released. Back in January 2025, Marvel Rivals game director Guangyun Chen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that he wanted to cater to both casual and competitive players</a>. As of now, Marvel Rivals is not rushing to put together a massive esports league.</p>



<p>Still, there’s been no shortage of interest in a potential esports scene. Streaming star Shroud mentioned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potentially starting an organization</a> just to play Marvel Rivals back in January. He then <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1888686812044103965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he’s building an organization after reaching a $150,000 donation goal during a charity stream a month later. He also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1887877669955514717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met</a> with Sentinels CEO Rob Moore, who said he would be open to Shroud running a Marvel Rivals team under the Sentinels brand.</p>



<p>Is a tournament of this size going to ignite the Marvel Rivals esports scene ?Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Ubisoft is happy with the pre-launch build for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Despite multiple delays that pushed the game out of 2024 to March 20, 2025, Ubisoft’s CEO Yves Guillemot says that the interest in the game has seen strong preorders overall.</p>



<p>During Ubisoft’s Q3 2025 <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2GbdOQTUuRZV3mqGXgTfeK/520f2262c4f60b4bc13f0f3a59ec37e7/Ubisoft_FY25_Q3_PR_English_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call on Thursday</a>, Guillemot said that preorders for Assassin’s Creed Shadows are “tracking solidly, in line with those of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, the second most successful entry of the franchise”.</p>



<p>Aside from the pre-orders, Ubisoft says that the previews of the game have been strong from multiple angles.</p>



<p>“Early previews have been positive, praising its narrative and immersive experience, with both characters playing critical roles in the game’s storyline, as well as the quality and complementarity of the gameplay provided by the dual protagonist approach,” Guillemot said.</p>



<p>He continued: “I want to commend the incredible talent and dedication of the entire Assassin’s Creed’s team, who is working tirelessly to ensure that Shadows delivers on the promise of what is the franchise’s most ambitious entry yet.”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was originally scheduled for release on November 15, 2024. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was then delayed</a> to February 14,  2025 for more polish and updates. In January, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed again</a> to March 20.</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows preorders being as strong as they are? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <p>
Just days into its Kickstarter campaign, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> developer Failbetter's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallen-london">Fallen London</a> tabletop RPG adaptation has smashed its crowdfunding goal, raising over half a million pounds.
</p>
<p>
Fallen London, if you're unfamiliar, is a <a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com/login">free-to-play browser-based narrative adventure</a> that's been steadily expanding since its launch in 2009. At its heart is an alternate-universe version of Victorian London that was stolen by bats and carried to a vast underground cavern system deep beneath the Earth's surface - the centre of a darkly whimsical universe Failbetter has revisited in three standalone games: Sunless Sea, Sunless Sky, and Mask of Rose.
</p>
<p>
All three of those titles started life as Kickstarter campaigns, but for its latest crowdfunding endeavour, Failbetter is doing something a little bit different. Working in conjunction with Magpie Games, it's stepping away from the digital realm to crowdfund an officially licensed tabletop roleplaying game based on the Fallen London universe.

<figcaption>A brief overview of the Fallen London roleplaying game.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwamNFDfWGs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Being a Kickstarter, there are a variety of stretch goals and reward tiers, but the meat of the campaign consists of the Fallen London roleplaying game Core Book and the Guide to London supplement. Between them both, players can find all the rules, setting details, plot hooks, character types, conflicts, concerns, and dynamic systems - plus a sample 'venture' - they'll need as they start and chart their journey through the cavernous Neath.
</p>
<p>
There's obviously a lot more nuance to the Fallen London tabletop RPG than a single paragraph can do justice to, and there's plenty more detail (alongside a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiDpWURGrG8">video play-through</a>) on its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/magpiegames/fallen-london-the-roleplaying-game?ref=thanks-tweet">crowdfunding page</a>. And what's there is clearly resonating with potential backers; the campaign has already smashed its $50K funding target - raising more than $626K, or a little over half a million pounds - at the time of writing. And that's with 28 days still to go.
</p>
<p>
As to what Failbetter might be planning next in the world of video games following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mask-of-the-rose-review-kissing-optional-but-recommended-and-tricky">2023's darkly romantic visual novel Mask of the Rose</a>, the developer hasn't yet said. But the studio, which recently celebrated its 15th birthday, continues to expand Fallen London and it's <a href="https://failbettergames.com/news/fallen-london-firmament-recap-update-and-the-state-of-the-game-2025">also confirmed an unannounced game is in the works</a>.

This DLC, as well as the planned sequel, have been in the works for a while now, and while both could potentially whiff it, I have confidence because <em>Lies of P </em>was so thoroughly my shit that it made me shout.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lies of P - Director's Letter" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbCnjeUilhU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The Director's Letter talked about the plan for Lies of P after its release.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Lies of P </em>had much going against it: It can seem both hubristic and tiresome for a relatively green studio to say its making a Soulslike. The surface level absurdity of the pitch, <em>Pinocchio Bloodborne</em> with minor <em>Sekiro </em>characteristics, coupled with the fact that the game takes a while to settle into a rhythm, made it a hard sell. I was underwhelmed when I first played the demo. But <em>Lies of P</em>, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kunitsu-Gami</em></a>, massively benefited from the slack afforded to it by being on Game Pass. Once you give the game a few hours, the systems start to lock in place and the game starts firing on all cylinders.&nbsp;</p><p>If <em>Lies of P </em>had simply aped <em>Bloodborne </em>competently that would have been satisfying. <em>Bloodborne </em>is still peerless in FromSoft’s catalogue, its excellence made bittersweet by being trapped in the strange limbo of Sony’s involvement. But <em>Lies of P </em>blossoms into more than a simple imitator around the tail end of its second chapter. The game features a Weapon Assembly system, where handles and blades can be swapped interchangeably and weapons can be customized. Using different combinations impacts not only the moveset and efficacy, but the Fable Arts, special moves similar to Ashes of War in <em>Elden Ring</em>. <em>Lies of P</em> also features different elemental damage types that change in efficacy depending on the type of enemy being faced (puppets, carcasses, or alchemists). On top of this, P’s mechanical Legion Arm opens up a lot of possibilities in a way that’s not dissimilar to <em>Sekiro’s </em>Shinobi Prosthetic.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Krat develops into its own place over time. Credit: NEOWIZ Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>It should go without saying that <em>Lies of P </em>is difficult, and the game quickly developed a reputation for being harder than many of FromSoft’s recent offerings. You could debate this until you are blue in the face, and since its release the game has undergone multiple difficulty tweaks. What actually matters is that the game feels fantastic when it’s grinding you into dust – it’s a blissful, relentless pressure that keeps you coming back for more. It says much about the planning and success of <em>Lies of P </em>that people put it up to the level of scrutiny <em>Souls </em>games normally face. When nerds start getting into annoyingly granular arguments about boss nerfs and weapon balance, there’s a nonzero chance you have succeeded.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Krat develops into its own place over time. Credit: NEOWIZ Games</span></figcaption></figure><p>But what floored me is that <em>Lies of P</em> actually makes such a goofy premise work. Over the course of the game, Krat becomes a totally realized world. P’s relationship to Geppetto actually gains heft as the lore of the universe develops. Appropriately, the game ceases being simply an imitation and becomes real. This culminates in a “true” ending that is well realized, one with actual meat on it in ways that many of FromSoft’s endings lack (FromSoftware is not allowed to do another ending where a bunch of guys bow or someone sits on a throne.).</p><p><em>Lies of P</em> also features an absurd and fantastic post-credit surprise. Normally I hate teasers like that because the Marvel cinematic universe has so thoroughly abused the form in the last 17 years. What’s more, if you had spoiled the surprise for me at the beginning I would have told you that it was corny. But <em>Lies of P </em>ended on such a strong note for me that when I saw what it was hinting at, I started hooting and hollering. Oh you guys are doing <em>that</em>? <em>That’s </em>where you’re going with this? Hell yes, I’m sold, I’m locked in, let’s fucking gooooooo.&nbsp;<br>God damn, <em>Lies of P</em> rules, and writing this made me want to play it all over again.</p><figure><figcaption>I wish to return.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-continues-today-with-extended-hours/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Due to the PlayStation Network outage, Capcom has made the decision to extend the Open Beta Test by a full 24 hours across all platforms. The PlayStation Network outage occurred during the first weekend of the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test. Specifically, it happened on February 8, and as a result, millions of gamers were left without a way to play their games. This caused players to be locked out of all online services, even their single-player games, if they happened to own them digitally. While players who had them on the disc would be able to play, it would only be the case if the data of the game was already on the PlayStation and did not need to be installed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sony didn't really give much of a <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation/status/1888454556125708758" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reason</a> as to why the network was down for so long, but blamed the outage on an "operational issue." Luckily, it sounds as if it was just an internal error rather than the network being hacked from the outside and causing major data breaches across the board.</p>
<p>As a result of the network outage, the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2 will resume today at 7 PM PST / 10 PM ET / 3 AM GMT and will continue until February 17 at 6:59 PM PST / 9:59 PM ET / 2:59 AM GMT.</p>
<p>As the Open Beta Test takes place, players will be able to unlock the participation bonus that will become available in the full version of the game, which is set to release on February 28 on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether this game will run on your PC, Capcom has released a Benchmark for you to utilize, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-free-benchmark-and-updated-pc-requirements/">full specification requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Like the original beta, Open Beta Test 2 will include a character creator, where the data can then be transferred into the full game. It will also include a story mission and free-roaming hunts with cross-platform multiplayer. Compared to the first Beta Test, this one comes with additional content, such as fighting the Gypceros and the flagship monster of the game, Arkveld.</p>
<p>Alongside those new features, the Training Area and online features such as Private Lobbies and Online Single Player mode are also included in this upcoming Beta Test.</p>
<p>Although it's been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced by the Monster Hunter developers</a>, the performance and balance adjustments will not be available in this beta build; instead, the developers are instead focused on implementing these changes in the full release of the game.</p>
<p>Will you be participating in the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test 2? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on February 28 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Season 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is themed around ninjas, so there's no better time to bring in the heroes in a half-shell.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision made the TMNT crossover announcement with a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1890098739915768252" rel="nofollow ">brief teaser clip</a> for Call of Duty, which shows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo peeking out from a sewer manhole. This likely means there will be operator skins for all four turtles. Call of Duty previously had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-tmnts-shredder-with-a-gun-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2/1100-6512543/">TMNT collab for 2022's Modern Warfare 2</a>, but the only character featured was Shredder.</p><p dir="ltr">The video doesn't give a specific date for the TMNT collaboration, teasing only that the turtles will be "coming soon." However, the Season 2 Reloaded update is set to include a set of melee weapons, which is rumored to be a pair of sais, nunchucks, a bo staff, and a skateboard. Leonardo's katanas were previously teased in the promotional art for the launch of Season 2. This means the turtles will likely appear with the midseason "Reloaded" update or sometime shortly after.</p><p dir="ltr">Leakers suggested the crossover will include a limited-time event and a special TMNT-themed game mode, but those details haven't been confirmed by Activision. The turtles themselves will likely be included as operator shop bundles.</p><p dir="ltr">A Terminator crossover event is also currently live in Black Ops 6 and Warzone until February 20.

			<p>Announced during yesterday's State of Play, Hell is Us was announced to get an official release date of September 4, 2025. This title comes from Rogue Factor, a company that made Necromunda: Underhive Wars and Mordheim: City of the Damned. This new ambitious title will be developed by Rogue Factor and then <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/hell-is-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Nacon</a>. If this game is something that you want to delve into, pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will follow suit in the next coming days for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

<p>This game was previously announced in 2022, with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">15-minute extended gameplay video</a> being released during a State of Play in September last year. In this video, viewers were introduced to the dark world of Hell is Us, where you'd have to explore a war-torn country, going on an investigative journey to uncover the past, as well as confronting the ongoing chaos through the country.</p>
<p>This new trailer introduces viewers to the main character Rémi, who is voiced by Elias Toufexis (Criminal Minds, Supernatural, Assassin's Creed, Starfield) in the English language version of the game.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell is Us. I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character and the events that have shaped his personality," says Elias Toufexis. "The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>Hell is Us is a third-person action-adventure game where you rely on melee combat for your main method of attack, with a heavy focus on player-incentivized exploration and a captivating story. Instead of being given markers to show them the way, players are encouraged to follow their instincts. This methodology is being used as an homage and return to the roots of adventure games from the 90s, where hand-holding in video games was very minimal.</p>
<p>You play as Rémi, a protagonist who is on an investigative journey to find who he was in a country that was torn apart by civil war. Along the way, he'll find supernatural creatures that are reminiscent of ancient headstones and monuments that were found in the region.</p>
<p>Along with the Standard Edition of the game, there will also be a Deluxe Edition that you can purchase, giving you some in-game goods. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hell is Us</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for Rémi</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
<li>Hollow Walker Skin + 1 Additional Skin for The Drone</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Secret Code for in-game bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you pre-order the game, you will be rewarded with a Military Pack. If you pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition, you'll get 72-hour early access to the title.</p>

<p>According to a reliable leaker, Fortnite’s next game collaboration could be with the popular Like a Dragon series (formerly Yakuza).&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR, known for providing players with Fortnite leaks at the earliest, recently posted about the Yakuza collaboration on <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889756376404029528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post revealed that the series’ beloved characters, Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, will be coming to Epic’s popular battle royale. <span>The information comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Wensoing" target="_blank">Wensoing</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X. Kiryu was the initial protagonist for the series, whereas Majima leads their latest game,</span>&nbsp;Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. </p>



<p>Fans are already pumped for the Fortnite x Yakuza collaboration, with many hoping for a slew of emotes and song tracks for which the Like a Dragon series is popular. Players have also started discussing alternate outfit options for the characters, such as “<a href="https://x.com/Hakuji_03/status/1889846041928933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Mad Dog style and the Cabaret Manager style</a>”. Some wonder if Ichiban Kasuga could be added in the future, too.</p>

<p>In other news, Fortnite is gearing up for a new season called Lawless, which will be released on February 21, 2025. The next adventure takes players to Crime City, where Big Dill is dropping their new single. According to ShiinaBR, the upcoming season’s vaults can’t be opened with key cards and must be broken into with <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1889782607249818034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">thermite</a>. Releasing the Yakuza collaboration with the upcoming season makes sense, too, as it matches the “Lawless” theme.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Pokémon fans attending this month's big meetup in Los Angeles are being encouraged to bring a can of soup along with them. 
</p>
<p>
The initiative is part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic's push to aid LA's wildfire relief efforts - which also involves a joint $1m donation from the developer and The Pokémon Company group.
</p>
<p>
Some fans were unsure whether Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles would still go ahead at the city's Rose Bowl Stadium later this month, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">January's devastating wildfires</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But after several weeks of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-offers-refunds-for-los-angeles-event-following-wildfires">Niantic confirmed at the start of February that the event would continue as planned - with optional refunds</a> for those who decided they no longer wanted to attend.
</p>
<p>
"For ticket-holding Trainers attending the in-person event, Niantic will host a donation drive at Rose Bowl Stadium supporting the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.
</p>
<p>
"The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank supports food pantries across Los Angeles County, and we encourage ticket-holding Trainers who are able and willing to participate in this drive to bring one can of protein or low sodium soup to the event."
</p>
<p>
Numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">video game and entertainment companies have donated to LA wildfire relief efforts</a> over the past month.
</p>
<p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the wildfires. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">He now faces up to a year in prison</a>.
