            <p>A man who sent almost 40 threatening messages to Nintendo, including death threats, has been sentenced to one year in prison and four years of probation by Kyoto District Court.</p>
<p>As reported by Japanese newsite <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/mito/20240724/1070024657.html">NHK</a>, Kenshin Kazama - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suspect-behind-nintendo-live-tokyo-cancellation-death-threats-arrested-in-japan">a 27-year-old employee of Hitachi City</a> - was accused of forcible obstruction of business after sending 39 threats using the inquiry form on Nintendo's website.</p>
<p>These threats were sent between August and November last year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-death-threats-suspect-charged-by-japanese-police">As reported in April</a>, the threats sent during this time included messages such as "I'm going to make you regret releasing such a crappy game to the world" and "I'm going to kill everyone involved".</p>
<p>The sender also threatened to "kill the people at the venue" if Nintendo held its Splatoon Koshien 2023 National Finals that December. As a result, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-live-2024-tokyo-event-cancelled-after-threats-to-staff">Nintendo took measures to ensure everyone's safety</a> by cancelling both this Splatoon event and its Nintendo Live Tokyo 2024 event, which was planned to run in January of this year.</p>
<p>At the time of this announcement, Nintendo said it had received "persistent threats targeting our employees" which had also "spread to spectators", but did not share specifics.</p>
<p>In his ruling on the 24th, Judge Hiroshi Kawakami said "the defendant was frustrated by the fact that he continued to lose in online matches of Nintendo games", and that he committed the crime as a way "to relieve stress".</p>
<p>The judge called the crime both "persistent" and "vicious".</p>

            <p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, the long-in-the-works sequel to developer GSC Game World's cult-classic 2007 post-apocalyptic horror shooter, has been delayed again. It's now due to launch on 20th November, giving the studio "breathing room to address technical issues".
</p>
<p>Word of the delay surfaced on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ebrihj/stalker_2_delayed_to_november_20/">reddit</a> today from a user who said they'd been emailed about the date change by GSC Game World. The news has now been publicly confirmed by the developer in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxeGyXSM5Pc">video</a> titled "Really, again?" posted to YouTube, below. </p>
<p>
Stalker 2 has, of course, had quite the journey to release. It was originally set to arrive in 2012, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-to-be-multi-platform">announced by GSC Game World two years prior</a>, but those plans were eventually shelved following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-we-will-do-our-best-to-continue">troubles at the studio</a>. It was a bit of a surprise, then, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apparently-stalker-2-is-happening-but-dont-get-too-excited">Stalker 2 re-emerged in 2018</a> with a new release window of 2021.
</p>
<p>
Since then, however, Stalker 2's development has had numerous setbacks. First, its release date moved to April 2022 before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-delayed-until-december">shifting again to December</a>, but the Kyiv-based GSC was then forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">put the game on hold</a> following Russian's invasion of Ukraine. Development resumed in May 2022, with some of the team relocating to Prague, but its release was moved to 2023 then 2024 amid an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-to-include-metaverse-of-nfts">NFT backlash</a>, claims of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">Russian hack</a>, and even an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-gsc-game-worlds-servers-have-been-damaged-by-a-fire-at-its-prague-office">office fire</a>.

<p>
When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-until-september">last heard from GSC</a>, Stalker 2 was scheduled to launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 5th September this year, but that release date has shifted again, this time to 20th November.
</p>
<p>"We know you might be tired of waiting," a statement included in the YouTube video's description reads, "and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more 'unexpected anomalies' (or simply 'bugs', as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding - it means the world to us. We're just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself."
</p>
<p>
To alleviate the wait a little, GSC has teamed up with Xbox to present a special Stalker 2 Developer Deep Dive on 12th August. This promises a "variety of never-before-seen content", including a video walkthrough of a story quest, plus footage providing a world overview, a look at various locations, new gameplay, and cutscenes.
</p>
<p>
Assuming no further delays, Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be available for Xbox Series X/S and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en#editions">GSC's website</a> when it launches on 20th November.

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been delayed again and will now be released around two months later than expected.</p>
<p>The second entry in the series by GSC Game World will now release on November 20th instead of September 5th to give the developers breathing room to address some technical issues with the game and deliver the experience players have eagerly been waiting for. A new trailer was also released, and you can find it below.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxeGyXSM5Pc</p>
<p>Thankfully, it's not all bad news today. The most comprehensive look at STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming during a Developer Deep Dive in collaboration with Xbox on August 12th. The Deep Dive will feature interviews and behind-the-scenes footage of the development process, as well as new footage, including a world overview, various locations, gameplay, and cutscenes. Lastly, the Deep Dive will also feature a full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.</p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on November 20th. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-good-hunting/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl feels modernized in ways that AAA games have developed over the years. A minimap has been replaced with a compass permanently affixed to the top of the screen, pointing to nearby points of interest and quest markers. Enemies are also marked with red dots when alive and gray X’s once they fall, giving the player a visual reminder of where to find their backpacks and that sweet low-level loot within. The firing mode indicator located beneath your ammo count indicates whether the weapon is toggled to semi-auto or fully automatic fire. Most of the information that needs to be conveyed to the player is presented in unobtrusive HUD elements shrunk down to the edges of the screen, giving more screen real estate for players to admire the corrupted beauty of the Ukrainian Zone.</em></p>

<p>GSC Game World has just announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been delayed <strong>again </strong>by another two months. It will now be released on November 20, 2024. This will come as a blow to the fans who were expecting to get their hands on the post-apocalyptic, open-world epic this coming September. It has been <strong>years </strong>since Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was revealed, but countless issues have surfaced that prevented GSC from delivering the game according to an original timeline.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness">Self-Awareness</h2>



<p>In a brief trailer, GSC Game World revealed the delay with a tongue-in-cheek nod to the fact that it is just the latest in a long line of postponements. The video is even titled ‘Really, Again?’</p>

</p></figure>







<p>It’s not all bad news, though. The revelation was accompanied by the promise of a developer-led deep dive into Stalker 2 on August 12. This will give players an unparalleled look at the game behind the scenes and on the surface, with GSC walking through an entire story quest and hosting panels and new development footage.</p>



<p>In a statement, the game director at GSC, Yevhen Grygorovych, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding – it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a long journey, and it has just gotten a little longer. Given how good the game looks, it’s a small price to pay to have any remaining bugs ironed out of it before it hits the market.</p>

<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl — Really, Again?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxeGyXSM5Pc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The team writes, “We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). […] We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding – it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.”</p>
<p>Either way, the team is also planning to give a much deeper look at the game in the near future, with a Developer Deep Dive video set for 12th August to look behind the scenes on the game’s creation and explore more of how the game actually plays.</p>
<p>This deep dive video will feature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interviews and behind-the-scenes of the development process;</li>
<li>Lots of new footage, including world overview, various locations, gameplay and cutscenes;</li>
<li>A full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives a little more time to catch up on the series so far. Console players have been able to visit the twisted world of STALKER for the first time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-review-ps5-xbox-ps4/">a STALKER trilogy remaster</a> earlier this year. Dipping into those games, Jim said, “the trilogy presents console players with an opportunity to play through these STALKER titles in the same condition that PC players have been able to experience them for the last decade and a half. As someone who struggled to get them running on my own PC back around the time they launched, being able to finally venture into the Zone on console has been immensely satisfying, even if these ageing first person shooters don’t cater for modern gamer sensibilities.”</p>

            <p>Animal caretaking sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> is about being an ordinary zookeeper working in an ordinary zoo. What's that? There are no ordinary zoos? My mistake. Let me start again. Animal caretaking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> Zoochosis is about being a stressed-out zookeeper in a hideous zoo where the giraffes have tendrils coming out of their chests and the kangaroos have rows of chattering teeth in their marsupial pouch. There, got it right in the end. We've known about the development of this terror-heavy tourist attraction since its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/animal-loving-horror-zoochosis-is-an-open-homage-to-the-thing">announcement early this year</a>. But now the upcoming horror sim has been given an autumn release date in a new trailer.</p>

<p>It's coming out September 23rd, say developers Clapperheads. "Zoochosis", as Edwin informs us, is an actual term for the unusual behaviour exhibited by animals in real life zoos, such as pacing or excessive scratching. But usually the zebras of reality don't grow a set of fully functioning gnashers in their anus. It is these travails you'll be dealing with as the feeder and cleaner of the wildlife in the upcoming horror game.</p>
<p>"Interact with the animals, take care of them, choose and prepare a meal for them, restock and clean up after them in the enclosure," says the game's blurb <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458560/Zoochosis/">on Steam</a>, while also noting something is deeply wrong with the animals. "But you can save them. You can discover the cause of the infection, create a vaccine and cure them."</p>
<p>I enjoy the creature design on display, and the obligatory suggestion that humanity is responsible for the monstrofication of the animal kingdom and earth's natural bounty as a whole. I'm not sure how deep the sim elements go and how much it will veer off into straight horror. We'll have to wait and see. Either way, I'm certain it'll appeal to a lot of fans of Carpenter-esque nightmares as well as the "fucked-up theme park" aficionados. Some people get their escapism from pretending to be a farmer in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> and petting the nice chickens. Others? Others want to mop up the human viscera from the floor of the bone-hippo enclosure. Let's just be glad there is a place for animal lovers of all stripes in this world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-yoshi-pixel-art-set-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Lego has revealed a 2D-style Super Mario World set featuring Mario and Yoshi.
</p>
<p>
The set is viewable today at San Diego Comic-Con, and official product images of it are already circulating online (thanks, <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-71438-super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-is-a-16-bit-ode-to-the-super-nes-classic/">Jay's Brick Blog</a>).
</p>
<p>
Reportedly, the set will launch on 1st October and feature 1215 pieces. We'll update again when it's officially announced with details of pricing. 
</p>
<p>
The set is the latest entry into Lego's adult-orientated Super Mario range, following earlier impressive sets such as the fold-out ? Block and Bowser statue. 
</p>
<p>
This time, the focus is firmly on Nintendo's earlier heritage once again - with a design based on 1990 SNES platformer Super Mario World.

<p>
Mario wears his yellow cape from the game, and rides atop Yoshi. A small crank can be seen in imagery for the set, and it looks like this will operate Yoshi's arms and legs, making Mario's loyal steed appear to move. 
</p>
<p>
It's a busy time for Lego sets based upon video games. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Legend of Zelda: Deku Tree set</a> due to launch on 1st September, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus">Lego's big new Fortnite range</a> kicks off on 1st October.
</p>
<p>
And then there's a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enjoy-8-inches-of-lego-shadow-the-hedgehog-this-october">eight-inch Shadow the Hedgehog bust</a>, also revealed today.

            <p>
Forthcoming action-RPG Phantom Blade Zero will have a seamless, non-linear map "just like the Souls games before <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>."
</p>
<p>
That's according to the game's director, who (ironically) goes by the moniker Soulframe, as interviewed by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/dev-behind-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-says-its-seamless-non-linear-map-is-just-like-the-souls-games-before-elden-ring/">Games Radar</a> discussing its world design.
</p>
<p>
"It's just like the old Souls games," said Soulframe. "You move around and explore in a seamless map, it's just not a huge open-world map. But every region is connected together seamlessly."
</p>

<p>
"There are certain gates requiring keys, and the keys are obtained from some missions," Soulframe continued. "There's still some process you go through, but it's non-linear. There are always multiple paths you can go through. It's just like the Souls games before Elden Ring."
</p>
<p>
It's an intriguing comparison, considering the developer has continually stated Phantom Blade Zero is not a Soulslike.
</p>
<p>
In the same Games Radar interview, Soulframe described the game as an action-RPG with "combo-driven, heart-pumping combat that is hectic, rewarding, and exhilarating".
</p>
<p>
The developer also stated in a post-Summer Games Fest Q&amp;A the game is not a Soulslike. "It's worth stressing again that 'making another Souslike' was never part of the plan," reads the statement. "We did take inspiration from Soulslike games, such as multi-layered maps, multiple approach paths, and hidden nooks and crevices, but the similarities stop there. There will be difficulty options, and you won't have to face respawned mobs after you die or interact with checkpoints."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/phantom-blade-zero/soulslike-interview">PCGamesN</a>, Soulframe discussed difficulty in comparison to the Souls games, adding the studio doesn't have the "privilege of FromSoftware" to make players frustrated.
</p>
<p>
"We want our players to enjoy the pure combat, the story, and the world; that's the point," said Soulframe. "As a new studio, I don't think we have the privilege of FromSoftware to make you frustrated while you're playing. We'd rather keep it accessible to everyone so that everyone can enjoy it."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slick-looking-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-blends-chinese-martial-arts-with-punk-spirit">Phantom Blade Zero was first revealed at Sony's PlayStation Showcase in 2023</a>, and was shown once again at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-summer-game-fest-2024">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>. The action game is inspired by Chinese martial arts and Wuxia.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-native-4k-challenge-rtx-4080/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal-engine-5-makes-running-games-at-native-4k-resolution-a-challenge-on-an-rtx-4080.936348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-native-4k-challenge-rtx-4080/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The NVIDIA RTX 4080 GPU is among the most powerful available on the market, but even so, it struggles quite a bit running Unreal Engine 5 games at native 4K resolution with decent performance.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> highlights how the NVIDIA GPU has trouble running the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games, such as Nobody Wants to Die, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2, Lords of the Fallen, The First Descendant and Remnant 2, at native 4K resolution at framerates higher than 30 FPS. Only with the help of NVIDIA DLSS, the GPU can reach 60 FPS and above in these games, although in more than a few cases, performance still isn't at the level it should be.</p>
<p><iframe title="RTX 4080 Unreal Engine 5 - How Good Can it Run UE5 Games at 4K? | Test in 12 Unreal Engine 5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y6fjhoA3l34?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that even games that don't use some of the Unreal Engine 5 most taxing features, like Lumen and Nanite, can't run decently at native 4K resolution even on an RTX 4080 isn't particularly surprising, as over and over in the past few weeks we have seen how demanding is the new version of the engine by Epic. Seeing a game powered by the engine run at native 4K resolution with decent performance, in particular, may be something we won't often see, even with more powerful hardware, as the engine has been built around <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-cant-run-native-4k-engine-design/">upscaling.</a></p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.4. You can learn more about the changes introduced by it on the engine's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

"That has, for lack of a better term, sort of screwed us over, somewhat,” Carter said.</p><p>As a result of Bethesda’s Fallout 4 updates, the release of Fallout London is slightly fiddly. If you get the mod on GOG, it’s compatible with Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition from both GOG and Steam.

The Ukrainian studio was forced to relocate to Prague in the Czech Republic, and a member of the development team, Volodymyr Yezhov, was later killed in action while fighting for Ukraine. The studio's offices in Prague were also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/accidental-fire-damages-stalker-2-developers-offices/1100-6517609/" data-ref-id="1100-6517609">damaged in a fire</a> in late 2023, but fortunately, no one was hurt.</p><p>GSC Game World also announced that it'll be doing a deep dive into the game on August 12 as part of a new developer diary video. This preview will feature a variety of never-before-seen content, interviews, and a behind-the-scenes look into the development process. Fans can also expect to see new footage showing a world overview, various locations, and a walkthrough of one of the story quests.</p><p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-the-horrors-of-the-wasteland/1100-6524068/" data-ref-id="1100-6524068">Stalker 2 gameplay</a> was also shown off during the June <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.

		<p>A new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> RPG is now available to download and play, just in time for those currently watching House of the Dragon season 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Game of Thrones: Legends Official Pre-Registration Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ptiMkPE6eRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>However, if you were hoping to explore the Seven Kingdoms in a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/skyrim">Skyrim</a> or Witcher style AAA adventure then Game of Thrones: Legends may not be for you. Developed by Farmville creator <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/zynga">Zynga</a> – who also launched new arena shooter, Star Wars Hunters – this is a mobile match 3 puzzler that puts you at the helm of your own warband battling your way through Westeros.</p>
<p>The big draw here is that you can recruit a roster of fan favourite characters from Game of Thrones and the more recent House of the Dragon TV adaptation.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones: Legends Overview</h3>
<p><em><strong>CREATE A LEGENDARY TEAM OF CHAMPIONS</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Seize the chance to team up Khal Drogo, Arya Stark, the Hound, and more! Build your house and train your team to increase their power, unlock new abilities, and fight for Westeros.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>EPIC PUZZLE-RPG GAMEPLAY</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Make matches and strategically clear puzzles to charge your Champions’ special abilities. Match 3 or more gems to solve puzzles. Set up amazing combos to deal extra damage and savage your enemies in this epic puzzle game. Become the most powerful player in Westeros as you progress deeper in your Westeros story by maxing out your champions’ power and completing key milestones.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>UNLEASH SPECIAL CHARACTER ABILITIES</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Exercise each Champions’ unique powerful ability by charging them up with matches. Strategically customize your team by equipping characters with deadly weapons or iconic items unique to them – such as pairing Jon Snow with Longclaw or Arya with Needle – to defeat your enemies and turn the tide of battle in your favor.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>BATTLE IN NARRATIVE-DRIVEN EVENTS</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Immerse yourself in Game of Thrones lore. Tackle special challenges or fight in limited time events and tournaments based on iconic moments to gain power and progress in your journey. For example, fight The Battle of the Bastards to add Ramsay Bolton or Wun Wun, the Wildling Giant, to your collection.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>FORM A NEW HOUSE &amp; JOIN ALLIANCE WARS</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Partner your noble House of Westeros with Houses commanded by other players to form an Alliance. Work together to fight enemies for bigger rewards, and collectively compete against rival Alliances in Tournaments &amp; Special Events to climb the rungs of power and conquer the Seven Kingdoms.</em></p>
<p>Great video games based on the popular license have been sadly few and far between. Aside from Cyanide’s flawed but fascinating <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/06/13/game-of-thrones-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Game of Thrones RPG</a> and Telltale’s star-studded, story-driven adaptation, fans have had to settle for mobile and browser based games, Legends being the latest addition.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-announces-exclusive-mrbeast-collaboration</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-now-announces-an-exclusive-mrbeast-collaboration.936309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-announces-exclusive-mrbeast-collaboration<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and developer Niantic are gearing up for even more updates heading to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> this month. Following a successful release in Japan last year, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> hit 15 million downloads in six months, promoting a focus on a real-world Monster Hunter experience whilst hunting monsters with simple and authentic gameplay.</p>
<p><br>
Like many mobile games, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> makes use of a season system, with two – Vernal Invader, and Dancing in the Tempest – under its belt already, it’s time for the next major update centering on group hunts.</p>
<p><br>
Niantic is set to debut a new system called Dimensional Links, which is a sort of evolution from the game’s concept of all of the monsters spawning into our world through Dimensional Rifts. The story here is that some of those monsters got entangled and became Dimensional Link monsters instead.</p>
<p><br>
What this means is that they’re caught between worlds and these monsters can be in multiple places on Earth at the same time.</p>
<p><br>
The way it works is, by tapping on a Dimensional Link monster, players can team up to hunt it with three other faraway hunters. If you’re inclined, you can also fight these monsters with a party of friends, but currently not with a local party and faraway hunters combined. Dimensional Link monsters can also not be captured for later. The whole idea is that this creates more opportunities to play with others, and opens up the game to newcomers as well.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/i3ng5zlg.jpeg?itok=ua4dRX20 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/i3ng5zlg.jpeg?itok=x3u7frfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
On top of this announcement, Niantic revealed that <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> will launch a collaboration with popular YouTube personality MrBeast starting July 27. The team wanted to do something with meaningful integration and do this won’t just be something superficial – there’s a whole custom narrative built around MrBeast, his theming, and in-game items.</p>
<p><br>
“<em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is super fun and also encourages people to go outside, explore, and get active,” said Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, “Working with Niantic on my very own <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> quest line has been fantastic. I love that they partner with creators and trust them to know how to reach their audience.”</p>
<p><br>
The plot of this event will involve MrBeast asking for help, giving users the ability to slay monsters so that MrBeast and his priorities can be secured. By doing these quests, players can obtain an exclusive custom MrBeast sword and shield.<br>
The weapon set is notable because it’s non-elemental and will be one of the strongest in that class at grade 10.</p>
<p><br>
Niantic developed this partnership exclusively with MrBeast for <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> – it won’t be ported over to any of the other Monster Hunter games, as an example.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mrbeast-collab_0.jpg?itok=KLJq4cn2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mrbeast-collab_0.jpg?itok=BAbuGUTg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
As they want it to be newcomer friendly, the first step of the involved quest will have players forging this weapon, with which they can then upgrade and obtain special skills for it known as MrBeast Challenge! You’ll really want to upgrade this one to grade 6, and then after that common materials can get it up to grade 10.</p>
<p><br>
In addition to the weapon, players can collect MrBeast-themed merch for free including a hoodie, face paint, and an exclusive quest medal. There’s also a guild card background to show off Monster Hunter Now’s first entertainment collaboration.</p>
<p><br>
The MrBeast event will run from July 27 to September. <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is currently available for iOS and Android platforms.</p>

            <p>The team at Double Fine is offering Xbox 360 owners free digital codes for Kinect Party -  the sequel to its eccentric title Happy Action Theater - ahead of the console's digital store closure later this month.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Microsoft is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">close its Xbox 360 digital store on 29th July</a>, as announced last year. In addition, the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV app on the Xbox 360 will no longer function. Following this date, users will still be able to play Xbox 360 games on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

<p>To prepare for this closure, developer Double Fine - which is also known for the likes of Psychonauts and Brütal Legend - has asked its Xbox 360 players to make sure they download any games ahead of time, "just to be sure" they can retain access to them after 29th July.</p>
<p>It also noted that while "most" of its games will still be available digitally on Xbox One and upwards, one specific title will not be: Kinect Party - as the Xbox 360 Kinect is not supported by later Xbox hardware.</p>
<p>"Alas, digital preservation evangelists are again proven correct," Double Fine wrote.</p>
<p>In light of this, the studio is offering anyone interested in giving the game a whirl for themselves a Kinect Party code. Codes are limited, Double Fine said, but if you are one such Xbox 360 Kinect player ("It's one of them wavy arm games!") who fancies a shot, you can email <a href="mailto:support@doublefine.com">support@doublefine.com</a> to ask for one.</p>
<p>Other Xbox 360 games, including the Kinect's My Self Defence Coach, are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-gets-swathe-of-discounts-ahead-of-closure">currently discounted on the console's digital store</a>. Once more, the digital store is set to close down next week, on 29th July.</p> <div>

            <p>
Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii believes modern advancements in game graphics make silent protagonists "look like an idiot".
</p>
<p>
Horii recently discussed the topic of RPGs with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> director and producer Katsura Hashino, an excerpt of which was published by <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/240722m">Denfaminicogamer</a> (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/dragon-quest-creator-talks-about-an-unexpected-challenge-the-series-is-facing-due-to-graphics-becoming-more-realistic/">Automaton</a>). 
</p>
<p>
One challenge Horii believes the Dragon Quest franchise is facing is how a protagonist should be depicted now that graphics have become more realistic - allowing for more detailed and expressive designs.
</p>

<a aria-label="DRAGON QUEST III HD 2D Remake – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSd31mFvOTU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>

The Dragon Quest games have had silent protagonists, or "the symbolic protagonist" as Horii puts it, which allows players to see themselves as the main character and project their own emotions. This choice was partly due to technological restrictions at the time.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, graphics are more lifelike and detailed. Horii joked: "As game graphics evolve and grow increasingly realistic, if you make a protagonist who just stands there, they will look like an idiot."
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, a speaking protagonist can be hard for players to relate to. "That's why, the type of protagonist featured in Dragon Quest becomes increasingly difficult to depict as games become more realistic," said Horii. "This will be a challenge in the future too."
</p>
<p>
Horii's comments could easily apply to a number of major series, including the likes of The Legend of Zelda and Pokémon, which have historically all had silent protagonists.
</p>
<p>
With Link in particular, Nintendo have found ways to make the character expressive within the confines of the visual aesthetic, without the need for speech. That rings true for the detail of Tears of the Kingdom as much as the minimalist approach for Wind Waker.
</p>
<p>
The forthcoming HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 3 will allow players to choose between a male or female protagonist (as per the original) and it now includes voiced dialogue for some characters. However, this is all about modernising the pixel graphics of the original game, so Horii's comments instead may hint that Dragon Quest 12 - the next new game in the series - could have a voiced protagonist.
</p>
<p>
The previous game, Dragon Quest 11, does include a voice option for the protagonist but this only adds grunts rather than full dialogue.
</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-is-the-excuse-i-need-to-properly-play-this-iconic-series">hands-on with the Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D remake</a> recently, describing it as "a balance of old and new that remains firmly in retro territory, but with tasteful touches to smoothen out the experience."

</p>
<p>
Do you like a silent protagonist, or would you prefer main characters to all speak?
</p>

                <p>Cherrypick Games has announced its next project, and it's a stylish-looking survival game called Angst: A Tale of Survival. Cherrypick Games, based in Poland, is known for its <a href="https://cherrypickgames.com/our-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">slate of free mobile games</a>, but Angst is the studio's first major premium game for PC and console.</p><p>The studio says fans can think of the game as "Don't Starve meets Dredge meets Hades" in terms of the genres and tone it's aiming for. The game features roguelite progression and what's described as a "contemplative, quest-driven narrative." Take a look at the cinematic trailer below to get a feel for the game's tone, vibe, and setting.</p>

<p>Players awaken in an old cabin in the middle of a frozen taiga, and they don't know what happened to them besides how they got stuck in a terrible snowstorm. Players try to discover what happened, but the twist is that things start to feel oddly familiar.</p><p>Angst is an atmospheric wilderness survival game where players explore a "limbo-like world" where they can't trust that what they're seeing is actually real.</p><p>"As you venture deeper into the snowy wilderness, you’ll encounter an array of biomes with unique characteristics and find new quests that unravel the secrets of this world's mysterious past," reads a line from the game's description. "To survive in this frozen realm, you must craft tools and weapons, hunt, fish, and upgrade your skills and gear."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339003-angstscreenshot%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4339003" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339003-angstscreenshot%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4339003"></a><figcaption>Angst: A Tale of Survival releases early next year</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339003-angstscreenshot%281%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339004-angstscreenshot%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339005-angstscreenshot%282%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339006-angstscreenshot%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339007-angstscreenshot%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339008-angstscreenshot%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339009-angstscreenshot%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339010-angstscreenshot%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339011-angstscreenshot%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339012-angstscreenshot%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339013-angstscreenshot%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339014-angstscreenshot%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339015-angstscreenshot%2812%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4339004,1300-4339005,1300-4339006,1300-4339007,1300-4339008,1300-4339009,1300-4339010,1300-4339011,1300-4339012,1300-4339013,1300-4339014,1300-4339015" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339004-angstscreenshot%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339005-angstscreenshot%282%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339006-angstscreenshot%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339007-angstscreenshot%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339008-angstscreenshot%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339009-angstscreenshot%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339010-angstscreenshot%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339011-angstscreenshot%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339012-angstscreenshot%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339013-angstscreenshot%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339014-angstscreenshot%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4339015-angstscreenshot%2812%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339004-angstscreenshot%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339005-angstscreenshot%282%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339006-angstscreenshot%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339007-angstscreenshot%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339008-angstscreenshot%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339009-angstscreenshot%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339010-angstscreenshot%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339011-angstscreenshot%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339012-angstscreenshot%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339013-angstscreenshot%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339014-angstscreenshot%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4339015-angstscreenshot%2812%29.png"></figure><p>Angst prioritizes environmental exploration over what could be considered more traditional combat and skill-based challenges, its developer said.

		<p>Sci-fi hero shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> won’t have a battle pass, developer Firewalk Studios has confirmed, with Gameplay Animation Director <a href="https://x.com/markderidder/status/1816152226815172785">Mark DeRidder</a> quipping that “You own Concord, Concord doesn’t own you.”</p>
<p>The news comes from Firewalk answering some key questions about the game in the wake of the two Concord beta weekends on PS5 and PC.</p>


<p>Concord will be a paid game, coming in at £35, as opposed to being free-to-play like obvious genre rivals <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/valorant">Valorant</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>. However, even paid games have long adopted the premium battle passes as a way to make more money over time. Concord will instead rely on more traditional character progression and levelling up to let players earn more cosmetics.</p>
<p>There will, however, still be a seasonal approach to the game’s post-launch plans, which Firewalk will detail more broadly in the new future. An overarching focus on character-led narrative will also be pushed on with regular new cutscenes between the various Freegunners.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s the full FAQ from Firewalk:</p>

<p><strong>How many maps and modes will be available at launch?</strong></p>
<p>There will be 12 distinct maps available when Concord releases in August. including the five maps you experienced during the Early Access and Open Beta weekends. All six of the modes featured in the Concord Beta – Takedown. Trophy Hunt, Area Control, Signal Chase, Clash Point, and Cargo Run-will all be available on day one, as well. These lineups will grow soon after Concord’s release through regular post-launch seasons and updates, which will introduce new Freegunners, maps, and more.</p>
<p><strong>What other kinds of progression rewards will be in the game?</strong></p>
<p>The progression rewards you saw in the beta are just a small sample of the unlockable items in the full game. When Concord launches, we’ll have hundreds of items to customize your Freegunners, which you can earn just by playing the game, completing jobs, and leveling up your account and characters. These rewards are cosmetic, do not impact gameplay, and include: Freegunner outfits, wearables, and accessories, as well as weapon skins, weapon charms, victory and defeat poses, and drop-in animations</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a Battle Pass?</strong></p>
<p>Concord does not have a Battle Pass. We wanted to focus our attention on making Concord a rewarding and robust experience on day one, where just playing the game, leveling up your accounts and characters, and completing jobs yields meaningful rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be post-launch content?</strong></p>
<p>Launch is just the beginning. We will be introducing new Freegunners, maps, modes, and more through regular post-launch seasons and updates available to all players at no additional cost. We’ll be diving deeper into our post-launch roadmap very soon – stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Will there be more in-game cinematics?</strong></p>
<p>The beta showcased the first three of our cinematic vignettes, which will release weekly in-game at launch. As you saw, these brief cinematics will allow you to get to know the characters and learn about life as a Freegunner and the broader Concord Galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>How many Freegunner Variants will be in the game?</strong></p>
<p>While the beta introduced you to the first Variants for Lennox, Haumar, and Teo, in the full game, there will be multiple unique Variants for each of our launch roster of 16 playable Freegunners. These Variants will be unlockable through progression and special weekly Variant Unlock Jobs on the Job Board, beginning at launch.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game have a leaver penalty system?</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring teams are complete and evenly matched throughout a game is a priority for us. We are exploring a variety of methods, including leaver penalty systems, to incentivize players to start-and stay incomplete teams. Stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Galactic Guide be available at launch? </strong></p>
<p>Yes! The Galactic Guide is an important part of how your journey in Concord will unfold at launch and beyond, unlocking more information and narrative threads about our characters and the broader Concord Galaxy as you level up your characters and account.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be solo PvP modes, like Free for All?</strong></p>
<p>At launch, we will have six distinct 5v5 team-based modes, which range from more approachable respawn-based modes. like Trophy Hunt, to more competitive modes, like Cargo Run-all of which can be queued for as a solo player.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/ea-backtracks-on-some-apex-legends-season-22-battle-pass-changes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Respawn have backtracked on some of the changes to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> battle pass system, so while the game will still be going ahead with now having two battle passes per season, players will once again be able to buy the Premium battle pass by using Apex Coins that are earned through the battle passes themselves.</p>
<p>Apex Legends Season 22 will have two battle passes over its 3 month runtime. Starting on 5th August and through to the mid-season ‘Split’ on 17th September, and then from 17th September through to the end of the season, there will be two smaller 60-level battle passes that should be easier to complete for players than the 110-level passes previously seen.</p>


<p>The originally announced change would also have done away with the ability to use premium Apex Coins currency to buy the premium passes. This has been a common mechanic for free-to-play games to keep player engagement high as they would rather play than pay for the premium cosmetics.</p>
<p>Backtracking will see Respawn restore this ability with Split 2, while the Split 1 pass will be unlocked by completing “simple in-game challenges”. Another change is that, where they had previously planned to double the number of Crafting Materials included with a battle pass to 2400, this has gone back to 1200.</p>
<p>Respawn’s full statement reads:</p>

<p><i>To Our Apex Community:&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>You’ve spoken, and we’ve listened. With the release of Season 22 </i><b><i>we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins.</i></b> <i>We recognize that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better—that’s on us.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s our intention to improve the overall value and experience across our Battle Pass offerings. For a summary of the updated Battle Pass offerings starting with Season 22 Split 2 on September 17th, please check out the infographic. Here’s what we’d like you to know:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>With the launch of Season 22 on August 6th through Split 1, we want to give you an opportunity to get the Premium Battle Pass. You can unlock it by completing a series of simple in-game challenges.&nbsp;</i></li>
<li><i>Starting with Split 2 on September 17th, you can get the Premium Battle Passes the same way as before: by using 950 Apex Coins. You’ll be able to earn enough Apex Coins via the Battle Pass to get future passes.</i></li>
<li><i>The Battle Pass options now include better rewards—and with the re-tuned Battle Pass challenges, it’ll be faster to complete at only 60 levels.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Moving forward, we recognize that we need to be more timely, transparent, and consistent in our communications with you. </i><b><i>Your priorities are our priorities: cheaters, game stability, and quality of life updates are top of mind. We need to get better and it’s why we’re acknowledging them here.</i></b><i> As a next step, there are a number of improvements and game stability bug fixes coming in Season 22 that will be outlined in the Patch Notes dropping on August 5, 2024.</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you again for all of your passion and time in Apex Legends, because we couldn’t do this without you.</i></p>

            <p>In a certifiably not-great week for gaming CPUs, AMD have announced that the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-computex-2024-pc-hardware-announcements-that-are-actually-interesting">Ryzen 9000</a> series is being delayed for a few days. That’s thanks to initial production units not being up to standards, an AMD executive admitted, and comes shortly after rivals Intel copped to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-algorithm-among-the-many-other-things-they-ruin-is-causing-stability-problems-on-intel-core-cpus">potentially chip-killing fault</a> in their latest Core processors. Ah well, there’s always – oh, wait. No. Those are the only two.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jack Huynh, a general manager in AMD’s Computing and Graphics dvision, <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1816210711254639031">Xeeted</a> that "a short delay in retail availability" will affect the new Ryzens while they iron out some kinks discovered in the first batches. Having been previously expected on July 31st, the 9000 series era will instead begin with the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X on August 8th, while the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X are delayed until August 15th.</p>
<p>"During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations", Hunh said. "Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units."</p>
<p>While the exact issues with these early Ryzens hasn’t been specified, it does sound like more of an inherent hardware problem than what’s been ailing those Intel chips. While the affected 13th and 14th Gen Core CPUs can fail entirely, the accused cause – a microcode algorithm sending incorrect voltage requests – can, Intel say, be fixed up with what is more or less a firmware patch. Not something that demands a full recall-and-replace operation, as AMD are undertaking. That said, better to take a little extra time to release something that works, rather than launch now and fix later, eh? Eh? AMD please do actually fix them so this optimism doesn’t look childishly misplaced in five weeks' time, cheers.</p>

			<p>Coming to any game over a year since its release can be a daunting prospect. Stuffed full of alterations, adaptions, and updates, it’s often hard to know where to begin. This is even truer of a complete edition, which can be overwhelming in the sheer weight of content it throws at you from the very beginning. Add to this that the game is a rock-hard evil blighter that hates anyone who plays it and you can see why I was a little anxious about commencing playing Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty – Complete Edition for review.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty Complete Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2odHwyi49t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hailing from Team Ninja, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty wowed souls-like fans when it debuted last year with its fluid, violent, swordplay and surprisingly coherent story. Now the Complete Edition is here, and it is an absolute beast of a release. Alongside the original game, you get all three DLC packs; ‘Battle of Zhongyuan’, ‘Conqueror of Jiandong’, and ‘Upheaval in Jingxiang’. That means all the new weapon types and armour sets are available from the get-go. As is all the equipment and stages from Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s collaborations with Lies of P, Nioh 2, and Naraka: Bladepoint.</p>


<p>If all that wasn’t enough, and it really should be, you get a vast swathe of new endgame content that plays like a roguelike and, like Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, never seems to end. That’s an awful lot of Wo Long for your wonga.</p>
<p>If you were thinking that Team Ninja would have come up with some fresh presentation for the Complete Edition then, well, you’d be wrong. This is the base game with the DLC bolted on, absolutely no new visual bells and whistles here. Also, the DLC content is hidden away behind the fact that you need to be around level 80 to experience it. As such, if the hardcore arcade soulslike gameplay of Wo Long isn’t your thing, then you won’t even be able to give the DLC levels a try.</p>


<p>If Wo Long clicks for you, and you make it that far, then the DLC is all of a particularly high standard. Each new chapter adds new baddies to be murdered by, as well as some suitably epic divine beast encounters that will truly punish any gamer’s skills to the limit. Even better, the DLC stories skilfully fill out on missing elements of the main game’s narrative.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, if you’ve ever been tempted by Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, then this is the version to get. It’s remarkable how well the game plays; combat and movement are silky smooth, the parry system is masterful in its intricacies, and the morale mechanic adds a neat twist to the soulslike formula.</p>
<p>A word of warning, it can be hard to find anyone online to co-op with, and when you do they tend to be so skilled that they destroy everything whilst you check your nails. Fortunately, the AI comrades do a great job in their buddy role, so if you want to get by on your own, that’s totally an option. Even better, the historical setting and characters are utterly glorious in their presentation, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms has never looked better.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty – Complete Edition is, without a doubt, the ultimate form of Team Ninja’s soulslike series. It’s just a shame that no attempt has been made to make this edition more accessible for a new player and to explain the game’s complexities more clearly. Still, if you wanted things easy, then you wouldn’t want Wo Long.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The Asus ROG Ally X is the best a Windows gaming handheld has ever been. It’s got the most comfortable grip, the smoothest gameplay, and the longest-lasting battery — three of the elements that make a PC gaming experience truly <em>portable</em> for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">Most of this is no surprise</a>: It’s smooth because Asus makes the only handheld that pairs AMD’s powerful Ryzen chips with a variable refresh rate screen, which better syncs up with your game. It’s got longer battery life because Asus now stuffs an 80-watt-hour pack in there, the biggest we’ve seen in a handheld to date. The battery’s so big, you can <em>keep</em> that AMD chip humming at higher power levels for higher framerates.</p><p>But what might surprise you is this: the Ally X is the first handheld I can recommend alongside my gold standard for handhelds: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the Steam Deck OLED</a>. That is, if you’ve got a few extra bills burning a hole in your pocket, don’t mind wrestling with Windows, and trust that Asus has actually learned <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">its customer support lesson</a>.</p><p>My ROG Ally X review unit arrived just before I went on vacation — the perfect opportunity to test its massive 80Wh battery. As of today, I’ve spent more than 24 hours playing actual games on the Ally X.</p><p>At first, the battery life didn’t seem like anything special. When I navigated the Japanese high school demon drama of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> at maximum brightness in the car and on the beach, I got 2.5 hours per charge. That’s not enough to last the drive from Northern California to Southern California, at least not without an external battery. I did get an entire additional hour in <em>Dave the Diver</em> compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">the Lenovo Legion Go</a>, but my total runtime of 3 hours, 19 minutes still paled in comparison to the Steam Deck OLED’s total of 4 hours, 42 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>But when I fired up more demanding games, the Ally X pulled far ahead. I got nearly an entire extra hour of <em>Armored Core 6 </em>(2h59m) and an extra half-hour of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider </em>(2h41m) at 720p and medium spec, using the Ally X’s default power mode. That’s the best I’ve seen handheld for games that intensive!&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->25</p><div><figcaption><em>Want to see some comparisons to the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck? Here are my photos with the final Ally X, followed by earlier comparos with a near-final one.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>Then, I played two full hours of one of the most demanding PC games currently in existence: <em>Alan Wake II.</em></p><p>Technically, the ROG Ally X is the first handheld that even begins to meet <em>Alan Wake II’s</em> system requirements. It wants 16GB of system memory <em>and</em> 6GB of VRAM, and it’ll throw errors at launch if you’re short; on the original ROG Ally and Steam Deck OLED, which have to share 16GB between system memory and GPU, the game is a choppy mess.</p><p>But the ROG Ally X has a full 24GB of shared memory, and it shows! At a 540p render resolution, upscaled to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 tech, I could actually delve through the game’s lush, eerie forest without wanting to throw my handheld against the wall. The game did dip as low as 29fps in combat, but I saw a smooth 35–45fps just running around.</p><p>It felt playable enough that I finally sat down and <em>beat the game </em>on Ally X — and I had enough battery to do so for two full hours using the Ally X’s 25W “Turbo” mode.</p><p>As you can see in my <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25542989/247200_Asus_ROG_Ally_X_ReviewDSC02310.jpg">comparison</a> <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25542990/247200_Asus_ROG_Ally_X_ReviewDSC02311.jpg">screenshots</a>, the game’s only running 5fps faster on the Ally X when Saga’s standing still over this corpse. But when we’re playing a game that would dip below a smooth 30fps <em>if not for that boost —</em> on a handheld with VRR and <a href="https://www.displayninja.com/what-is-freesync/#lfc:~:text=refresh%20rate%20range.-,LFC%20(Low%20Framerate%20Compensation),-As%20long%20as">Low Framerate Compensation</a> that works right down to 30fps — it makes all the difference in the world.</p><p>In game after game, benchmark after benchmark, the Ally X produces the smoothest gameplay I’ve seen from any handheld, even in the valleys and caves of <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> where the Legion Go technically produces more frames per second. That’s because Asus’ screen is dynamically working to smooth things out. (Even the Steam Deck OLED’s brighter, more colorful, and faster-responding OLED panel can’t match it there.)</p><p>Speaking of benchmarks, <em>Alan Wake II</em> isn’t the only game where the Ally X pulls ahead. Despite having the same AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip as the original ROG Ally, the faster memory, more efficient cooling, and power tweaks make their mark.</p><div><p><em>Tested at 720p low, save</em>&nbsp;Dirt Rally<em>&nbsp;at 720p ultra. Ally X tested with 15W custom TDP, 17W “Performance”, 25W “Turbo”, and 30W “Turbo” AC modes. </em></p></div><p>While you should note that the Ally X now defaults to a new 17W “Performance” mode rather than 15W, I’m getting better numbers in almost every game with the newer handheld, regardless of wattage.</p><p>See how <em>Returnal </em>is now hitting 38fps in my 720p benchmark in the 25W “Turbo” mode, up from 33 with the original Ally? Like <em>Alan Wake II</em>, I bet that means it’s finally enjoyable on a handheld.</p><div><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X’s massive 80Wh battery is bigger than that of most laptops. It’s also easy to remove: four Philips head screws, no glue.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But again, power is only half the performance story. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review#:~:text=ROG%20Ally%20wattage%2C%20May%202023">A year ago</a>, the original ROG Ally drained its 40-watt-hour battery pack at 40–50 watts in Turbo mode, meaning you’d get less than an hour of gameplay if you ran the Ally that fast away from a charger. With the Ally X, I’m draining an 80-watt-hour battery pack at 33–40 watts in Turbo mode, generally giving me two full hours in a worst-case scenario.</p><p>I’m not even seeing any slowdown as the battery reaches empty — it’s good all the way down to the 3 percent mark, when it puts itself in hibernation, and I can begin playing again at full speed almost as soon as I plug into the wall.</p><p>Even configured to its lowest wattage of 7W TDP, the Ally X isn’t as power-hungry as the original. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> gave me over eight hours of magic roguelike poker at 50 percent brightness, by draining under 10 watts the whole time. So far, my best result was total battery drain of 7 watts in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, down from 9 watts with the OG Ally. At that rate, the Ally X should be able to play for 10 entire hours before shutting down.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The ROG Ally X is still easy to repair — though slightly harder to pop open — and Asus tells me it’ll offer spare parts this year. </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld#:~:text=to%206%C2%B0C-,cooler.,-1/11"><em>More insides here</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’m not going to rehash everything I already told you about the ROG Ally X in my early hands-on — there are so many substantive little changes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review#:~:text=ROG%20Ally%20wattage%2C%20May%202023">they deserve their own story, and I’ve already written that one</a>. But I suspect you may have three distinct questions that deserve answers here:</p><div><ul><li>How are the revised ergonomics and other physical changes?</li><li>Can Windows really be so bad that you’d choose a Steam Deck with worse performance?</li><li>Why trust Asus when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">dodged our SD card reader defect questions</a> and its customer support reputation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">is in the toilet</a>?</li></ul></div><p>I find the ROG Ally X <em>so much more</em> comfortable to hold than the original, despite its additional weight. The meatier grips, triggers, and pebble-shaped omnidirectional back buttons no longer have any protrusions to get in the way. The joysticks and bumpers feel tighter and more premium, the face buttons have a deeper (though noisier) throw, and the D-pad has gone from meh to quite decent — though I am already getting an annoying squeaky sound when I press the down arrow. The fan is also genuinely quiet, not that it was an issue with the original.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I like that you can activate the back buttons from practically any angle. The </em><a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25474422/rog_ally_x_verge_sean_hollister_019.jpg"><em>ROG microtexture</em></a><em> is neat, too.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s also nice to have twin USB-C ports for charging and peripherals, even if I haven’t yet been able to hook up a Thunderbolt eGPU (Asus tells me there’s a driver issue with AMD eGPUs at the moment).</p><p>But I vastly prefer the Steam Deck’s symmetrical analog sticks, which always lie right under where my thumb naturally lands, instead of the Ally’s offset right analog stick that makes me uncomfortably shift my grip. I miss the larger screen I get on other handhelds and their less cramped 16:10 aspect ratio.</p><p>And I cannot stand that Windows <em>still</em> cannot reliably make a gaming handheld <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.audible.com%2Fpd%2FGo-the-F-k-to-Sleep-Audiobook%2FB00551W570"><em>Go the Fuck to Sleep</em></a> and reliably wake up again. The Nintendo Switch does it perfectly, and the Steam Deck does it nearly perfectly, but I couldn’t keep track of the number of times Windows decided it could no longer recognize my fingerprint on the sensor or black-screened my game, or the Ally X simply woke up again the moment I set it down, or Asus’ Armoury Crate settings app simply forgot my choices (like whether to turn on my joysticks’ RGB lights) on wake.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Windows is still lurking under the surface.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’m happy to say that Armoury Crate has actually improved tremendously over the past year — the game launcher now intelligently sorts my games, lets me easily map buttons and gyro controls for fine aiming, and seamlessly downloads updates (including BIOS updates) without navigating to a website or separate app.</p><p>But it’s nothing compared to the ease of use of SteamOS and its compatibility with generations of older PC games thanks to community support — and Windows itself is more of a pig than ever. I spent nearly 45 minutes waiting for mandatory updates and clicking through unwanted offers for various Microsoft products before I could use the Ally X for the first time.</p><p>Did I get a joystick-navigable virtual keyboard or PIN screen or a pre-mapped Alt-Enter shortcut for my trouble? Nope — instead, Asus added a Copilot shortcut, there’s a copy of Outlook sitting on my taskbar, and OneDrive is on by default. The only mercy is that Microsoft Teams doesn’t launch on startup this time.</p><p>As far as the whole SD card situation, Asus has only told me that it’s not the same reader as the old one that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision#:~:text=And%2C%20while%20Asus%20still%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20that%20the%20Ally%E2%80%99s%20SD%20card%20reader%20ever%20had%20any%20fault">it won’t admit has an issue</a> — it’s the one it uses on laptops.

            <p>
The entirety of Blizzard's 500-strong World of Warcraft development team have unionised, making it the largest group within Microsoft's gaming teams to do so thus far.
</p>
<p>
Around 1750 employees within Microsoft's gaming teams are now unionised, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-24/world-of-warcraft-unionizes-growing-foothold-at-microsoft-s-activision-blizzard">Bloomberg</a> reported yesterday, including those working on Blizzard's veteran MMO.
</p>
<p>
World of Warcraft developers will now be represented by the Communication Workers of America (CWA), which celebrated the inclusion of Blizzard staff yesterday in a statement which dubbed the joining as the "first wall-to-wall union at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>", and "a key inflection point in the broader movement for video game worker organising industry-wide".
</p>
<p>
Blizzard unionisation leaders have said they want to improve standards of pay, as well as the company's stance towards remote work and diversity. 
</p>
<p>
There's also a hope that the mass unionisation of the entire World of Warcraft team will act as a blueprint for other developers across the industry.
</p>
<p>
"It's exciting to potentially raise the standards of the entire industry as siblings in organising," World of Warcrft designer Kathryn Friesen said.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has once again voluntarily recognised the union, as it has done with others in the past - most recently, the 240 staff at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and The Elder Scrolls 6, who similarly voted to unionise last week. 
</p>
<p>
The Xbox maker previously pledged not to hamper unionisation efforts among staff, as part of its long-running but ultimately successful Activision Blizzard buyout. 
</p>
<p>
"Unionising one of the most successful games ever signifies the rising power of worker solidarity across the industry, from AAA studios like Sega and Bethesda to indie developers," CWA spokesperson Tom Smith said. "What seemed impossible six years ago is now a reality, and this is just the beginning. 
</p>
<p>
"Together, workers are redefining their industry. Up until now, my proudest WoW moment was successfully main-tanking RoS as a prot warrior, stance-dancing with no off-tank back during TBC. But what these amazing workers have done today leaves that in the dust."
</p>
<p>
"When workers have a protected voice, it's a win-win for employee standards, the studio, and World of Warcraft fans looking for the best gaming experience," said World of Warcraft test analyst Eric Lanham. 
</p>
<p>
"Through our union, we're ready to tank any obstacles, heal any wounds, and DPS through the challenges ahead," he continued. "Together, we will ensure a full tier set bonus with the inclusion of all job titles in the same union. Like the legendary heroes of Azeroth, our union is forged in the fires of perseverance and resilience, and together, we will stand strong as the Alliance and the Horde to ensure a bright future for all."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-app-steam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation VR2 app Steam Store page has gone live today, providing more information on how users will be able to use Sony's VR headset on PC.</p>
<p>The page, which can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, also features some screenshots showcasing the setup process, and the app's release date, which is planned for August 7th, the same day the PC adapter will released at select retailers and on PS Direct. The store page also lists the system requirements, which are identical to those shared by Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">last month.</a></p>
<p>While the headset will retain its basic functionality on PC, the PlayStation VR2 experience on PC will not be the same as on PlayStation 5. Some key features, such as HDR, headset feedback, eye tracking and adaptive triggers, and haptic feedback, won't be supported. However, 4K visuals, a 110-degree field of view, finger touch detection, see-through view, and foveated rendering should provide a more than acceptable VR experience with the many VR games available on Steam.</p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will launch on August 7th worldwide. You can learn more about the headset in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With a pricetag befitting of next-generation hardware, the PlayStation VR2 headset offers a virtual reality experience that's unique to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem. Only time will tell if the new technology is worth the investment but all of the design changes and new features make me excited for what's to come in the future for PlayStation VR2.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-new-update-performance-connectivity/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new PlayStation Portal system software update went live a few hours ago, introducing improvements to the Remote Play-focused handheld device released last year.</p>
<p>The new update, version 3.0.1, not only introduces unspecified system software performance and stability but also expands connectivity options by allowing the system to connect to a wider range of public networks, including certain 5GHz networks. Regarding performance, multiple users on the system's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1ebjb6w/update_just_dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subreddit</a> report improvements, but more thorough testing will be required to see if the improvements are actually real.</p>
<p>Albeit small, it is nice to hear Sony expanding the PlayStation Portal options, as the system has the potential to be something more than just a Remote Play machine. As of now, at least, the console does well what it is meant to do, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>The PlayStation Portal isn’t quite the portable successor that players have been asking for from Sony since the decline of the PlayStation Vita. That being said, the PlayStation Portal does one job and does it exceedingly well. It might not reinvent the remote play experience, but for those relying on controller clips to mount a phone to the top of a DualSense controller or third-party controllers that use a mobile device as the display, an official Sony product just makes sense for a unified solution. It might not replace those Backbone controllers and other devices that players might have in their home, but the PlayStation Portal might wind up being the controller that players start reaching for first.</em></p>
<p>The PlayStation Portal system is now available worldwide</p>

<p>A man confessed to sending 39 threats to Nintendo last year during a trial last month, which led to the cancellation of one of their gaming events. The Judge passed the final verdict for the man’s actions yesterday; the accused will be sentenced to one year in prison along with four years of work suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per <a href="https://nordot.app/1188760785942986824?c=39546741839462401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nordot</a> (via <a href="https://splatoon-torikara.com/archives/42988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Torikara Sokuhou</a>), the Judge passed a sentence against the man threatening Nintendo, sentencing him to one year in prison and suspending him for four years. Judge Hiroshi Kawakami charged the man with obstruction of business and stated, “The damage was great, and the responsibility is not light” (as translated by Google Translator).&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>[Splatoon 3]</p><p>The man who sent 39 bomb and death threats to Nintendo was sentenced to 1 year in prison (4 years suspended).</p><p>A statement from a Nintendo employee was read out in court. They said the threats terrified them and that it "reminded them of the Kyoto Animation attack". <a href="https://t.co/gjFK75LBcB">https://t.co/gjFK75LBcB</a></p></div>— OatmealDome (@OatmealDome) <a href="https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1816275242626531544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>A Nintendo employee also provided a statement, revealing that the situation with these threats deeply affected them. The threats reminded them of the ‘Kyoto Animation arson and murder case’, and they were ‘terrified’ due to that. The 39 threats that the man sent Nintendo included messages like ‘I’ll kill everyone involved. You should be careful about events with spectators.’ Kyoto Animation Arson is a reference to the 2019 arson case at an anime studio, where 36 people tragically passed away.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>And, in case you weren't aware, "Kyoto Animation arson" refers to an attack on an anime studio in 2019.

</div></figure>



<p>Judge Kawakami’s verdict was based on the man’s selfish motive for the crime against Nintendo. He committed the crime to relieve stress caused by online gameplay. The Judge described his actions as persistent and malicious.</p>



<p>In the earlier report, a 27-year-old Hitachi City employee was identified as Kenshin Kazama, and the prosecution revealed that the threats against Nintendo caused staggering damage of around caused damage worth ¥700 million or around $4.3 million. The prosecution sought a one-year imprisonment and managed to achieve that ruling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo has announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-new-2-way-joy-con-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new 2-way Joy-Con stand</a>.

Concord may fare better on PS5 (Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers public), but tough questions will surely continue around whether the game hits Sony’s commercial expectations for it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Sony has found enormous success going down the PS5/PC cross-platform route for fellow PlayStation live service, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>. Arrowhead’s third-person co-op shooter, which also launched at $40, is PlayStation's fastest-selling game of all time with over 12 million sold in 12 weeks.

Cinematic vignettes will be released weekly in-game at launch (three we shown during the beta). These let you get to know the characters and learn about life as a Freegunner and the broader Concord galaxy.</p><p>One big problem the beta suffered from was no mid-match leaver penalty, and no join-in-progress system. That meant players would be faced with playing as part of an under strength team, or against a team short on numbers, which would encourage more players to leave.</p><p>Firewalk said “ensuring teams are complete and evenly matched throughout a game is a priority for us,” and confirmed plans to explore the potential of a leaver penalty system “to incentivize players to start and stay in complete teams,” but it doesn’t sound like it will be in place for launch.</p><p>And finally, at launch, Concord will have its training mode and Galactic Guide unlocked.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>I've never been a poetry guy, not because I don't like it, I've just never gone out of my way to read them over books or whatnot. The poems I've engaged with the most are those read out during wedding ceremonies, those that pop-up before the start of a horror game, or <a href="https://826dc.org/student-writing/the-tiger/">The Tiger</a> by 6-year old Nael that occasionally pops up as I'm doomscrolling. But thanks to the multiplayer web game "fridge poetry", where you drag words to create poems, I might become a day-to-day poem guy. Going off my first effort, I don't think many will appreciate my career switch.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Head on over to <a href="https://playhtml.fun/fridge.html">this site</a> and it'll transport you to the web's fridge wall, complete with loads of magnets folks have already popped on there and arranged to create poetry. At the bottom right, you can generate your own words, too. All you have to do is drag a word around and plop it next to any others, rearranging existing poems or creating your own. And what's really nice is that you can see other people's cursors as they go about their business, before they disappear into the ether.</p>
<p>My first poem? I saw my opening, the moment I laid eyes on the fridge door: the night consumes <em>blank</em>. I saw the word "fortnite" hovering nearby. Smugly, I put the two together: the night consumes fortnite. I think of it as a sort of contemplation, let's say, on how Fortnite both consumes people's evenings and is also being consumed itself. Consumed by Disney and Lego and Ariana Grande - perhaps gleefully. The word "night" also sounds like "nite", which I thought was clever.</p>
<p>Someone immediately dashed my work, hopping in to unpick my poem before leaving (fair enough). So I left another poem later, simply entitled: rock, paper, shotgun. And just as I did so, someone else generated the word "frotnite" and positioned it above "fortnite" in what was a rather beautiful thing that happened in real time.</p>
<p>Other poems on the door at the time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>every raccoon is gay</li>
<li>meow! meowmeowmeow</li>
<li>Dismay@aol.com</li>
</ul>
<p>Yeah, I really like that last one.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a> developers Respawn Entertainment have announced that poorly-received plans to overhaul the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-battle-royale-games">battle royale</a>'s Premium Battle Pass will be partially walked back. Most crucially, the new passes – set to launch alongside the upcoming Season 22 in August – will no longer be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-new-battle-pass-plans-promise-greater-rewards-but-for-more-of-your-real-world-money">sold exclusively for real-world cash</a>; as with previous BPs, players will still be able to buy them with accumulated in-game currency.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"You’ve spoken, and we’ve listened", opens the statement on the official <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859">Apex Legends TwiXer</a>. "With the release of Season 22 we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins. We recognise that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better – that’s on us."</p>
<p>Several other changes will still go ahead, including the switch from one Premium Battle Pass per season to one smaller (yet still more reward-stuffed) PBP per half-season. Yet these were never the target of player ire, which has been laser-focused on that hard cash requirement since it was revealed by publishers EA a couple of weeks ago. In essence, this would have denied dedicated players the chance to earn future Premium Battle Passes for no additional cost, as each pass includes enough Apex Coins as levelling-up rewards to cover the cost of the next one.</p>
<p>Happily, that can now continue, as even these truncated half-season passes will dish out 1300 coins when completed – more than enough to chain together successive purchases. A wise change of course, then, even if it’s one that probably shouldn’t have been necessary in the first place. If you're curious, here's a full breakdown of each tier's price and goodies:</p>

<p>EA and Respawn aren’t entirely abandoning the cash-for-passes model, though, as in addition to the Premium Battle Pass, Season 22 will also introduce Ultimate and Ultimate+ Battle Pass tiers, each offering yet more rewards – and costing $10 / $20 respectively, with no Apex Coin option. While that means some will end up forking out <em>$40 per season </em>if they pick up both Ultimate+ passes – good lord, people, control your hat urges – I wouldn’t expect these to draw the same kind of rancor as the original set of changes. Beyond a couple of timed-exclusive skin variants, they’re only serving up some extra crafting materials and loot crates over the Premium tier, and are more of a genuinely optional upgrade that won’t leave Apex Coin buyers in the lurch.</p>

            <p>
Fallout: London, the fan-made game-sized mod for Fallout 4, will be released today. The mod's creators confirmed the release to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-london-bethesda-mod-tomorrow">Inverse</a> - saying the date was now definite, "unless nuclear war happens".
</p>
<p>
Developed by Team Folon, the mod has been over five years in the making and transports the post-apocalyptic game to England's capital city, with a whole new story, environments, characters, factions, weapons, and gameplay elements.
</p>
<p>
Due to its size it won't be available on popular mod hosting sites, so is instead <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london">available on GOG</a> with a custom launcher.

<p>

Note, however, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">mod is currently not compatible with the next-gen version</a> of the game, so players will need the pre-patched version (1.10.163.0). For this reason, players on Steam will need to downgrade before installation. As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-will-work-with-fallout-4-on-gog-and-steam-but-not-epic">mod is not compatible with Epic</a> due to lack of rollback features.


</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-fallout-london-finally-gets-a-release-date">mod was originally set for release on April 23rd this year</a> (fittingly, St. George's Day), but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">release was delayed due to Bethesda's next-gen upgrade</a>.


</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has followed development of Fallout: London for some time. Most recently, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-cast-will-include-former-speaker-of-the-house-john-bercow">former Speaker of the House John Bercow would be lending his voice</a> to an AI robot, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-adds-baldurs-gate-3-actor-to-its-cast">Neil Newbon - voice of Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3 - is also in the cast</a>.


</p>
<p>
The release of the Fallout: London mod will likely be boosted by the popularity of Amazon's Fallout TV show. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks</a> and has just recently been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>.

			<p>The Dragon Quest series is facing some unexpected challenges posed by more realistic graphics, according to the series' creator Yuji Horii.</p>
<p>Speaking with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/240722m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Denfaminicogamer</a>, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/dragon-quest-creator-talks-about-an-unexpected-challenge-the-series-is-facing-due-to-graphics-becoming-more-realistic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Automaton</a>, the popular RPG series creator talked about some unexpected challenges for the franchise posed by more realistic graphics. As now character models have become more expressive and detailed, having a silent protagonist, or "symbolic protagonist," as Horii-san calls it, who allows players to be the main character of the story has become more difficult. With more realistic and detailed graphics, a character that just stands there will look like an idiot.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest series creator feels there is no easy way to address this, as making the character react to events would ruin immersion. This, according to Yuji Horii, will become even more of a challenge in the future, so the day that the series will feature a different sort of protagonist may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, things are remaining as they have always been. The next entry in the series, the long-anticipated Dragon Quest III HD-2D remake, will feature a silent protagonist and many of the features that have always defined the series. You can learn more about the remake launching later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>
