            <p>After rebooting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> as the trilogy of Remake, Rebirth and Really, You Went With That? (TBC), Square Enix are now planning to reboot themselves. Among the publishers’ revamped approach to making money - following a recent drop in profits, per their latest financials - is a more “aggressive” approach to bringing their games to more platforms than specific consoles (in other words, PlayStation) as exclusives, with a particular focus on “win[ning] over PC users”.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The New Medium-term Business Plan, which is also referred to in the presentation as “Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens” - which I especially like for how much it sounds like it could’ve come from a Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts trailer - plans to spend the next three years shifting “from quantity to quality”. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>In a pleasing corporate balm to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">other</a> multi-million/billion/trillion companies shutting down their more experimental projects that don't instantly make a gazillion dollars, Square Enix say they will “be bold in attempting to create new IP, prioritizing novel forms of excitement and striking the right balance with earnings potential”, giving “bringing smiles to our customers’ faces” top billing to boost players’ loyalty to existing series while also releasing “mid-class” titles that aim to increase the company’s “hit rate”.</p>
<p>Part of the effort to grow existing audiences for their franchises and win over some new players to boot is an “aggressive” multiplatform push that aims to “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles”. That certainly sounds like corpo-talk for putting out games across more platforms than just PlayStation - the presentation mentions PC alongside Xbox and Nintendo consoles.</p>

<p>PC in particular is a real point of attention for Square Enix, as they say they will “pursue initiatives designed to win over PC users”, adding that PC is a “growth market” for the company - hard to argue with that, given how long we’ve been waiting for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> on PC now, with the currently PS5-exclusive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> yet to even be officially confirmed to follow FF7 Remake over onto PC at some point.</p>
<p>It won’t just be console games that make their way over onto PC, mind. Square also plan to consider PC releases for their mobile games, starting with the already revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-vii-ever-crisis-pc-release-confirmed-will-share-data-between-steam-and-mobile">Steam launch for gacha spin-off Final Fantasy Ever Crisis</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like Square Enix or Final Fantasy have a particularly weak showing on PC - though that arguably is largely thanks to the ongoing success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, while PC ports for the more mainline <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy games</a> have been of more mixed quality and showing over the years. If this increased dedication to bringing games to PC more quickly and with higher quality pays off, who knows - perhaps we’ll even see the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">FF7 Remake</a> game land day and date with its console release. We can but dream (and give us Rebirth sooner, at least).</p>

That franchise is, quite predictably, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-best-games-ranked-jedi-knight-dark-forces-lis-1848893189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-best-games-ranked-jedi-knight-dark-forces-lis-1848893189"><em>Star Wars</em></a></span>,<em> </em>and folks have especially wanted to see characters and situations from <em>The Clone Wars </em>recreated in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, due to some thematic similarities between the two. Well, PC players no longer have to fret over the (very slim) chances of an official collaboration, since there’s now a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mods-make-gaming-a-better-place-for-everyone-1846720538&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mods-make-gaming-a-better-place-for-everyone-1846720538">mod</a></span> that reskins various elements of the game to resemble characters and vehicles from <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>.</p><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196653,195928" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The mod, which was developed by a modder named Toasted and their respective team, exchanges the Helldivers for members of <em>The Clone Wars </em>series’ 501st legion, including fan-favorite characters like Captain Rex, Cody, and Hunter. The mod also replaces <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-automaton-robots-back-1851397017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-automaton-robots-back-1851397017">Automaton</a></span> enemy force with the droid army of the Separatists. Even the massive ships that stay in orbit and function as in-game lobbies have been made to appear like <em>Star Wars</em>’ massive Star Destroyers. The mod pack stops shy of being a <em>total</em> conversion, but the results are still rather impressive nonetheless. If we’re not going to get a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fps-respawn-canceled-cuts-layoffs-ea-1851295478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-fps-respawn-canceled-cuts-layoffs-ea-1851295478"><em>Star Wars </em>shooter</a></span> anytime soon, this might be the next best thing.</p><p> The more you think about it, the more it makes sense that fans of both properties would specifically want <em>this </em>collaboration. Whenever you die in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, reinforcements are called and an identical version of your character drops in, almost as if they were cloned to fill out the ranks of a fascist space empire. Helldivers are treated about as callously as the clones in <em>Star Wars </em>are, making them effectively one and the same. Admittedly, there’s also a lot of physical humor in the reckless tossing around of Helldivers that translates pretty well if you do a <em>Star Wars</em> palette swap, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deathtroopers-fan-game-star-wars-zombies-stormtroopers-1851420306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deathtroopers-fan-game-star-wars-zombies-stormtroopers-1851420306">clone troopers</a></span> are an especially popular bunch to put through the ringer.</p><p>The <em>Star Wars</em> mod pack that includes all of the extensive reskins is not available just yet, but will be in the very near future. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789636825390432706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/ToastedShoes/status/1789636825390432706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toasted</a></span>, “the mods don’t work consistently across all planets and difficulties so we want to iron out the kinks before dropping them.” In the meantime, the team will be dropping the 501st legion “and other mods” on Nexus Mods individually throughout the week before bundling them all together. As an added and very neat gesture, Toasted and their mod team will also be releasing the tools they used to build the <em>Star Wars </em>mods so that others might use them and make their own.</p><p>It’s fortunate that <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s modding scene is generating some positive buzz because the game and its developers are otherwise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">going through a rough patch</a></span> right now.

                <p>After 14 years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/" data-ref-id="5000-42031">Red Dead Redemption</a> might finally be headed to PC, according to new information unearthed by a dataminer. Rockstar community member Tez2 recently posted on X/Twitter that "it looks like Rockstar is gearing up to release #RDR1 on PC" and attached a screenshot that they claim was pulled from a Rockstar launcher site file.</p><p>"Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare. Now playable on PC," the text in the image reads. Tez2 added that the launcher site had recently been updated with the new message, although there's no indication of when Rockstar could plan to surprise-launch Red Dead Redemption on PC.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Rockstar's launcher site file. They updated it today and added those strings.<br>Marketing strings. The same way Rockstar promotes GTAV. <a href="https://t.co/CY1trQQGOz" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/CY1trQQGOz</a></p>  — Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>For PC fans, it'll have been a long wait if the report turns out to be true. Originally launching on Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2010, PC owners have long been requesting for the game to make its way to their platform. Strangely, Red Dead Redemption 2 hit PC a year after it first landed on PS4 and Xbox One, and players were expecting Rockstar to bring the previous open-world cowboy game to their systems.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption did get updated for PS4 and Switch last year, although it proved to be underwhelming and "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-on-ps4-and-ps5-is-a-bare-bones-upgrade-according-to-technical-analysis/1100-6516955/">bare-bones</a>" on launch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/">Rockstar has regularly prioritized console</a> over PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/">something it'll be doing for GTA 6</a> when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-may-still-be-on-schedule-after-all-report/1100-6522286/">launches on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Originally supposed to launch tomorrow, May 14, The Rogue Prince of Persia will now wall jump over to May 27 for the game's release date on Steam Early Access. The roughly two-week <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-has-been-slightly-delayed-thanks-partly-to-hades-2/1100-6523344/" data-ref-id="1100-6523344">delay partially came in response to Hades 2</a> surprise-releasing earlier this month.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Hades 2, developer Evil Empire also noted that pushing back The Rogue Prince of Persia "lowered the stress levels" of the team and should allow them to "kick some stubborn bugs out," too. The 2D action-platformer is a spin-off of Ubisoft's Prince of Persia franchise and comes from the studio behind Dead Cells. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rogue-prince-of-persia-builds-on-dead-cells-formula-wall-running/1100-6522522/" data-ref-id="1100-6522522">The Rogue Prince of Persia builds on the Dead Cells formula</a>, though offers up a lot more wall running.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Rogue Prince of Persia - Official New Release Date Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It was just a bit over a month ago that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-from-dead-cells-dev-announced-launching-in-may/1100-6522555/" data-ref-id="1100-6522555">The Rogue Prince of Persia was announced</a>. It will be the second game in the long-running franchise to come out this year, following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-crowning-achievement/1900-6418167/" data-ref-id="1900-6418167">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> in January. Ubisoft also has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-might-be-going-through-a-remake-of-its-own-report/1100-6522543/" data-ref-id="1100-6522543">a Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake in the works</a>. However, the game has switched development teams previously and is reportedly now seeing a huge overhaul.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/4204749829170749418?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On Steam</a>, Evil Empire revealed that The Rogue Prince of Persia will cost $20. The team also teased a "cheeky little launch discount" for people looking to pick up the game.</p><p dir="ltr">As for The Rogue Prince of Persia's new release date, Evil Empire added one funny tidbit as well. "If Silksong shadow drops in the next two weeks," then the studio might just be "burning the whole thing down!"</p><p dir="ltr">The Rogue Prince of Persia is planned to be in Steam Early Access for "around a year, probably a little bit longer," according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's Steam page</a>. Evil Empire will look to add levels, weapons, bosses, and story acts to the action-platformer over this time. The price of The Rogue Prince of Persia could also increase as new content comes to the game in the future.</p>

We’ll also get our first full-length look at the series' first Japanese entry this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ubisoft announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1790049608720125969">X</a> that the game’s cinematic world premiere trailer will air on May 15 at 9 a.m. P.T./12 p.m. ET. Ubisoft’s use of the word “cinematic” suggests that this trailer will not include gameplay. If that’s the case, Ubisoft could be saving a gameplay reveal for its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/03/ubisoft-forward-confirmed-for-june-same-week-as-summer-game-fest">Ubisoft Forward</a> presentation less than a month later, on June 10.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was first announced in 2022 and will be the first entry set in feudal Japan. At the time, Ubisoft described the game as being an open-world RPG and the ultimate "shinobi fantasy." It is being developed by Ubisoft Quebec, the team behind Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It has no release window, but the game is expected to launch later this year.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed game now has a final name: Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
Previously, it was known only under its working title, Assassin's Creed: Codename Red.
</p>
<p>
Shadows will get a full reveal later this week, on Wednesday 15th May at 5pm UK time. It's then we'll get a full trailer for the game, which will debut on YouTube (or you'll be able to find it right here on Eurogamer).
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Ubisoft is yet to say when Shadows will launch, other than confirm it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japan-set-assassins-creed-codename-red-out-before-end-of-march-2025-says-ubisoft">arrive before the end of the current financial year</a> (in March 2025). But the game will almost certainly land during the series' usual prime end of year sales slot - in either October or November 2024.
</p>
<p>Shadows will be the first full-fat Assassin's Creed game since 2020's Valhalla, after the snack-sized Mirage launched last year to celebrate the series' 15th anniversary. More pertinently, however, Shadows is the first Assassin's Creed to come from the talented Ubisoft Quebec studio since 2017's Assassin's Creed Odyssey - the excellent if enormous entry set in Ancient Greece.</p>
<p>Details on what exactly Shadows will be about are thin on the ground, though its feudal Japan setting has long been requested by fans. We do now at least have a first look at Shadows' version of the iconic Assassin's Creed franchise logo, now daubed in red blood:</p>

<p>A post to the official Assassin's Creed social media account on X today shows a large hourglass situated somewhere - presumably in Japan! - with blood red sand now pouring through it. Presumably this will run out on Wednesday at 5pm UK time - see you then!</p>

            <p>
An unopenable door in Super Mario 64 - thought impossible to pass through without the use of mods - has finally been prised open.
</p>
<p>
The door in question can be found within the game's infamous penguin level - you know, the one where you definitely didn't yeet the baby penguin off the mountain. 
</p>
<p>
There, a log cabin can be found with a door that opens outwards - but that's impossible to return through due to an invisible wall. Because of this, it's the only door in the game that was thought impossible to be opened both ways - until, last month, someone finally pulled it off.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>SM64's Unopenable Door Has Finally Been Opened! by pannenkoek2012
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmqFoojMeD8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As shown in the video by pannenkoek2012 above, Nintendo fan Alexpalix1 managed to finally crack open the penguin level's door from the outside thanks to some detailed knowledge of how Super Mario 64's code logic works - and with some help from a certain baby penguin's mother. 
</p>
<p>
It's been known for some time that the level's invisible wall can be breached using Mario 64's clipping ability - and that you can use the penguin to push Mario into the log cabin. But this simply leaves Mario plummeting to his death out of bounds. 
</p>
<p>
The new breakthrough here is the knowledge that the game's code logic handles Mario's turning action in a certain way so that if he's both falling and running in the same frame, the latter outcome will take precedent. This requires some careful timing, but means if Mario clips through the door with just a frame of walking, the door will open - and Mario will instead warp back to the room inside the cabin, safe and sound. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds complicated, but the video above lays the whole thing out perfectly - and after 27 years, is well worth a watch. 
</p>
<p>
If newer Nintendo games are more your style, the company last week confirmed it would finally reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> in the coming months - or to be precise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">before April 2025</a>.

            <p>Today I learned Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert is working on a new game, which he describes as "Classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park". Well, hello there!</p>
<p>Work on this project actually started several months ago, but it only came to my attention this afternoon thanks to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/05/monkey-island-creator-ron-gilbert-is-working-on-a-zelda-style-rpg-adventure">TimeExtension</a>. I have since done more browsing, and come across some posts on Terrible Toybox, as well as Gilbert's own <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@grumpygamer">Mastodon</a> page.</p>
<p>Now, admittedly there still isn't a huge amount of information on Gilbert's upcoming project at this time. The game doesn't even have a proper name yet, and rather has been labelled as Game Name TBD on <a href="https://terribletoybox.com/">Terrible Toybox's website</a>. Meanwhile, Gilbert has been using the hashtag #rpgtbd to tag his social media posts. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>But, regardless, the information that is there is enough to make me very excited. First off, the fact that this is coming from the man that gave the world Guybrush Threepwood, and he has used the words 'classic Zelda' to tease the game is pretty awesome. But then, the handful of screenshots he has shared also look great.</p>
<p>As you can see in the images above and below, the upcoming release has a charming 2D pixel aesthetic. The screenshots shared so far show a town, which is said to have both a bakery and a weapon shop. As Gilbert noted, these two establishments will really set players up with "all [they'll] need before setting out on a day of questing".</p>
<p>There is also a graveyard area, and I assume that this will lead to the cemetery crypt and the source of those skeletons.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Gilbert also announced Elissa Black, who has worked on Swords of Freeport and TownCraft,  has joined the team as a quest designer. "This ups the chance by 37 percent that I'll finish the game before becoming bored and disillusioned," <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@grumpygamer/112401714030473672">Gilbert</a> said announcing Black's arrival to the team.</p>
<p>Right now, Game Name TBD is slated to launch late this year, although Terrible Toybox says this may slip into early next year. "This is gamedev after all," the site reasons.</p>
<p>I will let you know as soon as I hear more.</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are lots of different ways to play <em>Warzone</em>, but for many, getting into close-quarters battles is the most enjoyable. If you feel that way, you’ll need a good SMG, and the FJX Horus could be the one for you. Here’s the best loadout, including attachments and equipment. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Added in Season 3, the FJX Horus is a powerful SMG, but does come with some pretty hefty recoil that you’ll need to learn to control. That’s why we’ve focused on recoil control and aim stability with this loadout, to help you hit as many of your shots as possible. </p> <figure data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?resize=640%2C360" alt="The FJX Horus in the Warzone weapon creator menu." srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?w=1920 1920w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?w=1024 1024w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?w=1536 1536w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/warzone-fjx-loadout-may-2024.png?w=1280 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>It’s all about recoil control.

 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">The <strong>SYN9 Long Barrel</strong> improves bullet velocity, helping you deal damage at longer distances, while the <strong>JAK Glassless Optic</strong> will help you aim down sights, but is a personal favorite so switch to any Optic you prefer if you want to. </p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Finally, the <strong>48 Round Mag</strong> will help you to not run out of bullets, which is always very useful. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Perks and equipment to use with FJX Horus in <em>Warzone</em></h2> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Perk 1:&nbsp;</strong>Double Time</li> <li><strong>Perk 2:&nbsp;</strong>Sleight of Hand</li> <li><strong>Perk 3:&nbsp;</strong>Tempered</li> <li><strong>Perk 4:&nbsp;</strong>High Alert</li> <li><strong>Tactical:&nbsp;</strong>Stun Grenade</li> <li><strong>Lethal:&nbsp;</strong>Frag Grenade</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">My <em>Warzone</em> perks never change, and I’m sticking with the same four that I use in almost every loadout. <strong>Double Time<em> </em></strong>increases your Tactical Sprint which is always nice, while <strong>Sleight of Hand</strong> lets you reload and switch weapons faster. </p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true"><strong>Tempered</strong> means you only need two plates to fully armor up instead of three, making it essential, while <strong>High Alert</strong> warns you when an opponent is looking at you. Finally, I stick with a <strong>Stun Grenade </strong>and <strong>Frag Grenade</strong> as my equipment, but these can be your own personal preference. </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/a-warm-farewell-and-exciting-welcome.1676646/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post on its official website</a>, Paradox says that the contract between it and Double Eleven "was fulfilled" with&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2</em>'s passing of certification across all platforms.</p>
<p>Following that milestone, however, the two companies "could not find a commercial agreement that worked" for them both, and so a mutual agreement was made for Paradox and Double Eleven to split, seemingly amicably.</p>

<p>Kokku has worked on games like&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Sniper: Ghost Warrior&nbsp;</em>franchise, and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em>, among others. It counts Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Paradox itself among its clients.</p>
<p>Paradox says that it spoke to multiple studios in the wake of Double Eleven's departure from&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>, but that Kokku was "found to be the best fit" due to its experience and appreciation of&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few months, Paradox and Kokku will be releasing development diaries and deep dives discussing&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>and the developer's role in bringing the game to life.</p>

<p>It doesn't go into detail about Double Eleven's reasoning, but it does include some fun speculation about where the game could be going, as well as what Double Eleven has achieved with&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect&nbsp;</em>over the last few years. You can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/comments/1cr004q/a_letter_to_the_prison_architect_fans_fellow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the letter here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>was originally announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-announced">back in January this year</a>. At first, it was slated for a March release, but it was subsequently pushed back to May <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed">and then to September</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the change in developer, no fresh delay has been announced, so it looks like we're still on track for the September launch. When it does hit,&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-PPSA14957_00-PRISONARCHITECT2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prison-architect-2/9NF6CP5B3J18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Since the show’s debut, the three characters—Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup—have become beloved heroes and have appeared in numerous games, books, and even a rebooted animated TV show. So they seem like a perfect fit for WB’s massive IP-clusterfuck that is <em>MultiVersus</em>.<br></p><p>Unofficially, references to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/fgc/news/all-confirmed-and-leaked-characters-in-multiversus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/fgc/news/all-confirmed-and-leaked-characters-in-multiversus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls have been spotted</a></span> in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-datamine-leak-the-joker-mark-hamill-voice-1849603750&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-datamine-leak-the-joker-mark-hamill-voice-1849603750">datamined files and content</a></span>. So it seems very likely that their showing up in this trailer is no accident, but rather a carefully calculated move meant to get fans excited and help the game’s hype train keep on rolling. Looking online, where the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=powerpuff&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=powerpuff&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Powerpuff Girls are now trending on Twitter</a></span>, it seems that WB Games got what they wanted. Heck, I even wrote over 300 words about it. Bravo.</p><p><em>MultiVersus </em>returns, after its extended beta, on May 28 for Xbox, PlayStation and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It looks like Rockstar Games could be getting ready to release the first Red Dead Redemption on PC. The information comes from data found inside Rockstar’s launcher site files, and was shared on <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790031522315026508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter via Tez2</a>.</p>



<p>The promotion information mentions the original game as well as the Undead Nightmare DLC being “now playable on PC”. </p>



<p>“Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare, now playable on PC,” the product promotion data reads.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-and-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last summer the game launched</a> on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4. As far as the future of the series goes, the man behind the voice of Arthur Morgan, Roger Clark, said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s “certain” there will be</a> a Red Dead Redemption 3 one day. That said, he doesn’t think Morgan will be a part of any future games in the franchise.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Rockstar Games for comment on the rumors. If a response is received, this article will be updated accordingly. Until then, take this rumor with a grain of salt.</p>

Just as customers can already trade in video games for cash or store credit, the same system will be available to those trading in Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic: The Gathering, and other trading card game cards.</p><p>The key word here is "graded", of course, meaning lapsed players or collectors can't just bring in a box of their old cards to be cashed in. Grading is a process which determines the exact condition of the card and essentially verifies it as being genuine (and valuable).</p><p>It's unclear how GameStop will value the cards being traded in. and it will only accept those graded by the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), at least at the beginning of the program. It also won't accept cards valued at more than $500.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"GameStop’s leaders believe this is the obvious next step for the company," said one store manager who's tested this program for GameStop. "Physical media is waning, especially for video games. It was time for the company to branch out to trading cards. They are the future."</p><p>Pokémon will seemingly be the chain's focus, as single holographic and reverse holographic cards from the Pokémon TCG will be sold in store too at $1 each.</p><p>The card collecting market is growing more and more popular, helped in part due to high profile cases of cards being sold for millions of dollars. The perpetually popular Pokémon sits at the top of the list in terms of value (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-most-expensive-pokemon-cards">its most expensive card is valued at $5.275 million</a>) but a special Lord of the Rings Magic: The Gathering card was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/post-malone-buys-magic-the-gatherings-one-ring-card-valued-at-2-million">bought by rapper Post Malone for $2 million in 2023</a>, and that record was soon broken as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million">another card sold for $3 million just months later</a>.</p><p>The popularity of Pokémon cards is otherwise evidenced by the number of people trying to steal them. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">Tokyo police reported an unprecedented number of trading card thefts</a> in the latter half of 2022, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thousands-dollars-pokmon-merch-reportedly-stolen-after-thief-breaks-through-a-store-wall">an independent gaming store in Minnesota reportedly had around $250,000 worth of Pokémon</a> merchandise stolen in February of that year. One month later, again in Tokyo, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/man-arrested-after-literal-pokemon-card-heist">a man was arrested for allegedly launching a literal heist</a> in order to steal the treasured cards.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Square Enix has revealed its three-year plan to achieve long-term growth within the company. It also gave the plan a catchy name, "Square Enix Reboots, and Awakens."</p><p>There are four pillars in this <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20240513_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plan</a>. The first one involves enhancing productivity by focusing more on quality rather than quantity. Additionally, there will be an emphasis on making games "fun" and making sure that Square Enix finds more ways to leverage its rich library of IP.</p><p>The second pillar sees Square Enix embracing multiplatform releases, including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo, iOS, and Android. The focus here is on trying to get more customers to enjoy Square Enix properties. Square Enix is also looking into expanding its IP across all media formats, which could possibly mean things like movies.</p><p>The third pillar focuses more on foundational stability, including structural reforms in the company's European and American offices. There will also be closer collaboration between divisions in Japan. Square Enix will rebuild its systems for training new gradates, and junior and mid-level employees, as well as for hiring and promotions.</p><p>Lastly, Square Enix will designate a maximum of 100 billion yen, or approximately $640,000,000, for strategic investments over a three-year period. As for what kind of investments Square Enix will make, the company isn't ruling out inorganic investments designed to expand its business, which means that acquisitions could be considered.</p><p>Last month, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-is-rethinking-how-it-approaches-games-and-its-coming-at-a-huge-cost/1100-6523070/" data-ref-id="1100-6523070">announced</a> that it expected to lose 22.1 billion yen, or $140,000,000, in "content abandonment losses" for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2024 due to seemingly canceling projects. Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu revealed earlier this year that the company would shift development processes to create fewer, and higher-quality games.</p>

            <p>NetEase, the publisher of Marvel Rivals, is retracting its no negativity clause for streamers previewing the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/marvel-rivals/contract">As reported by PCGamesN</a>, the move came after streamer <a href="https://twitter.com/A_Seagull/status/1789468582281400792">Brandon Larned shared some contract details on social media</a>.</p>
<p>"Extremely disappointed in Marvel Rivals. Multiple creators asked for key codes to gain access to the playtest and are asked to sign a contract. The contract signs away your right to negatively review the game. Many streamers have signed without reading just to play."</p>
<p>NetEase advised PCGamesN that it is revising the contract with content creators.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to the publication, the publisher said, "The contract is a draft version aiming for long-term cooperation with the creators who are interested in Marvel Rivals. The development team hopes to have more meaningful and consistent feedback, suggestions, and criticisms through more in-depth cooperation."</p>
<p>It also posted a statement on the Marvel Rivals content creator Discord saying it would revise the agreement terms.</p>
<p>Net Ease Games announced Marvel Rivals a month ago. It currently has no release schedule and is currently running a closed alpha test.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/narration-avenues-in-multiverse-games" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Narration Avenues in Multiverse Games</a> - Anjali Tyagi</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Apart from the traditional screenplay and 3d production hurdles, multiverse narratives and games produce even more complex structures of going about the production of ideas and concepts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most obvious challenges happen during the very early stages of production, i.e. the brainstorming and writing stage. From debating how many characters to have, what personalities to give them, what their character arcs might look like, and what main events will take place to give shape and craft the entire story, directors often end up chucking their semi-formed ideas either because it seems too complicated at first glance, or it doesn’t make sense halfway into creation, or because they don’t have the budget or resources to keep iterating on changes with the same passion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Right off the bat, ideas tend to start off as too ambitious or too complicated, or often both. Which is a good thing. The struggle begins when three quarters into writing, the ideas seem to get tedious and eventually the script starts to look boring if events don't start to come together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Timing and attention span of viewers also play a major role in the absorption of the content, leaving directors with multiple checklists to mark off from the traditional filmmaking rules, which, one are difficult to define, and two give them little room for radical experimentation of storylines and story plots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are certain obvious mistakes that if avoided during the first quarter of brainstorming could save the team and the production a lot of time and resources, and keep the excitement and momentum for ideation going. Here’s a helpful list to look out for:</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The first smart thing to do:">The first smart thing to do:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Characters that seem repetitive and have overlapping personalities should probably be merged into singular characters, leaving each player/main character to be distinctive from the other in all the ways that they think, behave, and go about problem solving on their quests. This gives plenty of starting points for writers to come up with unique events that seem organic and can be fun to encounter while playing/watching the game narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most obvious challenge of multiverse narration:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The infinite tree branching of follow up events. To make a game that could have the possibility to take a variety of routes, directors face the obvious challenge of creating too many pathways to be able to interlink them back to each other where it matters, let alone produce assets for such story branches. To this we say, giving careful choices to their players, is both the challenge and the solution to this problem. The challenge would be to not give the illusion of choice. Instead, give the users definite choice making moments that actually matter and would lead to some fundamental change in the making of the personalities of their player characters. Events that could go different ways but don’t really contribute significantly to character arcs or story plots are the obvious ones to completely overlook.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="A hack to go about improving your writing and brainstorming your main events:">A hack to go about improving your writing and brainstorming your main events:</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First thing to embrace would be your main characters. Studying the way they behave, think, and operate is a big window to defining your main events. Afraid nobody will care about your characters? That can only happen if you’ve got overlapping personalities going, that’s if you haven't studied them enough. If inspired from real life, which most characters are, with enough attention to mapping out their personalities, each character will be unique and have their own - universal story to tell. Main events are a lot like inevitable occurrences that can only play out one typical way based on the developing instincts of your characters, they are usually critical moments of crisis or change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Say you’ve got the characters, but can’t think of useful main events that come together. A good thing to do would be to put your characters with each other in scenes of different emotions, like fear, excitement, glee. Don’t worry about the order at first. Think about how each one of them would respond to the problem they’re facing, and how they’d affect each other based on their actions. Some would learn from others, some would lead, some would be dismissive, while others may be oblivious. After these various moments, think of quests they could go on with each other, or under what circumstances you’d like them to meet. While drafting these vague moments - keep connecting them, which will then create the path of your overall story fate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, write the same main events from the perspective of your different characters, their understanding of the occurrences, and their outlook and opinions of other characters. No perspective will be a repetition, giving the writer room of experimentation of choices, quests, and lessons learned. The main events stay the same in all of their paths, hence being the crux of your overall story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There aren’t many books out there to help you systematically craft multiverse plots that can be saturated into a compact reasonable game. Some novel series make attempts at multiplot narratives but unless you’re recreating those specifically, which would be a different kind of challenge in itself, you’d have better luck crafting your own vision that you wish to direct, formate, and give life to, i.e. if you’ve got some big ideas. Needless to state, this stage of writing is meat for your entire production and should be given the most amount of time. To profile your budget and streamline your thinking. It would take intuitive writing, reworking of ideas, and most of all organized planning, which brings me to talk about some obvious and great tools to help you on this journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Look and Feel/Art Direction - Start with the staple look and feel of certain scenes you have in mind. Make a google doc, flood it in. But in an organized structure. Collect lots and lots of references, from other movies, scenes, preferably live action, but animation also works wonders. Collect everything you see fit, that matches your vision.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Beat Sheet (Excel sheets) - A classic.">Beat Sheet (Excel sheets) - A classic.</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While drafting your multi-plots and developing the different characters, having it all in one place is a god sent - logic gift. Don’t abuse the empty space, keep reiterating, keep it clean, keep color coding your sequences and scenes. The beat sheet acting like a visual map will help you figure out the story challenges and how to bridge the gaps in them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Storyboarding - Bad at drawing? Work with stick figures. Or don’t draw at all. Storyboarding is a must however, so some alternate heavy lifting will be needed, take screenshots from your visual references. Researching the camera shots you want in your scene, the number of characters, the time of day, the motion of the players. Be sure to include all kinds of details you imagine taking place, from set details to expression details. Although keep in mind to depict moments concisely, to not stretch them unnecessarily, and be mindful of the time they take up. Alternatively, if you’ve got a good collection of references going, you could also edit together an acting reel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With these basics covered, next define your sets, your quests, and your levels - if it's a game - and even otherwise. And you’ll be all set with a happening multi-branch game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And finally, we wanted to advocate for using AI tools to help out here and there, but we strongly believe that during brainstorming, you’re better off without AI in your production. We think it slows down the momentum that otherwise has the potential to go smoothly. AI might be useful to find references, but then again the technology is not built for that, and it does more harm than good to our existence, for no needed reason. A whole upcoming blog in itself, stay tuned!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-hell-biome-in-sols-rng/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-get-the-hell-biome-in-sols-rng" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">How to Get the Hell Biome in Sol's RNG</a> - Zoey Handley</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As of the Era 7 update for Roblox’s <em>Sol’s RNG</em>, there are six biomes you might find yourself in (not to mention weather and time of day). One of these is Hell, which isn’t even the rarest of the biomes, but it does allow you to roll for four unique auras, including the coveted Bloodlust aura.</p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">I probably don’t have to say this, but getting to the Hell Biome is largely just random chance, as is most things in <em>Sol’s RNG</em>. It’s right there in the name. To be specific, the Hell Biome has a 1/6666 (0.015%) chance of appearing and lasts 11 minutes. This gets rolled every second, but it could still take a long time before you can experience Hell.</p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">If a roll is successful, you will be notified that the biome has appeared via in-game chat.</p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">But to make a long story short, if you want to get to the Hell Biome without waiting for a lucky roll, then you can join <em>Sol’s RNG’s</em> Discord and check the private server tab. You can then join a server and be spawned in the Hell Biome. This will allow you to start rolling for auras, but remember, this only lasts 11 minutes.</p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">If you need more info on how to join the Discord server, we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sols-rng-trello-and-discord-links-to-join-the-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a guide</a> you can check out.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-bloodlust-aura-in-sol-s-rng" data-injectable="false">How to get the Bloodlust aura in Sol’s RNG</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">If you want to get the Bloodlust aura in Sol’s RNG, then you’ll have to keep rolling the dice (of course).&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">That could take quite a while because the chances of getting the Bloodlust aura is 1/50,000,000 (0.000002%). To put that into perspective, the odds of getting struck by <a href="http://lightningsafetycouncil.org/Odds.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lightning in a given year</a> is 1/1,600,000. A year is a long time between “rolls,” but it paints an interesting picture.</p>
 <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">You can improve your odds of getting rare auras by using certain gear like the Gravitational Device. You can also improve your odds of getting struck by lightning by carrying a long metal pole.</p>

Rolling for this while it is raining may increase your chances, but it still isn’t guaranteed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">To tilt the odds in your favor, consider using Lucky Potions for a temporary 100% Luck boost.

			<p>Red Dead Redemption may finally launch on PC 14 years after its original release, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported by Tez2 on<a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2"> X/Twitter</a>, a screenshot showing a code string mentioning the PC version of the popular Old West-themed open-world game released back in 2010 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is making the rounds online. As Tez2 has yet to mention where this string has been discovered, we must take this PC port rumor with a huge grain of salt until more info comes in. [<strong>Update</strong> - The strings were found in <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1790038268630663441%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">Rockstar's launcher site file</a>.]</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like Rockstar is gearing up to release <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDR1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RDR1</a> on PC. <a href="https://t.co/2xMmpFIdCk">pic.twitter.com/2xMmpFIdCk</a></p>

<p>While this PC port of Red Dead Redemption has yet to be confirmed, it's not like Rockstar Games denied its game would never be released on PC. Following the release of an updated port on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick did not deny its existence, saying that any <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc/">game announcement is up to the developer</a>, suggesting that something was indeed in the works.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption is now available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch, as well as on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. We will let you know more about the rumored PC port as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts To DOOM &amp; DOOM Eternal’s Guns</p>
      </div>
<p>Id Software developed 2020's Doom Eternal, the latest entry in the main series. The mobile game Mighty Doom released in 2023 and was made by Alpha Dog Games. Microsoft recently closed the studio as part of a wider shakeup. Mighty Doom will go offline in August.</p><p>In January this year, ZeniMax filed a trademark application for <a href="https://twitter.com/Odah_SFA/status/1747585089804832836" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"IDKFA,"</a> which is an <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom_Cheat_Codes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic classic Doom cheat code.</a> Whether or not this is related to a new game announcement is unknown.</p><p>Doom Eternal had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/" data-ref-id="1900-6417432">positive critical reception</a> upon launch in 2020. It was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch consoles, as well as PC. Microsoft now owns Bethesda, id Software, and the Doom series, but it's unclear if any future releases in the franchise would be exclusive to Xbox on console.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-event-schedule-2024/1100-6523262/" data-ref-id="1100-6523262">Xbox Games Showcase on June 9</a> promises game announcements and other reveals. The event will be followed by a second briefing focused on a different game, and it's expected to be the next Call of Duty.</p><p>It's been a rocky 2024 for Xbox so far, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Microsoft laid off more than 1,900 people this year and closed four Bethesda studios.</a></p>

The latest episode of the GI Microcast is now available in podcast form, delivering your weekly dive into the biggest stories of the past week. The video will be available tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
This week, we take a quick dive in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">Xbox's closure of four Bethesda-owned studios</a>, as well as what this means for Microsoft's wider gaming strategy, the future of the smaller studios it still owns, and its reputation with the rest of the industry and gamers.
</p>
<p>
We also discuss <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">Nintendo's first official word on Switch 2</a> - or, as it should be called, New Nintendo Switch U XL - as well as the platform holder's financials, and why the market really needs a new console before Christmas 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rumors-are-swirling-around-a-possible-new-doom-reveal/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rumors-are-swirling-around-a-possible-new-doom-reveal" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Rumors are swirling around a possible new Doom reveal</a> - Andrew Heaton</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The last game we got in the <em>Doom</em> series was 2020’s <em>Eternal</em>. A fine game it was as well (though I personally prefer the 2016 entry). Given that it’s only been four years then, one would hardly expect a new installment so soon. We know how long AAA titles take to develop in this climate. However, something may be on the horizon soon.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Back in January of this year, <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98349237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax Media registered a trademark</a> that many interpreted as being <em>Doom</em> related. The trademark itself was given the title “IDKFA,” a well-known reference to a cheat code from the earlier games. Given this, many have assumed that this <em>has</em> to be in relation to an upcoming game.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge’s Tom Warren</a> also teased a <em>Doom </em>may be on the way in a recent write-up on what’s happening inside Microsoft and Xbox right now. “Microsoft will be banking on some new game announcements lifting the <em>Doom</em> around Xbox,” Warren writes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> also reports that it’s heard similar things.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">We have so few details about this speculation that I’m surprised I’m able to fill the required word count for this article (though I do waffle sometimes). As such, it can’t be said what ZeniMax has planned. All we can do is play the Speculation Game based on what people strongly suspect, given the <em>Doom</em> reference.</p> <h2 id="h-could-an-announcement-be-made-soon" data-injectable="false">Could an announcement be made soon?</h2> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">Not long ago, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/">Xbox Showcase for 2024</a> was announced, which will be going ahead on June 9. This will be a chance for a lot of Xbox-related content to be shown off and teased. Seeing as id Software – the studio behind <em>Doom</em> – is part of this business umbrella, there’s every possibility a new game in the iconic series could be announced.</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">I’m spit-balling, of course. None of the official Twitter/X accounts from the likes of id, Bethesda, Xbox or even the <em>Doom</em> profile itself mention any kind of announcement inbound. Makes sense if they want to keep it schtum, though.</p> <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">We don’t even know if id Software will be the developer of any future <em>Doom</em> games. I mean, it would seem likely, given the studio has been making them since 1993 (albeit not with the same people onboard). But as I say, these are just rumors, so we’ll hopefully know more either during or just before the Xbox Showcase goes live.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">The showcase will be an important moment for Xbox either way, as the company <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-says-it-needs-smaller-prestigious-games-right-after-killing-the-studio-behind-the-small-prestigious-hi-fi-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faces scrutiny</a> for its recent closure of several studios, including Arkane Austin and Tango GameWorks. This summer’s stream will show what road Xbox has ahead without the makers of <em>Prey </em>and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>on-board.</p>

 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</em></h2> <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">Those seeking adventure should look towards&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.&nbsp;</em>This (take a deep breath) <em>12-year-old game</em> (breathe out) still has a fervent fanbase, and is still played to this day for good reason. There are many weapons, armor, spells, and even dragon shouts to find across the open world. There are also branching side quests that in and of themselves have deep, fascinating stories and characters behind them. You should take an arrow in the knee in this game and explore the grand landscapes of Skyrim with Xbox Game Pass. The Special Edition also comes with all of the DLC.</p>

This entry was my first step into the series, and I was floored by this sci-fi experience. Each weapon in Master Chief’s arsenal feels powerful, but in the frantic first-person shooter levels, you’re scrounging for whatever you can find, adding to the tension of battle. Finding improved weapons from the tough bosses you kill in the open world is gratifying, and the world itself truly grabbed me. The storyline with Master Chief saving the UNSC and the world on the brink is also thrilling to experience. The multiplayer, to me, feels dated with tired map design and modes, but the single-player campaign is the main attraction.</p>

The action is also fantastic as you switch between the powers of your allies and string together combos on your foes.&nbsp; You also can’t forget the stand-out music selection in <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>with rock hits from Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, and The Black Keys. </p>

It’s a worldwide phenomenon for a reason as it allows players to build their own structures, craft their own items, and explore a randomly generated world.

Alongside your friends, you’re taking down monstrous beasts, collecting their materials, fur, etc, and then crafting incredible gear for your player. It’s a rewarding game loop that keeps you playing for hours on end.</p>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"> There’s a strategy to each battle, and you need to keep your wits about you to survive in some of these encounters. Ultimately, it’s <em>Monster Hunter’s</em> new maneuverability of the wirebugs that lets you zip from place to place like Indiana Jones’ whip that really made it click for me. You can also mount your pet palamute, letting you get to the battle quicker. It’s one of the best games on Xbox Game Pass because of how gratifying collecting resources and physically seeing your character getting stronger is.</p>

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Ready or Not</em> made its 1.0 debut <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ready-or-not-1-0-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late in 2023</a> and established itself as a fairly decent, if sometimes flawed attempt at bringing the classic <em>SWAT</em> gameplay formula back into the limelight. One of its biggest problems was the twitchy, trigger-happy AI, and this is being reigned in very soon.</p> <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">While it is to be expected that <em>some</em> of the perpetrators present in <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s many missions would, indeed, be hyper-aggressive, the issue was that they all behaved like highly trained, laser-focused super-mercenaries rather than nervous armed civilians, which they often were. As the developer Void Interactive explains in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/4210378060872317425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its recent Steam blog</a>, this problem is being curtailed through the implementation of a “cone” visibility feature, which should make the whole thing feel much more believable and organic in gameplay.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="Is Ready or Not on Xbox?" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Is-Ready-or-Not-on-Xbox.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure> <h2 id="h-ready-or-not-s-ai-is-getting-a-much-needed-detection-upgrade" data-injectable="false">Ready or Not’s AI is getting a much-needed detection upgrade</h2> <p data-characters="708" data-current-count="1008" data-injectable="true">One of the things that often played a role in making the AI feel downright unfair is <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s current viewing model: the parallel model. Here, <em>RoN</em>‘s AI tracks invisible traces from the NPCs’ eyes to the player character’s top and bottom of the head, the lower left arm, and the lower right arm. Whenever <em>any</em> of an armed AI’s traces would connect with two of the aforementioned player hotspots without any geometry blocking its field of vision, the AI would immediately react and be prepared for the player’s entry. This is particularly egregious when the AI “spots” the player through minute gaps in map geometry, leading to unfair encounters and deaths.</p>
 <p data-characters="630" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">The new cone model, on the other hand, solves this problem through a more granular handling of map geometry and the player vs AI positioning. Further, it also allows for a far more in-depth visibility system during gas grenade deployments. This, combined with a few notable aggression tweaks, such as the AI firing at the player’s last known location rather than tracking them through map geometry, makes for a substantially improved gameplay experience. At least, in theory, as all of these changes will only be implemented into <em>Ready or Not</em> with one of the future updates. Possibly <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ready-or-not-outlines-the-ominous-sounding-home-invasion-dlc-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming <em>Home Invasion</em> DLC</a>, perhaps.</p>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">On top of discussing AI improvements, Void Interactive also used this opportunity to highlight the fact that May is the month of mental health awareness. The studio is going to be “bringing attention to Mental Health Awareness month by uploading videos which explore various concepts of mental health related to the themes present in <em>Ready or Not.</em>” The first video, titled <em>PTSD</em>, can be found below:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Ready or Not - Mental Health Awareness Month - PTSD" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIFg98i3MWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="false"><em>Ready or Not</em>‘s Commander Mode is meant to illustrate some of the problems that arise from dealing with SWAT situations in the real world. While the specifics of its handling of the subject matter are open to interpretation, Void Interactive’s intention is clear and pointed, and bringing more attention to mental health awareness is always a good thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://aftermath.site/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I Saw The TV Glow Is Two Different Movies In One</a> - Riley MacLeod</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Representation,” for better or worse, tends to be the big talking point when discussing trans media; movies, TV, games, and more are lauded for showing trans people to ourselves. As someone who’s been out as trans for over 20 years, and making trans art for just as long, I tend to <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-have-mixed-feelings-about-the-last-of-us-part-2s-tran-1844245756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roll my eyes</a> at this, lamenting the ways it can limit the stories we tell. The film <em>I Saw The TV Glow </em>takes a moving, fraught approach to this problem, telling a hugely trans story without mentioning trans people at all.</p><p><em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> follows Owen, who begins the movie as a withdrawn 7th grader in 1996, when he meets 9th grade loner Maddy. The two bond over a TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, a <em>Buffy</em>-esque (down to the credits font) story of two girls who fight a monster of the week through a mystical connection on the astral plane. Owen drifts through childhood until the show is cancelled, when Maddy disappears. Then, Owen drifts through adulthood until Maddy suddenly reappears, with an outlandish story about their connection to <em>The Pink Opaque </em>and a frightening proposition for how they can rekindle it.&nbsp;</p><p>(I try to keep things vague from here on out to avoid spoilers, but it’s a bit inevitable in order to dig into <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em>, so let this be your <strong>spoiler warning</strong>.)</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I Saw The TV Glow | Official Trailer HD | A24" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kymDzCgPwj0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s one reading of this movie as a movie about fandoms and young people finding themselves through media. If you grew up in the 90s, you’ll spot appearances from Amber Benson, who played Tara on <em>Buffy</em>, and the stars from <em>The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete</em>; at the theater I saw the movie in, trailers for these shows played before the lights went down. Director Jane Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “I think a lot of my own mythology, of my childhood and coming of age, was created by a lot of those shows.” <em>The Pink Opaque</em> brings Maddy and Owen together, and shapes the course of Maddy’s life, at least, in major ways. In adulthood, it remains a place Owen escapes to, though it loses some of its luster over time. <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> wonderfully uses <em>The Pink Opaque </em>as a focal point without over-explaining the show, giving you enough glimpses to understand it while letting you fill in the gaps with whatever your childhood obsession of choice was.&nbsp;</p><p>A movie about realizing things about yourself through childhood nerd culture would be a fine movie, and I think it’s a fine way to read <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em>. But another reading of the movie is that Owen is trans, and also there’s a TV show, and the two don’t have all that much to do with each other. It’s fairly obvious–or maybe obvious if you’re trans–that Owen is not a cis guy, and the entire movie is just about him either not realizing it or not dealing with it. (I tried to write this piece without using pronouns, but it got clunky, and given that Owen never makes overtures toward any other pronouns, it doesn’t feel wrong to use “he,” though it doesn’t feel quite right either.) Whatever gender stuff Owen has going on is shoved so far down that he can only acknowledge it as a howling, empty void inside, and not looking at that void infuses every aspect of his life. </p><p>I don’t think he’s entirely ignorant of it; at one point, when he asks his dad if he can stay up late to watch <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, his dad remarks that it’s a show for girls. When Maddy asks him about his sexuality and he says “I think I like TV shows,” I didn’t think he looked confused about himself as much as so intentional about keeping all his desires at bay that he doesn't even know what they are. There’s a scene where he’s wearing a strappy top, possibly a dress, though it wasn’t clear to me if it was a flashback or a fantasy. I read adult Maddy’s offer to reconnect to the show as an invitation to Owen to transition, or at least finally look at the possibility of being trans, or at least stop living the repressed, miserable life he makes no efforts to escape.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_10-edited.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A shot from The Pink Opaque. Credit: A24</figcaption></figure><p>As a trans viewer, <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> feels like a very trans movie, despite the fact that it never once mentions trans people. But it’s not a story about transitioning, the primary story trans people were allowed to tell about ourselves for so long that <em>not</em> telling it <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/27/the-invention-of-the-trans-novel-imogen-binnie-nevada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaped my career</a>. Instead, it’s an intensely emotional look at <em>not</em> transitioning; at telling yourself it’s impossible even when you can see that it isn’t, because you think it’s just impossible <em>for you</em>; at what choosing that path feels like and where it leads. Nothing, even Maddy’s reappearance or the TV show that matters <em>so much </em>to them, can really get through the static of the unspoken that overwhelms Owen’s life. Through that lens, <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is almost incidental to the story–it’s worth noting that I didn’t catch anything explicitly queer or trans about the show, or even an in-depth explanation of what Maddy and Owen like about it so much. I think this is a good choice on director Schoenbrun’s part; it keeps the movie from drifting into nerdcore, and it also avoids what I see as a common pitfall of “this piece of media made me realize I’m trans” stories, which can give the media in question (usually made by cis people) too much power over trans people's imaginations. <em>The Pink Opaque</em> doesn’t teach Owen anything about himself or his gender; unlike Maddy, who he watches cry during their viewing nights, it’s just another thing his repression keeps him from touching.</p><p>But again, the movie never talks about any of this. <em>I Saw The TV Glow </em>and Schoenbrun’s previous film, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4s7v7djmBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We’re All Going To The World’s Fair</a></em>, received <a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/arts-entertainment/trans-filmmaker-explores-dysphoria-through-internet-horror-in-were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-21569357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">praise</a> for being adjacent-to-the-mainstream films with trans themes by a trans director. <em>I Saw The TV Glow </em>is distributed by A24; at <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/jane-schoenbrun/i-saw-the-tv-glow-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paste</a>, reviewer Leigh Monson praised the movie for this, writing, “A transgender filmmaker laying bare these specific emotions for a general audience to empathize with is undoubtedly a cause for celebration” and noting that “the relative high profile of <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> makes it something of a unicorn.”&nbsp;</p><p>But because of this profile, I can’t help wondering what it means that we have a mainstream-ish trans film that never actually <em>says</em> the word “trans.” It asks trans viewers to do the work that we did in all that media of our childhoods, reading too much into subtext and giving the film meaning by heaping our own lives on top of it. As a commentary on the necessity of that, especially in the 90s, it’s an artful choice, and to be clear I think the movie would lose all of its power if it made transness explicit. But as someone who sometimes lies awake at night wondering what my career might have looked like if everything I wrote and staged and edited wasn’t so fucking trans, whose undergrad advisor at a prestigious playwriting school told him “No one wants to see that pervert shit” and demanded I write something else when I brought in a thesis play starring trans characters, I can’t help but wonder if the silent presence of transness is part of what makes the movie able to enter the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=710" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=425&amp;quality=75 425w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=850&amp;quality=75 850w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=585&amp;quality=75 585w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=1170&amp;quality=75 1170w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=710&amp;quality=75 710w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2024/05/TV-GLOW_09-edited.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 30rem) 425px, (min-width: 30rem) and (max-width: 40rem) 585px, (min-width: 40rem) 710px" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A24</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ll let me sound like a cranky old man for a second: everyone’s transition is their own, and there’s no timeline for coming out, and no one way to be trans. But I’ve always looked a little askance–or if I’m being really honest, jealously–at celebrities like Elliot Page or the Wachowskis who came out later in life, who became mouthpieces for the trans community by virtue of already having mouthpieces. The ethics of being out have shifted radically during my lifetime, but I still have a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_Nation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queer Nation</a> roots to my politics that causes me to read the closet, at least in some instances, as a place of power. And you could argue that we see that in Owen’s life, especially when held up against what Maddy tells him about her own. He isn’t <em>happy</em>–he probably isn’t even in touch enough with his own emotions to be miserable–but his closeted adulthood (if you could call it closeted) has a kind of coherence, and an anemic version of safety, that it seems Maddy’s life lacks. When I let myself read <em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> as a closeted movie about a closeted person, or even as a trans movie that still primarily focuses on the question of transition but just doesn’t call it “transition,” it can feel less like something to celebrate.</p><p>But these critiques were just some of the million thoughts that went through my head after seeing the movie, and they're less critiques and more a sign of how many readings the movie supports. If you take cis people’s distribution channels and ticket sales out of it, if you look at it as a story by a trans director that takes trans people as its audience, the movie is a ferocious gut punch, and it would absolutely be lesser if it made its trans content spoken or explicit. Its silence is so loud, Owen’s lack of feeling so emotional, that it couldn’t be the moving, unique story it is any other way.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I Saw The TV Glow</em> is getting a wider release this week; I’m excited for more of my trans friends to see it so we can talk about it, and for more of my cis friends to see it so I can find out how it read to them. (Also, given Schoenbrun’s previous movie: if you, like me, are worried it’s scary, it isn’t.) Maybe it’s a trans movie infiltrating the mainstream in the Trojan horse guise of 90s nostalgia; maybe it’s two movies, one for cis people and one for trans people. Whatever it is, it’s definitely worth seeing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper"><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">New The Rogue Prince of Persia Release Date Revealed</a> - Joseph Allen</div><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Empire and Ubisoft have announced the new&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>release date, and the roguelite platformer is landing at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Last week, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rogue-prince-of-persia-delayed-hades-2">delayed the upcoming game</a> in order to avoid clashing with Supergiant's&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now">launched without warning last Monday</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, though, Evil Empire says&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>will launch on May 27th, which the developer says should give people time to play&nbsp;<em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>"and the other great games that came out last week" (which include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-well"><em>Animal Well</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crow Country</em>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=JoxYxSqV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=9R3L_jtR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c84bd3c4-f408-4570-ad70-29def8f6b5ab" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=9R3L_jtR" alt="The Prince dashing across a platform in The Rogue Prince of Persia" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>has settled on a new release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Evil Empire also says it'll "keep adding polish" to&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>in the interim, too. Rather amusingly, the dev says it's "burning the whole thing down" if the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>&nbsp;</em>shadow-drops before the new release date. I think that's unlikely, guys.</p>
<p>As well as the new release date, Evil Empire has also announced&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>'s pricing, and it's not quite as expensive as some have apparently been making it out to be.</p>
<p>According to Evil Empire, some have speculated the price of the game could be anywhere from $30 to $60. The latter seems like a pretty ridiculous guess to me, and apparently to Evil Empire as well, because&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>will be priced at $19.99, with a launch discount to boot.</p>
<p>To tide you over until the game's release, a new gameplay trailer has also been released, and it features the game's theme song, too. Check it out.</p>

<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>is a roguelite platformer developed by&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>co-dev studio Evil Empire and published by&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>IP holder Ubisoft.</p>
<p>It features a stylized aesthetic and fast-paced action-platforming gameplay not a million miles away from&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells</em>, complete with plenty of weapons and skills to unlock as you play.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 27th. Be sure to check out our very own Andrew Stretch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise">preview of the game</a> to see what you're in for, too.</p>

            <p>This news post leaves me in a quandary, readers, because I will need to write a swear word for the sake of full journalistic transparency, but Google’s algorithms tend to frown on sweary articles. On the other hand, Google’s algorithms don’t like it when you spend whole intros handwringing about Google’s algorithms, either, so let’s stop, er, faffing around and speak of Doom. Id Software parent company Zenimax recently <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/983/49/idkfa-98349237.html">trademarked</a> “IDKFA”, a string of letters that will be of deep significance to original Doom players, and which may therefore be evidence of an impending announcement.</p><!--more-->
<p>IDKFA is – cover your ears, Google! - short for I Don’t Know Fuck All. It’s an ancient cheatcode that unlocks all the game’s weapons and grants you megaarmour. It being somewhat of a retro insider term bodes well, I guess, for anybody fearful that their next helping of id Software’s demon-melching series will be some kind of ultra-modernised F2P affair or similar.</p>
<p>Zenimax’s trademark covers “downloadable computer game software via a global computer network and wireless devices” and “downloadable computer game software for personal computers and home video game consoles”. Seems pretty cut-and-dried, though again in the interests of full journalistic transparency, I should add that it also covers “scientific, nautical, surveying, electric, photographic, cinematographic, optical, weighing, measuring, signalling, checking (supervision), life-saving and teaching apparatus and instruments”. So this could be a new Doom game, or it could be some kind of Doom diving bell. They really are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-doom-using-gut-bacteria-but-the-framerate-is-atrocious">putting Doom on everything these days</a>.</p>
<p>“Doom: Year Zero” was among the games mentioned in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">a Microsoft presentation from July 2020</a> that leaked online last year as part of Microsoft's legal tussle with the US Federal Trade Commission over the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Eurogamer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-offers-doom-hint-as-suggestion-of-an-imminent-reveal-swirls%E2%80%9D">have heard</a> that a Doom announcement is forthcoming at this year’s Summer Games Fest in June.</p>
<p>In other news, Zenimax parent Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">recently closed Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a>, a development that probably has every other Microsoft-owned developer of games that aren't Call Of Duty sweating in their boots. Id seem relatively secure against wider corporate “optimisation” or “repositioning”, given their outsized reputation and the success of the last couple of Doom reboots – Doom Eternal made half a billion dollars in its opening nine months. But this being Microsoft in 2024, who knows?</p>

			<p>Even if a small fraction of the leaked GTA 6 World Events gets implemented in the game's final version, they promise to shake up the open-world experience of the latest entry in the series considerably.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RedBanditGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RedBandit</a> shared on YouTube a very interesting video analyzing some of the game's leaked World Events, what they could involve, and even where they may take place on the map, using the Map Project as a reference. While RedBandit is mostly speculating, some of his takes sound extremely reasonable, considering past entries in the series, so hopefully, the final game's events will be as varied and interesting as the YouTuber speculates.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 Leaked World Events are Amazing! (Here's why)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOLn14lQttw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the release of GTA 6's reveal trailer, Rockstar Games has been silent regarding one of the most anticipated games of all time, but more on the game could be coming soon. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-new-screenshots/">Last week</a>, the game's Official Website was updated with new placeholders for screenshots, suggesting new information could be inbound.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently in development for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S and should be release in 2025 worldwide. We will let you know more about the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>
