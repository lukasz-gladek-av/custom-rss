			<p>The top-down action RPG No Rest for the Wicked could skip Xbox, at least at first, as suggested by Moon Studios founder and Game Director Thomas Mahler. While chatting in the game's official Discord channel, he <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>:</p>



<p><em>By the way, given current market conditions, we might only release on PlayStation 5 and potentially Nintendo Switch 2 for the time being. We'll have to discuss things with Microsoft to see what makes sense for Xbox.</em></p>



<p>Later, Mahler commented on X that it's not official yet, but supporting PlayStation 5 first and foremost is just common business sense at this point.</p>



<p><em>There’s nothing to officially confirm yet. We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment. Ultimately, we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!</em></p>



<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in the second half of April 2024 on PC as an early access title. At first, it was published by Private Division, but Moon Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased</a> the publishing rights back earlier this year.</p>



<p>A couple of months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the Austrian developer (primarily known for the Ori franchise) wasn't exactly doing very well, with Mahler asking fans to leave a positive review on Steam for No Rest for the Wicked to counterbalance some review bombing. That may be why they are prioritizing the most lucrative platforms for the console ports.</p>



<p>Indeed, Xbox doesn't have nearly as large a user base as the PlayStation 5 (or the Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, if it continues selling at this rate). The hardware sales of Microsoft's consoles have continued dwindling as the first-party games are now available not only on PC but even on other consoles, and third-party developers find it increasingly hard to spend resources on Xbox versions, unless there is a Game Pass deal involved - which is not the case so far with No Rest for the Wicked.</p>



<p>It is, however, ironic that a developer whose best-known franchise, Ori, made its fortune on Xbox, is now essentially forced to put the platform after others.</p>

One source, who chose to remain anonymous, spoke to us on the day of the layoffs and explained they were left in limbo for hours after being locked out of ZeniMax's internal Slack channel. "In the last few minutes I've unfortunately lost access to literally everything," they said. "No Slack, email, nothing is working. We have an off-work Discord, but it's all people freaking out with no real verifiable info."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They detailed how staff were frozen out of those channels before HR had made contact, prompting widespread confusion and panic. "Considering we don't have email now, I don't know how they're even supposed to contact us—I don't know if they even have my personal email," they added. Another source, who also chose to remain anonymous, corroborated that information and said the ordeal left them feeling as if they had been "run over by a truck."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-chinese-room-is-independent-again-following-management-buyout" target="_self" data-discover="true">Update: The Chinese Room confirms layoffs after regaining independence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Current ZeniMax employee and ZWU-CWA union member Page Branson described that day as "one of the worst days at a job I've ever had in my entire life."

"It's not okay. It wasn't normal. I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal—it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way—it's not," she added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-14-steam-wages-war-on-porn-krafton-goes-nuclear-and-king-reportedly-swaps-humans-for-ai-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #14: Steam wages war on porn, Krafton accused of going nuclear, and King reportedly swaps humans for AI tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some people were here for 15 years and cut out.

"I would beg you—I would get on my knees and beg [you] right now—to please talk to people and ask them what this is like on the ground level before sending out the blast emails that you do," she said, referring to the leaked internal memo (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025">via Windows Central</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) sent out by Phil Spencer that communicated widespread layoffs while simultaneously noting that Xbox has "more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-and-netflix-greenlight-assassins-creed-live-action-series" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft and Netflix greenlight Assassin's Creed live-action series</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You are too far away to have any idea how—maybe not intentionally—how hollow those emails are," added Michell, who acknowledged that while there is no "right" way to make layoffs, Microsoft has repeatedly missed the mark by a country mile. "This is an acute traumatic event and it needs to be treated like that," she added. "[...] How do we mitigate the impact of how absolutely traumatic this is on people, including those who survive it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Branson explained she has never had any personal interactions with Xbox leadership, she feels they will struggle to regain the trust of employees after upending so many lives over the past 18 months. "I don't know what they can do at this point to win back trust from the consumers and some of their employees," she said. "I continue to think back to [the closure of] Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin—watching that happen is now the second worst day of my career.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"These mass layoffs affect real people and real families and throw their lives into disarray. I wish for empathy, is the core of my messaging. I wish for people to be empathetic and think about the human cost when it comes to all of this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's currently unclear how many people have been laid off at ZeniMax specifically, but one anonymous source told us it was a "fuck ton" and another indicated hundreds have been impacted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-future-has-been-stolen-zenimax-union-workers-respond-to-microsoft-layoffs">In a public statement issued last week</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and ZeniMax Online Studios United-CWA (ZOSU-CWA)—another union to have formed within ZeniMax—said no union members have been laid off yet but confirmed it remains possible that some will eventually be made redundant. The CWA and ZeniMax union representatives remain in negotiation with Microsoft over the layoffs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Workers claim Microsoft just kicked decades of institutional knowledge to the curb">Workers claim Microsoft just kicked decades of institutional knowledge to the curb</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The emotional impact of the layoffs—on both those being made redundant and those who remain—is evident. The more practical downside is that Microsoft has just erased decades of experience in the blink of an eye, making it harder for the developers who kept their jobs to maintain the same level of quality their employer (and its shareholders) will undoubtedly expect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight," said Branson. "Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell claimed ZeniMax has lost a third of the institutional knowledge that was keeping a lot of its projects running smoothly. Microsoft said the cuts were made in service of streamlining workflows and making studios more agile, but Mitchell suggests the reality will likely require remaining employees to grind themselves to the bone by taking on the work of multiple people.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," she explains. "I don't really know [how that works]. It looks like a lot of people moving between projects to fill in the position of someone who was laid off—and it probably took them a good six months to figure out [how to do that role effectively]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a human and emotional level, Mitchell said it's also just really difficult to do your best work when you're "looking at a graveyard." She explained ZWU-CWA union members had only just agreed a contract with Microsoft that will see them return to the office. One of the silver linings of that situation was the possibility of collaborating more closely with colleagues in-person. Now, many of those people no longer have jobs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Microsoft just took everything that could have been great about the culture and collaboration and decimated it," she added. "Morale is terrible. It's grotesque. People are stressed. They're crying. For a lot of us, those were some of our best friends. They're our roommates. In my case it was my partner—my partner and I worked together and he was laid off. And I'm not a unique story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's terrible. It's going to take a lot of time to heal. It's going to take a lot of time to regroup and get those projects running smoothly again. I also think we need to bring some people back. I don't see how we get through this work without bringing some people back."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'"><span>'</span>A lot of us are trying to stay because we believe in making it better'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both Mitchell and Branson believe the layoffs would have been so much worse at ZeniMax had so many of its members not unionized. Hundreds of ZeniMax employees have successfully organized under the ZeniMax Workers United-CWA and ZOS United-CWA banners and those groups are now rallying together to provide support to each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's reassuring having an organization like CWA for people during this moment, because if we hadn't organized and if we didn't have the backing of an outside organization that could fight for the people who have been affected—and those who still retain their jobs—it would be night and day for people," said Branson. "It's incredibly helpful to have their resources behind us during this time. I remain a very, very strong advocate for unionization across, not just the video game industry, but the whole tech industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell explained union members across divisions have united to help each other navigate the situation by editing resumes, hosting mock interviews, and reviewing portfolios. They are essentially doing whatever they can to ensure those who've had their lives derailed by Microsoft aren't simply left out in the cold. She also noted that some of those who fought tirelessly for unionization within ZeniMax will now be prevented from seeing the fruits of their labor, but said their collective efforts will help pave the way for a brighter future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We just ratified our first contract. It was a real moment of celebration for us, but we only had about two weeks to celebrate it. In that regard, it's hard not to feel like 'damn, we just went through all of that and now a third of us aren't going to see this thing in action,'" she added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell believes there is still progress to be made when it comes to securing better contract terms and mitigating the impact of layoffs, but said that unions have given workers the means to break down the communication silos between teams and departments, enabling them to rally together in the face of catastrophic moments like these. She hopes there is a chance that ZeniMax employees will be able to continue working together to overcome the pain and adversity caused by Microsoft, and suggested she would have left the company long ago if she didn't truly believe that was possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm still at Microsoft. It's not like I'm looking for other work. A lot of us are trying to stay because we believe in making it better. I think that's important for anybody who's reading to understand, especially the executives," said Mitchell. "If people are sticking around it's not just because they're fearful of losing a job. It's because at some point in time, they have believed in the culture and values that were once created at this place."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has approached Microsoft for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>The actor, known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust, voices Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's well-praised RPG. But Cox hasn't played a game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary'," Cox said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHK8HD2scfY">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon</a> in New Orleans. "They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</p>

He reiterated this point at GalaxyCon after being confused by a fan question, as he's unfamiliar with the full game.</p>
<p>"I wanna play the game," he said. "I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</p>
<p>When the fan told him he did a fantastic job, he replied: "People keep telling me that and I feel like a fraud because I just did the voice."</p>

            <p>The voice actors for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Toad and Peach have been announced, following the surprise recasting of Samantha Kelly last month.</p>
<p>Back in June, Kelly - who had voiced Toad and Princess Peach for 18 years - revealed she would no longer be providing their vocals for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. This came as a surprise to Kelly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">who was only informed by Nintendo when Mario Kart World released without her name attached to the project</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them," Kelly said at the time. "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever."</p>
<p>Now, Toad and Peach's new voice actors have been revealed, and they are played by Paul Castro Jr. and Courtney Lin respectively. Castro Jr.has also lent his vocals to the likes of NEO: The World Ends with You, while Lin's previous credits include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing the news, <a href="https://x.com/PaulCastroJr/status/1947503212095017462">Castro Jr. called the role of Toad a "childhood dream"</a>, adding he "can't thank Nintendo enough" for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Lin, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/thecourtneylin/status/1947399822946013624">said she was "eternally grateful" to Nintendo for "trusting me to help carry the legacy of this icon"</a>. Lin also voiced Baby Peach in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"These characters are so much bigger than ourselves. I am so honoured and honestly can still hardly believe it. I have so much respect for all of the Peaches that came before me, especially the one I grew up with," Lin continued. "I will do my best with every opportunity I am given, and I hope you all have been enjoying the game. Wahooo!! Sweet."</p>

<p>Toad and Peach aren't the only characters to have new voice actors in Mario Kart World.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-japanese-dub-actor-reprises-role-for-donkey-kong-bananza">Kouji Takeda was confirmed as the new Donkey Kong voice actor for the Switch 2 generation</a>, replacing Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Nintendo's main monkey for over two decades.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-charles-martinet-no-longer-video-game-voice-of-mario">Nintendo recast beloved Mario, Luigi, and Wario voice actor Charles Martinet after three decades</a>. Following Martinet's departure, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/internet-briefly-thinks-its-identified-marios-new-voice-actor-until-he-says-no">Kevin Afghani announced he'd taken over the role</a> shortly before the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros.

<p>Don't be shy, come closer...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We rewarded Migami Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/chronicles_of_the_wolf">Chronicles of the Wolf</a> a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/chronicles-of-the-wolf">super solid 7/10</a> when it launched just a few weeks ago, saying that, <em>"if you've got the patience to revisit a time when games were slower and more cryptic, and the pacing was a little more intense, Chronicles of the Wolf is like a rich, dark relic that you’ll treasure."</em></p>
<p>For those who're attracted by such a challenge, well, good news! Migami Games has just an announced that their metroidvania is now fully compatible with Switch 2 consoles. Hooray!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The time has now come for you to fulfil your destiny on Nintendo Switch 2. The wait is over, you can now enjoy Mateo’s haunting journey through Gévaudan with improved performance and compatibility on Nintendo’s latest hardware. Whether you’re hunting the Beast for the first time or returning to finish the fight, the experience has never looked or played better on Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With over 100 unique enemies, and a fairly lush gothic vibe about it all, Chronicles of the Wolf has certainly been doing quite well with audiences across the internet, and may not be a bad shout for a fresh new metroidvania challenge to break in your fresh new Switch 2 console!</p>
<p>In terms of upgrades or special features for Switch 2, there is no word of anything of note, so it seems that performance fixes - and there were a few technical issues on switch 1 - will be the highlight here. Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bloodstained_ritual_of_the_night">Bloodstained</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a> should take note, by the way, that not only is the voice of Alucard himself involved here (yes, that's Robert Belgrade on narration duties), there's also a special guest appearance from a Bloodstained character. Lots of crossover fun, it seems!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fable Rumored to Be Missing 2026 Launch Window, Too]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fable-rumored-missing-2026-launch-window/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fable-rumored-to-be-missing-2026-launch-window-too.1249374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In late February, Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> to fans that Fable would be missing its 2025 launch window. He did so while reassuring them with a new, gorgeous Pre-Alpha gameplay video that promised everything was in order except for the additional polish required before shipping the game.</p>



<p>However, according to insider Shpeshal Nick, there's a chance Fable might miss 2026, too. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gB3q8GursaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the latest episode of the XboxEra podcast</a>, he relayed information from two sources that suggested a delay is not out of the question:</p>



<p><em>I don't think Fable's next year. My information is that it's not going to be 2026. I've heard it from two different people now that Fable may slip to 2027. And that's not doom and gloom, oh, there's something wrong with the game. Problems. Just hearing that it's taking a little bit longer than they expected.<br>It's not about agreeing or disagreeing, I've had two different people tell me. One of them wasn't from Microsoft. I'm hearing that it's probably going to slip to 2027. Don't get me wrong, I'm well aware of what will probably happen now. Someone from Playground will probably come out and go, "No, no, it's next year."</em></p>



<p>While Shpeshal Nick got a few Xbox rumors right before, he doesn't exactly have a spotless record, either. As such, take it with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>If it turned out to be the case, though, it would be another blow to Microsoft's reputation. Fans are already disgruntled after the cancellation of the Perfect Dark reboot and the ZeniMax Online Studios MMORPG, not to mention the related layoffs. Moreover, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> that the twenty-fifth anniversary of Xbox, due to take place next year, would be celebrated with the return of several historic franchises, including Fable, Forza, Gears of War, and another that might be Halo.</p>



<p>Going back on that promise wouldn't work in Microsoft's favor. At the same time, rushing a game that is not ready wouldn't be great, either. But Playground Games has reportedly been working on the game for around eight years now, and while it is understandable that it would take them a while to get a grip on the action RPG genre (they only ever did racing games before), making that a full ten years to 2027 would be too much. They even got help from Eidos Montréal, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2024, although a <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> from the Canadian studio suggests their part of the work on Fable might have been completed.</p>



<p>Even without Fable, Microsoft could still have a decent first-party lineup in 2026 between Clockwork Revolution, the new Forza game, Gears of War: E-Day, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored Halo: Combat Evolved remake</a>, not to mention what Bethesda and Activision Blizzard may have in store for next year. Even so, it would be another blow for the Xbox division in the eyes of fans.</p>



<p>We'll update this story if anyone from Playground Games and/or Microsoft wishes to comment on the rumor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Ori Dev" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d537c5efe285d/ori-dev.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Moon Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-22T03:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Tue 22nd Jul 2025, 4:30am</time>]:</strong> As highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-skip-xbox-for-the-time-being-due-to-current-market-conditions">Pure Xbox</a>, Moon Studio CEO Thomas Mahler has provided an update today about <strong><a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-skip-xbox-for-the-time-being-due-to-current-market-conditions">No Rest for the Wicked</a></strong> coming to other platforms.</p>
<p>Although it seems the Xbox version might be ruled out in the immediate future, a Switch 2 version is still "potentially" on the cards despite the "current market conditions". Mahler <a href="https://x.com/delmontyb/status/1947313884584398874">reportedly confirmed this on Discord</a> (<a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/44658-ori-devs-gauging-interest-in-bringing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-to-switch-2-update">via GoNintendo</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Given current market conditions, we might only release on PS5 and potentially Switch 2 for the time being - we'll have to discuss things with MS to see what makes sense for Xbox."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493">separate thread on social media</a>, Mahler also noted how the team would ultimately ship on all platforms, but "likely not at the same time". Keep in mind, nothing has been "officially" confirmed at this stage.</p>

<p>If we hear any other updates or a proper announcement for Switch 2, we'll let you know. You can find out more about this game in the original story below.</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-rumours-leaks-announcement-history">formally announced the Switch 2 last week</a> and while some developers appear to have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">already locked in their support</a>, other studios are still gauging whether or not to release certain titles on the Switch's successor.</p>
<p>One of these developers happens to be Moon Studios, with the CEO Thomas Mahler asking on social media if fans of the studio (as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ori_and_the_blind_forest_definitive_edition">Ori</a> games and Nintendo platforms) would be interested in the team's new release, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/no_rest_for_the_wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></strong> on Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard about this game, it was released in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1371980/No_Rest_for_the_Wicked/">early access on Steam last April</a>, has "mostly positive" user reviews, and is described as a "visceral precision Action RPG" aiming to reinvent the genre. Here's the story and you can check out the trailer below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year is 841 – King Harol is dead. As word of his death echoes throughout the kingdom, the crown passes to his arrogant, yet untested son Magnus.</p>
<p>Even worse, the Pestilence, an unholy plague not seen for a thousand years, has returned. It sweeps across the land, corrupting everything and everyone it touches. Madrigal Seline, a ruthlessly ambitious figure in the church, sees the Pestilence as a chance to prove herself in the eyes of her god.</p>
<p>These forces converge on the backwater Isola Sacra, where rebel groups and the provincial government fight for control amid the isle’s crumbling ruins.</p>
<p>You are a Cerim – a member of a group of mystical holy warriors imbued with remarkable powers and sworn to defeat the Pestilence at any cost. But the task will prove increasingly challenging as you become entangled in the people’s plight and the vast political struggle of this downtrodden land. Chaos will pull you in every direction as you seek to cleanse the land of wickedness and shape the kingdom’s fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this might seem like an obvious "yes, you should do it" following the sales success of the Switch, development has become increasingly costly (and timely) in recent years with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/10/concord-cost-sony-over-usd200-million-and-didnt-make-a-single-cent">failures resulting in studio shutdowns</a>, so it doesn't necessarily hurt to gauge markets before committing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/the-switch-eshop-is-a-nightmare-so-weve-made-our-own-better-eshop">eShop is also more crowded than ever</a>, making it tough - even for prominent third-party and indie games to stand out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review-in-progress.1249311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Edge of Fate is a title that’s perhaps a bit too on the nose for a game balanced on a blade honed by years of iteration but also worn dull by time. In the storied and rich tradition of Destiny 2, this latest expansion once again takes a few major steps back after finally feeling like maybe it’d found its footing. The 14-mission campaign is monotonous and padded to the gills with busywork (despite having a sometimes-compelling story), the RPG and buildcrafting rework is locked behind one of the worst grinds Destiny has ever seen, and the new planetoid of Kepler isn’t up to Bungie’s usual standards. But even as it stumbles in its attempt to redefine itself after the excellent ending to its original story in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>The Final Shape</u></a> last year, I do admire the risks The Edge of Fate takes, both in the bold new direction of its story and the unexpected mechanics it tries throughout its experimental campaign – though it doesn’t exactly nail either one. I still need to play through the raid before my final review, but the 20 hours I’ve spent with it so far feel like that messy spot the MCU was in after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/23/avengers-endgame-review"><u>Endgame</u></a>, fumbling for what comes next following a conclusion that felt pretty, well… conclusive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wish I could say The Edge of Fate picks up where The Final Shape left off, or that it can easily be enjoyed on its own, but both of those are extremely not true. If you haven’t been playing every little scrap of seasonal content in the past year, you’ll certainly be off to a rocky start – there’s a new antagonist wearing the face and voice of an old character, godlike beings formerly relegated to vendors and goofy gameshow hosts who have been repositioned as omniscient puppetmasters who we’re now supposed to take seriously, and about 30 minutes of nearly nonstop info dumping, which feels like something out of a pulp sci-fi novel as voices explain how “dark matter” is totally different from “the darkness” and other such gobbledygook. It’s such a terrible opening, I feared the worst for a series that’s missed the storytelling mark more often than it’s hit by a pretty wide margin. But a weak first couple of hours makes way for a tale that was actually much better than I was expecting thanks to a very strong new supporting character in Lodi, who is shrouded in a mystery involving time travel, and a completely unexpected backstory finally given to one of Destiny’s longstanding cast members that really blew me away. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still plenty of wonky dialogue, less interesting characters like Orin who mostly just fill space, and an overreliance on established lore across over a decade of content that can leave even longtime fans scratching their heads – plus, in an effort to make the new baddie intimidating, they do one of my biggest story pet peeves and retcon it so that <em>actually</em> all of the stuff that’s ever happened was all part of their master plan (insert massive eyeroll here). But on the whole, this is one of the better stories Destiny has pulled off, and I’m especially impressed by how many massive swings are taken to make me care about the next saga in this weird universe. This is perhaps best showcased by Lodi, who manages to effortlessly feel like an invaluable part of the cast despite literally showing up out of nowhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual campaign, and especially the planet it takes place on, fare less well though. Kepler is Destiny’s first foray beyond the celestial bodies in our immediate solar system, so one might hope to marvel at places that feel new and alien, but instead we get an overly familiar setting that reuses assets we’ve seen a hundred times and slaps them onto loads of rocky cliffs and caves filled with big yellow warts. For an excursion that’s supposed to be a bold frontier that represents the future for the shooter, this is definitely one of the most lackluster settings they’ve added – to the point where I sometimes forgot The Edge of Fate was supposed to take place on a new planetoid. Seemingly in an effort to disguise how small the new area is, you aren’t allowed to summon your sparrow, which is instead replaced with a host of gimmicky abilities you have to use to access certain parts of the map, like one where you turn yourself into a tiny ball and squeeze through narrow passageways, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review"><u>Samus-style</u></a>. This structure has the vaguest possible resemblance to a metroidvania, but  usually only succeeds in making the trek back and forth to complete humdrum quests more irritating.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The new abilities can interrupt the flow of combat in an odd way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although these new abilities are generally irksome when they’re required to get around, they’re much more welcome in the context of solving puzzles during story missions. One such ability has you picking up a portal gun that lets you teleport to otherwise inaccessible areas, while another lets you shift the positioning of objects in the environment to create platforms or clear obstructions. So there are times where you find some loot just out of reach and have to use a combination of the Samus-ball and the other two to clear the way, which can be pretty neat. Unfortunately, these puzzles are so incredibly easy to solve they often feel more like busywork to artificially stretch out the adventure’s 8-hour runtime than anything of note, and since you can only use these abilities by finding specific nodes that grant you their power for a short time, I spent about 95% of my time running around searching for the tools needed to complete puzzles, and only the other 5% actually solving them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And even though I admire that Bungie has tried to incorporate these same tools into combat, they usually only serve to interrupt the flow in an odd way. For example, it’s really weird that in order to kill certain enemies or progress a boss to its next DPS phase, you’ve gotta turn yourself into a little ball of light and roll around collecting items while enemies absolutely lather you in gunfire you’ve little hope of dodging. This awkwardness is magnified by the fact that they reuse these three tricks nonstop throughout the journey on Kepler, and it starts to feel needlessly repetitive in pretty short order. Still, I’ve been saying for some time now that Destiny’s been resting on the laurels of its awesome gunplay for far too long and needs a shot in the arm to keep my interest, and these puzzle-forward abilities are at the very least an interesting attempt at doing just that, even if the execution is not always successful. Here’s hoping this is the prototype for something more engaging and fleshed out in future expansions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The wonky abilities and forgettable location aren’t the only reasons the 14 main missions in The Edge of Fate’s story are quite underwhelming though, as characters fill empty space with exposition as you fight bosses that are carbon copies of bad guys we’ve slain repeatedly throughout the years. To its credit, there are a few new enemies here and there, like flying aliens called corsairs and little robot bees that swarm you, but their impact on moment-to-moment gameplay is pretty minor when you spend 90% of the time shooting the exact same Fallen and Vex we’ve been murdering for over a decade. Even worse than the main missions though are the handful of side quests that have you literally retreading the same places you visited in story missions to scan objects and hear some more characters chatting over comms before learning you’ve completed the quest unceremoniously. Even for a game that has struggled to make interesting supplemental content, these are some of the most boring we’ve been subjected to, offering almost no benefit for completing them to boot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest changes to Destiny 2 since The Final Shape are the reworks to guns and armor, which have been overhauled yet again. I’m not one of those players who frets when updates and power creep invalidate my hard-earned loadout, so I don’t actually mind most of the changes here. A new tier system provides extremely clear labels to just how good your loot is, so you can spend less time sweating over stuff you just dismantle, and adding set bonuses to armor is a feature I’ve craved in Destiny for many years that finally gives me a real reason to hunt for different armor sets instead of finding one good set and never taking it off. The problem is that, at least right now, there isn’t enough loot to chase, with just a handful of armor sets and a little over 30 weapons added to the pool at this point, so I didn’t feel much of an incentive to rip and replace my current loadout just yet.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Destiny Rankings</h3><p>TieGuyTravis ranks each Destiny expansion since the series's conception.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The real issue is that even if I did feel compelled to hunt down the new gear available, the insane, painful grind to do so is in no way worth the effort required. Once you’ve completed The Edge of Fate’s campaign, you’re directed towards various playlists containing old content that you’re asked to replay over and over again, slowly upping your power level until you can complete activities that grant higher tier loot. What’s more, even these high level activities are just pulling from the exact same legacy content that has already been one of the main ways you’re expected to engage with Destiny 2 for years now. I was truly shocked to find that after I’d rolled credits on the new story, I was almost immediately loaded into a story mission from 2021. The new loot system has basically turned the endgame of Destiny 2 into an almost endless hamster wheel where you’re force fed the old content made arbitrarily more difficult based on the world tier and modifiers in play, all so you can get slightly better versions of existing weapons that have little use beyond (you guessed it) grinding more difficult versions of those same activities. Destiny has suffered through some pretty egregious grinds over the years, but this might just be the most brutal and ill-conceived one yet, and it almost immediately made me accept the fact that I’ll likely never have any high tier items until they decide to respect my time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final activity on my checklist before slapping a final score on this review is to play the new raid, The Desert Perpetual, which at the time of this writing was only very recently beaten by the Destiny community’s brave day-one raiders. I’ll be hopping in shortly to see what pleasant surprises, if any, are to be found. For now, The Edge of Fate strikes me as incredibly just okay, with some new experiments that don’t always work, a neat story attached to a weak campaign, and some cool tweaks to the loot game that are hidden behind the most monstrous and boring grind Destiny has ever had.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/21/edge-of-fate-temp-score-1753142216108.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I can finally say… I’m the voice"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Princess Peach - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3c82f943f7c8a/princess-peach-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last month, alongside the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, Princess Peach's voice actor Samantha Kelly revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/princess-peachs-voice-actor-has-been-replaced-after-18-years">she was no longer voicing this iconic video game character</a> after 18 years.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, it's been confirmed that the new voice of Princess Peach (and Baby Peach) is Courtney Lin.</p>
<p>Lin confirmed this in an <a href="https://x.com/thecourtneylin/status/1947399822946013624">announcement on her social media</a>. She also acknowledged how she has "so much respect" for the previous Peach voice actors and said she will do her best with "every opportunity".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Courtney Lin</strong>: I can finally say… I’m the voice of Princess Peach and Baby Peach in Mario Kart World! Eternally grateful for Nintendo, for trusting me to help carry the legacy of this icon.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>These characters are so much bigger than ourselves. I am so honored and honestly can still hardly believe it. I have so much respect for all of the Peaches that came before me, especially the one I grew up with</p>
<p>…I will do my best with every opportunity I am given, and I hope you all have been enjoying the game . Wahooo!! Sweet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Lin's <a href="https://www.thecourtneylin.com/voiceover">official website</a>, she has previously voiced characters in series like Monster High, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pokémon (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Pokémon Masters EX</a>).</p>
<p>Lin's name was previously spotted last month in the credits of Mario Kart World <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/marios-voice-actor-says-its-unbelievable-to-hear-his-voice-in-mario-kart-world">alongside Kevin Afghani (the voice of Mario)</a>, when the game was released on 5th June.</p>

<p>Once again, this confirmation follows Samatha Kelly's update, which revealed how she found out her time as Peach was "over" as the Switch 2, and the latest Mario Kart game, was releasing.</p>
<p>This voice actor swap for Princess Peach follows some recent updates about the voice actors playing Donkey Kong and Pauline in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

Whether it's uncovering them hiding in terrain or by solving clever puzzles to reach them, you'll be spending the majority of your time in the game tracking down these fruits.

Though failing an answer isn't the end of the world, it does send you back to the beginning of his dialogue and forces you to re-answer any previous questions, which can be quite an annoyance.

<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157470/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>There's something nostalgic about going back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley">Monument Valley</a>. Ustwo's indie hit debuted on mobile in 2014 and helped establish (at least for a mainstream audience) that the mobile space could include the artistry of the wider indie games scene with thoughtful, immaculately presented, perspective-bending puzzlers alongside all the clickers and tappers and match-threes. The striking presentation and Escher-style designs put it squarely in the 'games as art' category. And though short, it was sweet enough to linger long after you'd finished. I remember having a wonderful time with it on iOS.</p>
<p>Two sequels eventually came, and now they're all on PC and consoles. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_1and2_bundle">1 and 2</a>, available separately or as a bundle, are joined by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monument_valley_iii">Monument Valley III</a>, previously a Netflix Games exclusive since its December '24 mobile launch. These console versions expand the canvas to 16:9 and adapt the controls for a gamepad. And it works, just. It's a shame, though, to see the impeccable presentation let down a little by some odd choices and a glitch or two at launch.</p>
<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157462/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For Monument Valley newbies, you're presented with discreet screens featuring surreal architecture floating in a dreamy landscape and tasked with guiding your character — in this case, Noor — around the blocky structures to buttons, doorways, and eventually the exit. You don't control Noor directly; rather, you tap — or in this case scooch your cursor along the path and click (more on this later) — where you want her to walk, after which she'll make her way there, if the route is clear.</p>
<p>Movable platforms, dials, and other interactable elements enable you to change the twisting terrain in a perspective-breaking fashion which makes sense from an isometric viewpoint, but couldn't exist in real 3D space. For instance, a platform jutting out low down on one tower might form a bridge to the top of a neighbouring structure with a simple 90-degree twist - things like that.</p>
<p>As you progress, the structures and mechanics get infinitely more interesting as platforms turn in on themselves and expectations invert in surprising ways which are best discovered on your own — especially for a short game like this — but the basic goal is always the same: create a clear pathway for your character and navigate to the next objective.</p>
<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157469/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As with the previous games, there's a gentle narrative of self-discovery, here centred around sailing and restoring a lighthouse in a small ocean hub. It touches on familiar themes: relationships, responsibility, the friends we make and lose, recovery when all hope seems lost, and bringing colour back to a desolate world.</p>
<p>It's beautifully presented and animated, and touching in its way, although 'familiar' is the word. It's so delicately and deftly presented — with an injection of character that elevates it beyond just beautifully shaded shapes and illusory puzzle play — that you can't help but go with it. But if you've been playing anything outside mainstream blockbusters for the last decade, only the puzzles will surprise you.</p>
<p>That and the lack of touchscreen controls, perhaps. Instead, you use a fairly subtle circular cursor to select where you want Noor to go. Holding 'A' on an interactable element makes it movable with a push or prod of the stick. This black dot 'adheres' to any surface you can walk on (rather than floating freely across the screen), and while it's not inelegant, it's also not flawless.</p>
<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157459/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Various times, I was prodding the stick to shift a single space to a neighbouring block, but then overshot and found myself readjusting for several seconds. You can change the sensitivity in the options, but after a touchscreen's intuitiveness, any faff whatsoever feels jarring.</p>
<p>These games have always been a case of quality over quantity, and including all my note-taking and experimentation, I spent no more than two hours getting through the 11 chapters currently in the game. It was supposed to have the full Garden of Life DLC included at launch, although that's now coming as part of a larger update sometime later in 2025. You're investing in an incomplete package at launch, then, although it could do with another round of tweaks and polish to get that quality up to the standards you expect from Ustwo.</p>
<p>Nothing is game-breaking or enough to distract you from the brilliance of the base game - there are just some rough edges and glitches which stick out (I played Ver. 1. 218712). My boat jittered a bit as the eyeball on the sail blinked. Text flashed up for a split second before the 'unravel' animation began. Credits appeared garbled as department and position titles couldn't be found to display correctly above the names.</p>
<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157468/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game itself runs fine, with performance taxing the Switch a little in the open-ocean segment, although its effect is negligible on a game as sedate as this one. Testing on Switch 2, these hiccups are predictably smoothed over. I'm confident the little 'glitch' issues will be addressed in due course, but juxtaposing them with the otherwise stellar presentation, it's just noticeable.</p>
<p>Visually, MV3 is a festival of colour with some surprising and welcome variation between chapters, and it all looks pleasantly crisp on Switch - and predictably lovely on the OLED Model. The orchestral audio is a treat, too, gently enhancing the mood of the tranquil pastel stone architecture, the ominous polygonal waves, and the more surreal places the story takes you.</p>
<p>It all comes together to make an accessible puzzler of real depth and beauty, but one that doesn't quite reach its potential on a platform that offers the best of all worlds. According to the developers, after testing the functionality and finding that it led to frustration, there are no plans at this time to implement touchscreen controls on Switch. I get that the added screen real estate might make touch input less precise than on mobile, but with the cursor also lacking precision, I wonder if it would be worse.</p>
<figure><a title="Monument Valley III Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157471/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Maybe adding pinch-to-zoom creates other problems, but you would (or at least I did) expect those to be solved if you're putting out Monument Valley on this platform. It feels like a fundamental oversight that a game originally developed on a touchscreen device <em>doesn't</em> include that input on Switch. Likewise, the gyro in the Joy-Con and Pro Controllers could be used for pointer controls (see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/world_of_goo_2">World of Goo 2</a>). Given the premium you pay on Switch over the mobile apps, you might expect this option to be present, too.</p>
<p>The team is apparently open to feedback, so it's not impossible that touch input could be added in the future. Its absence isn't a dealbreaker, and this remains a wonderful piece of work. It does, however, make for a confounding first impression which doesn't have the time to completely wear off over the game's short runtime.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The confusing lack of touch controls aside, Monument Valley 3 lives up to its predecessors as an excellent little puzzler with mind-tickling structures and stunning presentation sewn together with a delicate narrative thread. That you're able to see some of the developmental stitching show through at launch is a surprise given the polish and reputation of this developer and series, but it's ultimately not enough to significantly affect your enjoyment of this slight but satisfying game.</p></section>

                <p>Every mainline Final Fantasy game introduces its own lore and cast of characters to the franchise, and Final Fantasy XVI is no exception. Set in Valisthea, a world of magic, cruel gods, and powerful Eikons, Final Fantasy XVI features one of the most mature and gritty settings of the mainline series--but still offers the expansive worldbuilding and fantastical themes the series is known for, along with unique interpretations of Final Fantasy staples like Moogles, Chocobos, crystals, and more. If you want to learn more about Valisthea, you can revisit Final Fantasy XVI's setting with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1646093127?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logos: The World of Final Fantasy XVI</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stonemaier Games has an all-star lineup, including titles such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review"><u>Wingspan</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Scythe</u></a>, and Viticulture. Vantage is the publisher’s latest hotly anticipated release, and it’s the culmination of eight years of work from studio head Jamey Stegmaier. It’s a game full of secrets and exploration, capturing some of the same vibes as mystery box series like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/lost"><u>Lost</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scavengers-reign-review-max"><u>Scavenger’s Reign</u></a>. It also just may be Stonemaier’s most revelatory game yet.</p><div catalogid="d2d33976-aa0e-48e9-aeba-c7b6dc3678e0" id="225554"><div id="225554" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Vantage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Vantage begins with a simple premise. Players take on the role of crew members of an intergalactic spaceship en route to an uncharted planet. Before landing on the destination, something goes wrong, and everyone bails in isolated escapade pods. You are now hurtling towards this heretofore unexplored world with zero understanding of what you will find. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the setup. While each player receives an individual named character with a specialty, there's no lengthy backstory. You don’t even know what organization, government, or coalition you work for. Beyond a relatively light ruleset, you know nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the mystique of Vantage. It’s an open-world exploration board game built atop the bones of video games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"><u>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/26/subnautica-review"><u>Subnautica</u></a>. This style of board game isn’t novel. There have been some popular entries in recent years, including the fantastic Sleeping Gods and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/7th-continent-board-game-buying-guide"><u>7th Continent</u></a>. But those other tabletop games are based on a foundation of historical reality with a fictional layer on top. Vantage turns this idea on its head, providing no footing for understanding or tradition. Everything is weird and unusual, sometimes bearing a resemblance to what we know, but even then, this is often used as a device to subvert expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player arrives on the planet at a randomized location. You are lost, like detritus heaved into the wind and violently scattered across a foreign body. Your position, and the conduit for the bulk of interaction, is the location card. This large rectangular card depicts your current perspective in the first person. This is your vantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each card lists a half-dozen actions, each mapped to a separate skill. These categories are broad in application, with titles such as “take”, “look”, and “help”. They are denoted by colors, with the specific use of each category given a name corresponding to the circumstances you’re currently in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means the location card will often list a separate colored action for each of the six categories. For example, the overpower action may be displayed as a red “steal” on the card, while the blue move could be listed as “chase”. This is where the game is murky, requiring players to lean on intuition by studying the card’s artwork and trying to infer a sense of context.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After selecting the action you want to perform, another player picks up the narrative booklet of the same color and flips to the entry with the same number as your location card. Each action type has its own bespoke book of story entries, making for a massive amount of content on the whole.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each action type has its own bespoke book of story entries, making for a massive amount of content on the whole.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story entries list a difficulty and a brief description of what you are trying to do. So the steal example above could be: 4 – steal the satchel laying next to the sleeping sentient. Tests in this game are straightforward. You roll a handful of dice equal to the difficulty of the action, and then either lose health, stamina, or morale based on the roll. Some dice results avoid losing any vital signs, and are typically the best possible outcome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleverly, your character – as well as other cards you may have attained on your journey, such as items or other followers – may store rolled dice so you don’t have to suffer the consequence. Other players may even absorb some of these dice depending on their abilities, effectively representing support or encouragement. This is the main throughline of the system, performing actions and then eating the results while hopefully maintaining enough mental and physical integrity to keep the adventure going. The more tools and followers you can amass during the journey, the more complex your system of mitigation becomes allowing for more interesting abilities and effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crucially, you never fail an action in Vantage. Every test automatically succeeds, with the tension residing completely around the cost. If any of your three core stats is lowered to zero, whether as the result of a roll or triggered effect, the mission immediately ends. The action system is also where the core frustrations may arise. The fuzzy context regarding descriptors, such as what “steal” actually means, and not knowing how many dice will be rolled prior to the selection, can feel too unpredictable. This approach folds into the central philosophy of discovery quite neatly, but it’s not a particularly strategic system and can sometimes take you by surprise. This can lead to abrupt endings that are unsatisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Vantage’s most compelling details is the mission. You are assigned a random goal at the outset of play that the whole group must work towards. This could be something like “attain two artifacts” or “build a home”. These are invented to avoid spoiling content, but the actual missions parallel this methodology. In pursuing your goal, you may also come across a destiny. Destinies are organically discovered objectives which can be pursued in tandem with your mission. They’re more impactful emotionally, as they arise naturally through play and often flow from actions. As a device to spur creative dynamic interest, they’re superb.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I don't view the murkiness of Vantage’s action system as a substantial flaw, I do have a more critical view of the destiny and mission structure. Mostly, this system is problematic in conjunction with the unique format of multiplayer play. Since each player is scattered in an unknown land, sessions can often feel as though several characters are playing their own separate games. This leads to slow progress, uneven investment, and a finish that can be unsatisfying. In one session, a player was pursuing a series of odd developments and weird discoveries. They were learning a mysterious craft and building a life for themselves on the planet. Meanwhile, another player on a completely separate side of the world accomplished our goal and triggered the end game. The first player was never able to pursue their own interests and felt as though they were not linked to the greater story at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vantage tries to correct for this. It allows you to keep playing if you’d like, but this rarely feels satisfying. Should we all have sat by, spending another hour or so wandering around while we waited for the other player to reach the conclusion of their own goals? It’s not a great position to be in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The isolated positioning of players works much better when pursuing a destiny or mission that can be accomplished in pieces. Occasionally, narrative will align perfectly with players calling out landmarks they're near and trying to orient themselves. Sometimes you have to work together across massive distances. When this occurs it’s magical. Everything feels right and Vantage is hitting its peak. These moments, however, emerge unpredictably. This is why the game works much more reliably with lower player counts, or even as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo board game</a>. With no downtime, the tempo just hums along and the exploration is wholly immersive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the unique approach of scattered perspectives and its quirky take on mission objectives, Vantage’s real innovation is in how it approaches discovery. Most games of this ilk are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a> that ask you to commit to a scenario and play it over a handful of sessions. Vantage shoves its gameplay into a single two- or three-hour engagement. Although, that’s not the whole story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While a game begins and wraps in a single session, the true experience of Vantage is one of extended play. The knowledge you gain is the primary achievement and what you take with you. In future sessions you'll learn more about the world, various key locations, and the mysterious nature of “the traveler” who continually reaches out to you. It’s a single-session game on the surface, with a campaign format smuggled in. This is frankly brilliant. Much of this rides on the sheer amount of content offered and the compelling nature of discovering it. The things you will find are wild and powerful, often impressing beyond expectation. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a single-session game on the surface, with a campaign format smuggled in. This is frankly brilliant.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This box will stand up to dozens and dozens of hours of play. There are hundreds of locations and hundreds of items and characters and creatures to discover. Every time you arrive at a location you can only trigger a single action. You cannot engage in a second action on that card in the same session. This is artificial, but it highlights how every single set-piece has multiple things to discover. Returning to previously seen spots yields new revelations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is subtle, but perhaps the design’s strongest mechanical trick. One of the weaknesses of games like 7th Continent is that you must retread previously broken ground. Many locations in that game lose their wonder and spontaneity upon repeated play. Vantage overcomes that problem by presenting richer locations, as well as mission objectives that can be accomplished in many different ways. It’s structurally very different to locate two artifacts on a planet that holds dozens, than it is to locate a temple at a specific location. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this ties in with the core motif of creativity. The rulebook explicitly suggests you may bring your own personal goals into a session and even forego the assigned mission. The nature of play reinforces this as well, as the outcome of any particular objective is a sparse section of text lacking fanfare. Vantage is about the journey and your agency in shaping it. This cuts right to the spirit of the design, highlighting that the central experience is yours, and yours alone. Make of Vantage what you will. What I make of Vantage is that it’s one of the best games of 2025.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObWxY?object_uuid=3e61f9b8-7023-401a-a7f6-97ab558c8653&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Stonemaier Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5wNKd?object_uuid=3e61f9b8-7023-401a-a7f6-97ab558c8653&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z62n3q?object_uuid=3e61f9b8-7023-401a-a7f6-97ab558c8653&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at GameNerdz</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 21, 2025 7:04 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Vantage is a peak mystery box adventure in board game form.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been five years since artist Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin's efforts to reimagine the grim world of Fallout as a 3D Doom-style shooter had us wondering what a more substantial version of their vision might look like. And finally we have an answer thanks to a newly shared, and stunningly atmospheric, Fallout: Bakersfield trailer.
</p>
<p>
When Fallout: Bakersfield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fallout-re-imagined-in-3d-looks-incredible">first came to our attention</a>, it was little more than an animated gif, presenting a vision of what Fallout's originally isometric universe - or more specifically, the ghoul city of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> (AKA Bakersfield, California) - might look like when presented using the first-person action and iconography of the original Doom. But since then, Red888guns has been turning that proof-of-concept into something closer to reality.
</p>
<p>
Two years later, Red888guns gave us our <a href="https://youtu.be/FMjJM9HAqqk?si=U1v0Vkd-651-5UWz">first progress update on the project</a>, improving on that once mostly static image with approximately ten seconds of footage featuring a player blasting their way through an enormously atmospheric slice of first-person action, built using the GZDoom Engine. And with a few more years having passed since then, we've finally been given another taste, and the results are more impressive than ever.

<p>
Red888guns' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM">latest Fallout: Bakersfield reveal</a> begins with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fr1KDYGkeo">nod to Fallout 1's trailer</a>, the camera slowly zooming out from an old-fashioned transistor radio (rather than the black and white television set) to reveal the surrounding ghoul-populated desolation of Bakersfield, all to the old-school warbling of the Ink Spots' I'd Climb The Highest Mountain.
</p>
<p>
From there, as the mood darkens, the trailer switches to a player-controlled first-person camera, initially as our jumpsuited protagonist quietly explores the filthy, decimated world, and next as they confront a group of gun-toting mutants using a blood-stained knife. After that there's some shooting, some classic Fallout fridge looting, and even a dialogue tree conversation with a big bad before things go seriously south.
</p>
<p>
Red888guns (who's also serving as an artist on developer New Blood's long-teased but still unannounced Fallout-inspired CRPG) is developing Fallout: Bakersfield alongside Denis Berezin, and a brief progress update at the end of the trailer reveals their non-commercial Doom 1993 total conversion is 60 percent complete. A heavily obfuscated release date is also seen, confirming it'll be out ??.??.202?. So mark your calendars as best you can.
</p>
<p>
Fallout, of course, has had something of resurgence in recent times, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's well-received live-action TV adaptation</a>. Season two - which visits a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-leaks-give-first-look-at-new-vegas">much-loved location</a> - airs this December, and in the game itself, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">saw the release of the impressive Fallout: London</a>.

The complaint argues that while the petition states there are no sources of funding behind it, Scott’s ongoing promotion of the petition essentially amounts to professional contributions from a foreign entity. </p><p>“The €500 disclosure threshold is exceeded by approximately 125-295 times through Scott’s undisclosed professional time contribution, representing potentially the largest single source of campaign support,” the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mega.nz/file/W3YTHCqQ#i-D2f_fgILqBILJiavLwX-eh3pUPGnYeaQfdadiFH20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mega.nz/file/W3YTHCqQ#i-D2f_fgILqBILJiavLwX-eh3pUPGnYeaQfdadiFH20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaint alleges</a></span>. “The concealment prevents informed citizen participation by misrepresenting the initiative as having no financial backing while substantially depending on foreign professional contributions.”</p><p>The entire argument rests on trying to ballpark the value of Scott’s time at between $55 and $85 an hour and the amount of time at up to almost 2,000 hours. The result is a non-monetary contribution of anywhere from $73,000 to $170,000 in value, the complaint claims. The estimates are based on his YouTube channel and an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-is-close-to-its-final-deadline-and-after-that-its-leader-is-understandably-done-either-the-frog-hops-out-of-the-pot-or-its-dead/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-stop-killing-games-initiative-is-close-to-its-final-deadline-and-after-that-its-leader-is-understandably-done-either-the-frog-hops-out-of-the-pot-or-its-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott did with <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> in which he said, “I’ve been running a rickshaw carrying people to the destination.” The complaint does not include an estimate for Scott’s hourly rickshaw rate. </p><figure id="" data-id="a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-recommend-id="image://a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-format="png" data-width="977" data-height="582" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an EU Commission complaint against Accursed Farms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-recommend-id="image://a28f9184eabc22511831748a31edb701" data-format="png" data-width="977" data-height="582" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an EU Commission complaint against Accursed Farms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout his latest video detailing the new twist in the ongoing Stop Killing Games saga, Scott tries to make clear that while he supports the EU petition, he’s not one of the organizers behind it, and the overall movement is not a “hive mind.” “The official organizers literally asked EU representatives if it was okay for me to assist them in the capacity I have been back in spring of 2024, just to make sure everything was above board in case there was a problem or we needed to report anything,” Scott says. “They said, ‘What I’ve been doing is fine.’ We’ve been doing this by the book, guys.”</p><p>It’s unclear who is behind the anonymous complaint. It could be someone appealing on behalf of video game companies in Europe whose lobbying entity previously released a statement rejecting the petition’s demands as too onerous and unworkable. Or it could just be some random internet user with an ax to grind against Scott as players debate the Stop Killing Games movement’s merits. </p><p>It was the decommissioning of Ubisoft’s <em>The Crew</em> that originally kicked the whole thing off, and the publisher’s CEO was recently grilled about the movement during its annual shareholder meeting. “The lifespan of a piece of software, whenever there’s a service component, eventually services may be discontinued, because eventually the software may become obsolete over time,” Yves Guillemot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the time</a></span>. “A lot of tools become obsolete 10 or 15 years down the line. They’re no longer available. And that is why we release a new version. And so we have version two and then version three. But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we are working on it.”</p><p>  The EU petition is currently in a good position to actually force action on the issue. According to its organizers, it “seeks to prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.” If at least 1 million signatures are proved to be authentic, the EU Commission will be tasked with addressing the group’s demands head-on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/stop-killing-games-eu-initiative-hits-1-4-million-signatures-and-if-at-least-1-million-are-valid-its-off-to-the-european-commission/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/stop-killing-games-eu-initiative-hits-1-4-million-signatures-and-if-at-least-1-million-are-valid-its-off-to-the-european-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">within a six-month period</a></span>, even if it ultimately chooses not to create a new regulatory framework around them.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/accursed-farms-stop-killing-games-eu-petition-ubisoft-1851786660]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Stop Killing Games movement hits a bit closer for Ubisoft than some companies in part because the publisher is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-facing-lawsuit-after-the-crew-was-removed-from-platforms/1100-6527713/">facing a lawsuit</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/">shutting down the servers</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-crew/" data-ref-id="5000-183626">The Crew</a> last year. During an Ubisoft shareholders meeting, CEO Yves Guillemot was asked to address the goals of Stop Killing Games and he replied that games aren't meant to "last forever."</p><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/zzxygofu/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared the text of the shareholders meeting</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>), Guillemot said, "You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point the service may be discontinued. Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever. But that's an issue that we're working on. That's something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players. But clearly that's something you need to factor in."</p><p>Stop Killing Games was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE">started last year</a> by YouTube host Ross Scott in the aftermath of Ubisoft's decision to sunset The Crew. The movement challenges the legality and ethics of publishers' decisions to shut down games that have previously been sold to consumers. The EU lobbying association <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lobbying-group-says-stop-killing-games-petition-would-make-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create/1100-6532989/" data-ref-id="1100-6532989">Video Games Europe recently responded</a> that Stop Killing Games' proposals to keep older games alive "would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create."</p><p>Ubisoft isn't the only company taking older games offline.

			<p>Nacon has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1249970/view/538859942242681786?l=english">announced</a> the Year 2 roadmap for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, detailing the highlights that will be a part of each season, including this week's Season 4, all the way up to Season 8, which will debut in July 2026. </p>



<p>KT Racing and Nacon put together an hour-long developer update that digs into what's to come, along with a short retrospective on how things have gone since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> launched last September.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Behind the Scenes: The Future of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K88Nrddj4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Starting with what's to come in the short term, Season 4 is launching this coming Wednesday, July 23, 2025, and with it five new cars, new content like Casino, a new currency for players to earn called Diamonds, and other enhancements to the game. </p>



<p>There's also a key community feature that's live from now until August 4, 2025, which is that players will be able to vote on which new mission type will be added to Solar Crown. Detective, Delivery, Photography, and Adrenaline are the four types players can choose from, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdV49jCWe1BvGaZpkgYEpdY0tTJOSYappAnQj0V06ZYg7gEuQ/viewform">you can submit your vote until August 4th at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Season 5 will arrive in October of this year, which is also when Year 2 will officially kick off. That's when taxi missions will be making their return, and when a new online store will be introduced. There will also be re-balances to the in-game economy, new vehicles, and a bevy of performance and graphical boosts that'll be directly from the KT Engine getting its own upgrade. </p>



<p>Season 6 kicks off January 2026, and it's also when the mission players voted for will be added to the game, among the other usual features like new cars and improvements to the game.</p>



<p>Season 7 arrives in April 2026, bringing along with it the introduction of Official Racing Centers, dedicated racing venues for Hong Kong Island and Ibiza City, and a revamping of live events and the premium Solar Pass. Finally, Season 8 arrives as previously mentioned in July 2026, which will be highlighted by the return of Housing and Real Estate, two elements missing from Solar Crown that players loved in the first two Test Drive Unlimited games. It'll also add Extreme missions and Passenger mode, along with the rest of the usual suspects. </p>



<p>Beyond Season 8, Nacon and KT Racing are committed to continuing to update and improve Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, as the team is already considering adding elements like bikes and yachts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's not Universes Beyond, no&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;has gone to outerspace, with&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>. A science-fantasy type of set with a take on the Space Opera, it's a very different set than what we've seen in the Magic universe before. As a new set, it means there's plenty of new options for players, and here we'll be ranking all the new&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;Commander options.</p>

<p>With&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-edge-of-eternities-preview-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Edge of Eternities Preview Cards Revealed"><em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;comes a rule change to Commander</a>: any legendary card with power and toughness in the bottom right corner can be your commander. Practically this means that legendary vehicles from past sets (there are none in this set), and legendary spacecrafts in this set are also commander options, along with legendary creatures.</p>

<p>After going over all of the over <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1">150 Legendary Creatures in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>, I'm relieved to say that there are a few less legendary options in&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities.&nbsp;</em>There are in fact only 22 cards capable of being your Commander in the set, as the high amount of legendaries in Universes Beyond sets has Wizards of the Coast pulling back some on in-universe sets. Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;list, this list is Commander specific, and is not considering other Constructed (like Standard or Modern) or Limited play.</p>

<h3>22. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/225/sami-ships-engineer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sami, Ship’s Engineer">Sami, Ship’s Engineer</a></h3>

Sami in this form is pricey, undersized, and makes modestly sized tokens if you jump a couple of hoops. While Sami synergizes with vehicles and spacecraft, that isn’t near enough for the cost in commander.</p>

<h3>21. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/232/syr-vondam-the-lucent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Syr Vondam, the Lucent">Syr Vondam, the Lucent</a></h3>

Clearly designed for limited, this iteration of Syr Vondam will have trouble breaking the 99 in general, but if you need to give deathtouch to your creatures in white and black there are worse options.</p>

<h3>20. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/218/haliya-ascendant-cadet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Haliya, Ascendant Cadet">Haliya, Ascendant Cadet</a></h3>

Haliya in this version is clearly aimed at limited play as a 5 mana 3/3 who brings a +1/+1 on enter or attack. Paired with a minor card draw ability, overall this is a card left out of your deck in commander.</p>

<h3>19. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/212/alpharael-dreaming-acolyte" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte">Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte</a></h3>

The deathtouch on your turn is situationally useful, but Alpharel isn’t that impressive, but in a blinking artifact deck it might have some use.</p>

<h3>18.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/19/haliya-guided-by-light" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Haliya, Guided by Light">Haliya, Guided by Light</a></h3>

Haliya is essentially <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltc/12/the-gaffer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Gaffer">The Gaffer</a> + a <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asoul-warden-ability+type%3Acreature" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Soul Warden Ability Creatures">Soul Sister </a>in a creature, but somewhat worse than either. The combination is useful, and card draw is important, but I think this is likely to be in the 99, and only after The Gaffer has made a list.</p>

<h3>16. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/238/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought">Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought.jpg?itok=v7fO6jR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought.jpg?itok=V8aJlC8G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As we reach 16, we get our first legendary Spacecraft, and it's a doozy of a ship. The Dawnsire is undeniably splashy with that potential 20/20 size and 100 damage to creatures, but Its high station count is a challenge. As your Commander, Dawnsire's colorless identity is another major limitation, but in the 99 of a Spacecraft deck it can be a flashy, if pricey top end.</p>

<h3>15. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/233/tannuk-memorial-ensign" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tannuk, Memorial Ensign">Tannuk, Memorial Ensign</a></h3>

In many ways, Tannuk is a color shifted and appropriately weakened take on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/247/tatyova-benthic-druid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tatyova, Benthic Druid">Tatyova, Benthic Druid</a>. Also he is the first and only legendary Kavu other than his other version (changeling things excluded).</p>

<h3>14. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/35/the-seriema" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Seriema">The Seriema</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-seriema.jpg?itok=lrVRbqFp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-seriema.jpg?itok=fploQVMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a lower mana cost of 3, and a lower station cost of only 7, the Seriema provides value at all stages. At the start it is a legendary creature tutor and points you in a direction for the deck. Once it gets 7 station points, it’s a 5/5 flying that protects all your other legendary creatures when they are tapped and lets them rule in combat. Still, it feels likely to be better in the 99 of other legendary matters commanders, which is why it's up here.</p>

<h3>13. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/127/xu-ifit-osteoharmonist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist">Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist</a></h3>

This also makes him an interesting leader for a skeleton deck, or a way of taking advantage of creatures with significant downsides.</p>

<h3>12.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/87/alpharael-stonechosen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Alpharael, Stonechosen">Alpharael, Stonechosen</a></h3>

Ward isn’t hexproof, but a random discard may discourage people from dealing with Alpharael before they have to.</p>

<h3>11. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/4/szarel-genesis-shepherd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Szarel, Genesis Shepherd">Szarel, Genesis Shepherd</a></h3>

The need to buff his power to get the most does make this a three things to do commander, making it busy and it’s not as novel as you have other cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/117/the-gitrog-monster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Gitrog Monster">The Gitrog Monster</a> that also play around with lands and sacrificing.</p>

<h3>10. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/1/hearthhull-the-worldseed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hearthhull, the Worldseed">Hearthhull, the Worldseed</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hearthhull-the-worldseed.jpg?itok=eYX9JiWv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hearthhull-the-worldseed.jpg?itok=PCgx5Mtb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We enter the top 10 with the alternate commander for the RGB (jund) deck, which is a spacecraft. Like Szarel, Hearthhull is a jund-colored land aristocrat's commander, but it comes down cheaper, albeit with the need to be stationed before you can do much with it. The ability to sacrifice and payoff the land sacrifice in and of itself make it really good, and I think I slightly prefer the spacecraft over the insect.</p>

<h3>9. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/219/infinite-guideline-station" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Infinite Guideline Station">Infinite Guideline Station</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinite-guideline-station.jpg?itok=kTxoyl0s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinite-guideline-station.jpg?itok=3ob20Z_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A five color Spacecraft commander, that also rewards playing a lot of multicolored permanents. Even before you charge it up, the Infinite Guideline Station will provide you with Robots for your gold board, and then it can give you a lot of cards once it starts firing its lasers.</p>

<h3>8.&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/216/dyadrine-synthesis-amalgam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam">Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam</a></h3>

Dyadrine wants a friend with counters as well, so that it can make tokens and draw cards for you, though note it can work from get go, not needing to attack itself.</p>

<h3>7. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/221/mmmenon-uthros-exile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm’menon, Uthros Exile">Mm’menon, Uthros Exile</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-exile.jpg?itok=E1WGDgOm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-uthros-exile.jpg?itok=6ZwUvvXK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The final uncommon commander option makes a run deep into the top 10, as this version of Mm’menon is an interesting commander, because you can grow any of your creatures when you have artifacts enter. It notably lacks any of the restrictions we see sometimes on cards like this like ‘once per turn’ or ‘non-token’ which would stop it from being able to go crazy. Instead the Uthros Exile invites all the treasure craziness, all the artifact shenanigans and everything else for even a potential voltron approach.</p>

<h3>6. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/2/inspirit-flagship-vessel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inspirit, Flagship Vessel">Inspirit, Flagship Vessel</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inspirit-flagship-vessel.jpg?itok=f1uPXkDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inspirit-flagship-vessel.jpg?itok=RiL7uHet 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A strong commander for Spacecrafts, Inspirit lets you put charge counters on other artifacts or grow creatures so they can station (or attack) better. The 3 mana cost is low, and the single point needed to get the base station level up is very little. Later on, it becomes a 5/5 flying protector for all your other artifacts, putting it in play to lead your fleet to victory.</p>

<h3>5. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/68/mmmenon-the-right-hand" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mm’menon, the Right Hand">Mm’menon, the Right Hand</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mmmenon-the-right-hand.jpg?itok=Dp1-atDo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mmmenon-the-right-hand.jpg?itok=wVrytzJZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starting off our top 5, we have a far fairer example of a blue artifact commander than Urza, Lord High Artificer. Mm’menon lets you cast artifacts from the top of your deck, and use artifacts to fuel casting them from the top, or with other cards from spots other than your hand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/224/ragost-deft-gastronaut" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ragost, Deft Gastronaut">Ragost, Deft Gastronaut</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ragost-deft-gastronaut.jpg?itok=rdRXhdM8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ragost-deft-gastronaut.jpg?itok=m8mI0jnF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A cheap and effective food commander in different colors then we often see food running in (red food decks aren’t common!) Its ability to lob food at opponents, while untapping each turn if you gained life gives it a fair amount of strength. It can fuel off any artifacts you have, letting you make them in many ways and take advantage of various death triggers and other neat tricks in his spicy restaurant.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/296/tannuk-steadfast-second" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tannuk, Steadfast Second">Tannuk, Steadfast Second</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tannuk-steadfast-second.jpg?itok=mBvUcsGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tannuk-steadfast-second.jpg?itok=rol6g0Eu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the only character to ever be a legendary Kavu, Tannuk had some pressure to carry, and while his earlier rated uncommon form is serviceable, the Steadfast Second is a very strong card. Granting everything haste is something red already wants to do, and is often willing to pay 3 mana to do that and nothing else, while the Warp ability for any red and artifact cards is just begging for abuse as cost cheating is very powerful.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoc/3/kilo-apogee-mind" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kilo, Apogee Mind">Kilo, Apogee Mind</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kilo-apogee-mind.jpg?itok=eV3rrjIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kilo-apogee-mind.jpg?itok=XOK_Ws_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This kilogram pound robot (that’s why it’s Kilo right?) can do all sorts of crazy things, and while the easiest way to tap is attacking, there are plenty of other ways to do so, and many, many, many payoffs to proliferate that it opens up to be abused and played with. Blue is also the color of untapping, and letting you do this more than once a turn.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/301/sami-wildcat-captain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sami, Wildcat Captain">Sami, Wildcat Captain </a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sami-wildcat-captain.jpg?itok=pJiH1Med 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sami-wildcat-captain.jpg?itok=A5ylnjXC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I never expected for this list to go full circle, but here we are at number 1, and we're in a way just back where we started with Sami. While Sami's uncommon card was highly unimpressive for commander play, the mythic rare version backs quite a wallop. While the body is a touch undersized, the double strike makes up for that, but it's really the ability after that which is most interesting. Granting all your spells affinity for artifacts is something that is highly breakable, and something with which many an interesting, or distinct thing can be done with across a variety of power levels.</p>

<p>And that's how I saw the&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>Commander options. Some of them have me quite interested to build around or try out different decks, including seeing how spacecrafts play in reality.</p>

<p>Are there any <em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>commanders that interest you particularly or disagree with a placement on this list? Tell us in the comments below!</p>

While that made it sound like <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> could skip Microsoft’s platform entirely, he was quick to foll0w up clarifying that the grimdark fantasy adventure will hit Xbox eventually.</p><p>“There’s nothing to officially confirm yet,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1947340601781051493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added on X</a></span>. “We want to support consoles and just looking at the numbers, PS5 makes the most sense at the moment.  Ultimately we’ll ship on all platforms, but likely not at the same time!”</p><p>With PS5 currently sitting at around 80 million consoles sold, the Xbox Series X/S, whose hardware revenue within Microsoft falls precipitously every year, is estimated to have sold less than half that. The Switch 2 only just launched, but is already breaking launch records and is expected to continue the momentum of its 155-million-unit-selling predecessor. So if you’re a small team allocating limited resources for porting your PC release, the case for prioritizing Xbox is becoming harder and harder to make. </p><p>The problem’s been pronounced enough that Microsoft published a developer blog post last fall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">asking studios for feedback</a></span>. “If you are making video games, we’re interested in hearing from you,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read</a></span>. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why. And honestly, if you are using our competitor’s products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!”</p><p>The case of <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is especially striking, though, given the size of the team (estimated at over 80 people) and Moon Studios’ history with Xbox. <em>Ori and the Blind Forest </em>was a 2015 exclusive that proved to be a bright spot for the Xbox One as it recovered from its rough launch. The follow-up, <em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>, did the same for the Xbox Series X/S. While both games have since been ported to Switch, neither was ever made available on PlayStation. </p><p><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>, which swaps snappy 2D platforming for weighty top-down dungeon crawling, will now reverse that trend. I guess there’s no Game Pass deal on the table this time around. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ori-no-rest-wicked-console-port-souls-rpg-xbox-ps5-1851786659]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Oh, snap! Second Dinner has officially announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a>: <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/18/marvel-snaps-golden-gauntlet-world-championship-series-gives-players-a-new-way-to-compete-connect-and-shine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series</a>, a global tournament initiative launching on August 9, 2025. This free-to-enter competition is open to all players regardless of rank or experience and is aimed at bringing together the community and showcasing players' creativity. The series will be broadcast live on the game's official Twitch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channels.</p><p>Registration links will be shared on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Discord</a> ahead of each event, along with full rules, format, and support in dedicated channels. </p><p>The Golden Gauntlet Series will include three regional "Open Qualifier" tournaments, leading up to a global finals event in November called the Golden Gauntlet Worlds. Each regional event will follow a standardized format: Six rounds of Swiss-style playing (a fixed number of rounds, with pairings based on performance rather than elimination), followed by a top 16 single-elimination bracket, with prizes awarded to the top finishers.</p><p>After that, players who end those rounds with a 5-1 record or better will earn a spot in the final event. These qualifiers are scheduled for August, September, and October, each focusing on different global regions, ensuring as many players as possible.</p><p>Aland Failde, SVP of marketing at Second Dinner, emphasized that the tournament is a way to give back to fans and creators who have shaped the game's journey.</p><p>"From day one, Marvel Snap has been shaped by its players, and the Golden Gauntlet is our way of supporting and amplifying that passion," Failde said in a statement. "Huge shoutout to Game On Events for helping us host this event and to all the incredible community members who've helped bring this to life--this series wouldn't exist without their dedication, creativity, and love for the game."</p><p>Snap players might remember when the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-gets-caught-up-in-tiktok-ban-currently-unavailable-in-the-us/1100-6528894/" data-ref-id="1100-6528894">went temporarily offline</a> this past January due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). The legislation banned software owned or published by ByteDance, which owns the game's then-publisher Nuverse. The restrictions were later removed, and the developers announced that they would work with US company Skystone Games to bring publishing duties in-house.</p><p>Similarly, Matthew R.--also known for his gamertag ItsGuestGaming--co-founder of Game On Events, highlighted the tournament's evolution from grassroots efforts to a full-fledged world championship.</p><p>“Our goal with this series is to bring the community together to celebrate Marvel Snap's competitive scene while showcasing the fast, high-stakes nature of its matches," he said. "It's been exciting to watch tournaments grow from grassroots events to the Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series. Whether you've been playing for two months or two years, we're thrilled to host a tournament that honors Marvel Snap's amazing community."</p><p>The grand finale, Golden Gauntlet Worlds, will take place on November 8, 2025, featuring over 300 qualified players from the three open tournaments. This final event will consist of nine rounds of Swiss play, culminating in a Top 16 playoff to determine the ultimate champion. </p><p>As of now, there are no cards banned, but it wouldn't surprise me if they treat this like High Voltage-style and ban cards like Galactus and Magik just to speed things along.</p><p>The tournament will start a week after the last of the Fantastic Four: First Steps cards drop, giving players some time to decide if their already perfect deck could be better.</p>

            <p>
Stop Killing Games figurehead Ross Scott says "serious accusations" and "false claims" have been filed against the game preservation movement's European initiative, accusing the campaign of violating EU rules. All this comes as support continues to gain momentum, with the official EU petition having now surpassed 1.4m signatures.
</p>
<p>
Scott <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQN_ZA5WRpo">discussed the latest developments</a> in a video update on YouTube, revealing the <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en">Stop Destroying Videogames EU initiative</a> - which he reiterated is distinct from the Stop Killing Games campaign and has its own organisers, despite often being discussed under the same banner - had "received a serious accusation from an anonymous source".
</p>
<p>
Specifically, Stop Destroying Videogames has been notified of a Transparency Complaint, claiming its campaign violates EU rules by failing to "provide clear, accurate and comprehensive information on the sources of funding for the initiative exceeding EUR 500 per sponsor". Stop Destroying Videogames is accused of including a "false 'no funding' declaration" on its petition and of "systemic concealment of major contribution".
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames, for context, makes use of the European Citizens Initiative, an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission. In Stop Destroying Videogames' case, the aim is to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." 
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' petition has <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1947025316452454853">now surpassed 1.4m signatures</a>. That's well above the 1m needed for it to be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament - and, it's hoped, well above the threshold needed to ensure it stays above 1m after mistakes or deliberate spoofing are filtered out. However, a complaint potentially marks a bump in the road.
</p>
<p>
The gist of the complaint is that Scott's work as a volunteer on the EU initiative "far exceeds any reasonable volunteer threshold" and that "professional time investment constitutes quantifiable in-kind contribution under transparency regulations". The complaint also provides "evidence" - based on several seemingly off-the-cuff statements made by Scott and some imaginative maths - that his involvement equates to €63,000-147,000 in professional contributions, and, as such, a failure to declare this supposedly significant source of funding violates EU rules. 
</p>
<p>
The trouble is, the figure mentioned in the complaint is entirely speculative, based on an assumed hourly rate of €50-75, generated from an imagined 12-14 hours work a day across "many" weeks - an assumed workload Scott scoffed at, saying "that would have killed me", despite admitting to focussing on Stop Killing Games 12-14 hours a day on at least a "some" occasions. "Maybe that would mean something if I was a professional and had a rate for anything," he added, noting "nobody was hiring me for this, it's all volunteer time". Scott also stressed he's just a "promoter" of the EU initiative, and has "no actual authority" over the decisions its organisers make. "It's only my perception that this is my one chance to fix the problem of destroying games that's pushed me so hard," he said.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Scott rejects the claims made in the anonymous complaint, noting he's spent zero Euros on financial support. Moreover, he claims Stop Destroying Videogames' organisers "literally asked EU representatives if it was okay for me to assist them in the capacity I have been back in spring 2024... [and] they said what I've been doing is fine". The big question, though, is what impact, if any, the complaint could have on the EU initiative. Despite Scott's suggestion of potentially "serious" ramifications, the <a href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/how-it-works/faq_en">Citizens Initiatives website</a> only says the Commission will "contact the organisers of the initiative to establish the facts and ask them to correct any inaccuracies on funding/support", with no talk of specific penalties for violations.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the video sees a clearly frustrated Scott discussing what the complaint means for the future of the campaign, his own involvement, and how supporters can respond. Much of it, however, is based on Scott's apparently unsubstantiated assumption the complaint was filed by a games industry representative, despite him earlier admitting, "We'll never know [where the complaint came from], it's anonymous".
</p>
<p>
"I'll just say the timing of this is awfully hot on the heels of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">industry lobby group giving some very bad statements about the movement</a>," he continued, "in some cases I think outright lying about it. But I don't know it was them; maybe it was a different lobbying group or maybe it was just some political hatchet man hired by the industry. But someone was trying to kill the initiative, filing paperwork to the European Union accusing the initiative and myself of violating the rules, maybe even committing a crime, I'm not sure. That's not small thing. This is the industry playing dirty now."
</p>
<p>
The sense, perhaps, is the campaign's escalating visibility is starting to make Scott uneasy - "I am so out of my league on this...," he says at one point, "I have never been a political target before, so this is all uncharted territory for me" - but he ends on an upbeat note to supporters, highlighting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-killing-games-momentum-continues-top-eu-politician-offers-support-a-game-once-sold-belongs-to-the-customer">a number of European parliament members are now among them</a>. "I have no idea what's coming down the pipeline now," he concluded, "but all this resistance means we're throwing around some real power to fix things so let's keep at it."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">inadvertently kickstarted the Stop Killing Games campaign</a> when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">took The Crew offline</a> last year, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement">recently asked about the initiative</a> during a shareholder meeting. "We are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously, support for all games cannot last forever," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot ventured in response. "But clearly this is a far-reaching issue, and we're working on it."
