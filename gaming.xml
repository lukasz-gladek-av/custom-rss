            <p>While I’ve been known to enjoy a few of them in my time, I tend to view a lot of more mundane <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulator games</a> in the same way I view sports games: Looks fine, but I could do this stuff in real life, were I inclined and also social and also vaguely limber instead of owning a spine with roughly the flexibility of a rib n’ saucy Nik Nak.</p>

<p>Similarly, the currently popping-off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/">on Steam</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tcg-card-shop-simulator">TCG Card Shop Simulator</a> - in its digitisation of a hobby-within-a-hobby-within-a-third-place - feels vaguely like the sort of thing that would have made Baudrillard violently shit himself to death. Still, as someone who frequently fantasises about having a.) a killer deck, b.) lots of mates and c.) a good enough understanding of maths to crush those mates into the dust so hard that they never know joy again, I was intrigued enough to give it a go. 20,000 concurrent players can’t be wrong! We, uh, we don’t <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">talk about the banana game</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that you run a collectible card shop selling a come-at-me-brotendo -branded TCG named Tetramon. You order in some boxes, enjoy a lovely ‘pop’ sound as you arrange booster packs on your shelf, set a price, then open doors. Customers come in, you check out their orders, and I have to say: I’m already starting to see why people dig this one. Every little action feels tuned just so, with everything from scanning packs to giving change accompanied by ear-tickling sound effects. Dinged point: you have to count out change individually, but trying to be a short-changing rapscallion isn’t an option, which would have been fun. What I can say: the music is so carefree and cheerful that it put me in the mood for crime!</p>
<p>I especially wanted to crime the header guy. Two packs?! Get outta here! You get out too!</p>

<p>The other side of the game is collecting the cards yourself. I love how this characterises your owner as a little card weasel, rapidly shooing off customers so you can get your grubby mitts on more shinies. My first card was a happy onion named ‘Sapoling’. He’s got 22 health and I’ve got no idea if that’s good yet, but I’m sure he deserves every point. I did notice a nightmarish little wrinkle, though: it tells you the monetary value of every card as you reveal it. Is this what we’ve been reduced to? Can we no longer derive joy from cracking packs for their own sake, but merely from the amount of currency they can be exchanged for? What happened to…</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tcg-sim-shiny-nimblus.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>OPNeon/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Wait shut up I got a shiny Nimblis! $5.73 baby! Honey, come quick: we’re eating the good cocoa pops tonight!</p>
<p>You get your own digital binder to collect your cards, and this works as a sort of sub-objective running in tandem to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> stuff, since you can only stock high-level boosters once you’ve upgraded your shop. As you go, you’ll also get more furnishings, play tables, things of that nature. And, yes, the game couldn’t help itself: some of your customers have giant green cartoon stink clouds that effect the experience of your other customers. Missed opportunity for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">Powerwash Simulator</a> minigame, imo.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3103840/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator_Prologue/">a prologue on Steam</a> if you want to try it out, and even from just a brief piss about, I’m starting to understand the attention it’s getting. It’s nicely made, pleasant, and nostalgic in all the right ways. You can even leave the shop and go for a wander, although there is an invisible wall that stops me going to buy cheap pizza, which I consider an act of violence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>The protagonist of our story quits his job at an extremely toxic workplace and finds himself at a run-down maid cafe tucked away in a quiet part of Nipponbashi. There, he meets the maid Shiro. One thing leads to another, and he eventually gets appointed as the temporary cafe manager and put in charge of the <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> of the maid cafe. As the new manager, his first task is to scout cute girls to work at the cafe. Time to explore Nipponbashi and all the otaku stuff it has to offer!</p><ul><li>Get to know the four unique main girls: Shiro, Miyu, Favna, and Honoka, all voiced.</li><li>Immerse yourself in lighthearted stories about everyday life with the cute maids.</li><li>Enjoy the modern and gorgeous pixel art graphics depicting even the finest details, including the meat buns next to the convenience store cashier and the figures on the shelves of an anime shop.</li><li>Go on fun dates at Nipponbashi, from anime shops to <a title="Platforms > Arcade [372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> to the cinema!</li></ul><p><strong>The Four Main Girls of Fuwa Fuwa</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shiro</strong> – <em>“Um, please be the new manager of the cafe!”</em> A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she’s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she’s always wanted to be.</li><li><strong>Miyu</strong> – <em>“Hey Mr. <a title="Series > Mana [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, thanks a bunch for hanging out with me today~☆”</em> A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite. Loves both eating and <a title="Genres > Cooking [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro’s friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.</li><li><strong>Favna</strong> – <em>“I am the Slayer of the False God, the Queen of the Kingdom of Darkness, the All-Seeing Oracle, the Guardian of the Dream of All Things—“</em> A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she’s taken by surprise though, so maybe she’s just got a serious case of chuunibyou…?</li><li><strong>Honoka</strong> – <em>“Ya want a thrivin’ business? That there sounds like a job for our shrine!”</em> A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money, and has a strong sense of responsibility to boot. On top of that, she’s also the only glasses girl at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe!</li></ul><p><strong>Support Your Maid Cafe Employees as the Manager</strong></p><p>As the cafe manager, it’s your job to allocate work to your maids. Make sure to give the right girl the right job! For example, Shiro is always enthusiastic to serve customers, and Miyu is great in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just sit there while they work. During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!</p><p><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting. As you collect more toys, you can even bring them up in conversations with the girls. Keep cranking those machines until you’ve collected them all!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is rdein, creator of the <em>Momodora</em> series. Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, <em>Moonlit Farewell</em>. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of <em>Momodora III</em>. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past games’ mysteries and questions.</p><p>I’m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, I’m designing <em>Moonlit Farewell</em> to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of <em>Momodora I</em> to <em>III</em>‘s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, don’t worry too much about “catching up”!</p><p>Lastly, we hope to bring you our best game with this new title, using all the knowledge we’ve learned in the past ten years. So please don’t forget to head over to the Steam page and hit that wishlist button, and stay tuned for the <em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em>!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-state-of-play-games-might-we-see/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>First and foremost, before we dive any further in, let’s be entirely clear that this is purely speculation until we receive additional confirmation regarding any of the State of Play games. Numerous leaks regarding Sony’s showcasing point to many teasers and gameplay trailers. Here’s what we might see at State of Play!</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-state-of-play-games">Potential State of Play Games</h2>



<p>Again, this is pure speculation until we receive a concrete schedule from PlayStation regarding its State of Play address. For now, here’s what we <em>might </em>see and what I’m hoping to see!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Path of Exile 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Judas</strong></li>



<li><strong>New World (PS5)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Horizon: Zero Dawn Remastered</strong></li>



<li><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost of Tsushima 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Until Dawn Remaster</strong></li>



<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Dogma 2 Expansion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silent Hill 2 Remake</strong></li>



<li><strong>Resident Evil IX</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I’m most excited to see anything and everything about Resident Evil IX, Metal Gear Solid Delta, Ghost of Tsushima 2, and Path of Exile 2. Oh, and Judas!</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-state-of-play">When is State of Play?</h2>



<p>Sony announced that its State of Play will be held on <strong>Tuesday</strong>, <strong>September 25, at 6 pm ET/11pm BST</strong>. The entire show will last approximately 30 minutes and showcase 20 or more titles. </p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-state-of-play">Where to Watch State of Play</h2>



<p>You can watch the entire State of Play on one of PlayStation’s official channels, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVs0suPHAX8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a></li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want to tune in early to ensure you connect to the stream without issues. Sometimes, the Twitch stream works a little faster than the YouTube one, and vice versa, so check both out before deciding where to watch!</p>

<p>On the topic of PlayStation, we recently reported on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-is-the-ps5-anniversary-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of the PlayStation 5 Anniversary Edition</a>.

That's one of the best prices we've seen for a 2TB PS5-compatible SSD from a reputable brand. It also happens to be one of the fastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs on the market right now. This is an outstanding candidate for your PS5 or gaming PC rig.</p><h2>SK Hynix P41 Platinum 2TB M.2 SSD for $134.99</h2><div id="161786" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>SK Hynix Platinum P41 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD</h3></p></div><p>SK Hynix might not be a brand that the consumer recognizes as much as Samsung or Western Digital, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and one of the world's largest memory chipmakers and semiconductor companies. They supply components for many reputable brands you've probably heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and sustained write speeds of 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and random write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, the SSDs have been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. SK Hynix backs it all up with a 5 year warranty. The P41 Platinum uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips, both of which are manufactured in-house.</p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs. Some of these SSDs include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/qmmDw?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SK Hynix P41 Platinum</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z446D?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Samsung 990 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/X641Y?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD Black SN850X</a>. Therefore, it all comes down to the price. At its current price point, the P41 Platinum isn't just one of the fastest drives on the market, it's also cheaper than any competitor that can come close to its performance.</p><h3>This is a great PS5 SSD, but you'll want to get a heatsink</h3><p>The SK Hynix P41 Platinum does not come equipped with a heatsink. That's because this SSD is catered to PC gamers looking to add storage to their desktop computer. Many motherboards come equipped with built-in SSD coolers and will only accept bare SSDs. It's generally harder to remove a heatsink than to apply a new one. If you plan to use this for your PS5, rest assured that' it is 100% compatible (in fact, it's overkill). Although some people have gotten away with an SSD with no heatsink, we recommend you install one for peace of mind. You can easily get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OGrjj?object_uuid=2700c67f-463d-4174-8813-7896fa99c488&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5 heatsink for under $10</a>.</p><p><em>Looking for more options?

            <p>
Sony and developer Shift Up are being sued by Louisiana-based film production company Stellarblade, which - in case you haven't already guessed where this is going - is alleging trademark infringement following the release of this year's PS5 action-adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">reported by IGN</a>, the complaint was filed in a Louisiana court earlier this month by Stellarblade LLC and its owner, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey. It's specifically targeting Sony, Shift Up, and and Sony's unnamed liability insurance company, amid claims Stellarblade's business (that's the film company) is being damaged by Stellar Blade (the game's) use of the name.
</p>
<p>
Stellarblade was established to provide "multimedia entertainment services" - including film, documentary, and music video production - in 2010, and Mehaffey is said to have owned the domain stellarblade.com since 2006. In the complaint, Mehaffey claims his customers have been unable to easily find information about his business online since the game formerly known as Project Eve was re-revealed under the name Stellar Blade in 2021.

<p>
In a statement provided to IGN, Mehaffey's lawyer expanded on the latter point, adding, "The defendants' far superior resources have effectively monopolised online search results for Stellarblade, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade."
</p>
<p>
Mehaffey also argues Shift Up and Sony's Stellar Blade trademark (filed in January 2023) is "confusingly similar" to his own Stellarblade trademark (filed in June 2023), citing similar colour schemes and a stylised 'S'. He's seeking damages and attorney fees if his legal action is successful, and is requesting Shift Up and Sony be prevented from using Stellar Blade or any other similar name in the future - and that all Stellar Blade material in their possession is handed over to be destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Jessica Orr quite liked Stellar Blade when it launched earlier this year, celebrating its "moreish combat and bizarrely appealing lack of personality" in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">four star review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitchcon-2024-protest-chevron-palestine-hilton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TwitchCon took place in San Diego over the weekend, and though I was not able to attend this year, I can confirm that at least one grand (read: regrettably necessary) tradition was alive and well: protest. Following a Marriott hotel workers’ strike that was <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-hotel-strike-was-the-talk-of-this-years-twitchcon-1830077660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the talk of the event in 2018</a>, TwitchCon 2024 was the site of two separate protests: one in favor of <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2024/09/17/san-diego-city-council-passes-resolution-supporting-striking-hotel-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a better contract for workers at a different hotel</a>, the Hilton San Diego Bayfront, and another against TwitchCon itself over a sponsorship deal with Chevron, which <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/east-bay/protesters-urge-chevron-to-divest-amid-war-in-gaza/3551411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to support Israel</a> to the tune of millions of dollars.</p><p>Creators posted <a href="https://x.com/brethamilton/status/1837310234861478311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Thafnine/status/1836888901765452172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">images</a> of both protests, with some <a href="https://x.com/xocheergurlox/status/1837926211621642749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in favor</a> and others <a href="https://x.com/The_Man_Animal/status/1837303247499055615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a>, confused, trolling, or, when it came to the pro-Palestine assembly, <a href="https://x.com/Liutauras_/status/1837331107945001045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bizarre combination of the three</a>. A few smaller streamers, like Bret "Cinemarxism" Hamilton and Austin "Gremloe" MacNamara, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2256970916?filter=archives&amp;sort=time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent time with protesters</a> of both causes and <a href="https://x.com/gremloe/status/1837652844444635290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated for them</a> (the latter also covered pro-Palestine protests <a href="https://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitchhttps://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Democratic National Convention</a> last month).&nbsp;</p><p>Some creators took Hilton protesters’ side despite being inconvenienced personally. Culinary influencer Tricia "Triciaisabirdy" Wang, for example, <a href="https://x.com/triciaisabirdy/status/1837579367310070064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted at Hilton Hotels</a> that she hadn't "slept in days" because protesters would "start chanting and banging drums outside my room" every single morning. Then she proposed a solution: "Give them a raise."</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Protestors from San Diego BDS and <a href="https://twitter.com/codepink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codepink</a> are protesting outside of Twitchcon, calling out the main sponsor of the event, Chevron, for their involvement in the genocide of Palestinians. </p><p>This marks the beginning of a week long focus from BDS National targeting Chevron. <a href="https://t.co/H6RMKbhaLS">pic.twitter.com/H6RMKbhaLS</a></p></div>— Bret 🍉 (@brethamilton) <a href="https://twitter.com/brethamilton/status/1837304998130274546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>As for Chevron, protesters <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sandiegobds/reel/DAJ4BinSU_s/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from San Diego’s BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement</a> lined up just outside the convention center and shouted things like “TwitchCon, TwitchCon, you can’t hide, you’re sponsored by genocide.” Chevron’s presence at TwitchCon is unfortunate, but far from unprecedented. Last year, Chevron <a href="https://passionfru.it/twitch-advertising-young-people-gen-z-15038/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had its own booth at the show</a>, while Shell <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/climate-deniers/after-decades-climate-deception-shell-uses-fortnite-court-demographic-most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threw money at <em>Fortnite </em>streamers</a> in an apparent effort to win over a younger crowd that’s skeptical of fossil fuels and fearful of climate change. Difference is, back then Chevron had yet to spend nearly a year aiding and abetting a genocide, though it had already by that point <a href="https://afsc.org/chevron-fuels-israeli-apartheid-and-war-crimes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped fuel Israel’s apartheid state</a>. </p><p>Chevron is not even remotely the first to target Twitch as a means of whitewashing crimes against humanity; both the <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-forces-u-s-army-to-stop-tricking-viewers-with-f-1844405124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US Army</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/navy-twitch-stream-spirals-out-of-control-due-to-slur-1845051780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Navy</a> have sponsored and streamed on Twitch, going so far as to <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-navy-follows-army-in-banning-twitch-viewers-asking-1844445873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ban viewers for asking about war crimes in chat</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After speaking with members of the San Diego BDS movement, one streamer, WitchyTwitchy, decided to lend support from inside the convention.</p><p>"I'm here at TwitchCon paying a visit to TwitchCon's deadliest sponsor this year, Chevron," she said in <a href="https://x.com/witchytwitchytv/status/1838085498457166276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video filmed in front of Chevron's booth</a>. "Chevron is literally fueling, via gas and money, the genocide in Gaza. I'm a Twitch streamer, I love coming to TwitchCon, and I understand that sponsors are needed, and it may be hard to find an ethical sponsor from a big corporation. But the least we can do is maybe ask Twitch to not get sponsored by a company literally fueling genocide – especially when Twitch is a company that claims to value diversity and inclusion. I would like to remind them that Palestinian streamers are also on their platform, and maybe [they should] not get sponsors that are killing their families."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/netease-subsidiary-skybox-labs-lays-off-25-people/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Canadian developer Skybox Labs has laid off 25 staff members. Skybox Labs is a subsidiary of NetEase, a Chinese company that has acquired many different companies over time. This included Grasshopper Manufacture, Quantic Dream, and Skybox Labs, for example. In addition to acquiring all of these studios, they've helped establish additional studios globally, often headed by industry veterans such as Greg Street and David Vonderhaar. The layoffs at Skybox Labs were announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skyboxlabs_today-we-informed-our-studio-that-we-made-activity-7242279185761607680-Xesv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn five days ago in a statement</a>. "Despite all our best efforts, we are not immune to the unprecedented challenges that have impacted so many companies in the industry."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/">layoffs</a> throughout the industry continue to rise, with the number reaching well over&nbsp; 12,700 in this year alone. The statement continues on to say that "every impacted employee will be fully supported through severance, extended benefits, career transition service, and connection to other resources to provide them with the assistance they require during this difficult time." Compared to other studios, this is generous despite the awful situation for those affected. Many companies have come under fire for laying off their staff in brutal and blunt ways and not providing them with any benefits or severance. One particular company that has come under fire multiple times for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">layoffs is Bungie</a>. They have experienced multiple layoffs this year, and considering how they are doing financially, it's possible that they will have more layoffs as shareholders pressure them to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">restructure the company</a>.</p>
<p>Skybox Labs was acquired by NetEase at the beginning of 2023 and is well known for its work on games such as Halo, Minecraft, and Age of Empires. It's currently unknown whether they are looking to develop any of their own games or whether they will continue to collaborate with other studios to assist in the development of other games.</p>
<p>If Skybox Labs was laid off only a year after being acquired by NetEase, it's possible that other NetEase subsidiaries will face layoffs. It hasn't been said directly whether NetEase issued the layoffs or whether they came from within the company.</p>
<p>NetEase came under fire just last month, after deciding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/">shut down Ouka Studios</a>, the developers behind Visions of Mana. The studio was launched in 2020 by NetEase, and it's said that only a handful of jobs remained by the end of Visions of Mana's development. NetEase refused to comment regarding the reported closure, and it was never explained why the company needed to close down, especially after making such a<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/visions-of-mana-ps5/"> successful game</a> that Square Enix published.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of cozy, casual games available on the market today. You can spend your time farming in Stardew Valley, catching creatures in Pokemon, or building a castle in Tiny Glade. You have options! But can you play Tiny Glade on Nintendo Switch? Is that an option?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-tiny-glade-releasing-on-nintendo-switch">Is Tiny Glade Releasing On Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p>Tiny Glade looks like the perfect game for the Nintendo Switch, right? Unfortunately, developer Pounce Light doesn’t think so. When asked about the cozy castle-building game coming to Switch, they said it’s “unlikely, sorry,” as the game is optimized for PC, and the Nintendo Switch is below the minimum recommended specifications for the game.</p>



<p>If you want to play Tiny Glade on a handheld, you must wait for someone to create a community controller layout for the Steam Deck, as the game doesn’t currently have Steam Deck support, either.</p>



<p>Quickly, since we’re on the top of other platforms for Tiny Glade, others did ask about the game on mobile, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Currently, there’s no word of a console port, and a mobile port is definitely out of the question, as the game can’t run on a Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Image via Pounce Light</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tiny Glade is described as a “diorama builder,” in which you construct castles, villages, ruins, and cottages out in the wild. The building system is completely gridless, allowing for free-form construction as you change the color of the walls, the pathing, the windows and decorations, and so much more.</p>



<p>It’s meant as a relaxing game where you can turn off your brain and chill. There’s no combat, no quests, and nothing pressing you for time. It’s just a chill experience. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24252493/delta-ios-emulator-online-multiplayer-nintendo-ds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The excellent Delta emulator for iOS is going to get even better: sometime soon, the app will get support for online multiplayer in Nintendo DS games, according to Delta developer <a href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/DARNtdxuQun">Riley Testut</a>. Testut’s post about the feature includes a video of a <em>Mario Kart DS</em> race between two people being played on the emulator, and it immediately transported me back to playing the game on my own DS many years ago.</p><p>Nintendo shut down the DS’s online services way back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/26/5452180/nintendo-wi-fi-connection-ending-in-may">in 2014</a>, so we asked Testut how the online services will work. “It’s based on melonDS’ online support, which connects to 3rd-party Nintendo [Wi-Fi Connection] servers (such as Kaeru, Wimmfi, AltWFC, etc),” Testut tells <em>The Verge</em>. “This means all&nbsp;10 million+&nbsp;Delta users will be able to connect to other Delta users&nbsp;and&nbsp;users on real devices who are using these 3rd-party Nintendo WFC servers.”</p><p>However, “this also means it is limited to Nintendo DS games for now, but all Nintendo DS games with Nintendo WFC are supported,” Testut says. The Delta team doesn’t plan to host its own server, so online multiplayer will be free when it’s available for everyone.</p><p>You might have to wait a bit before you can try the online multiplayer for yourself. Testut says that the feature is coming first in a beta version of Delta for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane">Patreon subscribers</a>. “We don’t have a public release date yet,” Testut says. While disappointing, that means you have plenty of time to get some <em>Mario Kart DS</em> practice in. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But you'll have to wait for the "pause" bit.</p>

    </div>

            <p>
If you're a traditionalist who kind of wishes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had stuck to the series' classic real-time with pause combat roots instead of taking a swerve into new-fangled turn-based territory, there's now - as they say - a mod for that. Sort of.
</p>
<p>
Modder tinybike has just <a href="https://github.com/tinybike/Brawl">released</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/one-baldur-s-gate-3-modder-managed-to-implemented-real-time-combat-like-the-classic-games-but-you-should-probably-wait-for-them-to-figure-out-a-pause-button-before-diving-in/">PC Gamer</a>) what they call a "very very very rough draft" of a real-time combat mod for Baldur's Gate 3. Which is to say, the real-time part of the equation is now there, but the critical "with pause" bit currently isn't implemented, meaning players are likely to get wiped off the face of Faerûn before making much progress.
</p>
<p>
Still, tinybike doesn't think adding pause functionality should be especially difficult. "I think because of the way I'm doing combat, which is basically by forcing everything to remain technically out-of-combat," they explained in a comment beneath a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEBW4qIW28c">video of the mod in action</a>, "pausing should actually be pretty simple."
</p>

<p>
"I think it's just a matter of clicking the button to drop into turn-based mode," they continued. "Not 100 percent sure this actually behaves the way you'd expect a NWN-style RTwP system to behave though, I will have to mess with it and see."
</p>
<p>
And if that's not enough to dissuade from giving the "very barebones" mod a go, tinybike has an additional warning, noting there's a very good reason players should avoid attempting the campaign with it installed right now: it doesn't play particularly nice with Baldur's Gate 3's reams of chatter. "You will get butchered in real-time," they explain, "while the dialogue is happening."
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it's a promising start to a mod that just might warm the nostalgia-hued hearts of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> purists. And you can expect plenty more where that came from, now that Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">has official mod support</a> - not that its absence stopped eager modders from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-baldurs-gate-3-mods-to-make-or-break-combat">getting stuck in</a> before then.

			<p>First posted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN China</a>, a new dev diary has surfaced online and showcases some of the gameplay in the upcoming game Assassin's Creed Shadows. The footage is just under five minutes long and shows off the dynamic world that players can expect to dive into when the game releases. Considering the popularity of the site that posted the footage, it's likely that the dev diary will very quickly be taken down. More and more leaks about the upcoming Assassin's Creed game continue to surface, including ones recently speaking about some of the features that will be included in the game. The features include a dynamic weather system, which will affect the gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For example, when it is raining in-game, it means that enemies won't be able to hear your movements, as they will be muffled by the rainfall. Alternatively, if you have to cross a large body of water, you may have to find that you wait until winter, when the water will be frozen over, and you can traverse the ice.</p>
<p>The footage shown showcases the new animation style that is being tested out in Assassin's Creed Shadows, hoping to make a more immersive world for those who plan on playing the game. Additionally, players are introduced to their 'Hideout.' It's been described as having one acre of land, where the player will be able to build their base of operations and build something similar to an armory, as well as a dojo and an altar. The buildings will be fully customizable, allowing players to make the buildings look however they want them to, as well as being able to change aspects such as the design of the roof or the color of the walls.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive footage shown to Insider Gaming</a>, they got to get a sneak peek further into the Hideout and what it will entail. It was said to be similar to that of the building in Valhalla, but heavily improved on.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows seems to be shaping up as <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">their most ambitious game yet</a>, despite it being smaller than Valhalla and bigger than Mirage. Assassin's Creed Shadows releases on November 12, 2024. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

In this case, that would be the single best Xbox exclusive of the past five years: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pentiment-review-impressions-obsidian-xbox-gamepass-rpg-1849774671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pentiment-review-impressions-obsidian-xbox-gamepass-rpg-1849774671"><em>Pentiment</em></a></span>. Maybe the dialogue-heavy 2022 game about solving murders in 16th-century Bavaria isn’t what you were expecting me to say. This was a game that received widespread critical acclaim when it was released but that often goes underappreciated due to its strange premise. But the team behind it should be enough to sell you. <em>Pentiment </em>was developed by a small team at Obsidian Entertainment led by Josh Sawyer, maybe best known as the director of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>. </p><p>The Team at Obsidian is known for creating intricate worlds and stories driven by player choice. That remains true in <em>Pentiment</em>, even if the medieval-inspired 2D aesthetic and lack of a sprawling open world make you think otherwise. In <em>Pentiment</em>, your choices decide not only your fate but also the fate of an entire town over the course of 25 years. It’s a stunning achievement of storytelling thanks to an incredibly fleshed-out network of characters all living their own lives in the midst of the changing times. At ten bucks, it’s a steal during the current sale.</p><p>Of course, if you’d rather grab some big-name franchises like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/every-halo-game-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1848242182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/every-halo-game-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1848242182"><em>Halo</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-xbox-360-split-screen-local-coop-nostalgia-1850753479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-xbox-360-split-screen-local-coop-nostalgia-1850753479"><em>Gears of War</em></a></span>, that’s also an option.
