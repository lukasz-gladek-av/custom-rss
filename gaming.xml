            <p>The announcement of a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer for the first time in 18 years was a welcome <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tokyo-xtreme-racer-is-returning-after-18-years-with-a-new-game-coming-to-steam-next-year">surprise at the end of 2024</a>. It now has a release date: January 23rd. It's an Early Access launch, but I am excited to drive a gaudy monstrosity on a Japanese highway.

<p>When it was announced, there wasn't much more to see of TXR than some logos and a screenshot of a road. As it stands, there are more screenshots and trailers now, but they do not suggest an Early Access launch lousy with content. 
</p>
<p>The text of its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/">Steam page</a> offers a more robust picture of the game. "Over 200 rival characters each with their own unique storyline have been implemented already. There will also be a total 50 playable cars, and over 180 kilometers worth of the Shuto Expressway to race upon," it says about the state of the game at launch. You'll apparently be able to play the game up to about the halfway mark, "with a focus on SP battle and the car tuning features." 
</p><p>Genki hope to keep the game in Early ACcess for "approximately 4 months", but the actual duration will depend upon player feedback. It'll be $30 when it launches at 8am GMT on January 23rd, with a likely price increase when it hits 1.0.
</p>
<p>I choose to be cautiously optimistic, because it's more fun to imagine this will be great than to fret otherwise. And if it is bad, there's still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707900/NIGHTRUNNERS_PROLOGUE/">Night-Runners Prologue to keep that expressway bustling</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For four seasons of Netflix’s stalker drama <em>You, </em>Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) has cheated death (and a few love interests) enough to warrant him being eliminated from existence forever, and the final season looks like it’s going to do just that. Today, Netflix put us all out of our misery by finally announcing the release date for the final season of <em>You</em>, while also offering some  hints about Joe’s potential fate.</p><p>The final season of <em>You </em>will release on April 24, a little under 5 1/2 years after the series made its way over to Netflix from its original home,&nbsp;<em>Lifetime</em>. The teaser recaps Joe’s litany of victims while the lovestruck sicko narrates about the trail of blood, bodies, and broken hearts that led him to where he was always meant to be. He eerily remarks that some anonymous “you” is the one constant throughout the years while lovingly caressing the glass case he’s imprisoned numerous people in over the last four seasons. Is he talking to his torture chamber? Is he talking to his latest love interest? Is he breaking the fourth wall and actually talking to the viewers?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196915" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="158" data-playlist="196915,193799,195369" data-current="196915"><div><p>Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Regardless of who he’s talking to, Netflix leaves little doubt that he won’t be talking for much longer. The logline for the seasons says Joe is returning to New York after spending Season 4 in London, but “his perfect life is threatened by the ghosts of his past and his own dark desires.” His life being threatened isn’t new to a guy who was almost killed on the kitchen floor by the mother of his child, but there are more allusions to his time being up. In addition to providing the release date and the teaser trailer, Netflix also gifts us with the poster for the final season, which sees Joe stomach-deep in water inside the glass case with the words “To The Last Breath” above his head.</p><figure id="" data-id="1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-recommend-id="image://1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="2222" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-recommend-id="image://1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="2222" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you need any more convincing that this is the end for Joe, he concludes the teaser inside of the glass case by looking directly into our souls and saying, “Goodbye, you.” We’ll check back on April 24 to see how Netflix decides to wrap up one of the creepiest stories in its collection. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But before Larian puts the latest patch through a stress test with players, the developer has shared more details about what to expect.</p><p>Photo mode and 12 new subclasses are among the new features that stand out in Patch 8. There are also a number of bug fixes and in-game mod improvements. Larian's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/782037674453106724" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest update</a> notes that there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-celebrates-100-million-mod-downloads-with-withers-big-naturals-mod/1100-6528842/" data-ref-id="1100-6528842">100 million mod downloads</a> to date. The company also promised that more mods are being approved for console players.</p><p>Mac players also have new minimum specs for Baldur's Gate 3. Larian now suggests that Mac users update their system to macOS 14 (version 14.7.1) or later. Older Macs that can't be updated to that level can still play Baldur's Gate 3 through Patch 6.</p><p>Players can <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">register to preview the patch in the upcoming stress test</a>. However, Mac players won't be able to use cross-platform play during that period. The Patch 8 stress test will let Xbox, PlayStation, and PC players try out the cross-platform play by creating or joining a lobby to find friends through the Larian Network. Xbox players will need to download the Xbox Insider Hub app to register for the stress test. However, Larian notes that the stress test will be going out in waves of players, and registering for it doesn't guarantee that players will be able to participate. </p><p>Larian recently announced that it is now focusing on a new project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. Any potential sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">will be developed by other studios</a>. You can find the Patch 8 bug notes below, but beware of some of the spoilers in there.</p><h3>Incoming Bug Fixes</h3><p>Along with the new features, we’re continuing to clean up animation pops, clipping, and have fixed bugs, including the likes of:</p><ul><li>Fixed a savegame issue where you wouldn't get the appropriate amount of Umbral Gems for the Gauntlet of Shar.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing you to get stuck at a 0% loading screen when attempting to join a multiplayer session that uses mods.</li><li>Your character will no longer think Shadowheart is dead if she isn't when talking to</li><li>Halsin will now show up to your camp in Act II as long as you save him, even if you happen to skip the celebration with the tieflings at camp.</li><li>Improved performance in the Adamantine Forge.</li><li>Minthara will now comment on reveal.</li><li>Cerys will stop getting involved in combats with Minthara from across the region. An eager beaver no longer.</li><li>We’ve also reminded Minthara that 'knocked out' does not mean 'dead', so she'll more reliably appear in Moonrise Towers.</li><li>Fixed companions' lines getting cut off prematurely after Gale at the end of the game.</li><li>Fixed a bug preventing Wyll from commenting on Astarion holding a blade to your throat during Astarion's recruitment dialogue by the beach.</li><li>Barcus is no longer Mike Wazowski'd by various items like cauldrons and bottles blocking him off from view when you talk to him at Last Light.</li></ul><h3>In-Game Mod Manager Improvements</h3><ul><li>Removed the third-party mods warning and replaced it with clearer messaging.</li><li>The Mod Verification window will now trigger regardless of where the request to connect to a multiplayer game is coming from.</li></ul>

            <p>
Microsoft has reportedly made another round of layoffs, this time affecting a "small" number of employees spanning its security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1">according to Business Insider</a>, which - citing "people familiar with the matter" - reports impacted employees were notified of the layoffs on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson told the publication a "small" number of job cuts had been made, but did not specify a figure. It also said the move was unrelated to recent job cuts targeting underperforming employees.
</p>
<p>
The news follows several rounds of layoffs at Microsoft over the last year. In January 2024, the company announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">cutting 1900 jobs across its gaming division</a>, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">further 650 cuts</a> being made in September. Eurogamer understands Microsoft's latest layoffs have impacted a small number of gaming employees, but that the division wasn't specifically a focus.
</p>
<p>
In response to a request for comment on Business Insider's report, a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer, "Organisational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business. We will continue to prioritise and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners."
</p><p>
Microsoft's latest layoffs follow a devastating 2024 for the games industry, in which around 13000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs. Those layoffs have continued into the new year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">numerous job cuts having been reported</a> amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">studio closures</a>. Last year, Chris Dring shared his thoughts with Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why these layoffs are happening</a>.

		<p>It’s been an exciting little day at TSA towers what with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">Switch 2 announcement</a> and everything, but not everyone is into plumbers who drive around in go-karts, or consoles where you can take the sides off. If you’re more of a multiplayer extraction shooter type of gamer, then the news that Exoborne, the latest game from Sharkmob, the team behind Bloodhunt, is getting a playtest next month might raise your pulse a little more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exoborne Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3GZwprbl0ik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Exoborne certainly looks the part, with players wrapped up in mechanical Exo-Rigs. These versatile tools are designed for survival and combat and they can be customised depending on the mission at hand. We got to take a look at the game during last year’s Gamescom, and storms seem to play a massive part, providing both visual impact, and deadly gameplay scenarios.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of gunplay and action on show, with some nods to previous Exosuit-equipped games like Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare and even a touch of Bioware’s Anthem. It looks hard-hitting, chaotic and all kinds of fun. Of course, they’re entering into a crowded genre, so the playtest is a perfect way to gain feedback from players and to garner interest ahead of its launch later in the year.</p>
<p>Brynley Gibson, Executive Producer says, “We’ve been conducting closed tests both online and in our studio for quite some time, but this marks our first large-scale test, and it’s an incredibly exciting milestone for us. By entering this stage of open collaboration with the community, we’re eager to gather invaluable insights and feedback that will drive us to elevate the game to new heights.”</p>


<p>The Exoborne playtest will run from Feburary 12th to February 17th, and while the game will launch on console alongside its desktop brethren, the playtest is limited to PC only. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2705130/Exoborne/">sign up for it right here</a>, and don’t forget to check out the new trailer as well.</p>

            <p>
Blade Chimera is a cyberpunk metroidvania from Team Ladybug, the team behind the really very good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/touhou-luna-nights">Touhou Luna Nights</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/record-of-lodoss-war-deedlit-in-wonder-labyrinth">Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth</a>. As with Deedlit - one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">favourite 'vanias</a> - I’m drawn to it partly for the opulent real-time RPG combat, and partly because, to be very superficial, the protagonist is taller than I’m used to in games like this. Sometimes he feels too tall for the levels.

I don’t know whether it’s just that I’ve been reprogrammed by the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal World</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori And The Blind Forest</a> to think of metroidvania protags as acrobatic blobs, but there’s something novel and, dare I say, regal about the imposing figure your character cuts in Blade Chimera, as he somersaults away from energy bolts and lacerates dragons with a whip. Look at his cape! Look at his pony tail! I used to have hair like that. I never had a cape, though.
</p>
<p>
Blade Chimera launched today, and still has a demo. If your interest has been piqued, I’d download that demo pronto, because they’ll likely pull it soon. It casts you as Shin, a cyberpunk demon hunter who doesn’t have a memory but does have a Demon Sword called Lux who can turn into bridges, ropes, and barricades. Demon Swiss Army Knife, morelike. Demon Green Lantern’s Ring, even. When she isn’t being used as a clobbering instrument or platforming prop, Lux also gets to be a ghost lady who can manipulate time. She’s the kind of friend you want when you’re lacerating dragons.
</p><p>
The controls might take a teeny bit of getting used to, if you’re new to the dev’s work– there’s a stateliness to movement that may feel stifling. I'm sure you'll persist, though, because the animations and art are swish. Again: his cape! His hair! The last time I had hair like that was before the Millennium Bug. In terms of how it differs from Team Ladybug's previous games, the map is apparently “far larger”. I’m not sure I like the cyberpunk backdrop’s abundance of metallic grey surfaces, next to Deedlit's faerie labyrinth, but it’s a handsome production regardless.

So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p><p>Yoshida reiterated that this wasn’t secret information but just his own guess as to why FromSoftware and Sony have never moved forward with anything related to the franchise, even a potential remake by another studio like Bluepoint Games. It previously produced the well-received <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remakes, and was at one point rumored to be working on something related to <em>Bloodborne </em>before later leaks suggested it was actually working on an original IP. </p><p>We don’t know exactly what Miyazaki and FromSoftware are working on at the moment. A separate team within the studio is shipping 2025's <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off, <em>Nighreign</em>. The director recently said other teams within the studio would be focusing on new projects in different genres. Sony is now the largest single shareholder in FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation. Who knows, maybe <em>Bloodborne 2</em> will be a launch game for the PS6. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s yet another addition to the in-development title that sees Grinding Gear fine-tune the experience to live up to both it and fans’ expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Endgame maps have increased their monster, chest, Essence, Strongbox, and Precursor Artifacts numbers in hopes of creating a more rewarding experience for those deeper into Path of Exile 2. Endgame players will now also find four new Tower Map areas – Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire. Skill changes include tweaks to things like Supercharged Slam, Scavenged Plating, and more, while monster balances promise increased toughness per essence modifier and a reduction for the Lost-men Zealot’s Meteor range. There are, of course, also a vast number of glitch and quality-of-life improvements included in today’s list.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exile 2 patch 0.1.1 is only the first of many updates set to launch in 2025. Included in the patch notes are mentions of fixes for issues Grinding Gear says it “didn’t quite get ready in time for this patch.” For example, it’s taking longer to fix Una’s Song than the team anticipated, and Map Stash Tabs are also on the way. Grinding Gear says these problems will be addressed “as soon as they’re ready.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s worth stressing that just because a specific issue is not on this list, it doesn’t mean that we’re not aware of it or that it isn’t going to get addressed,” game director Jonathan Rogers explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNJSDxwC9bY&amp;t=8s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a recent video going over everything in 0.1.1</u></a>. “It just means that we either can’t fix the problem quickly, or we can’t do so without the need for a new economy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The long wait for the Path of Exile 2 early access launch finally came to an end when it released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on December 6, 2024. It saw massive success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-enjoys-massive-launch-becomes-15th-most-played-game-ever-on-steam"><u>securing its place as the 15th most-played game Steam game ever</u></a>. Regardless of its strong start, the team acknowledged that more could be done to make the experience feel rewarding, outlining <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-dev-admits-the-game-doesnt-feel-rewarding-enough-outlines-plans-to-increase-loot-drops"><u>a plan to tweak loot drops last month</u></a>. For everything coming in update 0.1.1, you can read the full patch notes below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Path of Exile 2 Update 0.1.1 Patch Notes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>0.1.1 Patch Notes</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This patch contains new endgame tower maps, checkpoints for map areas, respawn attempts for the Arbiter of Ash, as well as many monster changes, unique changes, improvements and bug fixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Endgame Changes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added 4 new Tower Map areas: Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire.</li><li>The Lost Towers Map area has also been revamped.</li><li>To address the problem of only having one attempt at the Arbiter of Ash Boss fight, you will now have up to six respawn attempts at this fight. Respawns can only be triggered by the person who put in the keys, and everyone in your party will be respawned at the same time. Leaving the Map still forfeits your attempt so you'll still need to fight the boss with the build you walked into the Map with. Higher difficulties of the Boss will lower the number of respawn attempts you receive. We'll be looking to add respawn attempts to other Pinnacle content over time.</li><li>The Arbiter of Ash can no longer be interrupted during his falling flame seed skill. His flaming gale skill can no longer be blocked.</li><li>The Arbiter of Ash Boss is now invulnerable for longer during its emergence and now takes significantly reduced damage while emerging.</li><li>The Arbiter of Ash is now way less likely to target minions when using his sword, which could prevent some of their skills being used.</li><li>Added checkpoints to Map areas.</li><li>Map areas now contain a minimum of 3 Rare Monsters.</li><li>Citadels can now appear closer to the Ziggurat Refuge.</li><li>Improved the visibility of Citadels on the Endgame Map.</li><li>Maps now display their Biome when hovered in the Atlas UI.</li><li>Added the new Overseer's Precursor Tablet, a currency item which can be placed in completed Towers to add Map Bosses to valid Maps in radius. These tablets drop from Map Bosses, and can roll exclusive modifiers that affect Map Bosses.</li><li>Map areas have been adjusted to have more distinct specialities for the content they contain. For example, one Map area might have more total number of monsters, while another is more likely to contain additional content such as Strongboxes, Essences or Shrines. Generally speaking, the more difficult a Map is to clear, or the smaller it is, the more axes it will specialise in. Here's an overview of changes we've made to give Maps more discernibility:</li><li>A number of Maps now spawn up to double the number of Chests, and twice as many minimum Magic or Rare Chests.</li><li>A number of Maps now contain up to double the number of Monsters.</li><li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Magic Monsters.</li><li>A number of Maps now contain 50% more Rare Monsters.</li><li>A number of Maps now have a higher minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li><li>A number of Maps now have a lower minimum number of Rare Monsters you will encounter.</li><li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Essences.</li><li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Strongboxes.</li><li>A number of Maps now have 50% more chance to contain Shrines.</li><li>Maps that are only exclusively found in Biomes containing Citadels now have 50% more chance to contain Essences, Strongboxes and Shrines.</li><li>Unclaimed Hideout Areas now have substantially more Magic Monsters, and fewer Rare Monsters.</li><li>Monsters in the Untainted Paradise have been breeding. Untainted Paradise now contains 100% more Monsters, of which spawn 100% more (thus quadruple) Magic and Rare Monsters.</li><li>Improved the highlightability/clickability of Shrines.</li><li>Reduced the damage scaling of Monsters in Simulacrum encounters with added Difficulty.</li><li>Adjusted the chance for Maps to contain Bosses, you should be encountering a Boss roughly every 1 in 4 Maps.</li><li>The chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher has been reduced to account for the increase in total number of Map Bosses.</li><li>The Radiant Waystones Atlas Notable Passive now provides +15% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 25%).</li><li>The small Map Boss Waystone Chance Passives now provide +6% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 10%).</li><li>The "I'm not afraid of you!" Delirium Atlas Passive Skill now grants "Delirium Bosses in your Maps drop 100% increased Simulacrum Splinters" (previously 50%).</li><li>Reduced the number of monsters and small chests from Breaches by 15%.</li><li>Increased the amount of Simulacrum Splinters found in Maps by 20%.</li><li>Added dedicated 2D art for Waystones that are instilled with layers of Delirium.</li><li>Crisis Fragments, Breachstones, Simulacrums, and An Audience with the King now have a more appropriate gold value to vendors.</li><li>Increased how far you can zoom out on the Endgame Map on keyboard and mouse input, to match the zoom level on controller input.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Skill Changes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Supercharged Slam now has "Each successive aftershock gains +0.5 metres to radius, up to 3 metres (previously uncapped).</li><li>Scavenged Plating now grants you stacks for a duration based on the enemy's rarity. Normal enemies grant 1 stack, Magic enemies grants 2 stacks, Rare enemies grant 5 stacks, and Unique enemies grant 10 stacks.</li><li>The Lightning Bolt Skill granted by the Choir of the Storm Unique Amulet has been renamed to Greater Lightning Bolt to differentiate it from the Skill granted by Staves. Triggered Greater Lightning Bolts are now unable to trigger a subsequent Greater Lightning Bolt if the first was a Critical Hit. Greater Lightning Bolt now deals roughly 3.5 times more base Lightning Damage compared to Lightning Bolt.</li><li>The Temporalis Unique Body Armour can no longer reduce the cooldown of a Skill to below 100ms.</li><li>Skills socketed in a Meta Gem's sockets can no longer gain energy.</li><li>Clarified Vine Arrow's description to explicitly state that it hits enemies on landing.</li><li>Removed the Aura tag from Pain Offering for consistency with other minion skills, as the skill does not directly create an Aura (the Aura is created by the summoned minion).</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monster Changes</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Monsters now have increased Toughness per Essence modifier affecting them.</li><li>Added a small delay before monsters released from Essence Monoliths can use their skills.</li><li>Forsaken Miners now throw less grenades, which have also had their damage reduced and their visuals improved.</li><li>Rudja, the Dread Engineer's grenades now deal less damage in Cruel and Maps.</li><li>Reduced how far away Faridun Plaguebringers can use their Detonate Dead skill from.

The visuals of this skill have also been improved.</li><li>Reduced the axe throwing distance of Vaal Axemen.</li><li>Reduced the area of effect for Filthy First-born's on-death explosion. The visibility of the area of effect has also been improved.</li><li>The vomit skill used by Rotting Hulks and Bog Hulks now deal less damage, and can no longer be used point blank in front of you.</li><li>Adjusted the damaging area of The Bloated Miller's slam skills to more closely match the visual effects.</li><li>Adjusted the damaging area of Zalmarath, the Colossus' attacks to more closely match the visual effects.</li><li>Adjusted the player targeting behaviour for Zalmarath, the Colossus. Their arms are no longer targetable.</li><li>Adjusted the damaging area of Bahlak, the Sky Seer's Tornadoes to more closely match the visual effects.

Their slam now deals more damage in the centre, and less around the edges.</li><li>Reduced the distance of which Urnwalkers in the Trial of the Sekhemas are able to initiate their skill. We've also fixed an issue where they were not dealing damage correctly, meaning they now deal more damage.</li><li>Slitherspitters no longer deal damage twice with their projectile attack. Their melee attack now deals Physical damage instead of Chaos.</li><li>The density of monsters in Utzaal has been reduced. Monsters contained in the area are now more likely to be of a weaker variety.</li><li>The density of monsters in Dreadnaught areas has been adjusted to result in less swarming encounters.</li><li>Improved the telegraphing for Azak Shamans' Detonate Dead skill.</li><li>Improved the telegraphing for the crystals left by Vaal Goliaths when they die.</li><li>Chaos Pustules in Ritual encounters have had their visuals improved.</li><li>The Impending Doom modifier in the Trial of Chaos now has more time before it explodes and has had its visuals improved.</li><li>Improved the telegraphing of the anchor drop from monsters affected by Essence of Torment.</li><li>Improved the visuals of the area of effect from monsters affected by Essence of Electricity.

The Medium preset keeps 60 frames per second on an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 GPU. Lastly, the Ultra preset is also shown at 60 frames per second on an Intel Core i7 10700 CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 GPU.</p>

<p>Soul Assembly, the developers behind Just Dance VR, has let go 15% of its staff in the latest string of layoffs to hit the games industry. First reported by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/soul-assembly-layoffs-january-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, the layoffs are across multiple areas of the company including animation, marketing, QA, and more. </p>



<p>“This decision was taken to ensure the studio is aligned with the requirements of our upcoming projects,” Soul Assembly CEO David Solari told UploadVR. “We are providing support to the affected team members as they transition to new opportunities and thank them for their contributions. This step was necessary to position the company for future success during a challenging time for the gaming industry.”</p>



<p>As far as the number of employees being let go, the company only says 15%. The <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/520511-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest employment data</a> from 2023 says that company had 72 people working at the studio with a goal of hitting over 100 by 2024. If we were to go based on that information, the company let go anywhere from 11-20 people if it surpassed 100 employees as it intended. Insider Gaming has reached out to get an exact number of people impacted, and will update this story should a response be received.</p>



<p>The layoffs at Soul Assembly <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mark the 11th company</a> to hold layoffs so far in 2025. After 2024 saw nearly 16,000 known jobs lost, 2025 has seen an estimated 200+ jobs lost in its first 16 days.</p>



<p>In addition to Just Dance VR, Soul Assembly <a href="https://soulassembly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has developed games</a> such as Warhammer 40K: Battle Sister, Last Stand, and the Drop Dead franchise.</p>

<p>The best Counter-Strike 2 case to open depends on entirely on what you’re trying to get out of a case. Opening cases in CS2 is a gamble, as you’re most likely to open a blue Mil-Spec tier skin that’s not worth the price of the case key. But if you’re lucky, a Covert red skin or an Exceedingly Rare item might fall your way.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-cases-to-open">Best CS2 Cases to Open</h2>



<p>The best cases to open in CS2 are the ones that feature the most aesthetically pleasing and valuable skins. But cases with the most valuable knife skins are also considered the best. From the perspective of pure value, the older, rarer cases contain the most valuable skins, but those cases are easily the most expensive. Sure, you can pay $120 for the classic CS:GO Weapon Case, but unless you’re lucky you’re more than likely going to end up with a skin worth $40.</p>



<p>If you’re fishing for knives, but don’t mind ending up with some nice skins as a consolation, here are the CS2 cases to target.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-spectrum-2-case">The Spectrum 2 Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Spectrum 2 Case has some of the most valuable rare items in Counter-Strike. Its Covert red skin is the gorgeous AK-47 The Empress skin, and you have a chance at opening a Butterfly Knife Doppler, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/most-expensive-counter-strike-skins-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most valuable skins</a> in all of Counter-Strike. It’s currently listed at $2.64 per case on the Steam community market, so it’s a bit high risk, but it’s also high reward.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-prisma-case">The Prisma Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Prisma Case is a little more cost effective at $0.95 per case, but what makes it worth opening is a chance at one of the most gorgeous M4A4 skins. The Emperor skin for the M4A4 is one of the most esthetically pleasing and clean skins for the CT rifle, but you might also luck out with an extremely valuable Doppler knife skin. The AWP Atheris is also a solid get.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-recoil-case">The Recoil Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Recoil Case is the cheapest case on the Steam community market, currently listed at just $0.24 per case. The lower price is due to it featuring a small chance at gloves instead of a knife, but it also has some nice skins you could potentially get. The M4A4 Poly Mag, the AK-47 Ice Coaled, the Glock Winterized, and the USP-S Printstream are all really clean skins.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-danger-zone-case">The Danger Zone Case</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Danger Zone Case features a classic Covert red skin, the AK-47 Asiimov. The orange, black, and white skin is a iconic color scheme which has been replicated on other weapons as well. Opening a Danger Zone Case also gives you a chance to unbox a lucrative Talon Knife Fade skin.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Mortal Kombat 1 [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a></em> downloadable content character Conan the Barbarian will launch on January 21 for Kombat Pack 2 / “Khaos Reigns” expansion owners and January 28 for all users, publisher <a title="Companies > Warner Bros.

Games:</p><blockquote><p>Downloadable content guest fighter Conan the Barbarian is the towering Cimmerian warrior from the <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> (1982) film, featuring the likeness of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role of the title character.</p><p>Born on a battlefield, Conan has become one of the most formidable warriors the world has ever seen through relentless toil and kombat. Sold into slavery after his parents are slain and village destroyed by the malevolent warlord Thulsa Doom, he is eventually freed by his master and embarks on a quest for vengeance, his journey culminating in the defeat of Doom, liberating thousands from his sorcerous grip. In <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, Conan stands ready to defend Earthrealm against the vile beings that mean to conquer it.</p><p>Conan’s distinct yet devastating moveset is on full display in the new trailer and is built around his iconic Atlantean Sword. The master blade-wielder can perform complex maneuvers with the imposing steel weapon, including his intricate sword spinning and signature overhead chop to take down opponents with brute force. The video also reveals one of Conan’s gruesome Fatalities and teases the fighter’s Animality, the brutal finishing move that morphs the character into a powerful bull to annihilate defeated opponents. The fan favorite Animalities are available now as a free content update for all <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> owners.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,662 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,572 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,520 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,132 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/mortal-kombat-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-is-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Assetto Corsa EVO, the latest entry in the popular sim-racing series, has debuted on Steam Early Access today, starting the long journey through to a full 1.0 launch, expected later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO Early Access Launch Trailer - OUT NOW [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZpAVyWViIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Early Access is priced at €39.99 | $39.99 | £32.99 with an additional launch discount of 20% off for a limited time.</p>
<p>This is a more direct sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-console-review/">Assetto Corsa</a>, as opposed to the motorsports focused <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/01/assetto-corsa-competizione-ps5-xbox-series-xs-review/">Assetto Corsa Competizione</a>. As such, there’s cars that include everything from modern road cars to classics, hypercars, and race cars.</p>
<p>For the start of early access, Assetto Corsa EVO has 5 tracks and 20 cars, alongside free practice, quick race, driving academy and special event modes.&nbsp;This will grow to include 100 cars and 15 licensed circuits for the 1.0 launch in Fall 2025, with 5 more tracks to follow after launch as free updates.</p>

<p>For now, though, the tracks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brands Hatch</li>
<li>Imola</li>
<li>Laguna Seca</li>
<li>Mount Panorama</li>
<li>Suzuka</li>
</ul>
<p>And cars include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abarth 695 Biposto</li>
<li>Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAm</li>
<li>Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica Veloce</li>
<li>Alpine A110 S</li>
<li>Alpine A290B Concept</li>
<li>Audi RS 3 Sportback</li>
<li>BMW M2 CS Racing</li>
<li>BMW M4 CSL</li>
<li>Chevrolet Camaro ZL1</li>
<li>Ferrari 296 GTB</li>
<li>Ferrari 488 Challenge EVO</li>
<li>Ford Escort RS Cosworth</li>
<li>Honda S2000</li>
<li>Hyundai i30 N Hatchback</li>
<li>Lotus Emira</li>
<li>Mazda MX5 ND Cup</li>
<li>Mercedes-Benz AMG GT2</li>
<li>Porsche 911 (992) GT3 Cup</li>
<li>Toyota GR86</li>
<li>Volkswagen Golf Mk 8 GTI Clubsport</li>
</ul>
<p>The first content update has already been laid out to add Circuit of Americas, five more cars, custom race weekends, and more. Five more updates are planned through the year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this is following the path laid out by Gran Turismo and other always-online racing games. There’s early reports that server issues are blocking players from accessing the in-game licensing events, and thus blocking them from unlocking more than an initial five cars. Great.</p>
<p>Hopefully they can address the server troubles, and I’m sure many will be hoping they reconsider this kind of digital locking system, because the rest of what AC EVO promises is incredibly promising. There’s a new proprietary race engine that is designed specifically for racing games. It features a full 24-hour race cycle, dynamic weather and track conditions, full support for VR and triple-screen set-ups and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-our-unanswered-questions-about-the-nintendo-switch-2.1084374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">has finally revealed its new console</a>, debuting the Switch 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/itpcsQQvgAQ?si=VDfmRNPpVOUhOhZo">with a short video</a> that went heavy on visuals but light on information. The video was paired with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250116009204/en/">a brief follow-up press release from Nintendo</a> that <em>also</em> didn’t go into much detail, with the company ostensibly saving all the juicy stuff for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">the Switch 2 Direct set to take place on April 2nd</a>. While we wait for official word, here are the burning questions we still have about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p></div><p><h4>What are the Switch 2’s specs?</h4></p><p>Perhaps the most glaring omission in the Switch 2 reveal was the fact that Nintendo didn’t say anything about how powerful the new console is. We can see that the console is bigger, but what’s the screen size? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">Is it OLED</a> or LCD? Is the screen resolution still 720p? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701210/nintendo-switch-4k-pro-rumors-oled">Is 4K resolution supported</a>? </p><p>Though visible for a few brief moments, the reveal video showed off the Switch 2’s new dock. What’s the docked resolution? Is it just a charging shell, or is it still required for TV play? Can you dock the Switch 2 in the original Switch dock, or will it support all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349885/genki-covert-dock-review-price-portable-nintendo-switch-usbc-hdmi-adapter">super-portable third-party docks</a>? </p><p>The Switch 2 also features a second USB-C port at the top. It’s likely there to offer a way to connect USB-C headphones without sacrificing a charging port. But perhaps it might have some other mysterious function. Has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update">native Bluetooth support</a> been improved? It’d be nice to connect more than two wireless controllers if a Bluetooth headset is being used. What about the UI? Can we expect to see a homescreen similar to the original Switch? What about the UI for the eShop? Can <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057">you still post screenshots and clips directly to Facebook</a>? Will Nintendo add the ability to post to other social media or streaming platforms? </p><p><h4>How exactly do the Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers work?</h4></p><p>A lot of the reveal trailer focused on the new Joy-Cons, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">while there’s some info we can infer</a>, there’s still more we don’t know. Do they attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld">via magnets</a>? Do they still have 3D rumble? Will the Switch 2 support the original Switch Pro controller or the original Switch Joy-Cons in wireless mode? </p><p>Prior to the reveal, there were rumors that the Joy-Cons would have magnetic Hall effect joysticks that would supposedly combat Joy-Con drift. So, what improvements has Nintendo made to protect against drift? Will Nintendo still offer repairs for the new Joy-Cons if they do drift? Will it sell new Joy-Cons separately at launch, and do they come in any new colors? </p><p><h4>What does that new button do?</h4></p><p>There’s a new button on the Switch 2 directly below the home button on the right Joy-Con. Does it have something to do with a new chat functionality <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-purpose-function-campus-chat-rooms-rumor/">like rumors have suggested</a>? </p><div><figcaption><em>Sure seems like that’s some mouse action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF: Nintendo / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h4>Does the new Joy-Con work like a mouse?</h4></p><p>The reveal video featured a Joy-Con attaching to a cover and zooming around on a surface like a mouse. Is “mouse” functionality one of the Switch 2’s new gimmicks? Speaking of gimmicks, is there still an IR camera for games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/13/14262624/1-2-switch-nintendo-hands-on-preview"><em>1-2-Switch</em></a>? I also hope that the Switch 2 will still support original Switch peripherals like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>Ring-Con</a>.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p><h4>What games will be playable on the Switch 2?</h4></p><p>The Switch 2 reveal only showed off one game: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Beyond that, we have no idea what kind of launch titles to expect or if the new <em>Mario Kart</em> will even be among them. So, what kind of games can we expect for the Switch 2? Will there be Switch 2 exclusives at launch, or will we get cross-gen launch games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em>? One of the bigger original Switch complaints was that newer, larger games often didn’t run or look all that good. Can the console run more technically intensive games? If so, will they run natively on the console, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293458/nintendo-switch-japan-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-odyssey">will they be playable via cloud streaming</a> like <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> and <em>Control</em>? </p><p>Speaking of<em> Mario Kart</em>, the short glimpse we saw of it in the trailer featured what looked to be 15 simultaneous racers with 24 spots behind the starting line. Does this mean the Switch 2 will feature enhanced multiplayer capabilities like larger player lobbies, and will the console natively support communication with them? What of Amiibos? Will the Switch 2 still support those, or are there plans to make more?</p><p><h4>What Switch 2 games will be backward-compatible?</h4></p><p>In today’s video, Nintendo reaffirmed that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">Switch 2 would be backward-compatible</a>, playing both physical and digital original Switch games but with the important caveat that not <em>all</em> games would be supported. What original Switch games won’t be compatible? Will the original Switch games that do work on the console receive some kind of graphical or performance boost like certain games on PlayStation and Xbox?</p><p><h4>How much does the Switch 2 cost?</h4></p><p>There’s also the question of how much the Switch 2 will cost. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The original Switch</a> retailed at $299.99 in 2017. Since then, the cost of everything has gone up, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642627/tsmc-chip-price-increase-supply-shortages-apple-qualcomm">especially computer chips</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review">The Switch OLED</a>, the only significant console refresh Nintendo offered, was only $50 more than the base model. But without knowing its internal specs, it’s hard to guess what the Switch 2 might cost.</p><p><h4>When will the Switch 2 launch?</h4></p><p>The most important unanswered question we have about the Switch 2 is the simplest: when can we buy it? Nintendo didn’t share much beyond saying that it will launch in 2025. Much like with the original Switch, it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345091/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-event-schedule">take the Switch 2 on a world tour</a> starting in April. It’s likely that the console’s release date will follow the tour’s conclusion, which looks to be in June. Here’s hoping Nintendo shares that critical information, along with answers to at least some of these questions during its Switch 2 Direct on April 2nd.</p><p><h4>How do the cartridges taste?</h4></p><p>Oh, wait, there is one more burning question... what flavors can we expect for the Switch 2 cartridges? I’m hoping for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14778316/nintendo-switch-cartridge-taste-test-dont-lick-it">something better than “insecticide.”</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In many ways its what everyone wanted and hoped for: A new version of the Switch that’s more powerful, sleeker, and supports all the old games. However, is this new console too...safe? Boring?

It’s not a “fun” name the way Super Nintendo Switch would be, but it’s the smart play.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong>: They want to avoid a WiiU situation IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> YUP. In many ways lol.</p><figure id="" data-id="756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-recommend-id="image://756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-recommend-id="image://756b8cbf2e150e227e71ac8eb4ad194d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>John:</strong> See, I disagree. I get that they’re VERY sure this is a savvy marketing move, and they’re onto a good thing, and on and on and on.</p><p>But 15 years ago, they’d have called this something way better, and made it much weirder. Hence, unsure of themselves. They don’t think the “Nintendo” way of doing something would work.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> But everything was different 15 years ago. The Switch is still an outlier in the console space.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah. 15 years ago Nintendo was still selling a home console <em>and </em>a portable console.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> RIP Iwata</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I also think the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">Switch 2</a></span> will still be weird in some ways we don’t know yet. The mouse stuff is weird! Cool, too</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, doing something “weird” in this case would almost certainly be a failure from a business standpoint. The Wii, while “weird,” was also savvy business-wise, as it didn’t make sense for Nintendo to compete with Sony and MS at their own game.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yes, but it was weird.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> So was the virtual boy.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Nintendo just announced an iteration of their current console and put a “2" on the name. That’s REALLY unlike them. It’s weird because it’s what everyone else does.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yes, but there is not an opportunity today for them to do something that is both “weird” and that would be that successful IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, I bet if you asked Nintendo designers they wouldn’t call any of that stuff weird. Just new ideas they were trying</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> The SNES wasn’t weird. it was basically the equivalent for the time of the Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Gameboy Color was basically just Gameboy but color. Nintendo isn’t above iteration.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> No one expected a Wii, and at the time everyone said it was a mistake because it was so technologically weak. </p><p>When the Switch was announced, there was SO much discourse about how it couldn’t compete with the other consoles because it was so weak. </p><p>I think if Nintendo had done something totally new and weird and original, they could have still had a huge amount of success. And sure, make the Switch XL at the same time.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Like what? What’s your amazing “weird” idea that could have done gangbusters today for Nintendo?</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> And not break compatibility with hundreds of games.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> That’s the point! Only Nintendo could come up with it!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> [indifferent face emoji]</p><p> Yeah I mean, times change. I just don’t see that opportunity today. Maybe it will arise again in the future, but right now, this was the play.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I think you’d have said the same post N64, post GC, etc. And post Wii!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I would not.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Clearly the Wii U was NOT the move, but I love that it WAS the move.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, post N64 maybe, Nintendo didn’t really get “weird” with consoles until the Wii.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Here were my two AMAZING suggestions in my Switch 2 Disappointed piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship Mario game uses our house furniture for platforms.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I hate it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Right, that sounds like shit.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Ask Apple how well AR is doing.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> There is no way that would have a high adoption rate. No way.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> THEY AREN’T REAL PITCHES!</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Well my reaction was very real. lol.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I know but like, you’re just presuming that Nintendo can, under any and all marketplace circumstances, generate ideas for consoles that would be both groundbreaking and hugely successful. I don’t see a basis for that at all.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, after the last decade of merging all their software development into ONE platform instead of two distinct divisions (portable/home) the Switch 2 was always going to be the play. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> If you said to me after the GameCube, “Come on then, think of something,” I wouldn’t have replied, “Um, a thing with a sensor bar and two sticks you wave around.” And if I had, you’d have said “hate it.”</p><p><strong>John: </strong>“Oh you mean like the Kinect?

Its just stuff you buy <em>for </em>the Switch. Like Labo. Which is a better way to do it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yeah. </p><p><strong>John: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307">Everyone should read my brilliant article.</a></span></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I still hold out hope that the Switch 2 will have some surprises. That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah, that’s my point! Don’t need to make something weird, just include weird bits and build off that.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> You people would never have allowed the greatest gaming device of all time, the Nintendo DS.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> God I hated the DS. lol.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> “Two screens, only one is a touch screen, and they’re an inch apart? And it’s a clamshell? Fuck off you British idiot.”</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> The weird bits are included in 5 games that aren’t that good and everyone moves on.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> We should post this chat, lightly edited as a VG chat for tomw morning/later today.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bring me that horizon.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Yakuza series has no shortage of weird and wonderful games. From the serious but goofy at times mainline entries to its plethora of historical spinoffs, prequels, and side stories. There’s something for everyone here, really. Whether you’re looking for the next installment in the long running Like a Dragon series, or just want to play something a little different, our last hands-on with Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii ahead of release suggests that it’s shaping up to be another solid spin-off that will plunder dozens of hours from you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag dropped way back in 2013, I’ve been itching for another worthy pirate adventure. While there have been a few decent attempts released since then, none of them managed to capture my attention and made me excited to get to pirating until I got the chance to play Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. At first glance, Pirates and Yakuza may seem like a combination that’s about as compatible as oil and water. But upon closer inspection, Like a Dragon’s world, eccentric main character, and not too overly serious presentation makes for a surprisingly competent and fun pirate adventure. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Combat Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii you assume the role of longtime series favorite Goro Majima after he loses his memory and winds up on an Hawaiian island. From everything I saw during my few hours of hands-on time, the series’ weirdness is cranked up to 11 here. Outside of beating up roving gangs of pirates and the occasional bounty with my small tiger companion, I found myself recruiting a wide assortment of weirdos to my pirate crew, playing a plethora of fun and surprisingly addicting minigames – such as a home run derby, karaoke, and sailing the pacific ocean in my pirate ship, complete with ship-to-ship combat and aggressive weather. To put it bluntly, there’s a lot to do here. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Island Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During my preview I spent a lot of time in the pirate city of Madlantis, an area overrun by pirates, criminals, and some genuinely strange people even by Yakuza’s standards. I was able to participate in numerous minigames and side activities such as claw games, ports of classic SEGA arcade games like Virtua Fighter, and the Pirates’ Coliseum, an area where I was able to engage in ship-to-ship combat to battle it out with an assortment of unique pirate crews, as well as other combat-based minigames. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of combat, in main gameplay, it strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style. Majima has two fighting styles: Mad Dog and Sea Dog. While both fighting styles are rooted in the standard “heavy and light attack mixed in with dodges” formula, both styles play differently enough that I found myself swapping between them in order to keep the momentum on my side and deal out as much damage as possible. In Mad Dog mode, Majima will don his familiar getup and use a plethora of fast combos to quickly dispatch an enemy. Sea Dog, on the other hand, has Majima wearing a pirate getup and relies on pirate-themed weaponry such as two cutlass swords, a pistol, and a grappling hook. While Mad Dog was fun to play, the majority of my combat time was spent in Sea Dog due to its diverse assortment of weapons and abilities. Regardless of what fighting style I had selected, though I found myself having a ton of fun beating up dozens of rival pirates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It strays away from the JRPG turn based style of the two previous Like a Dragon games in favor of a more traditional beat-’em-up combat style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say combat didn’t have its shortcomings, though. Blocking and dodging took a bit of practice to get used to, and the enemies can range from a total pushover to a challenge that had me seeing the game over screen more times than I had expected to in a Yakuza game. Still, once I figured out how to effectively switch between fighting styles and take advantage of every tool and ability I had available, the combat became a challenging but rewarding experience. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Sail</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Naval combat is a welcome addition to the Like a Dragon universe. While some games tend to over complicate ship combat, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii goes with a “less is more” approach to its maritime warfare sections. My ship had a few methods of destroying enemy vessels the port side of my pirate ship was donned with short-range flamethrowers that could deal immense damage as long as I was close to my target, while the starboard side of my ship was equipped with long-range cannons. Firing off these two options in addition to the front-facing machine guns is how I spent most of my time in ship-to-ship combat. The third option was to leave the helm of my ship and use Majima’s rocket launcher. While this didn’t do as much damage as the other options, it was pretty fun to jump around my boat and take pot shots at enemy ships. Regardless of which method I chose to engage in, I found myself having fun drifting my boat around and sinking enemy vessels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on everything I’ve played so far, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is definitely shaping up to not only live up to the high standards of the Like a Dragon series, but it also has the potential to become one of the better pirate games released since Black Flag. With its fun and creative combat, intuitive ship warfare, and genuinely interesting and wacky world, you’re going to want to pack your Hawaiian shirt.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even better if you're a fan of Sonic: Ever since the Switch arrived in 2017, Sega has worked like clockwork to consistently release Sonic games for the hybrid console. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> out on Switch alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-sonic-the-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> in theaters, it's safe to say Sega's speedster is bigger than ever. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-finally-reveals-its-next-gen-console-confirms-switch-2-name">Switch 2 has been officially announced</a>, it's pretty much guaranteed more Sonic games are on the way. Thankfully, the Switch 2 trailer confirms the system's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-officially-almost-fully-backward-compatible">backwards compatibility</a>, so your existing Sonic games aren't going anywhere. For anyone looking to check out the modern era of Sonic (and friends), here are all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-sonic-games">Sonic the Hedgehog games</a> you can play right now as well as upcoming Sonic games we expect to see on the Switch 2. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Many Sonic Games Are There on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A total of <strong>nine Sonic games have been released for Nintendo Switch</strong>. This spans the first year of the system back in 2017 to the most recent game, Sonic x Shadows, released in October 2024. Keep in mind that this list below does not include the games available with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p><div catalogid="6381d2be-7f83-4285-91f2-acb37fdd2982" id="213268"><div id="213268" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic x Shadow Generations</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Sonic Game Released on the Switch (in Release Order)</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Mania (2017)</h3><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/thumbs/userUploaded/2017/8/14/sonicmania1280-1502683395450.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sonic Games: Sonic Mania</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review">Sonic Mania</a> was developed by PagodaWest Games and Sonic fangame community member Christian Whitehead as a love letter to the classic Sonic the Hedgehog titles released on the Sega Genesis and Sega CD platforms. Taking place after the events of Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, the game remixes eight iconic levels, including Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant Zone, and introduces five new ones, including the glamorous Studiopolis Zone and the peaceful Press Garden Zone. This game also introduces a new troupe of Eggbots called the Hard-Boiled Heavies for Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to beat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mania is considered one of the best Sonic games of the 2010s because of the experiment in allowing a group of Sonic fans to create a game other Sonic fans would love, the vivid neon graphics, and the new challenges present in every stage.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic Forces (2017)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/11/sonic-forces-review">Sonic Forces</a> makes Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic form a resistance against Dr. Eggman after he conquered most of the world alongside Infinite, a masked jackal who uses the Phantom Ruby to create doppelgangers and warp reality. The game switches gameplay modes between third-person Boost gameplay with Modern Sonic, side-scrolling gameplay with Classic Sonic, and a mode with the custom avatar character, which can be any animal you want, whose weapons use Wisp power-ups. Forces’ writing and lighting aren’t exactly the best in the series, but the game is still tolerable for some people.</p><div id="197171" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sonic Forces</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Team Sonic Racing (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/17/team-sonic-racing-review">Team Sonic Racing</a> takes racing games to a whole new level by having players race <em>with</em> each other, not <em>against</em> each other. This game has a cooperative gameplay mechanic similar to Splatoon and Overwatch, using Sonic Heroes as a frame of reference, where you play in teams of three characters and work together to win each race, paying very close attention to your teammates’ performance and sharing Wisp power-ups with them to allow them to speed up and pull your ranks. Since most of the karts are sports cars, you can customize them with gold rims and paint your car any color you want West Coast Customs style.</p><div id="181380" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2 Games Sonic Mania + Team Sonic Racing</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 (2019)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Released a year before the real-life Tokyo Olympic Games was scheduled to begin (only to be postponed to 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/05/mario-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-review">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020</a> brings the platform rivalry between the jolly red plumber, the speedy blue hedgehog, and their respective friends back to the world stage with new events, like surfing, skateboarding, karate, and sport climbing, and bonus features.

                <p dir="ltr">After countless leaks and rumors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Nintendo finally formally unveiled the Switch 2</a> with a surprise video today on social media. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-bigger-is-nintendo-switch-2-heres-our-first-size-comparison/1100-6528851/">The hybrid console is bigger</a>, has magnetic Joy-Cons, and yes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">a new Mario Kart is seemingly on the way</a>. However, this reveal comes across as overly corporate, bland, and lacking a basic sense of joy that should accompany the introduction of a brand-new video game system.</p><p dir="ltr">There isn't a human in sight for the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. Instead, the majority of the two-and-a-half minute video features an off-white background and CGI animation to showcase how Switch 2 differs from the original Switch. Clearly, Nintendo doesn't want <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wii-u-is-not-a-peripheral-nintendo-reminds-shoppers/1100-6416840/">a Wii U situation on its hands</a>, spelling out clearly that Switch 2 isn't some add-on to the original and will replace the previous system. However, the teaser feels too much like a basic upgrade trailer--way too similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izljcyvozig">the New Nintendo 3DS XL first look</a>, for example--than shouting out Switch 2 is the next generation of Nintendo gaming.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1914440195" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

However, that reveal trailer feels so much more full of life (thanks to actual people being present) and creativity than what we experienced today. The Switch introduction video begins with a man playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on his TV screen, before quickly snapping to the Switch logo and to show how he can take the system on the go. The hook of the system is showcased up front as the guy brings the Switch with him to take his dog to a park in the early morning. While unconfirmed, if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> works or even has better visuals on Switch 2, maybe showing that anticipated game on Switch 2 could have provided a similar sense of awe or at least an idea of the system's technical prowess.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, Nintendo presents all of the various ways the Switch can be utilized, whether on an airplane or even during a rooftop party. This reveal trailer also sees actual people interacting with and using the system--something that isn't present at all with the Switch 2 first look. Nintendo also sprinkles in a handful of third-party games with the original Switch, giving a better idea at what's on the way for the system. For instance, this was when we learned that Skyrim would come to the console. Now, for context, third-party support had absolutely cratered on Wii U, so the company needed to convey that partners were on board with Switch. However, it would have been nice for Nintendo to give third parties the option to tease their games with Switch 2 instead of only vague Mario Kart footage. Showing that Fortnite will, in fact, work on Switch 2 seems like a no-brainer and easy win.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="77104904" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

last third of Switch's unveiling is where Nintendo really flexes its muscles compared to what we see with Switch 2. The Switch unveiling not only shares gameplay footage of what ends up being Super Mario Odyssey, but also offers up a teaser for Splatoon 2 (though people were unsure it was a full sequel at the time). Once again, with Switch 2, Nintendo presents a pretty uninspired glimpse at a new Mario Kart--presumably Mario Kart 9. Of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-nintendo-best-selling-game-of-all-time/1100-6523297/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is basically Nintendo's best-selling game ever</a>, so if Switch 2 launches with a new entry, it will do gangbusters. But the presentation behind this could have been injected with at least a little bit of fun or at the very least highlight how this new Mario Kart will be unique. (Eagle-eyed fans believe 24 racers can compete at one time, and Donkey Kong seems redesigned to more closely resemble his appearance in the New Super Mario Bros. Movie.)</p><p dir="ltr">The most intriguing part of the Switch 2 unveiling relates to what appears to be optical sensors in each new Joy-Con. Nintendo then has a small segment where the controllers seem like they're ice-skating across a surface, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+mouse+controls+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">possibly hinting that Switch 2 will feature mouse-like controls</a>. If true, why not shout out to everyone that there is new functionality behind the Joy-Cons for Switch 2? Why only point out the magnetic aspect? To me, showing mouse-like controls on Switch 2 with something like a new Mario Paint, Mario Maker, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, or even an old game like Minecraft would have added a bit more wonder and excitement to this reveal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to wave away complaints and claim Nintendo will sell boatloads of Switch 2 systems regardless. But first impressions matter. Has Nintendo given up on expanding the video game user base? Because this video implies that to me. Nothing about Switch 2 looks revolutionary or particularly refreshing. Instead, this is more of the same. Maybe that's all that's needed: not rocking the boat on a system that people already love.</p><p dir="ltr">But Nintendo, historically, has struggled when the company gets conservative and complacent. So far, Switch 2 seems way too safe. That said, with a Switch 2 Direct coming on April 2, there is plenty of time to build up the hype train.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">finally revealed the Switch 2</a> — but it didn’t reveal everything. Even still, the new console looks pretty much like a bigger, more refined Switch. Sure, that’s the straightforward and expected move from Nintendo. But it’s also exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p><p>The first Switch was a revelation. When it launched, I marveled over being able to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> on my TV and then take the console out of the dock and play in handheld mode curled up on the couch. Nintendo absolutely nailed the execution of combining its console and portable expertise into one great device, and ever since, the Switch has been a constant companion at home and while traveling.</p><p>I would have been disappointed if Nintendo messed with what worked for the Switch with the Switch 2. I’m glad it has a bigger screen, one that appears to be even larger than the seven-inch display on the OLED Switch. I’m guessing the taller Joy-Cons will be easier to hold, which could be a massive improvement for my hands, and attaching them from the side looks like it could be easier than sliding them up and down. The second USB-C port on the top will be a <em>very</em> welcome addition for easier charging. And even though I barely used it, the return of the kickstand is great, too — maybe with the Switch 2, I’ll actually bring it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13403924/nintendo-switch-karen-meme-reveal-video">some rooftop parties</a>.</p><p>I also quite like the new black design with accent colors. Sure, it doesn’t pop quite as much as the red and blue Joy-Cons for the original Switch, but I think this design looks elegant with a splash of Nintendo whimsy — I love how colors peek out in different places around the hardware. And there will almost certainly be more color options at launch; Nintendo initially revealed the Switch <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161020005938/en/Nintendo-Switch-World-Premiere-Demonstrates-New-Entertainment-Experiences-from-a-Home-Gaming-System">in gray</a> and later showed off the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2017/170113.html">now-iconic red and blue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo made a great call in making physical <em>and</em> digital Switch games backward-compatible with the Switch 2. (Before today, it was a little unclear if that would be the case.) I’ve spent years building up a large digital Switch library that is filled with incredible games, and while Nintendo says that “certain” games won’t be supported on its new console, I imagine that the vast majority of my favorite Switch games will be playable.&nbsp;</p><p>While Nintendo didn’t reveal any technical specs, we can presume it’s going to be more powerful than the original Switch. And hopefully the new console gives a boost to games that sometimes struggled on the original hardware — as much as I love <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, some performance improvements could make it even better. The same goes for other big games like <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>. Maybe we’ll finally get a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game on the Switch now.</p><p>Yes, there’s a lot we don’t know about the Switch 2. The only official Switch 2 game is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24337198/switch-2-mario-kart-nintendo">a new <em>Mario Kart</em></a>. Nintendo didn’t reveal the console’s UI or say if the console has any improved online features. The video briefly showed a way to use the Joy-Con like a computer mouse, but that could be a barely used gimmick. We don’t know how much it will cost or when in 2025 it will come out.</p><p>That said, because it builds upon the original Switch’s outstanding legacy, it will be a familiar experience. There will be lots of older games to play even if Nintendo doesn’t have many Switch 2 games from the jump. It doesn’t look like Nintendo has switched things up very much — and that’s fine with me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommendshere">Patrick Recommends...<em>Here</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The de-aging stuff in this movie is so bad, and yet...</span></figcaption></figure><p>My wife is not into sad movies. She'll tolerate them, but her bar is usually "is this going to be up for an Oscar?" Beyond that, I'm on my own to swirl around a glass of bourbon and weep as midnight approaches. But I like good cry; <a href="https://medium.com/@patrick.klepek/everything-is-normal-until-it-isnt-111c6959ae7d?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">as I've argued in the past</a>, it's a reminder of raw emotions that have become distant—tolerable, even—with time. <em>Here</em>, the latest from director Robert Zemeckis, has a lot going against it. Zemeckis is broadly a hack these days, enamored with technology over storytelling. (If you've never seen <em>The Polar Express</em> and its terrifying CGI, bless.) </p><p><em>Here</em>, an adaptation of a graphic novel where the camera sits at a fixed point and has us watching a family (and a place) evolve over time, has all the trappings of modern Zemeckis' worst impulses. For the most part, the movie has us watching Tom Hanks and Robin Wright look slightly off. Just use make up, man, or let me imagine what a 16-year-old Tom Hanks looks like. It's fine. Here, it's grotesque. </p><p>But...<em>Here </em>knocked me off my rocker. I'm turning 40 next month, so I'm in a moment where I'm spending time thinking about what's come before, what's coming next. And icky visuals aside, <em>Here</em> lands enough sappy, sentimental punches about what it means to live a life, what it means to have regrets, what it means to imagine a life difference than the one you've experienced. I watched this while on holiday break, where my kids were around me all the time. It got me bad.</p><p>(The less we talk about the movie trying to comment on what it's like to be Black, however, the better. What the hell, Zemeckis?)</p><p>If you, like me, are a sap and enjoy working through a box of issues, check it out.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends%E2%80%A6-30-for-30-lance">Rob Recommends… <em>30 for 30: Lance</em></h2><figure></figure><p>Slowly but surely competitive cycling is moving up the rankings of my favorite sports. But as much as I watch, I always feel like there are tremendous amounts of context I am missing. I don’t fully understand the sport yet, and I always feel like I have just the smallest sense of its history.</p><p>So I decided to watch the documentary ESPN did on Lance Armstrong, who might be the Antichrist of the Tour de France and maybe all of modern cycling. It’s an utterly riveting film, in part because it turns out to be such a stark portrait of an unrepentantly corrupt and self-centered man. That might be the film’s great weakness as well: it’s so focused on Lance that it somehow fails to do justice to the extent of his cheating or the viciousness with which he defended his undeserved reputation. It becomes a psyschodrama about what was going on in the head of an audacious crime boss, and can’t quite stay on top of all the misdeeds or victims he left along the way.</p><p>On the other hand, Armstrong <em>is </em>an incredible figure. He appears to have stumbled into cycling because it was the one sport at which he truly excelled, and it fed his deep desire to dominate and humiliate people via competition. At no point does Armstrong or anyone else talk about his love for cycling, because it’s not clear he even liked it that much. He was from a young age a damaged and cruel person, he excelled at a sport where corruption and cheating were prerequisites for serious high-level competition, and then he improbably survived a metastatic cancer and this miserable person overnight became the inspiring feel-good sports figure of the decade.</p><p>At the outset we’re warned by a lot of the people interviewed as part of the documentary that Lance is a master manipulator, and they think he’ll turn any “tell-all” documentary about himself into an exercise in image rehabilitation. So take what I’m about to say with a grain of salt but I did come away feeling some sympathy for him in this one particular way: he was a corrupt liar, but he was the hero of a corrupt and mendacious age.</p><p>It seems like nobody who knew cycling was every fooled: everyone knew PEDs were widespread in the sport, and while Armstrong was marketing himself as a clean cyclist in a sport that was cleaning up its act, the riders were <em>improving</em> against the times they’d set in years when people had been caught taking drugs. But it was a good story that made a niche sport more popular, that gave American media a clean-cut underdog hero at a time when the United States was losing a pair of increasingly unpopular imperial wars, and that made a lot of brands and businesses a lot of money. Armstrong is justly reviled as a vicious and vindictive cheater, but the documentary raises questions about how much of the fraud he perpetrated on his own. He had lots of partners who were invested in selling his phony heroism, and when he was finally cornered, a lot of those same interested parties helped turn him into a symbol of everything that was rotten in sports.</p><p>You watch this documentary and you see clips of Matt Lauer talking about Armstrong on Today, or you hear about an FDA bureaucrat deciding to make it a mission to expose what Armstrong was up to, or you hear about how his commercial empire collapsed when Nike finally cut ties with him. In victory and disgrace, Armstrong seems to have been the perfect symbol for the comforting fictions Americans are so often fed. First, that a rich and ruthless competitor can have a clean conscience and a heart of gold, and then that in the end the truth will out and justice will be served.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-nobody-understands-playing-cards">Cado Recommends... <em>Nobody Understands Playing Cards</em></h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kY6DmPs4klU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Nobody understands playing cards — not even the experts"></iframe></figure><p>Yeah yeah, I know, it's funny how predictable this is. Sometimes you have to live your truth though and my truth is that I love card games, so I was delighted when last weekend <em>Polygon</em> published this fun video on some of the things that make cards so compelling. Simone de Rochefort et al have done their research on how 52 pieces of thick paper can have such a lasting impact on culture, and take some time to get into some of the math around the probabilities that make a deck of cards such a great source of delicious randomized tension.</p>
