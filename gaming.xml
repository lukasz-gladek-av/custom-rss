			<p>When Telltale Games collapsed in 2018, four developers stepped in to acquire the rights to Sam &amp; Max. Skunkape Games, as they are known, set about rereleasing the Sam &amp; Max series — three seasons each of which was originally released in episodic form, following the sitular dog detective and his&nbsp;lagomorph pal. Now the third and final season has been rereleased, asking once again: “if any one of us could unlock the power of the mind, would we use it to unlock the powers of the infinite… or would we use it to destroy?”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse Remastered! Now available!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzXbwm0P65E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you have played either of the two previous seasons —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/20/sam-max-save-the-world-remastered-switch-review/">Sam &amp; Max Save the World</a> or Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space, you can very quickly guess which one plays out.</p>


<p>If you haven’t had the pleasure, Sam &amp; Max are freelance police. Sam is a cool, calm and collected bipedal dog in a suit. Max is the embodiment of chaos, a hyperkinetic rabbity thing, and — naturally — the President of the US. The have relatively little regard for the law, and pretty much just stroll around performing an overly elaborate and complex set of point-and-click tasks in order to achieve their goals.</p>


<p>At the beginning of Chapter 1 of The Devil’s Playhouse, The Penal Zone, Max picks up a kid’s toy that allows him to see into the future. Little did he know that the Eyes of Yog Sogoth that he just grabbed would also unlock his psychic powers. As the game progresses, he picks up playing cards that grant mindreading, a telephone that transports them to another phone and a rhinoplasty toy that lets them shapeshift — all amusing little plays on what the item does for everyone else, and an insight into the playfulness of Sam &amp; Max creator Steve Purcell’s brain.</p>
<p>The problem is that these Toys of Power are being sought by an evil and powerful space gorilla, General Skun-ka’pe. He lands on your street, tries to claim the toys and even steal Max’s brain so that he can wield the Toys of Power for himself.</p>

<p>What follows is a joyous campaign of puerile humour and anarchistic problem solving. Case in point: when Skun-ka’pe brags to his queen that after locking Sam and Max in an intergalactic prison and blowing it up with an antimatter bomb, “I took care of the&nbsp;Penal Zone in one stroke”. Max walks past and snidely comments on the unfortunate choice of words.</p>
<p>But all of this was true when the game was first released in 2010. So how does 2024’s remaster shape up?</p>
<p>The answer is incredibly well. As with the previous remasters, most of the changes are technical, bringing the graphics from 1024×768 4:3 to high-res 16:9. The lighting, lip sync and audio have all been drastically improved, with the audio in particular shining through. That said, it’s not all just higher resolutions. Character models have been tweaked, new credits and menus have been added and the whole thing feels a little more connected as a result, and closer to Steve Purcell’s original vision. We know this because Skunkape said they had Purcell’s input along the way.</p>

<p>On top of this, a ‘new’ Toy of Power that didn’t make it to the original PC version is now available in the Nutri-Specs, along with a bunch of more spoiler-y additions that we won’t go into.</p>
<p>There’s not really much to complain about here. The intros are still unskippable, and the run button feels like it’s in the wrong place – I still don’t understand why running isn’t the default. Beyond that, there’s minor gripes with trophies not popping on the PS5, but that’s not the end of the world.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Sam and Max: The Devil’s Playhouse is exactly what you want from a remaster. It has been faithfully rebuilt, adding improvements and things that make sense, and tightening the things that were a little leaky. I loved stepping back into Sam’s (lack of) shoes and holding the world to rights as a newly psychic Max. If you don’t mind a bit of juvenile humour, this is still one of the funniest point-and-click adventures I’ve ever played, but a little prettier than I remember.	</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/castaway-review-a-delightful-little-adventure.954828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/castaway-review-delightful-little-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Castaway </em>is a game that wears its inspirations on its sleeve and knows exactly what it wants to be. Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lunark">Canari Games</a> markets it as a short but sweet experience you can complete in a few hours, but those few hours are packed full of wonderful fun.</p>
<p>Washing up on a beach of some forlorn planet, players take control of a nameless protagonist out to rescue his dog from a group of pesky pterodactyls. That's really the gist of the story, but it's all the background info you need to enjoy this experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-pterodactyls.png?itok=BgsQz19E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-pterodactyls.png?itok=vw_KTQ6Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Man, don't you hate it when pterodactyls kidnap your dog?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Castaway</em>'s Island of Adventure.</h2>
<p>Developer Johan Vinet explains <em>Castaway</em> as two mini-games in one, and that's a great descriptor. <em>Castaway</em> is split into two segments, the first of which is a brief island adventure, and the second acting as a subdued roguelite dungeon crawl through a perilous 50-floor dungeon.</p>
<p>The first portion of this adventure tasks players with rescuing their kidnapped companion. The island you explore is pretty small but very dense, meaning no enemy or obstacle is there to waste your time. Over the course of an hour or so, players gather new equipment to aid in their adventure, like a pickaxe and a grappling hook device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-hook.png?itok=pozsp_aA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-hook.png?itok=IoYj4Iba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Hook onto that rock and a gap is no longer perilous!</figcaption></figure><p>Along with your sword, these items work exactly as you'd expect. Both the overworld and the three dungeons players explore take advantage of these tools to the fullest, often involving simple sokoban puzzles (aka moving blocks around). These are largely easy to understand and shouldn't inhibit your progress, but it's still gratifying when you solve a puzzle.</p>
<p>Venturing from the overworld into a dungeon will put your equipment to the test. Using your pickaxe can crack open rocks and the hook shot allows you to travel across gaps. Of course, <em>Castawa</em><em>y</em>'s overworld and dungeons feature a few enemy types as well, and the combat is your standard one-button sword slash a la <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening"><em>Link</em>'s <em>Awakening</em></a>.</p>
<p>At the end of each dungeon is a boss battle to shake things up a bit. On the base difficulty, even bosses will pose no threat to players with even a moderate amount of experience in 2D, dungeon-crawling games. Nonetheless, you can take things up a notch by increasing the difficulty to Unfair, which gives you one heart and that's it -- get hit, you're dead for good.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-dungeon-1.png?itok=yLn9GMsv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-dungeon-1.png?itok=d0sO_E0N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>One of those rocks is not like the others.</figcaption></figure><p>Conversely, you can test your skills with the Speedrun mode and, if you're finding things difficult, Invincible and Pacifist modes. The former is exactly as it sounds, making you impervious to damage, while the latter removes enemies altogether.</p>
<p>These modes are a really neat inclusion because the audience for <em>Castaway</em> is meant for all ages and by including such modes, you could hand the controller to a child and they would have a blast. It's such an endearing notion that this may be a kid's first game, and I'm sure they'd love it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-tower.png?itok=DCC8JkJr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-tower.png?itok=g87q02XC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>The tower's rooms are small, but they can be densely packed.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Towering Challenge in <em>Castaway</em></h2>
<p>Of course, if things seem a little too easy in the island adventure, there's also a 50-floor dungeon to power through. This doesn't have a difficulty mode, so you're more likely to be challenged here than anywhere else. The goal is to get to the top and beat the final boss battle, but that's easier said than done: die and you're back to the foot of the tower.</p>
<p>You're still equipped with the usual equipment for the tower, but it does strip you of two of your four hearts, making the stakes a bit higher. Thankfully, there's a level-up system in place that allows players to improve as they climb.</p>
<p>Killing enemies on floors of the tower drops gold, and that's used to fund your new upgrades. Upgrades range from increasing your sword or pickaxe's damage to adding more health. Survivability was a priority for me, so I opted for more hearts as well as armor that would take a hit without taking actual damage -- it would remove my armor, but that'd replenish on the next floor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-upgrades.png?itok=4mAlhLSG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-upgrades.png?itok=qf2gfN1x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Upgrades are simple, and they'll make your life easier.</figcaption></figure><p>The first few times you climb the tower, things can get a little tricky. Spike traps and cleverly placed enemies are in the way and you might even get overwhelmed by foes if you're not careful. I constantly weighed my options as I lost more health -- all level-ups offer the ability to heal, but the trade-off is not getting an upgrade to your equipment. Hard choices must be made!</p>
<p>This mode is purely combat-based, though, which might not be as fun for some. I would have preferred to see a few puzzles thrown into the mix since the island adventure ends so soon. Though it'll probably take two or so hours after a few attempts of climbing, it can feel a tad repetitive seeing the same floors and having it be 100 percent combat.</p>
<p>Floors are also bite-sized, though, so it's not a terrible burden at the end of the day. However, I did get soft-locked a few times by getting stuck on a tile and some enemies bugged into the wall, causing me to reset. That repetition can get frustrating, but it isn't a dealbreaker when the rest of the experience is pleasurable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/castaway-spikes.png?itok=l6v8P3J4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/castaway-spikes.png?itok=mYmaE6FA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>Watch your step!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Castaway </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Castaway</em> is one of 2024's most charming games. The passion from Canari Games is quite evident in the final product, and though it's a short experience with only a few slight frustrations near the end, it's an adventure anyone can enjoy. Whether you're nostalgic for the past or want something to distract you for the weekend, <em>Castaway</em>'s got you covered.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Castaway doesn't reinvent the wheel, nor does it intend to. What Canari Games set out to do is to create a rock solid, short-but-sweet experience, and this endearing adventure game achieves just that. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <p>Any gags I could make about an update that lets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer </a>3’s dawi play tall are far too obvious for the discerning comedic palette that brought you such bangers as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overkills-the-walking-dead-review">that time I just wrote “(penis)” a bunch</a> so the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overkills-the-walking-dead">Overkill’s Walking Dead</a> page wouldn’t quote me out of context, so let’s just dive right in to the details. The strategy game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-3-teases-new-content-this-month-and-a-hotfix-ensures-goblins-will-now-get-dismembered-correctly">5.2 update is on the horizon</a>, and tagging along with it are the first of the “extra bits” the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/colossal-squigs-all-but-confirmed-for-next-total-war-warhammer-3-dlc-plus-big-new-toys-for-ogres-and-khorne">team teased in June</a>. I’m very excited about them. They sit somewhere between the usual patch fare of stat tweaks and errata, and the weightier faction facelifts that come alongside paid DLC. They’re also focused right where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii-immortal-empires">Immortal Empires</a> needs them the most: depth, rather than width. In the dawi’s case, quite literally.</p>

<p>You can find the full breakdown of the three headline features <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/29-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-2-dev-blog">here</a>. But, broadly, there are updates for both chaos and the dwarves, plus “unusual locations”  - a sort of fleshed-out set of landmarks which you’ll discover as you explore the map. One of the examples given is a Bretonnian holy site called “Grail Knight’s Grave”. Initially, owning the settlement gives a small bonus to control and corruption, as well as some holy horse-fanciers for your garrison. When control is over 75, any characters in the region have a chance to gain a tantalising <em>mystery trait. </em> The blog doesn’t reveal this trait, but I hope it’s <a href="https://youtu.be/onxTQx8aPZA">cow-buchet</a> related.</p>
<p>There are a few more teasers shown off, but I’m mainly enthusiastic about what design director Mitchell Heastie has to say here. He’s “a huge fan of worldbuilding content in games,” and says that he’s “always wanted to make the world feel a bit more alive - this is hopefully a start to doing more for both of those things.” Again, Immortal Empires is already irresponsibly massive and stuffed with more units than any reasonable person can keep track of. It’s these fertile embellishments that elevate it from a map to a world.</p>

<p>Next up is a rework to chaos cults, long maligned for feeling far too flat and lifeless to represent the hives of corrupted activity they’re intended to be. “Ultimately the fantasy is that Cults create the corruption, not the other way around,” says Heastie. They’ll no longer spring up in corrupted areas - it’ll now be the task of cultists belonging to all four monogods to set them up, which was previously just a Slaanesh thing. The cult magus is a new campaign-only character that specialises in setting up unique cults that offer more options. You’ll get access to the magus through upgrading standard chaos cults.</p>
<p>I’m not initially sold on the idea of stripping away an entire method of spreading cults, but Slaanesh’s exponential cult play is really engaging, so I can see this working well. The cults themselves look much more interactive and varied, too. They’ll now be a version of the skaven undercity archetype, with various resource-sapping buildings and a few devastating rituals. Khorne’s leader teleportation is now available to each of the four gods, for example.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s a new Dwarf feature named ‘the deeps’, for dawi fans that want to play tall. After shelling out a pile of cash, you’ll be able to expand your settlements into the earth, giving you unique buildings and more slots to play with. There’s some lovely flavour you’ll discover as you dig(gy diggy hole), too, like blocked tunnels and “some stranger things you can discover in the Deeps.” Here’s a nifty one from the new ‘guild foundries’ building: “+5% settlement income per turn count”. I’ve not seen that one before across the whole game. So that’s 500% income on turn 50, presumably? Say short again. Go on.</p>
<p>The blog also mentions an update to Cathay’s ivory road, although doesn’t go into detail just yet. I’m really into the deeps specifically, but the real prize here is knowing the team have reached a place where they’re ready to start experimenting with these smaller, flavourful additions between paid expansions. Heastie described this as “pushing our own expectations for what new content for the game could be, to always be on the lookout for what special idea we could do next.” There’s obviously an incentive with these things to sound passionate, but this feels genuine to me.  If so, I’m chuffed that the team feel they’re in a good spot. Fair warning, though, the dawi are going to be unbearably smug fuckers about all this.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The mountain biking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lonely-mountains-downhill">Lonely Mountains: Downhill</a> was sometimes a relaxing ride down gentle slopes, and at other times a hairy hurtle down declivitous cliffs. Alongside the likes of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/descenders">Descenders</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, it offered a more laid-back game, open to furious time trialling but always remembering to let you stop and appreciate the view. Both the stakes and the poly count were low. Happy news then, that it is getting a snowy sequel. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lonely-mountains-snow-riders">Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</a> you'll be swapping your bike for a pair of skis, and you'll be able to barrel down the mountainside with friends in co-op.</p>

<p>That looks just right. I seem to remember the camera in the first game always following the action from the front, but it looks like this time the view will sometimes let you look ahead. Probably for the best. I've broken enough bones in life already, thank you. </p>
<p>"Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is a game about skiing down gorgeous mountain vistas. Slice through deep snow, skitter over ice lakes, and leap into the air in spectacular jumps," say developers Megagon Industries on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/">the Steam page</a>. The other big change is that the game will allow for up to 8 players to race one another online, or tackle a mountain together in a chill-sounding co-op mode, "adding save points as you go". </p>
<p>That latter feature sounds quite tranquil. At least one screenshot shows eight players sitting together on the snowy banks of a cold lake, which suggests the hidden "resting places" of the original game are returning. As much as I enjoy a good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a>, it'd be sweet to stop and enjoy these vistas with pals. It may also make Alice O happy - she thought these resting spots were pretty darn pleasant.</p>
<p>"Yet the greatest reward of exploration isn't speed, it's outright stopping," she said as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lonely-mountains-downhill-goes-murderously-fast-but-appreciates-a-beautiful-view">part of her tour of cycling games</a>. "At hidden 'resting places', you can press Y to have your character dismount for a nice sit-down. They pick somewhere scenic to stretch their legs, shake out their arms, and take in the view. It is wonderful."</p>
<p>An exact release date hasn't been shared yet, but Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders is due out sometime in 2024, we're told.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-pay-to-win-elements-no/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/delta-force-pay-to-win-elements-will-%E2%80%98absolutely-not%E2%80%99-be-a-thing.954816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-pay-to-win-elements-no/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent AMA on Reddit, Delta Force: Hawk Ops’ development team answered some key and pressing questions about the future of the free-to-play shooter. It recently launched into an alpha phase and, by all accounts, has been turning heads simply because it plays so nicely. </p>



<p>It might look like a Battlefield rip-off on the surface, but it has plenty of weapons, well-designed maps, and a solid gameplay loop that keeps you engaged for a good while. One of the things that prospective fans were eager to know about was the future of microtransactions in Delta Force, which the developer was quick to address.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-clear-standard">A Clear Standard</h2>



<p>In the recent AMA, which was dug up <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/delta-force-hawk-ops-will-absolutely-not-have-pay-to-win-elements-new-season-incoming-every-2-3-months-name-change-considered" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by MP1st</a>, Team Jade’s ‘ShadowGuo’ spoke decisively about ‘pay-to-win’ mechanics in Delta Force: Hawk Ops. When asked if users will be able to exchange real-world money for in-game components that are considered pay-to-win, the developer said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can promise that this will&nbsp;<strong>absolutely not happen</strong>&nbsp;– this is a clear standard that we wanted to set for our game. The primary content we offer for our players to purchase includes weapon skins, character cosmetics, and battle passes. Our large-scale Havoc Warfare mode has no pay-to-win elements. We also promise that Tekniq Alloy and equipment in Hazard Ops will never be sold – they must be earned through gameplay, participating in events, or trading with other platers in the auction house.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team also stressed that ‘all multiplayer content’ will be free to experience, with nothing being locked behind a paywall.</p>



<p>That could be a slight dig at Battlestate Games, which recently released the ‘PvE mode’ in Escape from Tarkov and proceeded to lock it behind a purchase requirement. It’s also a shot at MoreFun Studios, which just pushed Arena Breakout: Infinite into early access. It was quickly discovered by users that many elements of ABI are considered pay-to-win.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1er6s48/delta_force_hawk_ops_dev_here_ask_me_anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the AMA on Reddit</a>, the team touched on plenty of topics. It was mentioned that the game’s name might change based on community feedback, audio elements are being worked on as the alpha unravels, and in-game ‘seasons’ should be delivered every two to three months.</p>



<p>Have you played the Delta Force alpha yet?</p>

            <p>
Japanese airline ANA has revealed a new plane safety video starring a variety of Pokémon.
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon brand has a long-standing relationship with ANA, and has adorned several of its jets with Pokémon characters over the past few decades. But this safety video is the first of its kind - and it's worth a watch to see numerous Pokémon getting to grips with good airline etiquette.
</p>
<p>
While Pikachu and Pichu are the stars, of course, you'll also see a mildly disturbing Jigglypuff scold a man for vaping, Mr Mime appear to mime safety instructions, and Floatzle turn up to demonstrate its own in-built life vest.

<p>
Meanwhile, Machoke not fastening his seatbelt over his 'pants' is likely going to open up the debate about whether he's wearing clothes or not again...
</p>
<p>
You'll only see the video if you're travelling on ANA's specially-decorated Pikachu and Eevee jets, which fly from Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports to a range of around two dozen destinations, mainly in Australia, North America and Asia. There's just one European route - to and from London's Heathrow. Or you can watch via YouTube above.

<p>It has just been announced that Blacknut Cloud Gaming has partnered with Ubisoft in a fresh distribution-focused agreement. This means that some of Ubisoft’s games will wind up on the Blacknut platform, which at present offers subscribers more than 500 games to stream at will.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-clouds">In The Clouds</h2>



<p>Cloud gaming has been coming up in recent years, and many providers and operators have made their way into the concept of streaming games online. </p>



<p>Most recently, it seemed as though Xbox was making a push into ‘not needing’ a home console to play the best games by leaning on the streaming platform provided as part of Game Pass.</p>



<p>PlayStation has a cloud-based service, as does Nvidia and Amazon, and there’s even Antstream, a retro-focused streaming service.</p>



<p>Blacknut Cloud Gaming has been in the market for a while and has been working on expanding the library available to subscribers. This latest move will see Ubisoft’s games crop up on the platform. In a statement, Ubisoft’s Chris Early spoke on the deal:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Blacknut’s premium cloud infrastructure, broad reach, and device compatibility have made them a force in the cloud gaming market and will help bring Ubisoft’s many gaming universes to more players. This is just the beginning of our partnership, and we look forward to sharing more soon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been confirmed that the likes of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry will appear on Blacknut’s cloud streaming platform soon. In a statement celebrating the partnership, Blacknut’s CEO, Olivier Avaro, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bringing Ubisoft games to our platform represents a significant milestone in our growth strategy. We’re excited to offer our users an unparalleled gaming experience with one of the industry’s most iconic publishers, and some of the world’s most emblematic franchises. This endeavour significantly enhances our current offerings and we are excited to continue scaling our partnership with Ubisoft, both as a B2C distributor and for our global partnerships in the months to come.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Have you invested in a cloud gaming platform yet, or are you not interested?</p>

			<p>Once again, rumors have begun swirling about the next Xbox first-party game to be ported to PlayStation 5, and it might be one of the most iconic (albeit niche): Microsoft Flight Simulator.</p>
<p>Yesterday, leaker extas1s <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> it would be Forza Horizon 5. However, an earlier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1etc9z9/the_next_xbox_port_will_be_flight_sim_according/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from January had mentioned Microsoft Flight Simulator, and it was right about everything it shared at the time.</p>
<p><em>Xbox will probably announce its multiplatform plans late next month or right before the fiscal year ends. ID Software's next game is no longer an Xbox exclusive and will be multiplatform. Bethesda's next few games that were exclusive have also been pushed to be multiplatform instead.</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator will be multiplatform, and a few other older 1st party games are also going to be multiplatform. Indiana Jones is a little weird cause he's modeled after Harrison Ford to the full extent but being voiced by Troy Baker. Most of the game is also 1st person, including whip combat.</em> <em>And Hideo Kojima is finally making a movie.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages turned out to be multiplatform, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a first-person game (except for rare instances during environmental interaction) with Harrison Ford's likeness and Troy Baker's voiceover. A few days after the leak, PlayStation also announced a partnership with Hideo Kojima on a new stealth IP called <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Physint</a>, which will include the production of a game and a movie.</p>
<p>If the leaker is right about Microsoft Flight Simulator, too, the question then becomes whether the 'old' 2020 game would be ported or the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new</a> installment that is slated to launch on November 19. This new entry features several new mission types, new aircraft types, more environmental features (snow and tornadoes), a full-fledged season system, improved physics, better performance with multithreading, and even the ability to step out of the plane and walk around the environments, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/flight-simulator-2024s-huge-ambition-means-you-can-now-exit-the-plane-walk-around-you-can-land-on-every-ship-and-it-looks-like-a-first-person-shooter-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> recently to PC Gamer.</p>
<p>Whether Microsoft Flight Simulator or Forza Horizon 5 gets to PlayStation 5 first, Xbox's multiplatform policy suggests both will eventually make it and if Sea of Thieves' success is anything to go by, they might thrive, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Exoborne Gameplay Trailer Reveals An Intense, Energetic Extraction Experience]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exoborne-gameplay-trailer-released/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exoborne-gameplay-trailer-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Exoborne’s gameplay trailer is finally here, and it showcases a perfectly intense and high-octane extraction shooter experience that’s bursting at the seams with action-oriented sequences and futuristic combat elements. </p>



<p>In the short but punchy trailer, we get a glimpse at the upcoming first- and third-person shooter that fuses unpredictable weather patterns with high-tech exoskeletons to present an extraction shooter experience like no other.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-master-the-apocalypse">Master The Apocalypse</h2>



<p>Exoborne is a promising, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter set in a world torn apart. Players enter a series of environments armed to the teeth with technology, weapons, and abilities, seeking high-value rewards and loot, which they’ll then try to extract before the world around them becomes too much to bear.</p>



<p>It’s a PvPvE shooter, so it operates similarly to Escape from Tarkov and other extraction shooters, but it’s so much more intense and action-oriented.</p>



<p>Here’s the Exoborne gameplay trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Exoborne - Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehaixwsBHVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Players will be invited to explore expansive environments, making use of their traversal abilities to cut across the territory as efficiently as possible. They’ll be able to lean on vehicles, high-powered weapons, and a string of abilities including boost packs, grapple hooks, and deployable shields to ensure their survival.</p>



<p>Presently, the extraction shooter genre tends to lean towards slower-paced, realistic, and more ‘simulation-like’ elements than it does balls-to-the-wall action mechanics. Exoborne could be the disruptive title that shakes up the genre with reckless abandon.</p>

<p>Meta has finally confirmed that it’s shelving the GTA San Andreas VR project. After months of speculation that have unravelled more than three years after the team announced a VR remake of San Andreas, it has been put on indefinite hold as the company pivots to focus on other projects.</p>



<p>Despite the game having been in development for several years, it has been brought to a sudden and decisive stop by Meta, marking a disappointing confirmation for VR fans everywhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grove-street-home">‘Grove Street… Home’</h2>



<p>I don’t like VR games at the best of times, but I would have played the heck out of GTA San Andreas VR. Imagine it – hopping on a BMX and cycling down into Grove Street, walking around the Johnson house, and performing brutal drive-bys against the opps. It would have been a fantastic way to experience <strong>again </strong>one of the best games ever made.</p>



<p>In a statement posted to YouTube, the Meta Quest team confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>GTA: San Andreas is on hold indefinitely while we both focus on other projects. We look forward to working with our friends at Rockstar in the future.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s it – it’s the end of the era. It was back in 2021 that the Meta Quest team announced it was working on San Andreas VR, but by today, no solid gameplay or even screenshots of the game have surfaced, suggesting they didn’t get too far with the project.</p>



<p>Would you have played a GTA San Andreas VR remake if it had surfaced?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-horror-game-gets-new-story-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The horror game Slitterhead just received a new story trailer. Developed by Bokeh Game Studio (founded by former Silent Hill co-creator Keiichiro Toyama), Slitterhead is <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-gets-gameplay-trailer-pc-specs-and-november-8-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> to launch on November 8 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slitterhead - Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4EENlMq23sE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's a detailed overview provided by Bokeh Game Studio, which is self-publishing Slitterhead:</p>
<p><em>Set in the cluttered streets of Kowlong, a city filled with darkness and chaos, this combat action-adventure game casts the player as "Hyoki," a being without memory or physical form. His sole motive is to eradicate the monstrous creatures known as "Slitterheads" that crawl through the city disguised as humans.</em></p>
<p><em>As players roam the vibrant, neon-lit cityscape, they must find allies among the humans known as "Rarities," infiltrate and track down dangerous organizations, and engage in battles harnessing the power of blood. As the suspenseful drama unfolds, delve into the mystery behind Hyoki's existence and the appearance of the Slitterheads.</em></p>
<p><em>The entity known as "Hyoki" finds himself wandering amidst the chaos of Kowlong, plagued by the enigmatic monsters known as "Slitterheads" that mimic humans. Though robbed of all memories, he has a single-minded purpose: to exterminate every last Slitterhead. Infiltrating the city, he embarks on a mission to hunt down those who have been hiding in human society.</em></p>
<p><em>Without a physical form, Hyoki's ability allows him to possess and control human bodies at will, turning those who wander the city into his pawns. With this power, he can pass through barriers, assume the identity of specific individuals, and infiltrate dangerous areas and organizations. He can also move through the city at high speed by quickly changing hosts.</em></p>
<p><em>While human bodies are fragile, Hyoki can burn their life force and turn blood into weapons to fight the ferocious Slitterheads. Even when critically wounded, he can continue to fight by efficiently switching hosts. By possessing "Rarities," special humans who share a high synchronization with Hyoki, he can unleash even more powerful attacks and activate various abilities. The cooperative relationship with these "Rarities" is the key to uncovering the deepest secrets in Kowlong.</em></p>

        <p>They'll be "smaller and more customized" in future</p>

            <p>For years, our PC storage has wobbled and buckled beneath the tyranny of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-defend-modern-warfare-3s-larger-install-size-promising-to-shrink-it-before-launch">gigantic Call Of Duty installs</a>. Like 13th century peasants straining to convey huge, teetering loads of freshly quarried LMGs, our SSDs cry out for justice. Perhaps scenting imminent rebellion and a mass audience desertion to low-poly shooters with more civilised file sizes, Activision have relented. Future installations of the much-padded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will be "smaller and more customised", though in a last cruel stroke of villainy, they want you to download a large update to prepare the ground.</p><!--more-->
<p>Step one for Activision is "decoupling" the free-to-play live service battle royale Call Of Duty: Warzone from other aspects of the Call Of Duty experience. Makes sense - the Venn diagram of audiences for COD campaigns and Warzone isn't a perfectly circular aiming reticule. "When you purchase an annual title, you will only download the files for that game by default," explains <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap">an Activision blog</a>. "On the free-to-play side, players can 'opt-in' to get Call of Duty: Warzone when they're downloading a new annual title or simply download it separately at any point in time."</p>
<p>Step two is "expanding our usage of texture streaming". This will allow the developers to "cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage". The trade-off is that "you may see older content that briefly appears at a lower quality until the streaming cache has fully loaded", but you can always pick the new "Optimised" high fidelity graphics quality setting to spruce up the textures faster. There will also be a "Minimal" graphics quality for people who don't have internet bandwidth to spare.</p>
<p>To "pave the way" for all this, Activision want you to download a Call Of Duty update right now, a couple of weeks before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-early-access-and-open-beta-dates-revealed">the Black Ops 6 beta</a> and a few months ahead of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-a-release-date-for-the-end-of-october-open-beta-on-the-way">Black Ops 6 release date</a>. This will "[reorganise] game files and [add] new tech to prep the way for the full player interface arriving in October". It's a big file, but the developers promise that "this initial download will not permanently add the stated file size to the storage space that Call of Duty takes up on your device". Once you've installed it, you can expect Call Of Duty to take up less space over time.</p>
<p>I've fallen away from Call Of Duty for many reasons, but having to shovel hundreds of gigabytes into my PC each time is definitely a prominent one. On the other hand, I'm not confident my internet connection could handle the increased streaming load. What's your mileage?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>India isn’t the most wide-open region when it comes to video games. Historically, the nation’s government has banned plenty of games, including the likes of Fallout 3, PUBG Mobile, and Free Fire. It maintains an iron-fisted grip on the functionality of certain apps in the country, but all that hasn’t stopped the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, from taking a positive stance on gaming in general.</p>



<p>Speaking recently during the nation’s 78th Independence Day celebrations, the Prime Minister of India made a bold pledge about the future of gaming across the country.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-entire-world">‘To The Entire World’</h2>



<p>Narendra Modi hasn’t ever been the biggest advocate for the gaming industry, but in recent years, he’s drifted a little closer to the concept of it all. </p>



<p>In April, he was snapped playing video games and interacting with some of the biggest influencers and competitive gamers in India, and now, he has made ambitious statements about the future of gaming in the country:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>India has a very rich heritage. We can bring new talent to the world of gaming. I want every Indian child, youth, IT professionals, and AI professionals of India to lead the world of gaming — not just in playing, but also in taking our gaming products to the entire world. We can establish our dominance in the world of animation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>During his recent sit-down with influencers, Mr. Modi played Stumble Guys on mobile and Beat Saber through a VR headset. He also enjoyed Raji, an adventure game built in and propagated throughout India.</p>



<p>Many governments around the world are actively supporting the growth of gaming and esports, welcoming the revenue that this rapidly expanding industry brings. India could be the next power player looking to make an impact on the landscape.</p>

    <p><span>Welcome to Natlan, the sixth major nation of Teyvat.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [116 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn,” will launch on August 28, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. The update will add Natlan, the game’s sixth major nation. <span id="more-906322"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Players will be able to reach the sixth major nation of Teyvat and ally with the warriors of the region, including Kachina, Kinich, and Mualani, as well as the Saurians of Natlan. Set off to discover diverse tribes, landscapes, mysteries, and legends.</p><p>The road to Natlan will open with an unlocked Teleport Waypoint that is accessible to players, even beginners and intermediates, who have completed the Prologue of the Archon Quest in Mondstadt. Known as the Nation of Pyro, Natlan is located west of the Sumeru desert. The people of this nation are divided into six main tribes. The dragons of Natlan, more commonly called Saurians, are the result of a long evolution and have evolved to coexist with humans, and they have even become their faithful companions. With Version 5.0, players will be able to explore three of the six tribes, as well as encounter three types of Saurians who live together with the locals.</p><p>Mastering the abilities of the different Saurians can prove decisive in exploring the towering cliffs and flowing springs, and players can transform into a Saurian by indwelling them. The Tepetlisaurus are Saurians good at tunneling undergrounds and climbing cliffs, and they are the companions of choice for the Children of Echoes who call the canyons their home. The Yumkasaurus can pull themselves in the chosen direction and reach great heights with ease. They have taken up residence among the Scions of the Canopy, a tribe living suspended from the walls of steep cliffs. As for the Koholasaurus, they can move quickly on water and liquid Phlogiston, which explains why they are commonly seen with the People of the Springs near the sea.</p><p>Natlan, also known as the Nation of War, honors her warriors at the Stadium of the Sacred Flame, where the Champion of each tribe is chosen through a tournament. This is where the main story unfolds, as the player, accompanied by local warriors Kachina, Kinich, and Mualani, travel to the Stadium. To begin Natlan’s Archon Quest, players need to reach Adventure Rank 28 and above, and have completed all of Liyue’s Archon Quests.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Natlan warriors are masters of skills and agility that reflect the lifestyle and traditions of their own tribe. Kachina, the four-star Geo polearm wielder from the Children of Echoes, is able to summon Turbo Twirly and ride on it to scale walls and cliffs, and also pound the ground to deal AOE DMG. She can be recruited for free by completing Act I of Natlan’s Archon Quest. Kinich, renowned for his hunting skills in the Scions of the Canopy, is a five-star Dendro warrior equipped with a claymore who wields the grappling hook to perfection, so as to swing and easily reach heights, or to link to enemies and perform powerful Loop Shots. His special companion, Ajaw, can also join the fray, unleashing his dragon breath against foes. Mualani, the watersports shop owner from People of the Springs, is a Hydro five-star catalyst wielder who can mount her reliable Sharky Surfboard and move at full speed on the water surface, liquid Phlogiston, and even on dry land. In combat, when Mualani is moving on her Sharky Surfboard and hits an enemy, she applies a mark and administers Sharky’s Bite, which inflicts more damage after several hits.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_906333"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Although Kachina, Mualani, and Kinich are all capable of locating regional specialties, they have different talents of restoring Stamina, accumulating Phlogiston, or increasing movement speed respectively, which can benefit all party members by interacting with certain harvestable items. However, to take full advantage of the powers and abilities of warriors and Saurians living in the Nation of Pyro, players will need to consume or utilize Phlogiston in different forms wisely. Through a mysterious ritual known as Phlogiston Engravings, the warriors of Natlan can further distinguish themselves in battle thanks to the Nightsoul’s Blessing.</p><p>In Version 5.0’s Event Wishes, Mualani and Kachina will debut in the first phase along with Kaedehara Kazuha’s rerun, and Kinich’s debut will come with the Raiden Shogun in the second half. In the meantime, the stories of Natlan’s three new characters will be available through the Tribal Chronicles, a new three-act quest for each tribe that replace the previous Story <a title="Platforms > Quest [113 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s, to provide a comprehensive experience for players to gain a deeper understanding of the stories, people, and traditions. Players can visit each tribe’s “Obsidian Totem Pole” to start the Tribal Chronicles, as well as their Bounties and Supply Notices to earn Reputation EXP and valuable rewards.</p><p>As the fourth anniversary of <em>Genshin Impact</em> approaches, rewards, and bonuses will be offered to celebrate this event with fans and players during Version 5.0. The special daily login event returns with up to Intertwined Fate ×10 for players to claim, and players can check their in-game mail to receive Primogems ×1,600, two exclusive gadgets “Firstborn Firesprite” and “Kaboom Box,” as well as more bonuses. Furthermore, players can also invite a 5-star character from the Standard Wish lineup to their team for free. More updates on the Character Event Wish, Weapon Event Wish, and a new tool to redeem Artifacts with designated affixes will also arrive in the latest version.</p></blockquote><p>And here is a detailed explanation of Natlan:</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ 1. Three Characters in Natlan</strong></p><p><strong>1.1 Mualani</strong></p><p>Mualani is a five-star Hydro catalyst wielder from People of the Springs. This shiny and hot-hearted girl is a watersports store owner and a fan of multiple water sports, such as swimming, surfing, and beach volleyball. Mualani primarily deals Hydro damage with on-field movement to stack layers.</p><ul><li><strong>Surf to Explore</strong> – Her Elemental Skill makes her mount on her Sharky Surfboard to move on land, water and liquid Phlogiston with a greater speed. In addition, Mualani can surf onto the Spiritways, a flowing Phlogiston track that she can take for a fast trip.</li><li><strong>Surf, Mark, and Bite</strong> – Her Elemental Skill also converts her Normal Attacks into Sharky’s Bite of powerful Hydro damage. By making contact with enemies, Mualani can mark her enemies and gain stacks. Max 3 stacks, Mualani can unleash a reinforced bite with significant damage.</li></ul><p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Mualani" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Btbl2DlhGXI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>1.2 Kinich</strong></p><p>Kinich is a five-star Dendro claymore wielder from Scions of the Canopy. He is a well-known hunter with a special Saurian company, Ajaw.</p><ul><li><strong>Grappling Hook</strong> – With his Elemental Skill, Kinich can use a grappling hook to reach higher places and swing foward consecutively by latching onto Coilgrass Sigils during exploration.</li><li><strong>Loop Shoot</strong> – When using his Elemental Skill in the presence of nearby enemies, Kinich links to the target and initiates loop shots. In this state, he gradually accumulates Nightsoul Points, which, upon reaching their maximum, allow him to unleash a powerful shot, dealing significant Dendro DMG.</li><li><strong>Stand with Dragonlord</strong> – Upon his Elemental Burst, the Saurian buddy of Kinich, Ajaw, will unleash dragonbreaths to deal AoE Dendro DMG.</li></ul><p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Kinich" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zxqfr4jyry0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>1.3 Kachina</strong></p><p>Kachina is a four-star Geo polearm wielder from Children of Echoes.</p><ul><li><strong>Turbo Twirly</strong> – Kachina is able to summon Turbo Twirly and ride it to climb walls and cliffs in daily exploration, and also unleash ground-slam attacks to deal AoE Geo DMG in combat.</li><li><strong>Free to Get in Archon Quest</strong> – By completing the first act of Natlan Archon Quest, you can invite Kachina into your team for free.</li></ul><p><strong>■ 2. Phlogiston and Nightsoul’s Blessing</strong></p><p><strong>2.1 Phlogiston</strong></p><p>In the Nation of Pyro, the Pyro power can be found as a unique resource known as Phlogiston. Phlogiston exists in different forms and can be utilized by the locals as a brand-new resource to in movement and combat. Once you indwell a Saurian, you may notice that skills are consuming a separate Phlogiston bar on the right side of your Saurian body. For Natlan characters, a Phlogiston bar also appears above their health bar. In addition, the constant flowing Phlogiston can form a pathway named Spiritways, where Koholasaurus or People of the Springs can use for fast travels.</p><p><strong>2.2 Nightsoul’s Blessing</strong></p><p>Nightsoul’s Blessing state is unique for characters in Natlan, which will usually increase their mobility and combat abilities. For them, the Elemental Skill is the most convenient way to enter this state, and a Nightsoul bar will show on the left side of the character.</p><p><strong>■ 3. The First Three Tribes in Natlan</strong></p><p><strong>3.1 Children of Echoes</strong></p><p>The Children of Echoes is located in the canyons of northeast Natlan, giving rise to expert miners and talented dancers. There is a large stage that serves as the heart of their entertainment, where locals proudly showcase their dancing skills and passion for the arts.</p><p><strong>3.2 Scions of the Canopy</strong></p><p>If you’re an extreme sports enthusiast or simply want to take in breathtaking views, visit the Scions of the Canopy, the tribe cantilevered over the steep cliffs with cables. People there are highly skilled at navigating through jungles and forests and reaching high places with ease. These abilities make them exceptionally suited for the role of a courier.</p><p><strong>3.3 People of the Springs</strong></p><p>As a laidback tribe known for its hot springs, People of the Springs offers a relaxing vibe with various watersports and music. It’s an ideal place for locals to conquer the waves and enjoy beach volleyball. With the guidance of local guides, more stories and mysteries will be unveiled around this seaside tribe.</p><p><strong>■ 4. Three Types of Saurians and Saurian Indwelling</strong></p><p><iframe title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Baby Saurian" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LgQNYVpVKKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>4.1 Saurian Indwelling</strong></p><p>Saurian Indwelling is a unique transformation mechanism in Natlan. We can roam the land of Natlan in Saurian’s forms by indwelling them or respective Spiritscounces. In Version 5.0, players can indwell three types of Saurians, Teptlisaurus, Yumkasaurus, and Koholasaurus to experience their unique skills.</p><p>Check the video showcase of Indwelling and Saurian’s abilities in media kit –</p><p><em>—Teptlisaurus</em></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Saurian Indwelling - Tepetlisaurus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A3sO5WeTdts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>—Yumkasaurus</em></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Saurian Indwelling - Yumkasaurus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tE8VusI8ud8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>—Koholasaurus</em></p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Genshin Impact - Version 5.0: Saurian Indwelling - Koholasaurus" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3MUK1UFxf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>4.2 Tepetlisaurus</strong></p><p>The Tepetlisaurus can be a good helper of the Children of Echoes, renowned for its mining prowess. This Saurian may aid the tribe in excavating valuable minerals and carving pathways through rugged canyons. When indwelling a Tepetlisaurus, you gain the ability to burrow underground, climb cliffs, and even access hidden tunnels that swiftly transport you to the other side of obstacles.</p><p><strong>4.3 Yumkasaurus</strong></p><p>Beloved by the extreme sports lovers among the Scions of the Canopy, Yumkasaurus demonstrates unparalleled agility in reaching higher terrain. Yumkasaurus possesses a unique organ that drags it into the air with ease. Additionally, when it consumes some Natlan fruits, it can unleash explosive projectiles, making it a reliable force in both combat and exploration.</p><p><strong>4.4 Koholasaurus</strong></p><p>Koholasaurus shares the hot springs and flowing waters of joy and relaxation with the People of the Springs. After indwelling a Koholasaurus, you can take a dip in the hot springs and waters around this seaside tribe. This Saurian even can move on dangerous Liquid Phlogiston and a fast track made by flowing Phlogistons.</p><p><strong>■ 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221374/fortnite-marvel-absolute-doctor-doom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After revealing <em>Fortnite’s</em> Marvel-themed “Absolute Doom” season last weekend, Epic Games is officially kicking off <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5 Season 4 by sharing <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom">a bunch of details</a> about what you can expect when you drop onto the island in battle royale. Spoiler: there’s a lot of Doctor Doom.</p><p>As already shown, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24217825/fortnites-next-marvel-collab-will-be-nothing-less-than-fabulous">Absolute Doom battle pass</a> will feature various heroes and villains you can obtain like War Machine, Gwenpool, and, of course, Doctor Doom himself. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209499/marvel-robert-downey-jr-doomsday-russo-bros-salaries">Timely!</a>) But the battle royale island will also have Doom-themed locations you can visit like the town of Doomstadt and Castle Doom, where you can find Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets to use as weapons. Doom’s gauntlets aren’t the only Marvel-themed weapons available, though; you’ll also be able to find Captain America’s shield, which is making a return from an <em>Endgame</em>-themed mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515617/fortnite-avengers-endgame-limited-time-mode-thanos-infinity-stones-mythic-item">from 2019</a>.</p><p>This is actually <em>Fortnite’s</em> <em>second</em> Marvel-themed season; the previous, which launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man">in August 2020</a>, featured characters like Iron Man, Storm, and another version of Doctor Doom in its battle pass. If you didn’t get the outfits in that battle pass, Epic won’t offer them again, but thankfully, Epic is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215375/fortnite-battle-pass-rewards-back-around-item-shop">changing that policy</a> starting with the pass for Absolute Doom.</p><p>There are also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24218732/honey-wheres-my-fortnite-suit">more Disney crossovers coming to <em>Fortnite</em></a><em>, </em>including three Disney villains and characters from <em>The Incredibles</em>. Given that Disney recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">invested $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a>, I suspect we’ll see a bunch more Disney cameos on the battle royale island at some point — and there’s a whole Disney-themed universe inside <em>Fortnite </em>on the way as well<em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fortnite x Fall Guys Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Chapter 5 Season 4 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in a new Marvel season--its first since 2020--complete with a battle pass full of Marvel icons, new map locations based on the comic book titan's decades of lore, and lots of new weapons.</p><p>But when will that be? Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 4 AM and 7 AM PT / 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, August 16--though there have been some exceptions in the past, usually tied to when a patch takes longer to deploy than Epic anticipated. Still, if all things go smoothly, like they <em>usually</em> do, it'll be on in the early to late morning for US players, or a bit later in the day overseas.</p><p>However, because last season saw some technical difficulties during the patch deployment, <strong>this season's downtime has started earlier than usual</strong>. Thast could mean the new season also launches sooner too. If that's the case, Fortnite may be back online as early as 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.</p><p>Once the game does return, Season 4 will introduce a whole host of changes to the battle royale island, thanks to the Doctor Doom's arrival. Players should expect new bosses, plenty of new weapons, and more secrets to be discovered, both on launch day and throughout the season. Presumably, Chapter 5 Season 4 will also play host to Fortnitemares, the game's annual Halloween event. Last year, horror icon Michael Myers came to the game, and the year before, it saw Ash from Evil Dead debut. Should we expect another horror legend to arrive? It seems like a safe bet.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 on GameSpot.</p>

The date of the cease and desists arrival almost exactly coincides with H2M’s August 16 release date, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced</u></a> last Friday. Its X account’s biography now only says “SHUTDOWN.”</p><p>“Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project,” the team’s last post says. “We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/03/31/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-campaign-remastered---screen-2-1585677001593.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer revival mod H2M has been canceled.</figcaption></figure></output><p>The H2M team’s posts date as far back as July 2023 when they <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1675434407560368128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced the project</u></a>, noting that they had already been working on a Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer remastered mod for a while. At the time, the team said, “If Activision won’t do what the fans want, we the community will.” Although the Call of Duty publisher did remaster the original Modern Warfare 2 campaign and release it in 2020, it never went as far as to remaster its multiplayer component.</p><p>H2M aimed to fill the hole with not only upgraded visuals for maps, weapons, and characters fans have loved for more than a decade but also new content, too. It meant new gun camos and animations as well as a crate of new maps based on iconic Call of Duty locations and more. This blend of old and new driven from the perspective of fans had players excited enough to drive sales of Modern Warfare Remastered seeing as the game was needed to play H2M. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/393080/charts/#3m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, the 2017 title saw a sharp increase in player count in the last few weeks and even managed to climb Steam’s top selling list (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-4-is-one-of-the-best-selling-steam-games-right-now-but-only-because-you-need-it-to-play-an-ambitious-modern-warfare-2-multiplayer-mod-launching-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a>).</p><p>Now, however, Modern Warfare Remastered’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/393080/Call_of_Duty_Modern_Warfare_Remastered_2017/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recent Steam reviews</u></a> read “Mostly Negative,” with many recent comments from players calling for Activision to reverse their cease and desist request. Call of Duty fans in general have taken to social media to express their sadness at H2M’s demise, with some prominent content creators asking for Activision to reconsider, too.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are begging that you guys reconsider this decision <a href="https://twitter.com/Activision?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Activision</a>.

The former posted <a href="https://x.com/TheWatchfulWolf/status/1824169716061180375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an apology</u></a> and then teased that the H2M will now <a href="https://x.com/TheWatchfulWolf/status/1824177213685764598" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>set out to create its own project</u></a>, saying, “Fine.

Both games are often cited as two of the best 90s CRPGs--Planescape: Torment features incredible writing, dialog, and a unique dark fantasy setting unlike most other RPGs, while Icewind Dale focuses on combat and dungeon crawling. You also get a Humble Store coupon code for <strong>85% off Mythforce</strong>, which is a first-person co-op dungeon crawler inspired by hero shooters and classic 90s fantasy and cartoons. With the coupon, you can pick up Mythforce for just $5.25 (normally $30).</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $7, you get the aforementioned games as well as the enhanced edition remasters of <strong>Baldur's Gate I</strong> <strong>and II</strong>--which update the Bioware originals with new UI and graphics options, quality of life tweaks, and even controller support--and Owlcat's <strong>Pathfinder: Kingmaker - Enhanced Plus Edition</strong>, which is based on the popular Pathfinder TTRPG rules and setting, and mixes classic CRPG gameplay with city building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351014"></a><figcaption>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4351014-warhammerroguetrader.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The $10 tier adds two more games: <strong>Neverwinter Nights: Complete Adventures Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</strong>. And if you pay $15, you get the DLC season passes for Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Wrath of the Righteous.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, for $35, you get all of the previous content plus Owlcat's latest game, <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</strong>. As the name implies, the game is set in the grim sci-fi universe of Warhammer 40,000, but rather than yet another Space Marine-focused adventure, it pulls inspiration from the lesser-known Rogue Trader TTRPG where players explore 40K's violent universe as the leader of a ragtag band of mercenaries.</p><p dir="ltr">The full $35 bundle equates to a $346 value, but whichever tier you opt for, you'll be adding some of the best CRPGs to your Steam library.

            <title><![CDATA[Madden NFL 25 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-nfl-25-review-in-progress.954663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If football is a game of inches, then Madden typically manages to perfectly recapture that feeling in the minutiae of its year-to-year iterations. Every August, fans sit around and obsessively try to figure out what has changed, if the under-the-hood adjustments actually matter, if the new systems do what EA says they do, and if things truly feel any better. <em>Usually</em>, that is. Not this year. I haven’t played enough of Madden NFL 25 to render a final verdict just yet, but I can already tell that things feel very different than they do in Madden NFL 24 – and I don’t need to bring out the chains to see that good progress has been made. </p><p>EA has been hyping up Madden 25’s updated looks, and honestly, that’s where its improvements are most immediately clear. The menus are much cleaner – your options are big, clearly delineated, and easy to understand, and, miraculously, largely lag-free. This may not seem like a big deal, but if you played Madden 24 at launch, it feels like mana from heaven. It truly is the little things. My wife, who specializes in UX design and has watched me play entirely too much Madden 24 over the last year, walked by while I was playing this year’s iteration and casually remarked that “this looks like an actual menu designed by an actual person.” Hallelujah, brothers and sisters. They heard us.</p><p>All right, Will. Yeah, new menus. Big whoop. Tell us about something more substantial than that. Well, dear reader, the major modes benefit from this new focus on presentation, too, and I feel like a lot of what’s good here can be traced directly back to the improvements we saw in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">College Football 25</a>. In Franchise mode, you can finally create female coaches, and there are more customization options than ever before in terms of heads and apparel. There are still only ten head options for women compared to forty for men, but it’s cool that they’ve been added at all.</p><p>Superstar also benefits from this new coat of paint, despite ditching the pretense of an opening storyline (and based on what I’ve seen, voice acting) entirely, which is a shame. The upside is that once you complete the Combine, things get better. The draft actually looks and feels like the NFL draft. When the almighty Joe Throw got drafted by the Falcons 8th overall, Roger Goodell, the most hated man in football, came out and hugged him before presenting him with a Falcons jersey and posing for a picture — just like in real life. Did Joe look like some hideous golem animated by black magic compared to the mute, wax figure of Madden 25’s Roger Goodell? Yes. Does that matter? Not really. It still looks a hell of a lot better than what we had, and I appreciated all of the additional customization options I was given when recreating Joe Throw in Madden 25 — another thing this year’s Madden feels like it owes in part to College Football 25.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The draft actually looks and feels like the NFL draft this year.</p></div><p>Once I was in the Falcons facility, I walked around with head coach Raheem Morris and we discussed my goals for the preseason. Again, it’s a little weird to see everyone’s mouths move and have no sound come out, but graphically? Way better than last year, and I appreciated the moment-to-moment visual updates, whether I was chatting with my teammates in the locker room or out on the field. No longer are we trapped in hotel rooms.</p><p>Speaking of the field, there’s some neat stuff to see here, too. Things just look better all around, whether it’s character models, animations before, during, and after plays, or the new and improved touchdown graphics that pull up the scoring player’s photo. Again, it’s the little things.</p><p>Not everything’s a home run here, however; I hate the new play arts, at least the ones we see in the playbook. They’re harder to parse than the ones in Madden 24 and, conveniently, look just like the ones in College Football 25. They can’t all be zingers, I guess, but man, these can’t be replaced fast enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There are also a lot of big changes, like the new kickoff rules, which feel… really weird. I don’t think I like them, but that’s an NFL problem, not necessarily a Madden problem. Either way, it will take a while to get used to. Other things are more positive. I love being able to choose coverage shells rather than just appearing in base align, and I’m a big fan of being able to shift both sides of my O-line independently of one another… yet another feature we first saw in College Football 25. It might just be me, but Madden 25 even feels closer to College Football 25 in terms of speed – maybe I’m crazy, but if that actually proves to be a thing as I play more, I like the direction things are headed.</p><p>I also like that there are more mini-games to play, and that there are finally mini-games for O-linemen you can use to Focus Train them in Franchise mode. I don’t particularly <em>enjoy </em>these mini-games, admittedly, but at least they’re there and I can use them – and overall the mini-games here are hands down an improvement over Madden 24. Getting messages from my GM when I’m playing as a coach in my Franchise is also a nice touch, and I’m a big fan of the new commentary teams, particularly Kate Scott and Brock Huard. (Say it with me: it’s the little things.) </p><p>I have a lot of Madden NFL 25 left to play before I’m ready to give it a score. I have a Franchise to run, more Superstars to guide to Lombardi glory, my yearly slog in the EA Money Machine that is Ultimate Team, and so on. But I find myself… optimistic? Is that even a thing you’re allowed to be about Madden? Maybe I’m totally off base, and I’ll notice more issues the more I play. Football’s a game of inches, after all, and the smallest mistakes can lead to disaster. But right now, man, those little things? They’re feelin’ pretty good.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-apologizes-for-accidentally-changing-player-names-says-fix-will-take-some-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Bungie knows there are a lot of Destiny 2 players who had their in-game names changed against their will, but it’s not sure when a fix will arrive for everyone.</p><p>The Destiny developer acknowledged concerns in <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1823863324746113061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a series of posts on X/Twitter</a>. Although it has implemented a server-wide fix to ensure no one else will be affected, it’s unclear when players will be able to change their names back. For now, Bungie simply says that the hiccup impacted a “high number” of accounts.</p><p>“We are continuing to investigate options to address player accounts that were impacted,” Bungie said. “This will take some time as our path forward will be dependent on fixing the underlying issue.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are continuing to investigate options to address player accounts that were impacted. This will take some time as our path forward will be dependent on fixing the underlying issue.</p>— Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1823863325924712765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Although Bungie has maintained that it has the power to alter player names if they violate <a href="https://help.bungie.net/hc/en-us/articles/7648312251284-Bungie-Name-Guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>certain rules</u></a>, many players were <a href="https://x.com/RickKackis/status/1823425570241438045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>met with a notification</u></a> that says their name was changed because they are either logging in for the first time or have recently changed their Bungie name. It’s a message that even some longtime players have reported despite neither condition being applicable, with everyone affected being renamed to some variation of “Guardian” followed by a string of random numbers. Complaints about the issue has flooded the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics?pNumber=0&amp;tg=Help&amp;tSort=3&amp;tType=0&amp;d=2&amp;lang=en%3Freload%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bungie forums</u></a> as players scramble to find out why their name was changed and how to fix it.</p><p>There are games where changing a player’s name is simple – Destiny is not one of them. A Bungie.net name can only be altered once following an account’s creation, with tokens required for any subsequent changes. Thankfully, Bungie does promise to deliver name-change tokens to all players “at a later date.” No additional information was shared, so if you see a lot of names like Guardian2804 running around in the near future, now you know why.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Destiny 2 Servers are so messed up they took my Name away from me lmao <a href="https://t.co/QeKGjkGdpR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QeKGjkGdpR</a></p>— KackisHD (@RickKackis) <a href="https://twitter.com/RickKackis/status/1823425570241438045?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In other Destiny news, Bungie announced that it would <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">let go of hundreds of staff late last month</a>.

<p>The Modern Warfare 3 portion of the Esports World Cup is heating up, and earlier today, a round of Challengers-level teams proved that they’re worth more than some CDL competitors. First up was Gentle Mates, which forcefully ejected G2 Esports (Minnesota Rokkr) from the event with a 3-2 win in the elimination round.</p>



<p>Then, Stallions (FC Black) booted Team Heretics out of the competition with a crushing blow. In that series, it came down to the wire on every map, with the opening Hardpoint being almost too close to call at 250 – 248.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shaping-up">Shaping Up</h2>



<p>Modern Warfare 3 isn’t performing all that well at the Esports World Cup, given how many fans of the Call of Duty League have labelled it a ‘fake event’. As an example, the elimination match between Team Falcons and Lore Gaming secured an average peak viewer count floating around 4,500.</p>



<p>Plenty have claimed it’s just to secure a bag, and in many ways, that’s true. There are stacks of cash on the line, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Even teams leaving the tournament without a single win go away with $20,000 in their pockets.</p>



<p>Following the first round of elimination matches, the first four teams to be ejected from the tournament have bowed out:</p>



<ul>
<li>OMiT</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Team Heretics</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>Tomorrow, we’ll see teams starting to flesh out the playoff roster, and the expectation is that it’ll be populated entirely by CDL squads. Only eight can make it that far, and presently, it looks like it’ll be:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>OpTic Gaming</li>



<li>100 Thieves</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Boston Breach</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s easy to believe in the underdog spirit in the Call of Duty world, so we could still see the likes of Gentle Mates, Stallions, or Lore Gaming make it into the playoffs.</p>



<p>Who do you have winning the MW3 category at the Esports World Cup?</p>

<p>You can now play the original <em>Diablo</em> (and its expansion, <em>Hellfire</em>) in virtually any web browser on any computer with generally excellent performance and operating-as-expected controls. It's all thanks to an open source project published on GitHub called <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb">Diabloweb</a> that's now being <a href="https://x.com/iequalshane/status/1823357647673868408">circulated</a> by game developers on X.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb/blob/master/README.md">README file</a> in the project's GitHub repository, the project's developer (d07RiV) notes that it is based on <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX">DevilutionX</a>, another open source project that did a lot of legwork to make <em>Diablo</em> run well on modern operating systems.</p>
<p>"I've modified the code to remove all dependencies and exposed the minimal required interface with JS, allowing the game to be compiled into WebAssembly," writes d07RiV. "Event handling (especially in the menus) had to be modified significantly to fit the JS model."
</p><p>It's pretty easy to set up; you just <a href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/">visit the website</a>, upload a file, and get going.</p>
<p>You have to upload a file because the project doesn't include the <em>Diablo</em> game files—you'll have to provide those in the form of the DIABDAT.MPQ file in the <em>Diablo</em> install directory.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>There are three above-board ways to source this MPQ file. First, you can, of course, own a physical copy of the original game. Alternatively, you can purchase the game <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo">on GOG</a> and install it, then pull the file from the installation directory.</p>
<p>There's also a shareware release of <em>Diablo,</em> and you can pull the SPAWN.MPQ file from that, and it works just fine. That's not the full game, though, so that's more for if you just want to try it.</p>

<p>I played the game for about half an hour using the MPQ from the GOG version without any issues on Firefox on a Mac. (There's no Mac version of the GOG installer, though, so I had to run the installer in a virtual Windows machine to get at the file.) The game is obviously primitive compared to more recent entries in the series (or even <em>Diablo II</em>), but it is an addictive blast to play regardless.</p>

But in 2022, a page <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220331041630/http://www.blackmesa.com/">advertising the domain's availability for purchase</a> was suddenly replaced by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220911192743/https://www.blackmesa.com/">a mysterious logo</a> that bears a striking resemblance to <a>the fictional Black Mesa logo</a> in the games. And then there's the hard-to-read cipher at the bottom, the kind of thing that an ARG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/the-only-thing-more-intricate-than-mr-robots-plot-its-real-world-puzzle/">might use to hide important information in plain sight</a>.
</p><p>The site stayed like that, to little wider notice or suspicion, until August 8, when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1eo3ddx/black_mesa_now_has_its_own_website_featuring_a/">Valve fans</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1eoagpo/what_we_know_so_far_valve_leaks_black_mesa_web/">social media</a> began to <a href="https://twitter.com/HL_Alyx_NoVR/status/1821870694927606026">"[wake] up to a Black Mesa website"</a> that had suddenly been updated with a new header declaring, "Science requires process. Our insight defends it." Others on social media were <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886779693166989">quick to note the old cipher text</a> as a well as <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886790598369404">a new, obfuscated JavaScript countdown function</a> with <a href="https://x.com/ImPeQu/status/1821930270586499121">the internal name "Lambda Incident"</a>. That countdown seemed to be pointing toward <em>something</em> happening on September 30, which seems like as good a time as any to announce <em>Half-Life 3</em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1821916164357771630">right</a>?</p>

<p>The Valve faithful hoping this was a new version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/04/why-complaints-about-valves-portal-2-arg-miss-the-point/">the old <em>Portal 2</em> Potato ARG</a> had their hopes quickly dashed, though. Internet sleuths soon found a digital paper trail for Charles Fracchia, a research scientist who is <a href="https://fas.org/expert/charles-fracchia/">listed</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/%3Ca%20href=">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.isac.bio/charles">elsewhere</a> as the founder of "Black Mesa, a stealth company developing technologies that create provable assurance for advanced manufacturing workflows" since back in 2022. And by last Friday, the Black Mesa team <a href="https://blackmesa.com/resonance-cascades">put up a blog post</a> quashing any game-related rumors that might be circulating.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"As much as we would be honored to be part of any Valve game—we do not work in this sector at all," the blog post reads. "We are not secretly working on <em>Half-Life 3</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1ek5yw9/valve_is_currently_developing_a_new_game/">Project White Sands</a> (whatever that is/may be) or any other Valve title—we're just nerds working to secure the global bioeconomy." </p>
<p>The team went on to thank the Half-Life community that had sent in "a ton of messages of support and curiosity" about the company, as well as "thousands of fake inquiries" that "made us laugh." As for that old ciphertext? Turns out solving it <a href="https://twitter.com/blapman007/status/1821886785795887461">simply unlocked a recruitment message</a> seeking "engineers, cybersecurity professionals, and biologists" for the company. "KingPotatoVII please reach out, we've been trying to send you some swag for cracking the cipher a while back," the Black Mesa team wrote with a smiley face emoji.</p>

<p>Despite the revelation of the <em>real</em> Black Mesa corporation, some hangers-on haven't quite given up hope that this is all still just an extremely subtle bit of stealth marketing. "What if [actual scientist Charles Fraschia] is such a huge fan of <em>Half-Life</em>, like us, and decided to use his image/likeness to do this ARG for the game?" one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1ent51e/what_if_this_charles_fracchia_guy_is_an_actual/">wrote last week</a>. "Maybe he reached out and absolutely went full madlad with Valve to make this a magnum opus of an ARG. ... Could be simply someone is heavy trolling us, and to be honest I’m not even mad because this is fun af!"</p>
<p>Keep hope alive, Valve faithful! <em>Half-Life 3</em> is obviously just around the corner, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/08/half-life-3-is-not-in-the-works-says-valve-voice-actor/">no matter what anyone says</a>! The truth is out there for those with eyes to see it!

            <p>
Call of Duty has become an absolute hard drive hog in recent years, with 2023's entry managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">consume over 200GB of storage</a> in some cases. That all might be about to change, however, as Activision has announced major changes to the way it'll be handing installs with this year's Black Ops 6, promising "smaller and more customised downloads" as a result.
</p>
<p>
Activision shared the news in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap">post on its Call of Duty blog</a>, explaining its optimisation work will begin with a revamp of "the experience formerly known as Call of Duty HQ". This revamp is set to roll out over the course of several updates ahead of Black Ops 6's October launch, and will promises to introduce a streamlined interface, direct access to games, more control over downloads, and expanded texture streaming technology to reduce file sizes.
</p>
<p>
A first update to reorganise game content arrives on 21st August. Then, following Black Ops 6's open beta on 30th August, a new user interface and other "remaining updates" are scheduled for mid-October. After these "larger initial updates", Activision says future Call of Duty downloads will decrease in size and existing files will take up less space on players' device.

<p>
Key to these plans is the decision to decouple Call of Duty: Warzone from other titles, meaning it'll no longer be installed by default. Instead, whenever players purchase an annual Call of Duty title, they'll only be required to install its files - but they can "opt in" to a Warzone install during that process, or download it separately at a future point.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, players will have new options where Call of Duty's expanded texture streaming tech is concerned. Activision says its new capabilities mean it can "cycle content that is less frequently used by players to a streaming cache, avoiding the need to download it directly to your device's storage". And once the tech is introduced, players can choose between Optimised streaming, which supplies high-fidelity graphical quality at the expense of higher internet bandwidth usage, or minimal streaming, which reduces graphical quality and bandwidth requirements.
</p>
<p>
Activision says the first update players will need to download as part of these changes is a "big one", but will ultimately see Call of Duty's footprint decrease due to its file optimisations. The publisher also notes this initial update will arrive for PlayStation 5 players across four separate downloads "due to differences in file organisation". There's more detail in Activision's blog, but the takeaway is a simple one. "As a result of these updates," the company writes, "Black Ops 6 will be a smaller download at launch than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">certain tiers of Game Pass</a> on 25th October. And if you're curious about this year's Zombies mode, developer Treyarch has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-shows-off-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-terminus-island-zombies-map-in-new-trailer">sharing initial details</a> over the last few weeks.
