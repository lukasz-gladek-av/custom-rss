  <p id="Bf58OB">Right now, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a><em> </em>fans are settling in for a season of backstabbing, violence, and betrayal.</p>
<p id="FF7Vec">And so am I, because I’m watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vZEY2A9f_h1WEcKKbo-RoY7Y4GjkuUy">a YouTuber build a 1,000 gallon vivarium full of hostile ant colonies</a>.</p>
<p id="UreDFn">Over the last six months, Mikey Bustos, who goes by AntsCanada, has been cultivating biodiversity in a 12-foot long vivarium that he keeps in his home in the Philippines. The latest addition is a six-inch long baby caiman, which he plans to eventually move to a separate swamp vivarium and then to his backyard. The ethics and legality of this are unclear to me, but it is compelling viewing nonetheless.</p>
<p id="G8nT1m">Bustos, who has long been what I guess I would call an ant YouTuber, uses a 4K camera to capture the residents of the vivarium, a world that he’s named Pantdora. Yes, with a “t.” There are tree frogs, geckos, many species of ants, crickets, cockroaches, guppies, spiders, the aforementioned caiman, shrimp, and more.</p>

<p id="Dw4GrQ">Over incredibly high-definition footage of the creatures, Bustos narrates at a clip, his voice taut with excitement. “Ah, I love when fish school! There’s just something beautiful and hypnotic about it!” he exclaims after adding guppies to Pantdora’s blackwater pool, Aqua Noctis. </p>

<p id="JNwu6u">A tree frog gets a similarly poetic introduction. “When I spotted her out and about in Pantdora, I was awestruck how beautiful she was in the misty moonlight,” Bustos tells us. “I named her Miss Piggy.”</p>
<p id="14U7hH">The rhythms of the videos makes me feel lightly insane. I am pretty sure they’re made and paced for children. The image quality is stunning, but they have the narrative simplicity and deranged cadence of something like CoComelon, and Bustos’ narration is less David Attenborough, and more Dora the Explorer. </p>
<p id="a7Q6Gf">But the Drama. Oh, the Drama.</p>

<p id="qILpNZ">At the beginning of the series, Bustos realizes that several ant colonies have accidentally ended up in Pantdora, after stowing away in a giant salvaged tree stump and soil from his yard. He’s thrilled to see a lively colony of marauder ants —<em> but wait, what’s this? </em></p>
<p id="TNdkq3">Two invasive ant species have also made their home in the vivarium: fire ants and black crazy ants. </p>
<p id="aqbHrn">A brief, bloody skirmish between the marauders and the fire ants ends with casualties: Bustos watches sadly as a marauder major dies, locked in battle with a fire ant. The surviving marauders bury the bodies, while the fire ants retreat to their tunnels, presumably to breed and shore up their numbers.</p>
<p id="NGiMXF">But the black crazy ants seem to coexist with the marauder ants in the tree stump (formally dubbed the Hallelujah Tree Stump). Until one day.</p>
<p id="mSsMhU">Hundreds of black crazy ants — with multiple queens — come pouring out of the stump, carrying eggs and moving the colony from the middle to the top of the stump. Bustos realizes that inside the stump, a war may have been raging between the crazy ants and the marauders — who haven’t been as plentiful lately. Also, the crazy ants have somehow infiltrated the hardened poop tunnels of a colony of termites who share the Hallelujah Tree Stump! Can the colony survive? Or have the king and queen, and their valuable eggs, been killed?</p>
<p id="dlLurA">As Bustos says, “Mother nature is just stunning, isn’t she?”</p>
<p id="OgFrID">I can’t wait to find out what happens in the ant war. Or what havoc the new praying mantis will wreak. Or what will happen after Bustos’ huntsman spider, Lady Deathstrike, is introduced to the ecosystem — along with her egg sac. </p>

<p id="VfK0mi">The thing is, despite the overdramatic voiceover, I genuinely believe in Bustos’ enthusiasm for his creatures. When he exclaims over a baby grasshopper crawling up a vine, praising its wisdom in moving slowly so that predators (like tree frogs Kermit and Miss Piggy) won’t see it, I get it! It’s pretty cool, and I’ve never been so engrossed in the complicated and dangerous lives of insects before.</p>
<p id="R6AId5">I’m not sure how many other adults will be able to put up with the child-like narration of Bustos’ videos. Come to that, I’m not sure how many other adults will be compelled by watching two huntsman spiders have sex in stunning 4K. But I need to know what happens next in Pantdora, and I will be tuning in.</p>

As the first boss in the <strong>Return of the True Demon </strong>sidequest, Matador can and will wipe the floor with you if you challenge him unprepared. Though Matador was a challenge in the vanilla version of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, <strong>the </strong><em><strong>Vengeance </strong></em><strong>rerelease adds a new gimmick that you’ll need to deliberately play around</strong>. Fortunately, as long as you bring the right skills and demons, you can easily overcome this challenge.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>For best results, your main character should be at <strong>level 24 </strong>before challenging Matador. If you’re underleveled, consider advancing the main story and returning to this encounter later. This is especially helpful if you’re playing the <em>Vengeance </em>story, since you’ll recruit Guest characters who can come in clutch for this fight. Also consider stocking up on <strong>Elec Shards</strong> from Cadaver’s Hollow to give the Nahobino and any other human characters a way to exploit Matador’s weakness.<br></p><p>With that out of the way, here’s everything you need to know about overcoming Matador.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-recommend-id="image://e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-recommend-id="image://e8b80e45af74b0a39691d5ecbc3671f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Matador's stats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h145063"><a id=""></a>Matador’s abilities and weaknesses</h2><p>At first glance, Matador doesn’t seem too bad. <strong>He’s weak to Electric (Zio) damage, Immune to Force (Zan) damage, and resists Hama and Mudo</strong>. He also resists a spread of status ailments, though you can still inflict these conditions since he’s not full immunities. While Electric damage is your best option here, Physical attackers are perfectly viable too. This is especially true of any Physical moves that have a higher likelihood to inflict a critical hit (like <strong>Aramasa</strong>).</p><p>The real challenge here is Matador’s skills. New to <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em> is the <strong>Crippling Blow </strong>innate skill, <strong>which gives Matador a chance to instantly kill anyone when it hits a weakness or scores a critical hit</strong>. Yes, just one unlucky dice roll when Matador strikes the Nahobino can turn an otherwise successful encounter into an instant loss. Matador will exclusively inflict <strong>Physical </strong>and <strong>Force</strong> damage, so avoid bringing any demons who are weak to either of those.<br></p><p>You’ll also want to watch out for <strong>Red Capote</strong>, which will raise Matador’s accuracy and evasion by two stages whenever it’s used. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> really punishes you for missing attacks, so you’ll want to use <strong>Sukunda</strong> to counter this buff. In fact, <strong>any and all debuffs will serve you well here</strong>, since Matador doesn’t have any way to neutralize these conditions.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-recommend-id="image://41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-recommend-id="image://41659b6a2d8d62082a8c2c503997bb9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h145064"><a id=""></a>Matador’s battle strategy</h2><p>Before you even have a chance to attack, Matador will use <strong>Red Capote</strong>. Use <strong>Sukunda </strong>and other debuff moves ASAP so you don’t risk letting Matador dodge your attacks, since this will put you on the backfoot immediately. You can use a <strong>Purge Charm</strong> to immediately remove the effects of Red Capote, which helps a great deal if you don’t have multiple demons using Sukunda.</p><p>Fortunately, Matador casts Red Capote infrequently beyond this point. Though it can use <strong>Marakunda </strong>to lower your party’s defense, you shouldn’t have to worry too much if you keep Matador’s attack debuffed with <strong>Tarunda </strong>or equivalent attacks. Otherwise, Matador will primarily hit you with Physical attacks and the occasional <strong>Mazan</strong>, so make sure to defend accordingly.<br></p><p>As has been the case with other bosses, you’ll eventually see the text “<strong>Matador began gathering nearby Magatsuhi!</strong>” To counter this, <strong>make sure your party uses Guard at the end of their turn</strong>. Guarding is the only way you can completely negate the chance of suffering a critical hit, which Matador will inflict after gathering Magatsuhi. This is a good tip for many boss encounters, but it’s especially vital here.<br></p><p>That said, based on my testing, Matador seemed to use <strong>Mazan </strong>after gathering Magatsuhi, which he then followed with <strong>Andalucia </strong>(which inflicts multiple Physical hits) on the next turn. Because of this, you may want to have the Nahobino use Guard for another turn to avoid the possibility of catching an unlucky critical hit. This also means that anyone in your party immune to Force may be able to endure his Magatsuhi-charged attack without guarding. Your mileage may vary.<br></p><p>Aside from this, Matador doesn’t have any other surprises to throw at you. Keep him comprehensively debuffed, exploit his thunder weakness as much as you can, and pile on the damage until he goes down. Your tactics beyond that will depend on your party composition, so let’s give you some pointers.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-recommend-id="image://1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-recommend-id="image://1ae4b63da7e4fee5028bffcb033184f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An important screen for beating Matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h145065"><a id=""></a>How to build the Nahobino to fight Matador</h2><p>Given Matador’s moveset, <strong>you’ll mitigate a ton of damage by imbuing the Nahobino’s Affinities with the Sudama Essence</strong>. This will grant your protagonist total immunity to Force damage, protecting him from potential critical hits via Mazan <em>and </em>making him cut Matador’s turns short (enemies abide by the same Press Turn system the party does, so hitting an immunity inflicts a turn penalty). Sudama’s weaknesses aren’t relevant in this encounter, and you can purchase the essence from Cadaver’s Hollow.</p><p>Beyond that, Nahobino’s moveset will depend on how you’ve built him and what party members you’ll bring to the fight. <strong>Aramasa </strong>remains one of your strongest moves in a Physical build, whereas <strong>Zio </strong>or <strong>Zionga </strong>will obviously excel in a magic build. Physical Nahobinos may still prefer to bring Zio if you don’t want to bank on critical hits for extra turns. Beyond that, debuff moves are useful to bring, and <strong>Miracle Water </strong>will come in clutch if you don’t have a viable healer. <strong>Inflaming Divinity </strong>can help if you’ve progressed far enough to access it, though this will drain your MP very fast. <strong>Rooted Soul </strong>is always viable for the extra HP and MP, so use that if you have a skill slot to spare.</p><h2 id="h145066"><a id=""></a>The best demons and party members to counter Matador</h2><p>You’re forced to take your protagonist into the encounter, but your other monsters are a different story.

It naturally learns <strong>Zionga </strong>to exploit Matador’s weakness, <strong>Sukunda</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to mitigate the effects of Red Capote, <em>and </em>it resists Force damage. It can even counter Matador’s attacks thanks to its <strong>Guardian Beast</strong> innate skill.</p><p>Since other Zio-focused demons are weak to Force, Shiisaa is uniquely one of the best damage dealers you could use in this encounter. You honestly don’t need to do much to build it, just level it up so it learns its full moveset.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-recommend-id="image://a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-recommend-id="image://a8564a427943f5ff65ecc5e0379223a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kikuri-Hime's screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h145068"><a id=""></a>Kikuri-Hime</h2><p>If you need a dedicated healer, Kikuri-Hime is one of your best options. Her primary boon is her <strong>Force immunity</strong>, completely negating Matador’s Mazan. Additionally, she naturally learns <strong>Recarm </strong>and <strong>Media</strong>, which allows you to heal and revive party members as needed. Her innate skill <strong>Divine Benevolence </strong>will also reduce the MP cost of support skills, which includes debuffs.</p><p>Kikuri-Hime’s only downside is her negative electric proficiency, so she struggles as a damage dealer despite her great Magic stat. That said, her support proficiency makes her especially good at using debuffs like <strong>Tarunda</strong>, which she can learn naturally. Also consider giving her the Essence of <strong>Obariyon</strong> to let her learn <strong>Sekunda </strong>and/or <strong>Sekukaja</strong>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0f74594ab41d2b63b0c916abce5e428f" data-recommend-id="image://0f74594ab41d2b63b0c916abce5e428f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Oni screen.

With good Strength, even better Vitality, and native access to the <strong>Taunt </strong>skill, Oni can soak Matador’s Physical attacks like a champ. What’s more, his Physical resistance will dampen Matador’s hits and ease pressure on your healer(s). <strong>Fang Breaker </strong>is also a great support skill, as it deals damage and lowers the enemy’s offenses by one stage.</p><p>If you want to optimize Oni even further, give him the <strong>Counter </strong>ability. This will give Oni a chance to counter attack any enemy that uses a strength-based attack, which is <em>perfect </em>for a tank. You can learn this skill from the <strong>Nozuchi </strong>or <strong>Rakshasa </strong>Essences.<br></p><p><strong>Ippon-Datara</strong> is a serviceable alternative to Oni, thanks to its native access to Taunt and its tank-supporting <strong>One-Foot Hop </strong>ability. That said, Oni is generally superior, and you don’t need to use both.</p><figure id="" data-id="cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-recommend-id="image://cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoko's character page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yoko's character page." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-recommend-id="image://cfdf69263a7f2692f0ee36892384434f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoko's character page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h145070"><a id=""></a>Yoko Hiromine</h2><p><strong>For those playing through the <em>Vengeance </em>story path</strong>, Yoko Hiromine fares well in this fight. Her most obvious perk is <strong>Zio</strong>, which upgrades to <strong>Zionga</strong> after a small amount of story progress. Thanks to her high Magic stat, she can make good use of these spells. She can heal and debuff Matador’s attack in a pinch too, though you’ll want to save her MP for those electric spells.</p><p>As a human character, Yoko can use items as needed. Given how helpful items are in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, this alone makes Yoko more versatile than she has any right to be. Absolutely no investment or building is required to use Yoko, so slot her into your party if you’re tired of devoting resources to this fight.<br></p><h2 id="h145071"><a id=""></a>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>Aside from the above, any demons that can inflict Electric damage and aren’t weak to Force can work. For example, <strong>Feng-Huang</strong> resists Force and doesn’t have a negative Electric proficiency, so you can teach it Zio and use it as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-recommend-id="image://816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-recommend-id="image://816e6ee733479b8fe8b6a44ed6e9fc80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screen showing the stats and skills of Feng Huang, which has the apperance of a colorful, regal bird." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As long as you play carefully, you shouldn’t need many backup demons to get through Matador. Build your team right, react to Matador’s attacks, and you should get your clear in no time. As a reward, you’ll unlock a special fusion for Matador, so you can use his powers against all who stand against you. Good luck in the rest of your journey through Da’at!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In another big change, Holy Bolts Elixir is getting a major power reduction, thanks to the seasonal elixir "scaling unintentionally high when it was triggered from pets such as Necromancer's minions." The elixir, which sends bolts of holy energy in all directions upon killing an enemy, will soon deal a percentage of weapon damage instead of a percentage of an enemy's health. The change is intended to "reduce its effectiveness against the toughest enemies in higher tiers of the Pit," but Blizzard notes the elixir "will still be really valuable for players throughout the whole game."</p><p dir="ltr">Classes are seeing some changes too, with Whirlwind Barbarians, non-minion Necromancer builds, and Twisting Blades Rogues in particular receiving some significant buffs. On the item side, various Uber Uniques--like Andariel's Visage, Tyrael's Might, Doombringer, and Ring of Starless Skies--are all getting buffs, and the game's healing potions are increasing, with higher-level potions set to have their initial healing increased by 200%.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 4, which overhauled the game's items and introduced new ways for players to customize and power-up their gear, has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-going-over-very-well-with-fans/1100-6523491/" data-ref-id="1100-6523491">well-received by the game's community</a>.

You can read the full patch notes for update 1.4.3 below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">GAME UPDATES</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>We greatly appreciate everyone’s excitement since the launch of Season 4 and are very happy with the state of the game. The changes in this patch are aimed at buffing classes and builds that are not performing as well as their counterparts. We are also slightly reducing the difficulty of the Pit to ensure that most builds are able to get to Tier 60 to get their final tier of Masterworking materials.</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">BALANCE UPDATES</h2><h4 dir="ltr">General</h4><p dir="ltr"><strong>Healing Potions</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Minor Healing Potion  <ul><li dir="ltr">Initial healing increased by 50%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Light, and Moderate Healing Potions  <ul><li dir="ltr">Initial healing increased by 100%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Strong, Greater, Major, and Superior Healing Potions  <ul><li dir="ltr">Initial healing increased by 200%.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Legendary Aspects</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aspect of the Protector  <ul><li dir="ltr">Barrier Cooldown reduced from 30 to 20 seconds.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mythic Unique Items</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Andariel’s Visage  <ul><li dir="ltr">Poison nova now spawns on the enemy instead of the player.</li><li dir="ltr">Poison nova damage increased by 50%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Doombringer  <ul><li dir="ltr">Shadow explosion damage increased by 100%.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Ring of Starless Skies  <ul><li dir="ltr">Maximum stacks of Resource Cost Reduction and bonus Damage increased from 4 to 5.</li><li dir="ltr">This increases the maximum amount of Resource Cost Reduction and bonus Damage from 40%[x] to 50%[x].</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Tyrael’s Might  <ul><li dir="ltr">Divine barrage damage increased by 100%.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Paragon</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Stat requirements for non-main stats reduced from 90 to 60 per Paragon Board.</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Developer’s Note: </strong><em>A classes main stat is the one that increases the damage of all of their skills.

The stat requirements to activate any Rare Node increases for each additional Paragon Board you progress through. Some of these nodes that require non-main stats were harder to activate than intended.

            <p>
Former Dragon Age lead writer and Summerfall Games co-founder David Gaider has strung together some opinions on Xitter - the original spawning ground for all opinions - about the full reveal video for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, expressing broad enthusiasm for the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s narrative tone, combat system and environments, while offering a more ambivalent analysis of BioWare's decision to let players seduce every last member of their party.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Those Xeets came through yesterday. Since then, in the wake of a bunch of articles recapping his thoughts, Gaider has <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801425282223772043">chucklesomely added</a> that “I should shut up about Dragon Age for a while” and that “I have other things to do than to provide fodder for news articles that like to talk about what "former Dragon Age lead writer" tweets, after all”. Ooft! 
</p>
<p>
I’ve seen this kind of jovial bait-and-switch before, when an industry luminary serves up some insight on social media, waits for the internet’s news mosquitos to swarm the jar, then slams down the lid and traps those foolish insects of journalism in an atmosphere of mild professional embarrassment and self-loathing. Well, I didn’t make it into your dang jar yesterday, David. I was off buzzing around Monster Hunter at the time. So here I am fluttering at the glass, trying to rejoin my brethren. Let me in, David! I also wish to batten on the sweet nectar of your comparisons with Dragon Age 2!
</p>
<p>
Here’s Gaider’s <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801050867975819542">initial thread</a> on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">the full reveal gameplay footage</a> - not to be confused with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">the much clowned-on story trailer</a>, which is one wisecrack away from having Chris Pratt abseil through the ceiling in a tuxedo. 

"Overall, I'd say this made for a better introduction than the reveal trailer," Gaider begins. "We see some story, and tone-wise it feels a lot darker and more DA. Like I said, trailers often need to be taken with a grain of salt, and my impression is that many fans are relieved. Which is great. 
</p>
<p>
"I could pick on a few things," he adds. "The stylized characters will take some getting used to, but the DA art style has changed every game so that's nothing new. Combat is more action-y, without any tactical elements, but it seems fine. Style is not much different than, say, DA2's combat.” 
</p>
<p>
There's some commentary on the environments, which "look amazing, full stop. To see the sprawl of Minrathous - wow. I wish we could have done this for Kirkwall or even Val Royeaux. Utterly gorgeous, sells the breadth and tone, such great work." Gaider also notes that Veilguard's dialogue icons resemble those of Dragon Age 2, and is happy to see Solas back and causing a ruckus. "Could probably chatter about the implications for days, and how this aligns (or doesn't) with where I thought the story would go... but I won't. I'm just eager to see where this goes. To the folks at Bio: great job."
</p>
<p>
In a response to a response to his thread, Gaider had a touch more to say about Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s combat, noting that “it's not that far afield from where DA's been headed, though I'll miss the more tactical elements of the past, it's true. I imagine they'll make it fun, regardless.”
</p>
<p>
All pretty upbeat, then! In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">my own preview of the game</a> from SGF I focussed on the comparison with Dragon Age: Inquisition, the most recent Dragon Ager, but the link to Dragon Age 2 is worth pursuing. Depending on whether you’re playing it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/analysis-dragon-age-ii">2011</a> or any year after, let’s say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dragon-age-ii">2015</a>, Dragon Age 2 is either Dragon Age’s lowest moment or its secret finest hour. It’s the more impetuously action-skewed of the existing Dragon Agers, especially before they patched in a proper auto-attack, and the least expansive or if you prefer, more focussed in terms of setting. Perhaps the better way of thinking about The Veilguard is that it’s a sequel to Dragon Age 2, rather than a streamlined version of Inquisition.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801421451414933634">a separate thread</a>, responding to an article from our colleagues at the Ian Acquisitions Network, Gaider offered a more involved appraisal of Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s letting you win the hearts of each and every one of your companions, noting that if you make a video game character a love interest, it stops you doing much else with them.</p>
<p>"First off, the fandom is pretty split on romance design," he wrote. "A huge part just want whoever they want, and NOT getting to romance them is tantamount to a slap in the face. Others like characters with more agency, even (and maybe especially) if it doesn't align with their preferences. 
</p>
<p>
"Nothing wrong with either desire, honestly," the thread continues. "It all depends on what you want out of your game. We're not all here for the same reasons, OK? The only unfortunate aspect, in my experience, is that these two approaches are more or less diametrically opposed, from a design standpoint. 
</p>
<p>
"The DA writers realized, eventually, that as soon as you make a character romanceable it limits the type of character they can be and the types of stories they can tell. They become beholden to their romance arc and their need to, ultimately, be appealing. 
</p>
<p>
"Why is that a limitation? Because not all character story arcs are defined by being appealing to the player. Even if the appeal of an arc is for a relatively limited audience, the requirement of having appeal inherently restricts the potential stories to a fairly limited band." 
</p>
<p>It was for the above reasons that the Inquisition writing team decided to make Varric, Dragon Age's smooth-sipping dwarven pulp novelist, a non-romanceable character, despite much Varric thirsting on the forums. "The call to back away from that approach in DAI was mine, made with [Mike Laidlaw]'s and the team's support," Gaider recalled. "I didn't like what taking away the followers' agencies did, that it turned them into sex dolls whose only purpose is to have the player mash them together and go "now kiss!"
</p>
<p>
To address the unclothed Githyanki in the room, Gaider also feels the hanky-panky-abundant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> might have been better if certain companion characters were off-limits. "Several characters would have had a stronger arc without romance, and the feeling I got from having this entire huge crew all ready to drop trou if I blinked wrong... meh." He thinks that Veilguard should get along perfectly well on this count, however, as long as "they unapologetically lean into it as BG3 did it", concluding that "it's a legit approach, like I said, and many many fans will be gleeful and happy for it."

            <p>There’ve been a ton of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-jackbox-party-pack">Jackbox Party Packs</a> over the last near-decade, each following a fairly similar structure: one or two standout games you’ll want to replay, a couple you might dip into every now and then, and at least one you’ll try once and then never bother with again. With 10 different packs to pick from, it becomes an increasing fuss to remember which pack has which game in, and then boot it up just to play its highlight before repeating the process when you choose to play something else.</p>

<p>Developers Jackbox Games seems to be <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/introducing-the-jackbox-megapicker">just as aware as anyone</a>, announcing the thing we’ve all been waiting for since at least Jackbox Party Pack 5: a single, unified launcher for all of the collected Jackbox Party Pack games that will let you jump between each of the more than 50 games released to date.</p>
<p>The Jackbox Megapicker, as they’ll christened it, will be out sometime next month on Steam, where it’ll be free to download. It’ll let you view all the Jackbox games you own, filter and sort them - it’s not clear what those options might be, but I’d assume things like player count - and then boot straight into your chosen game.</p>
<p>As someone who has found Jackbox to be a fixture of pretty much any social gathering in the last 10 years, it’s very welcome news. For what it’s worth, my favourite Jackbox remains <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jackbox-party-pack-3-released">Party Pack 3</a> - it’s hard to top Tee KO, and the rest are all good-to-great in a rare no-misses offering - though Mad Verse City from Pack 5 is an absolute banger thanks to hearing robot rappers spit awkward diss tracks about your friends.</p>

The high-stakes competitive mode is back this weekend, allowing you the chance to go Flawless and earn some serious, one-of-a-kind rewards. And like just about everything else in The Final Shape, Trials is seeing some significant changes from the way it used to work.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie gave us a few details about those changes in its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_06_13_2024?msID=3e87801c-0c0d-41ea-8015-16858ff2d5f3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week In Destiny blog post</a>. The specific new alteration is that Trials is getting a new currency, called Osirian Cipher. What exactly these will get you isn't clear, though: the blog post only says, "This new and very aptly named currency can be exchanged for rewards every weekend." Nothing in the inventory of Saint-14, the Trials vendor, currently requires an Osirian Cipher to purchase it, but Bungie advises you "use them wisely," which suggests you'll be able to use them to grab specific rewards. We'll add more details here as soon as they're available.</p><p dir="ltr">As the blog post details, Osirian Ciphers are going to be somewhat hard to come by. You can earn one for completing a Passage of Persistence, and if you manage to go Flawless and reach the Lighthouse, you'll get four ciphers. You can keep a total of 10 in your inventory.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, this weekend allows you to earn the Adept version of The Summoner for your Trials tribulations. The auto rifle is highly accurate and dumps bullets fast, making it pretty deadly. Bungie has also updated it to be a Strand weapon rather than Kinetic, so if autos are your thing, you might want to try to nab one.</p><p dir="ltr">As always, both the Trials of Osiris rewards and the map are randomized when the mode goes live at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Fridays. Here's what you're facing this weekend:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Map: Bannerfall</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Game Mode: Dominion</strong> (capture a control point or eliminate all opponents to win)</li><li dir="ltr">20 rounds won -- Pinnacle Trials Engram</li><li dir="ltr">7 matches won -- Pinnacle Trials Engram</li><li dir="ltr">Reputation Rank 10 -- Aisha's Care (Strand pulse rifle)</li><li dir="ltr">Reputation Rank 16 -- Shayura's Wrath (Void submachine gun)</li><li dir="ltr">Flawless run -- The Summoner (Adept), Solar auto rifle</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you're not familiar with Trials of Osiris, the special PvP event runs from the daily reset on Friday until the weekly reset on Tuesday, giving you four days to take part. Your goal is for you and the other two players in your fireteam to achieve a "Flawless" run, in which you win seven matches without losing any.</p><p dir="ltr">Going Flawless gets you a trip to the Lighthouse, a special social space you can't reach any other way, and provides you with special rewards, including Adept weapons that can only come from Trials. These have additional stat bonuses, making them among the most coveted items you can get your hands on.</p><p dir="ltr">To access the mode, you'll need to buy a Trials Passage from Saint-14. The card tracks your wins, but not track your losses--so you can keep playing and earning rewards even if you lose out on a Flawless run. You also earn rewards based on the number of rounds, rather than matches, you've won during your session, Saint-14 has a reputation system similar to other vendors that will dish out some Trials-only loot in exchange for your participation, even if you don't clean out any lobbies.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, you'll also earn Trials Engrams for participating in the mode, which you can cash in with Saint-14 during the weekend you receive them. You can tune those engrams to yield specific pieces of loot, or take your chances with random drops that will expand what's available in your loot pool. You get Engrams even if you don't go Flawless, so it's worth trying your hand at the mode for some cool rewards, even if you're not cleaning out the competition. Just note that your Engrams for the weekend have to be cashed in before the weekly reset on Tuesday.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the rest of our Destiny 2 coverage with our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.

        <p>Now renters will just split the bills, but their building will collapse if they can’t cover the costs</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> has found a delightfully straightforward solution to the very real-world problem of greedy landlords demanding excessive rent payments. The city-builder sequel will simply delete all its virtual leeches in its next patch, helping to bring down the cost of living in your digital metropolis.</p>

<p>The changes arriving in Colossal Order’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4145079671516384052?l=english">next patch</a> are dubbed “Economy 2.0”, looking to stop the likelihood of players being bombarded by complaints of “High Rent” by their virtual population. Rather than having renters fork over their cash to a virtual landlord, the patch will remove landlords so citizens living together in a building just split the cost equally between them. Wow, it’s almost like landlords serve no valuable purpose and don’t need to exist at all for society to function properly.</p>
<p>On top of driving landlords out of the city, Colossal Order have tweaked the way that rent prices are calculated as a whole, basing a reasonable cost on the overall income of the household. If renters start to struggle with paying the bills, they’ll look to save some cash on things like resources before saying the rent’s too high - and subsequently moving out or relocating to more affordable housing.</p>
<p>If residents do continue to struggle to pay the bills, mind, their building will eventually start degrading and could even collapse if left without maintenance. Covering the rent will reverse the risk, gradually progressing buildings up a series of different levels.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the next patch, you’ll now be able to remove building upgrades without having to knock the whole thing down thanks to a new bin icon on their info panel, while sub-buildings can also be freely moved around and turned on and off for extra control.</p>
<p>Colossal Order have reassured that existing saves will still work when the new patch lands, though the changes to the calculations and such mean that you might just need to keep an eye on things for a bit after you boot it up. Government subsidies are gone and the cost of City Service upkeep has been increased, so your city is likely to be spending more once you reload. More industrial space means more demand, while the shift in companies trying to be profitable also means more citizens may end up unemployed once things settle.</p>
<p>Colossal Order say they’re already lining up Cities: Skylines 2’s next patch for Q3 of this year, teasing expanded service import options, UI improvements and information, and some new buildings on the way - including what looks like a bin lorry and a water tower of some kind.</p>

			<p>2012’s Lollipop Chainsaw is very much a product of its time, but it’s attracted a bit of a cult following over the years for both the obvious reasons, and because of surprisingly sharp writing by a pre-Marvel-fame James Gunn and its solid, varied gameplay. Well, a new version of the game, entitled <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/lollipop-chainsaw-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lollipop Chainsaw RePop</a> has now locked down a September release date.</p>
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop was not made with the involvement of Gunn or the game’s original co-director Suda51, but its original executive producer Yoshimi Yasuda is heading up the project under the Dragami Games banner (Dragami is the successor to original Lollipop Chainsaw co-developer Kadokawa games). RePop looks to occupy a somewhat unique position between a remaster and remake, offering largely similar graphics (uprezed and touched up of course) but a number of gameplay tweaks and improvements. The story will remain the same as before though, with players being able to play with gore intact or RePop mode in which the blood is replaced with colorful effects. Unfortunately, a lot of the licensed songs from the original game will be getting the chop. Check out a new trailer for Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP FIRST TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iacKQtesXlQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Need to know more? Here are Lollipop Chainsaw RePop’s key features…</p>
<p><em><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The resolution of the game has been increased to full HD, and load times have been greatly shortened.</em></li>
<li><em>The chainsaw action has been sped up with the introduction of the Chained Hits Hunting system, in which chaining multiple hits in succession increases the player’s attack speed.</em></li>
<li><em>The input timings for Combo Actions have been adjusted, to better fit players’ expectations.</em></li>
<li><em>Chainsaw Blaster action has been improved with the addition of auto-lock and auto-fire modes that can be toggled, and an increased maximum ammo count of 99.</em></li>
<li><em>The player can now immediately use Combo Actions at the start of the game.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Additional Gameplay Content</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Separate from Original Mode, RePop adds “RePop mode,” which uses a unique and colorful pop art-inspired art style for damage effects.</em></li>
<li><em>Unique new chainsaws with distinctly different features have been added.</em></li>
<li><em>There are 30 costumes, more than the original game’s costume count. Combined with the addition of 4 new hair colors and 4 new chainsaws, this adds up to 750 different possible combinations.</em></li>
<li><em>Juliet’s Room has been expanded with more features.</em></li>
<li><em>A “Time Attack” mode with ranking feature has been added.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePop launches on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch on September 25.</p>

<p id="wHKt7R">Inside Stormveil Castle, from the <strong>Rampart Tower Site of Grace</strong>, go north and down the stairs to access the roof of the church. Be careful with the Warhawks in your path. You can enter using one of the windows or use a ladder on the southeast side to access the church. If you choose the latter, you’ll have to defeat the patrolling units. Otherwise, they can follow you inside the church and attack Rogier.</p>

Teleport there if Melina has already taken you there, or visit a site of grace for her to appear and invite you. You can find Rogier <strong>sitting on the balcony east of the central room</strong>. Talk to him and choose the “I’ve defeated Godrick” dialogue option once it’s available. Rogier rewards you with the <strong>Rogier’s Rapier +8</strong> and ends the conversation.</p>

<p id="ncPy1P">To progress Rogier’s questline, you need to visit an underground section of Stormveil Castle, where you can learn about what happened to Rogier.</p>
<p id="vu1zkw">Teleport to the <strong>Liftside Chamber Site of Grace</strong>, take the lift on the left, and, in the next area, use the ledge to access a window on the right side. From there, turn right and follow the only available path.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ac-infinity-now-known-as-%E2%80%98animus-hub%E2%80%99-could-launch-with-shadows.901791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/animus-hub-ac-infinity-shadows/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent interview, it was revealed that Assassin’s Creed Infinity, the core ecosystem that was planned by Ubisoft to act as the beating heart of the AC series, has been renamed. It’s now known as the Animus Hub, but for all intents and purposes, it’ll do the exact same thing (just under a new name), acting as the central nervous system for all things Assassin’s Creed, much in the way that the Call of Duty HQ is a centrepoint for launching COD titles these days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sudden-changes">Sudden Changes</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/assassins-creed-shadows-interview">interview with Game File</a>, Ubisoft’s VP executive producer, Marc-Alexis Côté, confirmed to Stephen Totilo that the name change had taken effect but it wasn’t confirmed when the ‘platform’ will come into play. However, it <strong>was </strong>suggested that it’ll land in time for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the dual-protagonist title set in Feudal Japan that’s set to be released on November 15.</p>



<p>That’s something that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-infinty-news/">we reported back in February</a>. </p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was revealed with a gameplay breakdown earlier this week at Ubisoft Forward, and it looks pretty fantastic. The character split is heavily evident, with one side behind commanded by the hulking samurai, Yasuke, and the other being represented by the agile and lithe shinobi, Naoe. It looks unequivocally ‘RPG AC’ but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>



<p>With a dynamic weather system that includes seasons, a massive open-world map, multiple approaches to missions, and more movement and stealth mechanics than ever before, AC Shadows should be a memorable enough title. It has been a long time coming, too – while 2023’s Mirage was a great stopgap, it didn’t have that much meat on its bones – that’s where Shadows will step up.</p>



<p>It’s set to release on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S on November 15 – will it launch alongside the Animus Hub?</p>

                <p>A nomad no more, things have changed for Xur in Destiny 2: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a> as the wandering arms dealer has finally set up shop in a permanent location in the game. With a slice of prime real estate dedicated to him, Xur has also undergone a revamp and he now offers a more exciting selection of Exotic gear for players to browse through. In case you're looking to get a potentially good roll of a specific armor piece or you're looking to see if he has a specific catalyst, here's where you can find Xur this weekend and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week Xur is offering the weapon catalysts for Bad Juju and Arbalest. Hunters can pick up <strong>Lucky Raspberry</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Nezarec's Sin</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319455-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319455" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319455-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319455"></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the Tower's Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319455-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

Using a grenade, melee, or class ability will empower the others, making your offensive abilities do more damage and your barricade will have more hit points. Ideally you'd want both discipline and strength to have high stats, but unfortunately, you're not getting that on this roll. Recovery eats up the bulk of the available stat points, and discipline is high but but there's a very low strength stat attached to this armor.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 4</li><li>Resilience: 7</li><li>Recovery: 25</li><li>Discipline: 17</li><li>Intellect: 10</li><li>Strength: 6</li><li><strong>Stat total: </strong>69</li></ul><h3>Lucky Raspberry (Exotic Hunter chest armor)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319466-destiny22024-06-1419-03-59.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319466" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319466-destiny22024-06-1419-03-59.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319466"></a><figcaption>Lucky Raspberry</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319466-destiny22024-06-1419-03-59.jpg"></figure><p>Lucky Raspberry's armor perk is Overflowing Light, which is great for Hunters wanting to be grenadiers. Arcbolt Grenades gain an increased chance to chain damage around enemies, and damaging enemies with Jolt lightning strikes or collecting Ionic Traces will recharge that ability more quickly. With this Exotic equipped, you can also use Arcbolt Grenade to stun Overload champions. This is a pretty great roll as well, with resilience, recovery, and discipline all having high stats. Intellect and strength are low, but these can be addressed with some armor mods.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 4</li><li>Resilience: 16</li><li>Recovery: 16</li><li>Discipline: 19</li><li>Intellect: 9</li><li>Strength: 2</li><li><strong>Stat total: </strong>66</li></ul><h3>Nezarec's Sin (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319467-destiny22024-06-1419-04-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319467" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319467-destiny22024-06-1419-04-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319467"></a><figcaption>Nezarec's Sin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4319467-destiny22024-06-1419-04-20.jpg"></figure><p>Another classic from the Destiny 2 vault, Nezarec's Sin works really nicely if you're focusing on causing some damage with Void weapons and abilities. Any Void damage you deal will increase your ability energy recharge rate, so pair this with a weapon like Graviton Lance and you'll quickly refill your ability meters. Unfortunately, this is not a good roll of Nezarec's Sin. Mobility is unnecessarily high, resilience is terribly low, and discipline is also not great. Intellect and strength aren't too bad, but this Exotic is worth skipping this weekend if you already have a better one in your armory.</p><ul><li>Mobility: 20</li><li>Resilience: 3</li><li>Recovery: 11</li><li>Discipline: 6</li><li>Intellect: 16</li><li>Strength: 12</li><li><strong>Stat total: </strong>68</li></ul><h2>Exotic Weapon Catalysts</h2><h3>Genesis (Arbalest Catalyst)</h3><p>Breaking a combatant's shield with this weapon fills its magazine from reserves.

Xur has changed how he conducts business. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="161" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While I don’t quite share some peoples’ enthusiasm for Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest Xbox showcase</a>, I will concede that it was at least a decent showing. </p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">The whole thing was brisk and crammed a lot of announcements into its near two hour runtime and, while I was more intrigued by some of the third-party announcements (like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-brings-back-max-caulfield-launches-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Life is Strange</em></a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-announced-at-xbox-games-showcase/">turn-based RPG <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>), there were some pivotal first-party reveals that warranted excitement from Xbox players, such as the long absent <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-perfect-dark-gameplay-trailer-looks-neither-perfect-nor-dark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a></em> and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gears-of-war-prequel-e-day-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Gears of War</em></a>. But every time Microsoft had something new to show from one of its teams, all I could think of was, “Man, I hope this team doesn’t get shut down.”</p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">It’s no secret that the games industry, as a whole, feels like it’s collapsing in on itself. We’re only halfway through 2024 and an estimated 10,800 people have lost their jobs across a wide range of studios. What’s especially damning is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-games-industry-has-already-laid-off-more-people-this-year-than-in-all-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is already higher than the number of 2023 industry lay offs</a>: approximately 10,500. </p> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="914" data-injectable="true">Microsoft may not be the sole contributor to these numbers, but it is one of the most notable examples. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-layoffs-affect-343-bethesda-report-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At the beginning of 2023</a>, it culled staff at <em>Halo</em> studio 343 Industries and <em>Gears of War</em> studio The Coalition, as well as Bethesda. This past January, it let go roughly 1,900 employees from its gaming division, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ones at Activision Blizzard</a> which it had only recently bought out for $75.4 billion. And then, just last month, it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shuttered several of its studios</a> including Tango Gameworks, despite Microsoft deeming its last title, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em>, a success.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Xbox YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="614" data-current-count="914" data-injectable="true">To see Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty, and Xbox president Sarah Bond take to the stage and talk about how amazing and talented their studios feels tonally dissonant. Booty said, “The creativity and talent of game creators are what make our industry unique, and I’m incredibly proud of our games and our teams.” But such praise rings hollow when, again, Tango Gameworks provided the Xbox brand with the creative and unique <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>. It could very well have gone on to make even more such projects, but that apparently wasn’t good enough for Microsoft.</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">When I see something like <em>South of Midnight</em>, which boasts its own distinctive visual style and unique Southern Gothic inspirations, how can I have any faith that developer Compulsion Games (who Microsoft acquired in 2018) won’t get gutted or shut down, even if the game sells well or pulls in new Game Pass subscribers? </p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">I can’t imagine how former employees who contributed to Microsoft’s awesome reveals felt seeing them get such glowing responses. Actually, I don’t need to, because some of them admitted in an interview with <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-diablo-gears-of-war-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Aftermath</a> about how bittersweet it all was. Take this quote from Shayna Moon, who was an engine producer on <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> (easily the highlight of the whole showcase) and was laid off in 2023:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true"> <p>“Seeing the trailer go up and the title get announced made me feel empty inside. It was a reminder that after I got laid off my team kept going without me. I am genuinely happy for the coworkers I was close with while I was there. But I’m still extremely angry about what Microsoft has done these last two years. My layoff in January 2023 was sandwiched between Microsoft executives having a private concert from Sting and then them shelling out $69 billion for the Activision merger.”</p> </blockquote>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="South of Midnight - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="824" data-current-count="1124" data-injectable="true">The way the showcase played out, you wouldn’t think the industry was on fire. Anyone not in the know tuning in could easily believe everything’s hunky-dory, and that Microsoft hadn’t put hundreds of people out of work barely two months before. Even Geoff Keighley managed to at least acknowledge the state of the industry when opening the Summer Game Fest showcase this year. It was brief and didn’t really touch on the root of the problem, but it was still far more than what Xbox offered. You’d think with how much public outrage there was regarding the shutdowns of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin, that they’d want to at least appear apologetic or offer any sort of condolences during the showcase. Clearly, announcing a new <em>Gears of War</em> was enough to make people forget or forgive.</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, Spencer was asked about the recent studio shutdowns during his <a href="https://youtu.be/IIpMhthwnto?si=2unT4L8clJA0jEj4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with IGN</a> (one of the only interview he was apparently willing to do during this year’s SGF), but his answer was disappointingly, if unsurprisingly, corporate. All he could say was that it was a tough decision he didn’t enjoy making, and that his priority is to “run a sustainable business inside the company and grow.”</p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">It’s not even a real explanation for why, specifically, the likes of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin had to go. Not to sound like a broken record, but <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> was a success in all key metrics <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Xbox’s Aaron Greenberg</a>, and while Arkane’s <em>Redfall</em> most certainly underperformed, it’s reported that the game’s failure wasn’t the impetus for its closure. Instead, it was, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNTE5ODQyOCwiZXhwIjoxNzE1ODAzMjI4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRDZOSzZEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zOpVTjvikB5ShRoVNwwKrwaDGSVNL6qhY3mhsEXW_nI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Bloomberg report</a>, because Microsoft was being spread too thin across its various studios. </p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">“It’s hard to support nine studios all across the world with a lean central team with an ever-growing plate of things to do. I think we were about to topple over,” said Jill Braff, head of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media. This feels especially strange, after Xbox spent billions on acquiring Activision Blizzard and its studios.</p> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t sound like Microsoft is in dire financial straits, either. Its decision to axe staff at Activision came two weeks after Microsoft briefly overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world, worth $2.859 trillion (per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>). I’m not the first to make this observation, but it feels like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-people-making-the-games-keep-paying-the-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving the employees holding the bag</a>.</p> <p data-characters="748" data-current-count="1104" data-injectable="true">Recently, Obsidian Entertainment’s Carrie Patel and Matt Hansen, director and art director on fantasy RPG <em>Avowed</em>, mentioned they still <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/avowed-director-say-they-feel-sense-of-security-under-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt supported by Microsoft and weren’t afraid about their studio’s future</a> even after the closures of Arkane and Tango. That’s all well and good, but how long will that last? Who’s to say Obsidian’s staff won’t face job cuts or even be completely shutdown in the future? You can’t say, “Well, Obsidian makes good games like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-outer-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>,” because so did Tango Gameworks. Arkane Austin had the 2017 <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-prey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prey</a></em> under its belt, and people still praise that game to this day. Yet neither of these studios’ reputations saved them from the chopping block.</p>
 <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="false">I sadly have no perfect conclusion where I lay out what can be done to prevent future job losses or fix any of this. But we mustn’t allow ourselves to be distracted by whatever shiny new toy companies like Microsoft dangle in front of us. It doesn’t matter how good of a showcase Microsoft had this summer, that it’s putting <em>Call of Duty</em> on Game Pass, that it’s got a new <em>Gears of War</em> in the works. None of that changes how these employees have been treated, how talent has been made disposable. Even the best video games are not worth it, if the people who make them can be tossed aside so easily.</p>

<p>Rumours have abounded about a remaster or re-release of Final Fantasy Tactics since at least 2021, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">a list of games datamined from Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service leaked out</a>, including PlayStation exclusives like God of War - which has since come to PC - alongside apparent ports of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> and FF Tactics. Nvidia later <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">confirmed the list was real</a>, but described the titles as “speculative” releases rather than confirmation of their existence.</p>
<p>Talk of a Tactics remaster has been kicking around for a while, and recently came back into discussion in the wake of the recent drama around prolific Persona and JRPG leaker Midori, who <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1801044892300267796">revealed themselves</a> to be a previously blacklisted male American leaker who resurfaced under the guise of a Japanese woman (complete with tweets apparently composed deliberately in broken English, ew). Prior to their admittance of being a fraud, Midori had been sharing apparent details about a Final Fantasy Tactics remaster. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">Eurogamer</a>.)</p>
<p>Though the truth of the Tactics remaster was called into question following Midori’s fall from grace - the account was also found to have made inaccurate claims about upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions of Mana</a> - Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier jumped in to add some weight to the claims.</p>
<p>“The Final Fantasy Tactics remaster is real and happening,” Schreier <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/comment/l8aa74v/">responded</a> to a thread discussing the credibility of the details on Reddit.</p>

<p>Schreier’s report - brief as it is - contrasts comments made by Tactics director Yasumi Matsuno in December, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1729771931522470343?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1729771931522470343%7Ctwgr%5E5e6d5af26c884fa458dd8e1c1bab4bacc7ac0b9c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffinal-fantasy-tactics-remaster-rumours-squashed-by-director">told a fan on TwiXer</a> that “currently, there are no plans for remastering [Tactics]”.</p>
<p>If a Tactics remake does find its way onto PC, it’ll mark the first time that the 1997 spin-off has been officially available to play away from the original PlayStation. A revamped version of Tactics, subtitled The War of the Lions, featuring full-motion cutscenes, an expanded roster of characters and multiplayer, as well as a 16:9 resolution, was released for the PlayStation Portable in 2007, before later finding its way onto mobile.</p>
<p>The closest that Tactics has come to PC to date is MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, which used its world of Ivalice (shared with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a>) and an alternative storyline as inspiration for the Return to Ivalice series of raids.</p>

As the definitive version of 2021’s <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, <em>Vengeance </em>is a stellar turn-based adventure that I can easily recommend to RPG fans and monster collecting fanatics alike. For <em>Persona </em>fans who are curious about the series those games spun off from, this is a great place to start.</p><p>Of course, if you’re new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei—</em>or it’s just been a while since you played it—you may have some trouble getting your bearings. After all, the series has a (frankly overexaggerated) reputation for its difficulty. So to help you on your way, here are 10 tips that should help ease you into the opening hours of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-recommend-id="image://eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Essence screen in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Essence screen in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-recommend-id="image://eb31bda6355b3e9a315ef5f17eb29846" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Essence screen in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Essences in <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>are kind of like TMs from the <em>Pokemon </em>games—they’ll let you improve and embellish your party’s skills. By using them on either your protagonist or your demons in the World of Shadows (which will appear at the Leyline Fount save points once you’ve made enough story progress), you can learn spells that help round out your party’s elemental coverage. You may feel tempted to hold onto your Essences in case you need them later, but I’d strongly advise against this.</p><p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> gives out Essences like candy. You may have difficulty grinding out a specific Essence in some cases, but generally speaking, you’ll only find progressively better Essences as you progress. By the time you’ve spent only a few hours in Da’at, you’ll already find Essences that outclass the ones you started out with. Don’t struggle trying to make your party’s default skill sets work; use what you got to flesh out your kits! </p><p> Remember, Demons can pass on skills whenever you fuse them, including ones they’ve learned via Essences. Additionally, as you advance the main story, you’ll have the option of buying Essences from the Cadaver’s Hollow shop. <em>Vengeance </em>even marks Essences you can purchase with a distinct symbol (pictured above). So if you’re the type who plays <em>Final Fantasy </em>games feeling too afraid to ever use a Megalixir, that should ease your anxiety.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-recommend-id="image://58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Battling in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Battling in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-recommend-id="image://58fc65f9ca372198c0965bce55d45f7d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Battling in Shin Megami Tensei V." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Another cool feature of Essences is that you can use them to change your protagonist’s weaknesses and resistances. This does require the “Divine Amalgamation” Miracle, but you’ll fortunately gain access to this early in the game. By selecting “Essence Fusion’’ and then “Affinities,” after selecting your protagonist in the World of Shadows, you can select which monster’s defenses you’d wish the Nahobino to mirror. You’ll want to do this as soon as you find a suitable Essence, as by default, your Protagonist has a dangerous weakness to Mudo.</p><p>For those new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>games, Hama and Mudo (the Light and Darkness elements, respectively) have unique properties. Not only do these elements inflict damage in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, they can instantly KO anyone who is weak to them. Considering that you’ll instantly get a Game Over if your protagonist loses all his health, sticking him with a perpetual Mudo weakness is courting disaster. All it takes is one unlucky battle where the enemies attack first and you’ll immediately lose all your progress without recourse.</p><p>For the early game, <strong>Cait Sith </strong>and <strong>Halphas </strong>are <em>mostly </em>neutral Essences that should keep your protagonist from becoming a liability. <strong>Unicorn </strong>and <strong>Apsaras </strong>are also helpful, as they pack resistances to the <strong>Charm </strong>status effect as well. We’ll get back to why this is important later. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-recommend-id="image://c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big save swirl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big save swirl." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-recommend-id="image://c655d580970038440d0eeba1acaae67f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A big save swirl." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Even if you protect your protagonist from instant-death spells, your party is far from invincible. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> doesn’t have random battles, but you never know when a quest or a story beat is going to lead into a boss fight. You can’t predict the future, but you can prepare for it by saving as frequently as you can.</p><p>Fortunately, <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>allows players to save at any time. In fact, there’s a shortcut for it (Left on the D-Pad for controller users, the “4” key for those using a mouse and keyboard). You can save by visiting Leyline Founts too, but you don’t <em>have </em>to use those. Aogami will warn you when boss battles are coming up in the main story, so those are always a good time to save. But whenever you’re approaching side quest objectives, you should record your progress just in case. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-recommend-id="image://2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's a matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a matador." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-recommend-id="image://2a12dc0c7af7576d3703555a903de432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="It's a matador." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Items are incredibly useful in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>. They essentially give any human characters access to on-demand healing <em>and </em>a full array of elemental attacks, which can easily turn the tides in battle when you’re in a pinch. While you’ll want to keep at least a few of each item on hand, prioritize grabbing Spyglasses as soon as you access the Cadaver’s Hollow shop.</p><p>Spyglasses are your “Scan” spell. They instantly reveal an enemy’s weaknesses and their moveset, which is invaluable in boss battles. While you <em>can </em>ascertain this information via trial and error, you’ll typically waste turns in battle while running the risk that the enemy might block or reflect your attacks. Spyglasses are so cheap that you don’t have much of an excuse not to use them. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-recommend-id="image://c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient apostrophe, Mitama." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sentient apostrophe, Mitama." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-recommend-id="image://c0fb6c307d2930b5a0a36e5b91acb428" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sentient apostrophe, Mitama." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re a fan of the <em>Persona </em>series, you’ve probably fused a Mitama once or twice before. However, in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, Mitama are much more than generic demons. Instead, these are your equivalent to the Metal Slimes in <em>Dragon Quest</em>, or Audino in <em>Pokemon Black &amp; White</em>. Mitamas drop valuable loot when defeated, including consumable items to level up your party and relics you can sell for cash.</p><p>You’ll occasionally see Mitama roaming the overworld. If you have a demon companion, they might dig up a Mitama when they spot points of interest too. The catch is that Mitamas resist all but one element that’s randomized every battle, and if you don’t kill it on turn one, it’ll most likely run away. This is another reason why Spyglasses are so valuable: they all but guarantee a successful encounter with a Mitama.</p><p>When you encounter a Mitama, have the Nahobino use a Spyglass. If it’s weak to an element that your active party can’t use, let the next party member switch out for one who knows the spell you need. Let the remaining party members use “Pass,” which will trigger extra turns that will let you wrap around to the ally whose spell you need. Defeat the Mitama, collect your rewards, and repeat whenever the opportunity arises.</p><p>Alternatively, the Almighty element essentially indicates that an attack is neutral. Enemies aren’t weak to it, but neither do they resist it. So once your party starts to learn some Almighty moves, you can use these during Mitama encounters as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-recommend-id="image://44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Caspar the friendly ghost wears a fox hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Caspar the friendly ghost wears a fox hat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-recommend-id="image://44fb714bde1aded8c3f22f95615347fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Caspar the friendly ghost wears a fox hat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>doesn’t necessarily have many “best spells,” since an attack that dominates one boss battle could be useless in the next. However, buff and debuff skills are almost always worth having on your team. Even a strong boss monster can feel like a common enemy encounter after you lower its attack, defenses, and accuracy.</p><p>Granted, you don’t want to go too overboard on support skills. Meticulously casting Tarujaka eight times to boost your party’s offenses isn’t necessarily great turn economy. But considering the sheer number of monsters you can keep in your party at any time, you’d do well to diversify your buff and debuffs just as much as your elemental coverage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-recommend-id="image://19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The extraordinarily detailed stat screen for Kikuri-Hime." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The extraordinarily detailed stat screen for Kikuri-Hime." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-recommend-id="image://19b81ae01c413654d3499c68cba03709" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The extraordinarily detailed stat screen for Kikuri-Hime." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of elemental coverage, don’t make the mistake of only focusing on your offenses without paying attention to your defenses. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>uses the series’ signature “Press Turn” battle system, which rewards your party with extra turns whenever you hit an enemy’s weakness or score a critical hit. However, this <em>also </em>applies to the enemy party. Even if your demon can shrug off taking the extra damage of an attack it’s weak to, it’ll put your entire party at risk of a wipe if an enemy party exploits that weakness to hit you up to six more times in a single turn.</p><p>For this reason, you often don’t want to assign specific niches to each party member that no one else can fill. Instead, spread your support skills and elemental attacks across demons with varying weaknesses to avoid the risk of letting an enemy pin you. Additionally, passive skills like Resist Fire can cover up a demon’s weakness and make it viable in more encounters. If a boss monster is giving you trouble, focus on building demons that best resist its attacks.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-recommend-id="image://3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue-haired lady stares in astonishment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blue-haired lady stares in astonishment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-recommend-id="image://3de480ef4c9b6475047c3d5edd89f8f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A blue-haired lady stares in astonishment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This tip’s a bit more specific than the others.

You’ll encounter a recurring boss early on in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>whose signature move is a party-wide Charm spell, which can massively debilitate your entire party. If you aren’t prepared to counter status ailments, this enemy in particular can turn into a real pain.</p><p>To handle this, <strong>Apsaras </strong>is one of the lowest level demons you can find who has full immunity to Charm. Additionally, she naturally learns Petra, which cleanses an ally of status ailment. Later, you can also fuse Vouivre, who carries the <strong>Willpower </strong>innate skill. Willpower specifically minimizes the effects of Charm as long as she’s in the party, allowing you to (somewhat) circumvent the entire mechanic.</p><p>Remember, Amrita Soda also cleanses status ailments, and any human character can use items. Use this to your advantage!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b680703dd4a7c31cb3169272a1d7c689" data-recommend-id="image://b680703dd4a7c31cb3169272a1d7c689" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chatting with a winged demon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chatting with a winged demon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b680703dd4a7c31cb3169272a1d7c689" data-recommend-id="image://b680703dd4a7c31cb3169272a1d7c689" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chatting with a winged demon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the primary ways you’ll recruit new demons to your party is by using the “Talk” option in battle. You’ll typically have to gauge their responses and eventually coerce them to join by giving them gifts. However, if you already have a particular demon in your active party, the Talk option becomes a Get Out Of Jail Free card.</p><p>Typically this will make the enemy say something along the lines of “take care of my buddy!” and then leave with no questions asked. Sometimes, they’ll even give you money and items. This is an especially handy trick if you get stuck in a battle you don’t want to fight, as using the Escape option can fail on you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3515f32c5ad97e9f6dea92a8a1ee348d" data-recommend-id="image://3515f32c5ad97e9f6dea92a8a1ee348d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our blue-haired protagonist walks through a dusty city street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our blue-haired protagonist walks through a dusty city street." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3515f32c5ad97e9f6dea92a8a1ee348d" data-recommend-id="image://3515f32c5ad97e9f6dea92a8a1ee348d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our blue-haired protagonist walks through a dusty city street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V </em>has so much for you to see and do at any given moment. It can feel overwhelming at times, especially if you’re just wondering when the next story beat will finally pop up. But to really get the most out of the game, your best option is to simply take your time.</p><p>You’ll inevitably reach points where your party is too under-leveled, either because you’re stuck on a boss or you need to get stronger to recruit new demons. And, sure, you could grind regular encounters to level up, but where’s the fun in that? Taking the time to uncover new corners of the map and complete side quests will naturally take care of that grind for you, plus you’ll earn several key items in the process. You might not need every Magatsuhi skill in the game, but you’ll enjoy having them nonetheless.</p><p>So much of <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>’s appeal comes from getting lost in its mechanics. Fusing the perfect monsters and uncovering cool new combat synergies can consume hours of your life alone. So relax, take in the sights, and only advance to your next story objective when you feel ready to. And please, for the love of whatever god rules over Da’at, don’t lose an hour of progress because your main character has a Mudo weakness. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of Echoes' new activities is available from the start of the Episode, but the second, Enigma Protocol, requires uncovering some secrets on Nessus to access.</p><p dir="ltr">Enigma Protocol sends you back into the Vex Network, that strange, ethereal computer world that players first explored during the Season of the Splicer two years ago. It's a tough, high-level activity for three players that has you constantly running against a timer; if the timer runs out, you have to start the activity over.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot to know about Enigma Protocol, starting with how to unlock the mission through the Encoded Log quest.

Instead, you'll have to complete some tasks for Failsafe, the Episode's primary vendor. Start by completing the introductory mission to Echoes; it'll load automatically when you log in after completing the campaign for The Final Shape. If for some reason you miss it or come back later, look for the node to start the mission on the Nessus Director screen.</p><p dir="ltr">After the introductory mission and a bout of the new Breach Executable activity, return to Failsafe. She should eventually have a new quest for you, called <strong>Encoded Log</strong>. Grab that and read the description: It'll tell you that some Hidden agents have been picking up on some weirdness on Nessus, specifically in the <strong>Well of Echoes</strong> location.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find the Well of Echoes in the area called The Tangle. Transmat in and ride your sparrow over to the big cylindrical structure on the western end of the area. Head inside and continue delving downward until you reach a teleporter. Through it, the path will continue to take you downward, until you meet a mess of enemies. Leading them is a shielded Minotaur, and you'll see Vex cubes in the air that will need to be destroyed in order to make the Minotaur vulnerable.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep killing enemies and damaging the Minotaur until the room is clear. This will open a way into a hole in the ground, the bottom of which you won't be able to see. Jump down and continue through the underground tunnels until you reach a mission flag for Enigma Protocol.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've located and activated this flag, Enigma Protocol will be available from the HELM screen on the Director, so you won't need to make this trip again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_Enigma_Protocol_Works_And_How_To_Extend_The_Timer">How Enigma Protocol Works And How To Extend The Timer</h2><p dir="ltr">Enigma Protocol is a little different from most other Destiny 2 activities. It's not a straight fight where you need to kill a certain number of enemies or gather a certain resource. Instead, it's basically a race through the Vex Network, where what you're actually trying to beat is the clock. The activity is broken up between a few long platforming sections and some objective-based arena fights that are more meant to waylay you.</p><p dir="ltr">Chiefly, though, except for one big boss fight before the end of activity, Enigma Protocol is not about fighting all that much. Most of the time, you're racing to complete an objective or pass through an area, and stopping to shoot all the enemies you see is actually detrimental. There are a few points where you'll be forced to stop for a battle, but these also always have specific requirements that you're trying to complete as quickly as possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318952-enigmaprotocolsecuritynode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318952-enigmaprotocolsecuritynode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318952"></a><figcaption>Shoot these golden security nodes to add 30 seconds to your timer. There will be three in each distinct area of Enigma Protocol.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318952-enigmaprotocolsecuritynode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most important piece of information to know about Enigma Protocol is how the timer works. When you first enter the activity, you'll have a timer that ticks down from 1 minute. The landscape will turn red when you have less than a minute left on the timer, letting you know just how dire things are getting (it'll be green otherwise). However, you can extend the timer in two ways: First, by <strong>shooting yellow diamond constructs</strong> that are hidden throughout each room of the activity, each of which will give you an additional 30 seconds; and second, by <strong>killing Harpies that appear in the fight arenas, called Archival Timekeepers</strong>. You'll know which Harpies are the Timekeepers by the fact that they spawn inside a white dome that you'll have to break in order to shoot at them. Always try to find and kill the Timekeepers whenever they appear, as they also add 30 seconds to your timer. They tend to show up in the middle of and/or at the end of any arena-based portion of the activity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318901-enigmaprotocolarchivaltimekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318901" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318901-enigmaprotocolarchivaltimekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318901"></a><figcaption>Watch for a message that notifies you an Archival Timekeeper has spawned, then find its white dome and kill it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318901-enigmaprotocolarchivaltimekeeper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you don't <em>have to </em>stop and kill enemies, it's better to try to keep moving. Bring powerful weapons for killing enemies and destroying the nodes that provide you with more time at a decent distance, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-call-god-roll-guide-how-to-get-it-and-god-rolls/1100-6524253/" data-ref-id="1100-6524253">The Call</a> or a machine gun. You'll also want something that can very quickly destroy Detain bubbles if you get caught in one, or kill the drones that create them before they hit you.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a good idea to bring your Power level up as close to 2005 as you can, or to run this event with high-level teammates (who can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-quickly-level-up-your-power-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-how-it-works/1100-6523930/" data-ref-id="1100-6523930">increase your Power level through the new Fireteam Power system</a>). There's no penalty for dying except the wasted time, but the enemies in here can be dangerous, especially if you're not powered up. You'll appreciate the survivability offered by bringing your Power up before trying Enigma Protocol.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Enigma_Protocol_Encounters">Enigma Protocol Encounters</h2><p dir="ltr">When you enter Enigma Protocol, you'll go through the same series of encounters, at least so far. It's possible this could rotate weekly or with each new Act of the Episode, so if that's the case, we'll update this guide as necessary. For now, here's everything we've seen in Enigma Protocol.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_1">Networked Grid-1</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318897-enigmaprotocol1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318897" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318897-enigmaprotocol1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318897"></a><figcaption>Networked Grid-1 is a straight shot to the portal, so avoid getting caught up fighting enemies if you can.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318897-enigmaprotocol1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you first enter Enigma Protocol, you'll be dropped into a long linear platforming path called Networked Grid-1. Your goal is to cross this to the far side ahead of you, where a portal waits. You drop right in front of the yellow node that weakens security and adds time to your clock. There are two more of those in this room, usually hidden below your line of sight or around corners, so check around for them as you make your way to the end. When you've destroyed them all, you'll see a notification that says "Zone security cleared!" to let you know there aren't any more nodes to search for.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, you don't have to kill all the enemies in this room; in fact, only shoot the ones that are in your way or particularly hazardous. Watch out for the Minotaur and Harpies near the exit portal, as they can be dangerous.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_1">Experimental Grid-1</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318902-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318902" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318902-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318902"></a><figcaption>Charge the orange balls in these Vex Charging Pools to fill the meter at the top of your screen, then dunk the balls in the waiting receptacles in the center of the arena.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318902-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you clear the portal of Networked Grid-1, you'll enter your first objective arena. You can't continue from here until you've completed the objective, but killing enemies is secondary; ignore them if you can, or only focus on the ones that are particularly dangerous.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first enter the arena, you'll see an orange ball in a column of light, waiting for you. This is the objective--one of your teammates needs to grab this ball and charge it up to full power, as measured by a meter called Radiolite Circuit Charge, that appears on your screen when you pick it up. You can charge the ball by standing in these wells of light, but note that they'll change position every so often, forcing you to move around. The ball maintains a charge even if a player dies and drops it, so if the ball falls, quickly grab it and keep charging.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the meter is full, dunk the ball in one of the two receptacles in the center of the room. That'll activate a Vex launcher that will send you on to the next area. Note also that there are three more security nodes for increasing your timer in this room. You'll usually get an Archival Timekeeper to spawn here as well, which will give you another 30 seconds if you kill it.</p><p dir="ltr">With your back to the door you entered the room through, the Vex launcher that sends you to the next area will be on the left, close to the entrance. It sends you back in the direction you entered from.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_2">Networked Grid-2</h3><p dir="ltr">The second Networked Grid portion is another platforming run, but this one is much more involved than before. As usual, there are three security nodes to find along the way. Speed here is important, but take your time and hit your jumps, as a few can be pretty precarious. Falling and dying usually won't penalize you too much, but sometimes you'll respawn much further back than you expect, forcing you to cover the same ground twice, costing you time.</p><p dir="ltr">The path can be twisting, so if you get confused as to where to go, look for pathways that let you go around blind corners or ledges that are above and behind you. You'll pass through two different portals, with the second one to your next objective arena.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_2">Experimental Grid-2</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318900-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318900" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318900-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318900"></a><figcaption>Throw the orange balls at the shielded Harpies to complete this encounter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318900-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This room is more of a fight than the ones before it or after it. Your goal is to destroy the nine shielded Harpies in the center of the room, floating in the air. To do that, you need to kill a batch of Goblins. There will be three batches: The first will spawn in the center of the room, the second on the left, and the third on the right. Be careful, as they're backed up by Harpies and a Minotaur, and can be dangerous in a group.</p><p dir="ltr">When you kill the goblins, they'll drop more of those orange balls. Pick one up and throw it at a shielded Harpy to destroy it. You'll get three balls in each of the three locations, for a total of nine.</p><p dir="ltr">As before, there are three security nodes in this room to destroy, and an Archival Timekeeper will spawn partway through completing the objective, as well. Take out all of them to maximize your time.</p><p dir="ltr">When all the Harpies are dead, a Vex portal will appear in the center of the room, allowing you to press on.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bridge_1">Bridge-1</h3><p dir="ltr">The next area is part platforming and part sparrow track. Follow the platforming path until you see a ring ahead, floating in the air, with a silver diamond in the middle of it. Shoot the diamond to create the track beneath you. Drop down and you'll hop on your sparrow automatically. As you're riding, try to hit the white spaces on the track to boost your speed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318893-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingbridge1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318893-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingbridge1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318893"></a><figcaption>Look for the security node right when you land, on your right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318893-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingbridge1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Two of the three security nodes in this area are in the platforming section. Look for the first to your right just as you enter Bridge-1; the second is behind you just as you land after taking the two Vex launchers. The final security nodes is on the right side of the track where it's separated by a column of architecture.</p><p dir="ltr">Race to the end of the track and you'll get your first breather and your first Enigma Protocol chest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Archival_Grid_1">Archival Grid-1</h3><p dir="ltr">This room lets you chill out for a bit, as the timer is paused while you're here. You'll receive a chest in the center of the room, and you can interact with the white Vex Constructs around the room to gather some data that (kind of) advances the plot of this story and activity. At the far end of the room are your two options: a Vex portal that allows you to continue, with a spot to drop a Rally flag, and a green control node that you can activate to reboot the activity and start from the beginning, if you're not happy with your run. There are a few reasons you might want to do that. First, if you're not happy with your remaining time, you can restart from here with something to show for your efforts and give the whole run another try. You can also farm that first chest for faster rewards than a full run, especially if you're just looking for new rolls on Episode weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also a pair of Triumphs tied to Enigma Protocol that are essential for the Episode seal, including clearing all the security nodes in a single run and completing a full run in less than 18 minutes. If you're trying to achieve either and you're already feeling like this run is blown, the reboot allows you to try again without having to complete a scuffed run.</p><p dir="ltr">Archival Grid-1 is also a good stopping point for players who don't want to commit to the whole run in a similar way that last season's activity, The Coil, let players drop in and out at specific stopping points. You might lose players here as people drop out, so a reboot can be a better approach than trying to continue under circumstances that aren't ideal. All three players will need to vote to reboot in order for that restart to happen.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_4">Networked Grid-4</h3><p dir="ltr">This is another run. Jump up into the round area at the start. There are a lot of enemies here, so while you don't want to get too bogged down, it might be a good idea to clear some out so you can safely move on. A Vex Hydra waits for you just ahead, and the next hallway is littered with lasers you'll need to jump over. As usual, there are three security nodes along the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318894-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318894-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318894"></a><figcaption>Another security node that's right in front of you when you arrive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318894-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid4.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_3">Experimental Grid-3</h3><p dir="ltr">This is another room that's full of enemies but in which you don't really need to fight apart from dropping anything that's particularly bothersome. Instead, your job is to pick up 20 pink Motes of Encrypted Golden Age Data. To get those, you want to look up at the big scaffolding thing in the middle of the room. On it, you'll see pink bulbs like fruit on a tree--much like one of the objectives in Breach Executable. Shooting those bulbs will drop one of the pink nodes, so your primary focus should be on shooting every one you see and picking up the node that drops from it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318903-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318903-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318903"></a><figcaption>Shoot these pink bulbs hanging from the Vex architecture. You need to pick up 20 of the pink Motes these drop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318903-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As usual, you've got three more security nodes in this room, mostly scattered around the edges and above your line of sight. It's possible another Archival Timekeeper will spawn here before you leave, so kill it if it does.</p><p dir="ltr">The portal out of Experimental Grid-3 leads to another long platforming section, this one marked by big gaps and narrow pathways. Be careful of enemies waiting for you on the path, particularly where you're going to land when you jump or use a launcher. Look for three more security nodes here as you go.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Experimental_Grid_4">Experimental Grid-4</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the big boss fight of the activity: a huge Vex minotaur boss called Ainigmatos, the Indecipherable Proto-Mind. It can be tough to fight, with lots of smaller enemies damaging you while you try to hurt the boss, who has a lot of health and teleports around the arena. Keep moving and try not to get caught up fighting small enemies or getting blasted by them; weapons like rocket launchers can be pretty effective in doing a lot of damage quickly, as can burst Supers like Golden Gun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318951-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318951-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318951"></a><figcaption>Ainigmatos can be tough to kill quickly, thanks to the fact it moves around a big arena filled with smaller threats.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318951-enigmaprotocolexperimentalgrid4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trick here is to use the power-ups around the arena to give yourself an edge, in particular the Shield one that increases your damage resistance, and the Super one that gives you a big chunk of Super charge. Note that these don't respawn, so only pick them up when you need them, or you could waste them.</p><p dir="ltr">With a team of three people who are pretty on the ball, Ainigmatos isn't too difficult to take down, but the fight can be time-consuming since he moves around so much. Look for three security nodes here, as well as Archival Timekeepers, who will show up periodically near where you first entered the arena. Kill those to keep your timer up.</p><p dir="ltr">When Ainigmatos goes down, don't drop your guard. You'll notice the timer is still going--you still need to get back to an Archival Grid room to end the activity and get your reward. A portal will appear in the center of the room, so jump through that as quickly as you can for your last challenge.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Networked_Grid_3">Networked Grid-3</h3><p dir="ltr">Not sure why this is numbered the way it is, but regardless, you'll drop onto another sparrow race track to make your way out of the Vex network before you're expelled. All the security nodes in this area are on the track. The first is right next to where you start on the track; the second is on the right side of the column just ahead of where you start; and the third is on top of a column just past a ramp, so hit the speed booster to make sure you get the air to nail it as you go across.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318895-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid31.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318895" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318895-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid31.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318895"></a><figcaption>Go to the right side of this column to hit the security node.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318895-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid31.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Zip to the end of the track to reach the end of the activity, where you'll get another rewards chest and the opportunity to interact with another Vex construct.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318896-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid32.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318896" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318896-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid32.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318896"></a><figcaption>Hit the speed booster just ahead of this ramp so you can get enough air to hit the security node on the other side of the gap.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318896-enigmaprotocolsecuritythingnetworkedgrid32.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you've bested Enigma Protocol, check out the rest of our Destiny 2 coverage at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a>, and read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">review of The Final Shape</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Extended 12 Minutes Of Gameplay Walkthrough | Ubisoft Forward</p>
      </div>
<p>Ubisoft has said Infinity--now Animus hub--was created in response to fans who have asked for a "more cohesive approach" to the Assassin's Creed series.</p><p>The specifics remain unknown, but it sounds like Animus hub is similar to Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which is a product that has multiple Halo games within it. Call of Duty does something similar as well, as the latest Call of Duty titles all launch from within an app called Call of Duty HQ.</p><p>Assassin's Creed: Shadows releases this November for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. The game takes players back in time to 16th century Japan and features two playable protagonists.</p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The final <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Live Letter from the Producers before <em>Dawntrail </em>happened today, June 14, and viewers were given a myriad of sneak peaks. From new Tomestones to a glimpse of The Arcadion, here’s everything we learned.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">Right from the jump, viewers were inundated with new information in the form of the official launch trailer for <em>Dawntrail</em>, featuring gameplay footage and story prologue, as well as an introduction to a new character:</p> <figure data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Launch Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7BghYTigv8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">After showing the trailer, Yoshi informed us that the team is still on track for early access release on June 28, so we’re not likely to face any delays as we did in the run-up to <em>Endwalker</em>. Some viewers asked if Yoshida will be getting a summer holiday after all of his hard work, but he stated that he’s already working on the story for 8.0, so that’s unlikely to happen.</p> <p data-characters="62" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">Beyond that, here’s everything we were told about <em>Dawntrail</em>:</p>
 <h2 id="h-new-content" data-injectable="false"><strong>New Content</strong></h2> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">We were given glimpses into a few new duties, including the first dungeon of <em>Dawntrail </em>and the level 93 Trial which will see us facing off against Valigarmanda. We learned that the boss during this Trial will alter its appearance, and also told of a new addition to the UI. Information regarding upcoming attacks will now be displayed in the middle of the screen.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Very excitingly, we were also given a brief glimpse into the 8-player raid series The Arcadion, which really is a live tournament complete with audience and commentary:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Hilariously, Yoshi and the team were trying to keep the name of the first tier of The Arcadion a secret, but neglected to remove the duty list from their stream, therefore giving away the name. As such, I think I’m allowed to reveal that the first tier of The Arcadion will be Light Heavyweight. Presumably, the weight class will increase with each tier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">The first tier of The Arcadion will be added in patch 7.01, which is due to be implemented on July 16. The Savage variant will be added in patch 7.05, due to release on July 30.&nbsp;We’re also getting a new Treasure Dungeon added in 7.05, called Cenote Ja Ja Gural.</p> <h2 id="h-new-tomestones" data-injectable="false"><strong>New Tomestones</strong></h2> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">It was revealed that the next iteration of Allagan Tomestones will be called Aesthetics, while the capped version will be called Tomestones of Heliometry and will arrive with patch 7.05. We were also shown some of the gear which will be available in exchange for Heliometry.</p>
 <h2 id="h-new-characters" data-injectable="false"><strong>New characters</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">After briefly going over already established characters, we were given more information about four new characters we’ll meet in our journey. From left to right:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Zoraal Ja</strong> is the First Promise of Tulliyolal and Commander of the Landsguard. Sibling to Wuk Lumat, he’s considered the foremost candidate in the Rite to Succession, so it’s likely we’ll face off against him at some point.</li> <li><strong>Koana</strong> is another sibling of Wuk Lumat, adopted by Gulool Ja Ja. He wants to drag Tuliyollal into the future using technology and innovation.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Bakool Ja Ja</strong> is the only candidate in the Rite of Succession who isn’t part of the family of the current ruler, instead having won his place through Martial Tournament. He is contemptuous of others and considers anyone with one head to be inferior.</li> <li>The <strong>“Enigmatic Maiden”</strong> remains largely a mystery, and we weren’t told much about her other than there are some secrets in her story.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-new-items" data-injectable="false"><strong>New items</strong></h2> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Towards the end of the Live Letter, Yoshi showed off some of the minions and mounts we can look forward to collecting in <em>Dawntrail</em>. The most exciting reveal was the theme of the next set of Trial mounts, which take the shape of something that players have been wanting for a long time — wings. Actual wings, which attach to your back and make you fly. Glorious.</p>
 <p data-characters="36" data-current-count="36" data-injectable="false">Here’s some of the minions we saw:</p> <figure data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">At one point, while showing off some new screenshots of Solution 9 featuring cars and motorbikes, Yoshida started to describe a new mount which apparently “transforms”. Sadly, we didn’t get to see this mount in action, but here’s what we did see, including those precious wings:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="170" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">We also saw some of the new gear we can expect to get in a variety of ways, although it’s uncertain how to get most of these items. We saw three different sets of gear:</p>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">One which will be gained with Heliometry:</p> <figure data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">One which will be crafted:</p> <figure data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="38" data-injectable="false">And this final set of unknown origins:</p> <figure data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshots via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Although any updates to housing will be coming&nbsp; much later during the 7.X series, we were shown a new house design, which looks like a fairytale cottage and comes complete with functioning treehouse feature:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Final Fantasy XIV YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-new-quests" data-injectable="false"><strong>New quests</strong></h2> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">There will be five new role quests available for Disciples of War and Magic classes to complete, one for each of the roles and unlocking at level 92. We were told that, at some point in one of the questlines, a Namazu will be making an appearance. Completing all five Role Quests will unlock a further quest to complete.</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">There will also be five new classes for Disciples of the Hand and Land to complete, named “Wachumeqimeqi Deliveries”, though we weren’t told at which level these would unlock. Completing all five will unlock an additional quest. The questlines will be split into the following groups:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="true"> <li>Blacksmith/Armorer/Goldsmith</li> <li>Carpenter/Leatherworker/Weaver</li> <li>Alchemist/Culinarian</li> <li>Miner/Botanist</li> <li>Fisher</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">While we weren’t told much about Viper and Pictomancer Job Quests, we were given a glimpse into their content in the form of screenshots. Through these, we know that the Viper quests will see us return to areas from <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, while Pictomancer quests will take us to Kugane, alongside at least one Moogle.</p> <h2 id="h-disciple-of-the-land-and-hand-updates" data-injectable="false"><strong>Disciple of the Land and Hand updates</strong></h2> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">All DoH/DoL classes will be getting new actions and traits, as well as a new Orange Scrip. Master Recipes will become available for Crafters with the implementation of patch 7.05 on July 30.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="47" data-current-count="47" data-injectable="false">Gatherers will benefit from additional updates:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false"> <li>Integrity will now be displayed in the gathering interface</li> <li>Fish Guide will now display the type of hook required for a catch</li> <li>New Regional Folklore</li> <li>New gathering points</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-other-adjustments" data-injectable="false"><strong>Other adjustments</strong></h2> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"> <li>Maximum amount of Bicolor Gemstones a player can possess will increase from 1,000 to 1,500</li> <li>Emotes and Recipes needed for quests will be accessible from the duty list</li> <li>Facewear will get its own slot in the character window <ul> <li>Clicking this slot will bring up all available face accessories, each accessory will come in 12 different colors and doesn’t affect stats</li> </ul> </li> <li>Some pieces of gear will have two dye slots, including all newly added gear.

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Minecraft’s</em> 1.21 update introduced the mace, a melee weapon that gets its uniqueness from damage that directly scales with fall damage. Not only can you use it to eliminate fall damage altogether in some cases, but using enchantments like Breach lets you shred through some of the game’s toughest enemies.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-breach-enchantment-in-minecraft" data-injectable="false">How to get the Breach Enchantment in Minecraft</h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">You can find the Breach enchantment in an enchanted book or through an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-minecraft-enchanting-table-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enchanting table.</a> However, since it’s a mace-exclusive enchantment, you’ll have to use your mace in your enchanting table for a chance to find it. You can also randomly find it in enchanting books within underground structures or villager trading, but the odds are low compared to more common enchantments like unbreaking, protection, and sharpness.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Just be careful, as you’re not guaranteed to find it right away while enchanting, especially if you have a low-level enchanting table. You’re much more likely to find it with level 30 enchantments, but you can encounter level one and two versions of Breach at lower levels. </p> <figure data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Make sure you’re not applying the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-the-density-enchantment-in-minecraft-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">density enchantment</a> instead by hovering over your enchant options. It’s impossible to get Breach on a mace that already has smite, bane of arthropods, or density enchantments in vanilla <em>Minecraft</em>, making this a great way to tell whether your next enchantment will have Breach at all. While you can use console commands to apply them all, you won’t be able to use them all together in a regular game. </p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">In short, if your mace already has one of these three enchantments, you’ll have to create a new mace or remove the enchantments to use Breach. Similarly, if you hover over an enchantment and see density appear, you’ll know you won’t get the Breach enchantment and will have to try again with a new set of enchants.</p> <h2 id="h-how-the-breach-enchantment-works-in-minecraft" data-injectable="false">How the Breach Enchantment works in Minecraft</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">Breach is a mace enchantment that reduces armor’s effectiveness, making enemies and other players less tanky. There are four enchantment levels, with the lowest decreasing armor effectiveness by 15 percent and the highest, level four, reducing it by 60 percent. While its power isn’t too noticeable with regular leather armor, having diamond or netherite armor with protection IV is where its strength truly shines. </p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="false">This effect also impacts natural armor that creatures like zombies, shulkers, and even the Wither boss have. If you’re fighting against any of these enemies, you’ll have a much easier time fighting them than with a regular sword, even if it has sharpness or other damage enchantments. However, it won’t make much difference against enemies like spiders or creepers with no armor buffs.</p>

            <p>Look, everyone wants to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> on PC. It’s one of those universally accepted truths, like gravity or pizza being delicious. And, yes, nobody really knows why Bloodborne isn’t on PC yet, almost a decade after it released on PlayStation 4 - despite Sony’s apparent delight in bringing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-comes-to-pc-in-may">every</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-resurrects-on-pc-on-march-3rd-2023">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horizon-forbidden-west-follows-zero-dawn-onto-pc-with-a-complete-edition-release-in-early-2024">PlayStation</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-heads-to-pc-with-dlss-ultrawide-support-and-a-psn-requirement-for-some-reason">exclusive</a> to PC, just to mock us.

<p>As if to keep repeatedly adding insult - or at least mild disappointment - to the injury of every State of Play going by without a Bloodborne PC announcement, the game’s developers and director have confirmed that, yes, of course they <em>also </em>want Bloodborne to release on PC - even if they probably can’t admit that.</p>
<p>The latest confirmation of something everyone already knew came via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/hidetaka-miyazaki-knows-for-a-fact-other-fromsoftware-devs-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble-but-its-nothing-im-opposed-to/">chirpy RPS fanzine PC Gamer</a>, who recently spoke with From’s president and Souls mastermind/sadist Hidetaka Miyazaki. PCG followed up on Miyazaki’s recent comments that From don’t even own the rights to the Bloodborne IP - the PlayStation ‘sclusy sits with Sony, unlike the multiplatform Dark Souls games - by asking whether the director would personally like to see it get a PC release. Of course he would!</p>
<p>“I know for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port,” Miyazaki replied, indicating producer Yasuhiro Kitao and interpreter Bobby Simpson. As for Miyazaki himself, however, he can’t officially say a definitive yes (presumably because Sony will summon down a eldritch monstrosity bearing a blood sword inscribed with “IP RIGHTS”), having to settle for a diplomatic admission that he at least wouldn’t stand in the way of Bloodborne coming to PC: “If I say I want one, I'll get in trouble as well. But it's nothing I'm opposed to.”</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony/FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Miyazaki continued by saying that he’d unsurprisingly like as many people as possible to enjoy Bloodborne - which releasing it on more than one obsolete console platform would certainly help with.</p>
<p>“Especially as a game that is now coming of age, one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware - I think any game like that, it'd be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s not like the obsessive hunting for any sign of a Bloodborne PC port ever really stop, but the decade-long anticipation has recently been reheated by cameos from the player character Hunter and Lady Maria - a boss from DLC The Old Hunters - in upcoming PS5 platformer Astro Bot, which sparked the imagination of those awaiting news of PC and PS5 versions. Bad news (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-is-coming-to-pc-rumours-claim">again</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-playstation-fans-are-only-happy-with-pc-releases-taking-place-2-3-years-later-surely-bloodborne-must-be-next-yeah">again</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodborne-on-pc-somehow-looks-even-less-likely-as-director-suggests-we-might-be-waiting-for-ps6-first">again</a>): developers Team Asobi have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-secret-meaning-behind-bloodborne-in-astro-bot-says-creative-director">since told Eurogamer</a> not to read any “secret meaning” into the nod. Back to reading too much into every little detail for the next decade, it is.</p>

If you’ll indulge me –</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Okay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: If you had to sum up the idea of guiding game music composers – sum it up in two or three points – what would those points be? Knowing that of course it takes years of experience to really get your head around these. What does a composer need to keep in mind when writing video game music?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hm. That is cool. Two branching points. I think I can do this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: (laughs)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: (laughs) I’m going to give it a try.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Love it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The first thing I would say, just compositionally, is that game music reflects the inner monologue of the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hmm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We’re in the players head. I think that’s the best way to think about what we do. We are essentially mirroring the journey mentally that players are having, and whether that’s in a very narrative game in which the player is pursuing objectives and interacting with characters and having adventures in that more linear narrative focus – or if it’s more of a puzzle game in which the player is solving more abstract problems and looking at a large playing field in which many simultaneous events are happening all the time and trying to absorb and logically assess the needs of the game and trying to figure it out. Whether it’s that kind of game, or a more narrative game, they have emotional and intellectual frames of reference. A center of focus. And they’re very unique! And I think the music plays the role of a mirror to that focus, to that mental state. I think when music is doing its best job, in terms of that sense of identity, it’s beautifully reflecting the mental cognition of the player. It’s helping the player to think and to solve problems, and it’s helping the player to empathize and to feel the momentum and the emotional arc of the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So I would say that is the one of two things that game music is, that game music does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hmm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The other thing that game music does, that I think is really important, is that it can emphasize&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/player-agency/#what-is-player-agency-in-game-design">player agency</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in a really important way. When it’s structured well, music for games reacts to what players do. It can react in subtle ways that you don’t notice, or it can react in really dramatic ways that have impact, that kind of hit you in the chest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And depending on the way in which the music is structured, it can kind of reinforce the idea that players are in control, that they are affecting the world that they are exploring or that they are manipulating.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3411764.3445540">That is really important to game development, to game design</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Everything about a video game is about giving players a sense of agency – about making players feel powerful. Making their choices feel like they matter. So everything that everybody’s doing in game development is about emphasizing that. The more players feel that their choices affect the game, the more fun they’re having!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah! So that really influences the way games are developed. And with music, if we can communicate that idea on the level and with the language that we have at our disposal, we can almost subconsciously emphasize player agency – player choice –&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3HoOu0iNCU">by letting the music morph and react to what the player does</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It makes the emotional texture of the game feel like it cares about the player. Like there is a relationship there that is personal. That the player and the game are exploring this experience together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And as a composer, it’s kind of like the composer and the player are having a conversation. Like we’re having a back-and-forth. So I think that’s the other thing that’s really important and pivotal about our role as game composers, and that makes our work as game composers different from composing music for any other form of entertainment, We have that back-and-forth. We have that relationship with the person who is consuming our art. And what&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;do influences how they experience what&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>we</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;do. So it’s really unique and interesting, and it makes our work a lot of fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It is beautiful, and your work is a lot of fun! I’ll say that for sure! Hopefully, this is a fun question. I imagine you’re updating this book in the years since you’ve written it. You’ve probably updated it a couple of times to reflect, you know, what’s happening in the world of video game music, and video games in general. If you had to rewrite this book in the year of our lord 2024, what are one or two very exciting things that you’d say, “Man, you all need to hear about this! You all need to get that this is happening, and keep this in mind in your future as game composers, or as people who want to make any sort of video game music.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: You know, that is just so interesting!&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/">I actually keep a blog that I contribute to on a monthly basis</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It is in concert with my book, so it allows me to continuously update the body of knowledge that I am offering as a part of that book, and to keep it fresh, and constantly add new ideas to it. And I think that’s really helpful, because game development is a technology, and you know how fast technology moves. It’s very difficult to write any book and expect it to be at the cutting edge of a technology by the time a book comes out! That’s part of the reason why when I wrote the book I focused more on core artistic principles rather than any technological guidance, because I knew that the technology was probably going to be out of date as soon as the book was released. That’s just the reality of it – just the way it works. But on the internet I was going to be able to speak to a community from a more immediate point of view, and so that has been special to me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: And in terms of what I think is one of the more interesting and important contributions to what we’ve essentially been discussing… I think that as much as virtual reality is sort of on unstable ground in terms of the way in which its community is building… I think the impact it has had on the discipline of audio and music creation for games can not be overstated. It is a really fascinating change in terms of what we do. Just in terms of the audio designer and the sound designer, it has moved work into the areas of binaural sound and ambisonics. Now I’m going to back up. I know we don’t want to get too technical here. But the idea here is – when you’re watching a film, everybody is pretty familiar with surround sound. The idea that when you watch a film and the film presents the audio in a way that pinpoints sonic locations for objects as they’re flying around you. Of course surround sound is essentially a hula hoop around you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah. (Laughs)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah. If you visualize it that way. I mean, if you go into a movie theater, there can be a little bit of up-and-down (in terms of where speakers are placed), but mostly it’s just whipping around you like a hula hoop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The difference between surround sound and what virtual reality does is that it takes that hula hoop and spreads it out into a sphere that wraps you completely around, so that sound is pinpointed to exact locations – so that you can experience it in a way that is much more immersive and reflects actual life much more than surround sound ever has. The terms binaural sound and ambisonics – those are just two of the approaches to this kind of sound implementation. And&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/2016/03/01/vr-audio-past-present-future/">those two approaches actually were being pursued quite a long time ago in the earlier days of game development</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But then they sort of went to the wayside. There were certain issues with technology that kind of got in the way, and we ended up with surround sound (which is reflective of what happens in television and film) for quite a long time. And that’s where things stayed. But now we’re moving back into this complete sphere of sound, and it’s because of virtual reality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That has essentially forced everybody’s hand – to really get serious about those technologies. You just can’t create an immersive virtual environment without that kind of 3 dimensional sound. And it’s challenged everybody in game audio to think differently about what we do – including game composers. In terms of just the discipline of composition, it’s been really interesting to look at ideas that are related to how music physiologically influences people. And to understand that, in relation to one of the big downsides of virtual reality – which is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/2016/02/22/can-game-music-and-sound-combat-vr-sickness/">visually induced motion sickness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A lot of people, when they jump into virtual reality, they put the big goggles on, they start walking around, and suddenly they’re feeling very queasy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: (laughs) Yeah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It has to do with how our physical movement and the environment doesn’t seem to match.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Our bodies want to say that the way we’re moving and the way the world is moving around us are congruous – that they agree. When they don’t, as is often the case in virtual reality, it sends our brains for a loop, and they don’t like it. So yeah, it’s tough.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So one of the things that has been really interesting for me as a game composer is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://winifredphillips.wpcomstaging.com/2018/07/15/composing-video-game-music-for-virtual-reality-comfort-versus-performance/">taking a look at how music affects us physiologically and how that can counteract visually induced motion sickness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Hmm! Fabulous!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Things like infrasound! The sound frequencies that can affect us. Some are steadying, and some make visually induced motion sickness worse. It’s a whole discipline, and it’s an interesting thing to think about. It freshens music creation, in terms of the sonic palette that we’re working with. When we think that the music not only has an emotional and intellectual component to the way players are experiencing the game, but it also has a physiological component that can actually affect the way people feel in their bodies, and that can help or hurt their experience of being plunged into a virtual world… that was amazing to me!&nbsp; Just thinking about that. And it really opened my eyes to different ways to think about what music can do. So if I had to point to anything that is recent, and that has really been fascinating and profound as a game composer, I’d say it’s that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I love this idea of music in video games actually having a physiological response. Because the flip side of that is taking video game music into the real world through the concert hall.

Composers are often sitting in our rooms doing our thing, and just cranking out the music, and hoping that people respond to our heart and soul and our tears and our blood and sweat that goes into it! When that goes out to the concert hall in the hands of live musicians completely outside of the game!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Yeah!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Where does that take you?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: It is amazing! You know, I think one of the things that’s so cool about being a game composer – and I think you would probably agree with this – when we create music for a game, we’re essentially creating music for somebody’s experience. It’s different than creating music for a film or a tv show, because that’s a passive experience. People are sitting. They’re watching. The experience that’s being had is somebody else’s. But for a game, it’s your experience that you’re having as a player. And the music belongs to you, because it’s what you heard during a really special and important moment in your life. It’s the reason why we remember music that we heard during milestones of our lives better than everything else! Because we remember music when we’re doing something that matters to us. It’s an immensely powerful mnemonic. It really cements music in our heads, when we’re doing something that is meaningful to us and we hear that music. The music just prints itself on our brains. It’s like nothing else!</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: So when you go to a concert, and the people who are there are going to hear music together that they feel belongs to them, that was a part of an experience they had and they remember so vividly – the sense of community is unlike anything else.&nbsp; It’s just amazing! The energy in that room, when everybody just erupts, and the roar that kind of builds when the music bursts into a chorus that’s associated with a moment in a game that everyone loves! Or that was really difficult, and created a great sense of triumph when you overcame it! And then that music brings you right back into that moment! It is amazing!</span><br></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Winifred</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That’s one of the reasons why as a game composer when you go into the concert hall and you hear your music performed in front of that audience, it really is incomparable to any other kind of concert. That audience is hearing and maybe singing along or swaying along to music that they feel like belongs to them in a way that is incomparable to any other form of media. It’s just outstanding to be able to be a part of that! I feel very humbled in a way to watch that happen. Because you are creating an intimate experience with one player as you compose music, you’re thinking of it as an intimate act of creation, but when you think of it in terms of thousands of players across countries, across the world, it is sort of an epic experience as well! The community that is having a relationship with you! And having a moment of their lives in concert with your own creation. There’s nothing like being a game composer for having the privilege of being a part of people’s lives in that way. So, yeah, watching game music concerts, hearing your music performed in a venue like that, there’s nothing like it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meena</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: That is beautiful! And so wonderful to hear what a career, what a life in game music so far! And what exciting times ahead! I’m so glad! Thank you Winifred so much for your time and space and just amazing generosity!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-gos-tycoon-racers-event-is-an-interesting-yet-brutally-challenging-concept/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=monopoly-gos-tycoon-racers-event-is-an-interesting-yet-brutally-challenging-concept<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="304" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I really enjoy playing through <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>events. While I find Peg-E fun, my true joy comes from Partners events. With <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/monopoly-go-tycoon-racers-guide-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tycoon Racers</a> becoming available worldwide for the first time this week, I was curious how it compares to some of my favorite events and whether I’d have a blast with it.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">So far, I’m enjoying Tycoon Racers a lot, but there’s a glaring issue that I’m conflicted on: the difficulty. There are many competitive people out there, and for a group of casual players who rarely have more than a few hundred dice on them at a time, it’s almost intimidating to see. </p> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">Unlike Partners events with very clear milestones that can snowball your progress, Tycoon Racers feels like a constant uphill battle, with no guarantee that you’ll get anything out of it. You can also get thousands of dice from a Partners event in one day, with Tycoon Racers rewarding significantly less. It does offer milestone rewards in the form of completing laps around the track, but you’ll often find yourself claiming more flags or taking 100 dice just to get slightly farther in your race.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-tycoon-racers-exactly" data-injectable="false">What is Tycoon Racers, exactly?</h2> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Tycoon Racers works in a multi-stage format where you pick your teammates, collect flags, and match up against three other four-player teams. After around 24 hours, you’ll all start racing around a race track, collecting milestone rewards and points to signal your placement. After another 24 hours, you’ll complete your first race, get your placement medals, and repeat this twice more. You’ll find your final rank once you complete your three races and receive a reward for your placement.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="595" data-current-count="895" data-injectable="true">After you finish your three races, you’ll get a final score that determines your reward. You’ll get 3,500 dice, a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-wild-stickers-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wild Sticker</a>, and the Tycoon Racer token if you’re in first place. The prizes for second place are 1,000 dice and a five-star pack, while third and fourth place are the equivalent of participation ribbons. In an event like this, it’s all or nothing, as the dice you use to obtain points are far beyond what you’ll receive in return, even if you get first. Nonetheless, the Wild Sticker is a decent prize if you get lucky with your teams and opponents.</p>
 <h2 id="h-off-to-a-rocky-start" data-injectable="false">Off to a rocky start</h2> <p data-characters="543" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Immediately, the initial stage of selecting a team was already a little stressful. I have one person I always team up with for every event, but beyond this, we didn’t have an exact game plan for how to navigate this event. All I knew was that I was intrigued, albeit slightly confused. Nonetheless, I partnered up with my usual friend, found someone else to invite, and got a random player to join near the end of the planning phase. All things considered, I was optimistic, as I was mainly excited to try a new event for the first time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">With that in mind, I’m enjoying the change of pace. I was looking for something interesting and different, and Tycoon Racers scratches that itch. Getting the top prize is a welcome bonus; above all, I’m looking forward to working with my friends and getting a little competitive, even if I don’t necessarily define myself as competitive.</p>
 <h2 id="h-things-are-getting-a-little-competitive" data-injectable="false">Things are getting a little competitive</h2> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">As of now, <em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Tycoon Racers event is still ongoing, and the standings look pretty good. I got lucky and found a five-star sticker that I needed to finish one of my albums during the team phase, so I used the dice to fly through a few Grease and Glory milestones beforehand. We’re in first now, but knowing how most <em>Monopoly GO</em> events progress, I don’t expect this to last very long.</p>
 <p data-characters="678" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">After all, competitiveness is what makes events like Tycoon Racers so challenging. In some cases, you’ll match up against a team or two who are so determined to win that they’ll get every event reward possible to collect thousands of flags before soaring through, grabbing lap milestone prizes, and snowballing their success. It’s impressive to see, yet it’s almost discouraging when you’re a group of casual players who just want to have fun. I enjoy the competitiveness to an extent, but I’m slightly disheartened by the game’s habit of having teams skyrocket to quadruple your score in a short time with no hope of making a comeback.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>All things considered, I’m surprised it’s this close. | Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="690" data-current-count="990" data-injectable="true">At the end of it all, though, Tycoon Racers is designed for competition. You collaborate with your team to collect points, but at its core, you compete directly against three other teams to reach the top. Whether you get there depends almost entirely on your determination. Sure, there’s luck involved with your dice popper rolls, but this is only half the battle. Getting into the nitty-gritty of min-maxing your rolls, trading stickers to get more dice, and looking out for rewards links all contribute to your success. Fortunately, if you’re competitive, you may have a blast with this aspect of the event. I’m conflicted over whether it’s worth the ending prize.</p>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Is it worth it for 3,500 dice, a Wild Sticker, and a cosmetic token? Honestly, I can’t even tell you for certain. I love cosmetics, so I’ll still try my best during this race to get it. However, if you like to conserve their dice for future events, it may be worth sitting out on this one and waiting until another Partner or Treasures event appears.</p>

            <p>
More details have come to light on the cancelled standalone spin-off for acclaimed RPG Disco Elysium. 
</p>
<p>
Back in February, it was revealed that work on this project, codenamed X7, had been stopped, along with news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs at developer ZA/UM</a>. At this time, it was claimed the spin-off was only "one to two years away from completion".
</p>
<p>
Now, in a report by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow">PC Gamer</a> with current and former employees of ZA/UM Studio, lead writer Dora Klindžić has said this release would have been "110 percent authentic" and the "most hardcore Disco since Disco".
</p>

</div><figcaption>Newscast: For Xbox, could this year finally be the one where it all pays off?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPVhT_7O0iE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
X7 "would have advanced the story, the emotional threads, and gameplay elements all at once to truly evolve the genre of psychological RPG as Disco Elysium started it," Klindžić said. "For a while it seemed like miracles were possible, and with them, redemption."
</p>
<p>
Another developer told the publication the spin-off was about "one of the most most beloved characters" in Disco Elysium. "I feel like it was the best possible shot at a Disco-like game without [Kurvitz], Rostov, and other people that made the original Disco Elysium," they said.
</p>
<p>
Internal response to X7 had been positive when it was shared during a company-wide showcase towards the end of last year. "Everyone was looking forward to its development," a developer on another team at ZA/UM said, adding its "internal announcement lifted a lot of spirits after a rough time of bad press around the studio".
</p>
<p>
They also thought it was "exactly the sort of game [ZA/UM] needs to put out". Several developers believed the spin-off could "reassure fans that ZA/UM is not a husk, that the IP is in safe hands and that the studio is full of talented people with a genuine love for the world of Revachol".
</p>
<p>
While some of those that spoke to PC Gamer said they believed this Disco Elysium spin-off could have launched this year, others felt next year was a more likely target. Klindžić said that had the team been left to get on with developing the title with less interference from management, "it could have perhaps been a three-year development cycle start to finish", with work on X7 initially starting in 2022. 
</p>
<p>
Klindžić had originally left her job as an academic physicist and space mission scientist in the February of that year, in order to work on a Disco Elysium sequel. However, it was an inauspicious start for the project. "Upon my arrival, I was told all the leads were gone and replaced, but this was framed as a good thing, a healthy thing. Four months later the project was shelved overnight. I began raising concerns, as I felt I had just abandoned my entire life and career only to end up in a studio where the people I had come to work with were fired, and the project I was meant to work on shelved with no reason given."
</p>
<p>
Then, that August, studio management approached both Klindžić and Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik⁠ about pitching a spin-off. "We were given only around a week to come up with a fully-fledged game pitch, and we worked around the clock to come up with a new story, new characters, new gameplay mechanics, and a new creative direction, including an initial vision for design, art, and audio. We presented the pitch to management, it was a resounding success. It was greenlit and codenamed X7, and its initial production schedule was set for one year."
</p>
<p>
However, even when the project had been given the go ahead, Klindžić said the team was "set up to fail from the start", due to not having been allowed a pre-production period. "Whenever we raised concerns about this and expressed we needed more writers if the deadlines were to be met, we were accused of not wanting to do our jobs," Klindžić said.
</p>
<p>
"Pretty much from the moment the writing team's pitch was approved in August of 2022, the other teams started production," Tuulik added. "We didn't even really know what the story or the characters were gonna be, when art teams were already making first character and environment concepts. I'm sure you can see how this is a big problem, when you're making a narrative-led game. 
</p>
<p>
"Essentially, the writing team had to work double-time from day one to supply other disciplines with work, whilst trying to write the first dialogues and sketch out the rest of the game at the same time. The writing team consisted of myself and Dora at the time." Another developer added: "I don't know if Dora and Argo ever felt in control."
</p>
<p>
As for why X7 was ultimately cancelled, PC Gamer's report does not give a clear reason. However, it is evident that a dark cloud still lies above ZA/UM. 

</p>
<p>"The entire X7 team loved the Elysium world⁠," Klindžić closed. "As fan artists, musicians, iconic voices⁠, we only wanted to keep it going, rather than leave it to wither in some dark decrepit cellar of corporate intellectual property."</p>
<p>Since Disco Elysium’s release in 2019, ZA/UM has mostly been in the headlines due to an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">extremely public legal spat</a> with former key members of the team. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-dev-reveals-some-team-members-left-involuntarily">2022</a>, ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga claimed Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere, and art director Aleksander Rostov had been fired following the company's takeover by Estonian businessmen Ilmar Kompus, and Tõnis Haavel, previously convicted of investment fraud. This started a series of lawsuits and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">accusations of toxic behaviour</a> at the studio. </p>

  <p id="Tn2NX0">It’s been a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/7/18214008/fallout-76-updates-patch-fix-future">long, hard road</a> for <em>Fallout 76 — </em>but one that has finally led to a triumphant peak. The game’s disastrous launch has been covered a thousand times from every angle; it was an intricate mess of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/12/18179873/fallout-76-developer-room-access-armor-paints-kenny-give-me-the-wooby">overlapping problems</a> that made the game difficult to play and extremely clippable for memes. But in 2024, the beleaguered game is stepping into the spotlight and enjoying a wave of positive attention. Bethesda has spent years patching up the ship, adding NPCs, companions, quests, Expeditions, factions, a battle royale mode, and more cryptids than you can shake a stick at.</p>
<p id="wDcJHw">The Fallout show on Amazon Prime <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131018/fallout-games-steam-player-count-bethesda-tv-show">kickstarted a wave of interest in everything Fallout</a>; Steam charts have shown that every game in the franchise has found a new player base. The games published under Bethesda’s umbrella are <em>Fallout 3</em>, <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Fallout 4. </em>Each of these RPGs is a meaty campaign with enough content — and player-made mods — to sustain its own fandom of players. But <em>Fallout 5</em> is a ways out, and <em>Fallout 4</em> is nearly a decade old. The game best suited to draw in new fans who were hoping for just general Fallout vibes is <em>Fallout 76</em>.</p>

<p id="s7uOAo">“It’s no secret that <em>Fallout 76</em> had some bumps at release,” said creative director Jonathan Rush in an email interview with Polygon. But even in its earliest days, <em>Fallout 76</em> was defined by its enthusiastic community. These were players who loved the game, warts and all, and stuck around. It was largely because of these fans that I was able to eke out enjoyment of <em>Fallout 76, </em>and I’ve returned to the game on and off over the years, sampling from these delights. Early on, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/18/18146133/fallout-76-player-satellitejedi-raid-boss-pvp">the high points came from other players</a>, and uncovering the stories of the dead who came before.</p>
<p id="AXE2WJ">“The characters that initially launched with <em>76</em> were nuclear shadows, whose purpose was to tell the story of what all had happened between [when] the bombs drop and the point where you emerge from Vault 76,” said Rush. “Since Appalachia was initially devoid of human life, we relied on these characters as tools to give our players an understanding of the new world they had emerged into.”</p>
<p id="m7tZgI">But without characters in the world, and dialogue trees, <em>Fallout 76</em> was missing much of the <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that makes a Fallout game. While the community team gathered feedback and part of the team provided smaller-scale updates and bug fixes, a larger group got to work on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/9/18658769/fallout-76-wastelanders-dlc-human-npcs-year-two-bethesda-e3-2019"><em>Wastelanders</em>, the first expansion that added NPCs</a> and a main quest to the game. “The development for <em>Wastelanders</em> started very soon after launch and was a huge effort which involved all Bethesda Game Studios locations,” said Rush. “On these types of games, it’s difficult to only support one of those – a dedicated group to maintain the integrity of the live service is crucial.”</p>

<p id="kYHg1X">Some of these updates have been much more experimental than others. Looking over the list of updates shows a healthy amount of variety. Nuclear Winter was a battle royale mode, engineered by a fictional in-game super-AI and rich with cosmetic rewards. <em>Steel Dawn</em> was a two-part narrative update that had players fight alongside the Brotherhood of Steel, learning more about the enigmatic order. The Pitt and Atlantic City were host to Expeditions, new maps outside of the main zone of Appalachia. Now, with the most recent <em>Skyline Valley</em> update, Bethesda is expanding the original map to include a weird, dangerous area to explore in the south. The bigger structural updates have been peppered with smaller experiments: killer aliens, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/18/20699410/fallout-76-hotfixes-update-patch-11-meat-week">grilling meat with a super mutant</a> and his brahmin buddy, mothman cults, and new tools for building comfier CAMPs.</p>
<p id="1liWrW">“We’re thankful to our community for giving us all the feedback and criticism they did so we could narrow our focus and fix the most critical issues,” said Rush. “We feel that because of everything we went through with the game and the community, we have a strong and open dialogue with our fans to keep the game updated in the most impactful way for our players.</p>
<p id="dIQCia">“Having an awesome Community team that listens to the feedback and effectively communicates it back to the developers was a tremendous benefit; knocking down the walls between the developers and the players is the key so we can have constructive discourse where both sides feel engaged,” Rush added.</p>
<p id="clDNph">Not every experiment was successful; Nuclear Winter was removed, some events were quietly retired, and some quests are more fondly regarded than others. But combined with greater stability and sense of identity, the new updates have transformed <em>Fallout 76</em> from a clown fiesta to a genuinely compelling game in a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23939222/no-mans-sky-2023-review"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a>-esque redemption arc.</p>

<p id="Q01Xlw">When looking back at past updates, Rush considers the most important lesson to be this: “Our players really love to play in our Appalachia. What I mean by this is, I look at Appalachia as the main character for this game, and the story is told by how it changes over time – both on the developer side, and through our players.”</p>
<p id="GU2VOB"><em>Skyline Valley</em>, the latest update, is an example of what expanding on Appalachia can be. While Expeditions require the player to jump on a vertibird and fly off to some distant locale, <em>Skyline Valley</em> changes the map we’ve been exploring since 2018. “Expanding the borders of our map gives us additional opportunities to flesh out the world further through stories, new locations, and the inhabitants within,” Rush explained.</p>
<p id="mwjy6u">There are more updates on the way for <em>Fallout 76</em>, and by this point, the designers have figured out what works for the game. Experiments like the Burrows, or the Pitt, weren’t always perfect — but they proved what worked and what didn’t. Throughout this entire process, <em>Fallout 76</em> has been backed by a brilliantly creative community of players who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/26/8932043/fallout-76-role-playing-cultist-horror-theater-nerds">build CAMPs</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/26/20885650/fallout-76-vulture-trial-five-0-role-play-event-bethesda">tell cinematic stories</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/30/20891291/fallout-76-doctor-cj-martin-clinic-roleplay-bethesda">work as doctors</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22676053/fallout-76-the-theatre-company-northern-harvester-plays-productions">recreate Shakespeare’s productions</a>, or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/10/22168469/fallout-for-hope-fans-charity-drive-st-jude-childrens-hospital">run charity drives.</a></p>
<p id="BqHahD">I recently loaded into <em>Fallout 76</em> to play with a friend who had just downloaded the game, and we rocked up to an event. Once it concluded, the veterans ran up to my friend and dropped a couple of bags chock-full of goods — a welcoming gesture toward a new player, and a common ritual among longtime veterans.</p>
<p id="8YLITr">“As our game world changes, we would like to open opportunities for our more seasoned veterans,” said Rush. “We have big plans to make the game more challenging and rewarding for our adventurers and builders alike. Powerful gear and new playstyles to conquer enormously nasty encounters, and new systems to encourage our builders to push even further, are all on the table.” <em>Fallout 76</em> has come tremendously far during its life so far, and now that it’s been through such a rocky road, the rest of the journey almost feels like a victory lap. </p>

It’s an open-world multiplayer survival shooter (so many descriptors) set in a post-apocalyptic landscape. <em>Once Human</em> is a PvE game that centers around you and your friends trying to build shelter and gather resources in order to protect yourselves from a horde of gruesome monsters. If you have a group of gaming friends who like survival titles then you should probably try this out.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-recommend-id="image://bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player crouches in an industrial hallway" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player crouches in an industrial hallway" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->tinyBuild</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-recommend-id="image://bfb8860aaf95c2b98204b55fc6e41378" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player crouches in an industrial hallway" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another multiplayer shooter,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1456940/Level_Zero_Extraction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Level Zero</em></a></span><em> i</em>s an extraction FPS.

It has just celebrated its first visual novel publication: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak The FEDORA Files: What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As a producer for the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series for the past seven years, and one of the founding members of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Drop Studios</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I have come to have an almost formulaic expectation for our games. Our primary focus since our founding has been action games in the survival horror genre, specifically targeting the retro PS1 style of play. It is a very niche style for a very niche audience, inspired by our own nostalgia of early 90’s horror games. For a three person studio, it is the type of gaming that we love and create the best. All small indies know that time and resources are precious. So how and why did we, as a small studio, end up with a visual novel side series? And was it worth it? Now that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is complete, I wanted to share our process, what our motivations were, and how it’s changed our company’s approach to game development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring new paths forward"><span>Exploring new paths forward</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The roots of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> come from another project of ours, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak: Shades of Horro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">r, currently in development. Funded via Kickstarter, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shades of Horror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our first big jump into cutting edge graphics and a whole new world using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unreal Engine 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It is also the largest scale game we have ever attempted and resource management has been much trickier than we expected. Up until now, we were typically releasing a title every one to two years. The development time for Shades of Horror was projected to be five years.This presented two major challenges for us. First, with how long the final project would take to come to fruition, we would need to release other games to stay in business. We had also made the switch to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unreal Engine 5 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">over </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unity</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which meant we needed the opportunity to experiment with that engine as our work evolved. The second challenge was community engagement. We have a wonderful Discord community of dedicated fans of the series, and we need to keep the flame alive and our people engaged and participating in the narrative. It is extremely hard to do this with five years of no content. We had to introduce them and keep them involved in the goings on of the fictional town of Cypress Ridge until release.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What other avenues could we explore?"><span>What other avenues could we explore?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our crew started to come up with ideas with what we could do that would not only be informative, but interactive as well. As any Kickstarter guru knows, updates are vital to the success of any long term fulfillment campaign, and as any developer knows, creating things that non-programmers or non-creatives can understand usually isn’t the priority in roughing out technical development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The universe in our games is very important to our players; it’s something that despite not starting out as a lore heavy series, our fans have always commented on enjoying. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shades of Horror </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">being a reboot to our in-game universe, I began to think of ways we could expand out the world that wouldn’t traditionally be the focus in a typical survival horror game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew whatever format we chose needed to give our players a close relationship with our characters. It would also have to be simple enough for one person to carry the workload. We considered a lot of different ways to approach this before finally settling on the visual novel format. We liked the idea of writing mini-series in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> universe that could run parallel to the full game experience and still allow us to be cinematic.The rest of our team was responsible for the technical build of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shades of Horror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was primarily my responsibility both due to the resource shortage as well as the fact the script work and logic for the visual novel experience are closely tied together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there was one huge problem – I never made a visual novel before!&nbsp; How would I be able to put this together? Would we be able to put it together in a way that fans who didn’t traditionally enjoy visual novels would want to play?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A breath of fresh air for our players and for our business"><span>A breath of fresh air for our players and for our business</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were already in the process of testing a new style of game plan when we put our lore building game plan into motion. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Railbreak, Dead Drop Studios</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’ on-rails shooter/ lightgun style game, was well received by our fanbase. We were reasonably sure that the fans would be open to a new style of play, but as shooters by nature tend to be very dynamic and visual novels very static, we definitely were sailing into uncharted waters. When we announced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Railbreak</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and saw the reception both from our core base and on social media, we realized that tackling new genres and ideas not only reached different audiences, it also energized us internally to do something different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, it turns out this new approach had plenty of advantages. I was looking to tell a more interactive and character-based horror story, and it was clear this ambition could be better realized as a visual novel. It also helped mix things up. As a small studio, we don’t have the infrastructure to create a reliable sequel over and over, especially as games become more expensive and complicated to make. There’s also the problem that iterative genre titles can excite a core fanbase, but for those who aren’t invested in this type of gameplay, it doesn’t really give newcomers a reason to take a look at our products. Our business model was previously focused around a very specific gameplay style, and now it has evolved to being focused on the story we’re looking to tell and what type of game is most appropriate to tell it. The diversity and experimental nature of projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> allows us as a small operation to quickly gather feedback and pivot if something we create either resonates or flops with our players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Learning something new"><span>Learning something new</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In order to pull off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I needed to closely study the visual novel genre from a marketing and sales standpoint. I also had to expand my skill base. I am normally the writer and overall narrative designer on our games. This was a unique challenge and an opportunity to get my hands dirty in a different way, as my husband and business partner, Evan, is our studio engineer.&nbsp; He was able to use his knowledge to put together an environment for me to convert my script into an interactive game with tons of branching paths, choices, and endings. But because the coding required a thorough knowledge of the script, I had to do all of the scripting myself. This was equal parts fun and frustrating. I loved learning how to do new things, but learning how to code and write for a new type of game at the same time often threw me for a loop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the company tackled the concept of how to provide additional side content and features that would enhance the overall value of the product and content that might retain past fans who were not thrilled at the visual novel style. While I handled the core game, the rest of the team was able to reappropriate the tech work Evan had done and expand on it to create what is now known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outbreak RPG</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a bonus title offered in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> package. Alongside other bonuses like a concept art gallery, a music player, and a scene builder, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> evolved into a robust product with a lot to offer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m extremely proud of what the team has been able to accomplish with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Lydia Knows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although the change in game style was a risk, fans responded very positively at having a different mode of interaction with characters both new and already beloved. The reception from both our players and from our publishing partners has been better than we could’ve expected so far, which is extremely motivating. We consider this experiment a success. Going forward, we will challenge ourselves to create new experiences and products that enable us to both reach greater audiences and satisfy our existing playerbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you find yourself stuck in a creative or financial rut, opening your mind to creating new and different products may just be the way to reignite your passion and your business!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
