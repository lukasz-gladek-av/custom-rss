<p>Activision accidentally posted a blog early that revealed details about Black Ops 7’s Endgame</p>



<p>As we inch closer to the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 14, 2025, the developers continue to drop various tidbits of information for players ahead of the full launch. We recently learned all launch details for the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-mode-complete-launch-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a>. It seems the next intel drop was going to be about BO7’s campaign, revealing the title’s Endgame details.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-endgame-dev-talk-coming-on-november-10">Black Ops 7 Endgame Dev Talk Coming on November 10</h2>



<p>Spotted by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1986877838310400201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Activision accidentally posted and promptly deleted a blog post early, which revealed details about the game’s campaign. Towards the end of the blog post, it was revealed that after completing the first 11 co-op missions, players will be able to unlock the Endgame for Black Ops 7. </p>



<p>The Endgame will task “JSOC with exploring the vast landscapes of Avalon, dismantling The Guild’s remaining Command Centers while battling exposure zones leaking a mysterious toxin into the city.” It seems that this blog post was intended to release on November 9, as towards the very end it was mentioned, “Expect a Dev Talk, and a Deep Dive Blog with a detailed overview of the Campaign Endgame, coming tomorrow, Monday, November 10.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>The blog post itself was intended to get players up to speed with Black Ops narrative so they are fully prepared once the co-op campaign goes live on the release date. Players can get “more insight on the major plots and players in motion at the start of the adventure” through the upcoming intel drop. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insomniac-games-doubles-down-on-fall-2026-release-date-for-wolverine.1347427/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With a busy late 2026, Insomniac confirms that Marvel’s Wolverine will still release in Fall 2026, despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6’s massive delay</a>.</p>



<p>Continuing on from Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man series, Marvel’s Wolverine is going to be a more mature take on the superhero. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wolverine-gets-new-trailer-at-playstation-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Gameplay Trailer</a> showing off some intense gore and violence, it’s clear the game won’t hold any punches. Seeing as it’s a PlayStation exclusive, there’s already a lot of backing behind it to be a huge title for 2026. The trailer announced that the game would release in Fall 2026, but, seeing as delays are common, weren’t sure if it’d hold. Well, Insomniac stood its case with a new tweet, possibly hinting at some heated rivalry with Rockstar’s highly anticipated sixth GTA entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-still-coming-out-in-fall-2026-despite-grand-theft-auto-6-s-delay">Marvel’s Wolverine Still Coming Out in Fall 2026, Despite Grand Theft Auto 6’s Delay</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1986894458835910839" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from Insomniac Games</a>, the company states that Marvel’s Wolverine is still coming out in Fall 2026. Wishlists for the game on the PlayStation Store are also open, letting fans get all the latest info on the game prior to release. The timing of the message does seem convenient, as Grand Theft Auto 6 was pushed from May 26th, 2026 to November 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Seeing as many games would want to avoid releasing when GTA 6 comes out, it’s neat to see Insomniac stick to its date. Still, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see Marvel’s Wolverine come out in August or September. That way, it would get a few months of sales and time in before Rockstar’s big new title gets in on the action. Either way, we’ll hear more about both projects next year, seeing as they’ll debut then. In Wolverine’s case, we’ll learn more in Spring 2026, as announced during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the last State of Play</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think about Marvel’s Wolverine keeping its Fall 2026 date? Think it’ll come out before Grand Theft Auto 6? Could it stand up against it if it releases near or on November 19th? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

                <p>Fortnite Battle Royale will return to a more typical experience once the current Simpsons mini-season ends at the end of November, according to a blog posted on the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1986889874029297835" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Status Twitter account</a>, with the game slated to return to 100-player rounds and a much roomier island.</p><p>The launch of Fortnite's Simpsons-themed mini-season at the beginning of November introduced some dramatic changes to the rhythm of Battle Royale matches, thanks largely to the size of the map. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-simpsons-map-full-springfield-map-and-all-named-locations/2900-7204/" data-ref-id="2900-7204">new Springfield island</a> covers about half the land area that the Chapter 6 island did, with the mode temporarily supporting 80 players instead of 100. That's made the island extraordinarily dense with players, and it's been tough to land in any named location at the start of a match without bumping into an opponent trying to grab the same chest you're going for.</p><p>The blog said that fundamental shift in the flow of matches was an experiment.</p><p>"Here's something different: this season’s BR is 80 players instead of 100 on the more compact map. The vibe so far? Faster rotations, more meaningful fights, and less time running across empty fields. This is an experiment--we plan to return to 100 players next season--but we wanted to see what happens when we concentrate the action."</p><p>That wasn't the only big piece of news we got from this blog. <strong>For this Saturday and Sunday only</strong>, Epic is adding two Simpsons-themed weapons--the Deodorant Applicator, and Bart's Slingshot--to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-simpsons-season/2900-7206/" data-ref-id="2900-7206">Battle Royale loot pool</a>. This is another unusual thing Epic is trying during this mini-season, as the company debuted those weapons last weekend in Delulu mode.</p><p>Fortnite's Simpsons season is live until November 29, when Chapter 7 will begin.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022"><em>Halo Infinite’</em>s</a> next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be the last major update the sci-fi shooter receives, as confirmed by Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) in a new blog post.</p> <p>On November 7, <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview">Halo Studios announced that after four years</a>, there would be no more large content updates for 2021’s<em> Halo Infinite.</em> The next<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and now last<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->major operation will launch on November 18. It will add some new cosmetic items and will permanently double XP progression. The devs are also doubling how many Spartan Points players receive for completing challenges as part of this upcoming update. And that’s all nice, but for folks excited for the future of <em>Halo Infinite</em>, the blog post shared on Friday made it clear that Operation Infinite was the end of an era for the FPS.</p> <p>“With multiple <em>Halo</em> titles in development,” Halo Studios explained, “we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>Halo Infinite</em> isn’t being shut down. You’ll still be able to play the free-to-play multiplayer shooter on Xbox or PC for the foreseeable future. And Halo Studios has committed to continuing to offer new daily and weekly challenges as well as ranked seasons. But as for new guns, maps, vehicles, and so on, that’s not going to happen.<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s days as Xbox’s flagship <em>Halo</em> game are coming to a close after the November 18 update.</p> <p>In the Friday blog post, Halo Studios thanked fans for “incredible memories” and for supporting the game, and explained that the team is now shifting focus to “in-development” games, such as the previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> a remake of the OG game’s campaign, which will be the first <em>Halo</em> game to make the leap to PS5.</a> And according to <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951">Xbox, it won’t be the last.</a></p> <p>“As we look ahead, your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals, in hopes of exceeding expectations and delivering the best <em>Halo</em> experiences possible,” said the studio.</p> <p>“Throughout our day, we look to your suggestions, your art, and even your memes as constant reminders of our dual commitment to faithfully stewarding <em>Halo’s</em> legacy and forging its future. Since&nbsp;formally announcing&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;in October, we’ve been floored by the response from both longtime fans and Halo newcomers. We’re humbled by the trust you’ve placed in us, and we can’t wait to introduce new players to the iconic story of&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for the first time in 2026.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/solve-these-strange-jigsaws.1347403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702170/Strange_Jigsaws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Strange Jigsaws'</em></a><em> </em>description is simple: It's a game of strange jigsaws where you solve strange jigsaws. I started playing it recently after seeing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m4gmqikclc2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some posts</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m4qamjr7n22h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about it</a> on social media. Created by <em>20 Small Mazes</em> puzzle master FLEB, <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> has about 50 or so puzzles—not necessarily <em>all</em> jigsaw puzzles, but using jigsaw pieces. It opens right into the chaos: "Solve jigsaws. Find the golden pieces. Open the door."&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>Designer FLEB opens <em>Strange Jigsaw</em> with a chaotic mess of multiple jigsaw puzzles, signaling that this game is more than just a puzzle simulator. Pieces are everywhere, and it's prudent just to start moving pieces around to test out what they do. Among the first few puzzles, I'm to put pieces together to power a magnet and a computer, respectively, which opens up <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> puzzles even further. Then, trouble! A puzzle is on fire, and <em>Tetris</em>-shaped blocks of water are the only thing that can put them out. On the newly-powered computer, more puzzles: A clever captcha-inspired puzzle game, then a burger-building logic puzzle that reminded me of <a href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em></a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><figure></figure><p>There are jigsaws that are highly meta, using pathways controlled by <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' menu systems. There are darling puzzles illustrated by the designer's seven-year-old daughter, puzzles with missing pieces that must be recolored using a paint fill tool, puzzles that need a screwdriver to solve. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is expertly designed, but what makes it truly fantastic is the earnest playfulness of it all: FLEB loves puzzles, and that's obvious. He writes in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em>' Steam description that this game is harder than his last, <em>20 Small Puzzles</em>, and that may be true—but the puzzles here don't feel cruelly hard. Some are hard, but designed in a way to make them feel doable and intentional. I might not understand a puzzle now, but the game reassures me that I will be able to, later.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>There are so many moments in <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> that I want to talk to you about, but unfortunately for me, the person writing about this game, talking about them will sully the experience for you. <em>Strange Jigsaws</em> is just $5, so I urge you simply to try it out yourself. But if you need a taste of what designer FLEB is out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2570630/20_Small_Mazes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>20 Small Mazes </em>is free</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, you can look to YouTube: The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FLEBpuzzles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designer FLEB has a YouTube channel</a> in which he talks about his games and others. It's just as delightful as his games. His recent videos include a retrospective on <em>20 Small Mazes</em> and a newly designed puzzle called <em>Touching Grass</em>, which is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmndrQW5AmA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naturally built out of grass</a>. Over the past 10 years—with a seven year break somewhere in there—FLEB has made videos about all sorts of different puzzles. If this doesn't convince you that FLEB knows puzzles, I don't know what will.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/solve-these-strange-jigsaws-steam-puzzle-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to grow and expand with the seemingly endless updates developer Hello Games continues to toss out for free. Lately, user-made ships have been all the rage. The range of options now available for a custom spacecraft has led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">stunning original creations</a> as well as tributes to classic ships from other science fiction franchises. But Tosk, an <i>NMS</i> fan who’s been playing the game since launch, recently took to recreating not a ship, but a key location found in Studio Ghibli’s classic animated film, <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i>. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/KJJ8VJE3SmU">Tosk’s video walkthrough</a> of his creation here:</p>  <p>I recently DM’d back and forth with Tosk to get a sense of the challenge of finishing a project like this in <i>No Man’s Sky</i>. Like any worthy endeavor, all it takes is time, perseverance, and, perhaps most importantly, inspiration. In this case, that was Tosk’s love of Studio Ghibli films. “<i>Totoro </i>is my favorite,” he told me. “It’s like a warm nostalgia blanket! Such a sweet innocent story of childhood wonders. It [also] has environmental themes but doesn’t hit you over the head with it.”</p>

The first challenge? Finding the right planet. Tosk scouted <i>NMS</i>’ procedurally generated universe far and wide for not just a suitable habitat, but one adorned with the right “Ghibli green,” he told me. That search alone took a month. “I did find about three or four sites that were possibilities,” he said, “but to find the right combination of color flora and a spot where I could build on flat land with a cave nearby a hill above it took a long time.” Just a random paradise planet wouldn’t do.</p>

 <p>Once he found that picture-perfect world, Tosk said it took around 100 hours to put the base together, much of it made “using free placement, so it was put together by hand, which takes a long time. It came in at just under 3000 parts, which is the build limit for uploading in <i>NMS</i>.” As it was done on PS5, no mods were used but, as he describes in the walkthrough video, there’s some “scale and color glitching” at work. He also “used the film a lot as reference for the floor plan, but the layout changed a bit from shot to shot, so I had to take a few creative liberties.”</p>

So I had to go back and rebuild a lot of it. I nearly gave up on it then, to be honest.”</p>

 <p>Thankfully, Tosk persisted. Unfortunately, due to an issue with the game right now, users can’t visit Tosk’s creation without him also being online and present in the area. But even when that issue is fixed, you’ll have to do some work to find Totoro’s location. The planet is in the Istentam galaxy, but Tosk has deliberately hidden the glyphs necessary to find it in his tour video.</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">15 Amazing&nbsp;<em>No Man’s Sky</em> Ship Builds You Have To See</a></p> <p>I was curious what project is next for Tosk. “I’ve been thinking about making the floating island from <i>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</i>,” another Studio Ghibli joint. “But to be honest,” he said, the <i>Totoro</i> build “has taken so long that I might just play for a while.”</p>

Grunt?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect fans have uncovered fresh artwork teasing the franchise's next game, which will feature the krogan race in the middle of a civil war. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clues hidden in today's blog post from series boss Mike Gamble have been decoded by fans to uncover a hidden link on BioWare's website — and on it, our first piece of new Mass Effect teaser in two years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a> artwork shows a battle-scarred krogan firing his gun, flanked by an army of helmeted krogan warriors. The title of the image is simply: "Civil War." </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/mass-effect-krogan-civil-war-jpg-adapt-1920w-1762543620424.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mass Effect artwork showing the krogan civil war. Image credit: <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/mass-effect/411826207">BioWare.</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect fans are already poring over the image, and there's a couple of obvious observations right off the bat. Firstly, the hero krogan in this image is <em>old</em>, the kind of old we've already seen in Mass Effect Andromeda, like your ancient krogan squadmate Drack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't Drack, which begs the question — who are we looking at? The armor color is reminscent of Grunt, your Mass Effect 2 squadmate who was then just a youth. Though for him to be looking as old as Drack (who was over 1,000 years old!), it might suggest the next Mass Effect is similarly more than 1,000 years into Mass Effect 3's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From what we've seen already — a lightly-wrinkled Liara — this seems a little too far. Asari and krogan both have long lifespans, but Liara looked hundreds of years older, rather than 1,000. Could this be a new character? Or... could it just be Wrex? Mass Effect 1's fan-favorite krogan squadmate was already middle-aged in the original trilogy, so with another few hundred years on top, he may now be as old as Drack was in Andromeda.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The next big question, of course, is why are the krogan in the middle of a civil war? This one is perhaps easier to answer, when considering the range of endings Mass Effect 3 offered for the krogan race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Krogan have always been portrayed as warlike and expansionist, though they have suffered from infertility due to an artifical plague which saw their numbers dwindle and homeworld left almost barren. But Shepard can choose to aid their cause and reverse the plague's effects — with results then dependent on your other choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect 3's myriad of endings range from the krogan pursuing a peaceful renaissance, to their new-found numbers supercharging fresh calls for galactic expansion. Perhaps the next Mass Effect game will offer a storyline that caters to all of the above by suggesting two factions emerging: one which wants that expansion, and another that seeks to curb the race's worser instincts? Whatever's going on, it seems all is not well with the krogan, hundreds of years after the Reapers were destroyed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps we'll hear more of the krogan civil war within Amazon's upcoming Mass Effect TV series, which we learned today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">will be set after the events of the Mass Effect trilogy to avoid rehashing Commander Shepard's story</a>. BioWare also used today to reassert that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-and-bioware-remain-committed-to-next-mass-effect-game-and-yes-romances-will-return">remained committed to developing its next Mass Effect project, with publisher EA onboard for the future of the franchise</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Rockstar Games recently delivered some difficult news for people eagerly awaiting the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>--the game has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">pushed back yet again</a>, this time to November 2026. The delay also has implications for a potential PC version that history says will follow... eventually.</p><p>After the delay was announced, people flocked to the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official GTA 6 website</a> to see if anything was new. Players found that it had been updated to display the new release date, which is about six months later than the previously scheduled May 2026 date. With GTA 6 delayed for its currently announced platforms, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, that means the wait is getting even longer for the expected PC release to come later.</p><h2><strong>Rockstar's history of PC releases</strong></h2><p>GTA 6 is expected to release on PC, in part because of the significant business opportunity, but the PC editions of Rockstar's releases do not often release day and date with their console counterparts. This is part of how Rockstar operates. Earlier this year, Rockstar owner Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms."</p><p>"We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">he said.</a></p><p>Back in November 2024, Zelnick said PC will continue to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">"more and more important" for Take-Two's business going forward</a>, saying that supporting PC "isn't complicated for us."</p><p>How long does it usually take for Rockstar to bring its games to PC? It depends. For GTA V, the game had its initial release for PS3 and Xbox 360 back in September 2013. It came to PS4 and Xbox One in November 2014, and then landed on PC in April 2015. PC players waited about 18 months.</p><p>For Rockstar's next big game after GTA 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, the wait wasn't as long. The game launched for PS4 and Xbox One at the end of October 2018 and landed on PC about a year later in November 2019. The first Red Dead Redemption, meanwhile, was initially released for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010 and didn't arrive on PC until the end of October 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-is-finally-on-pc-more-than-14-years-later/1100-6527449/" data-ref-id="1100-6527449">representing a wait of more than 14 years.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598824-screenshot2025-11-07at3.08.55%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4598824" data-ratio="0.56102003642987" data-width="1098" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598824-screenshot2025-11-07at3.08.55%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4598824"></a><figcaption>There it is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4598824-screenshot2025-11-07at3.08.55%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><h2><strong>Why is GTA 6 not on PC at launch?</strong></h2><p>So why isn't GTA 6 coming to PC at launch? No one from Take-Two or Rockstar has gone on record to explain why. But a former Rockstar developer said the studio aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/" data-ref-id="1100-6519893">"prioritize what sells."</a></p><p dir="ltr">"The PC version is kind of the version that's in the background, that is running the two versions and building them," former Rockstar developer Mike York said. "There's always a PC version of the game, but it's not polished and it's just kind of feeding the other games and making them work."</p><p dir="ltr">GTA 6 might not be Rockstar's next release, as the company is rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">ports of Red Dead Redemption 2 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2</a>, and they could launch later this year.

In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">the game was just added to GTA+</a>, so subscribers can play that game as part of their membership, and <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-grand-theft-auto-v-revient-bientot-dans-le-catalogue-de-jeux-60766" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GTA 5 is rumored to be returning to the PS Plus game catalog soon. </a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/that-time-a-student-asked-us-not-to-write-any-weird-or-horny-shit-until-4-30-pm-and-other-highlights-from-aftermath%E2%80%99s-first-two-years.1347361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We did it. Against all odds (our profound lack of business acumen), we made it to our second anniversary, which is today, <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the dot</a>. We’ll have more – MUCH more – for you next week, but for now, let’s all reminisce about the highs and lows of our first two years (out of a planned infinity).&nbsp;</p><p>On the latest Aftermath Hours, the whole gang – Gita, Chris, Riley, Luke, Isaiah, Nicole, and I – gathers to celebrate Aftermath’s two-year anniversary. We begin by announcing that we’re relaunching the site next week, but not with all the bullshit bells and whistles you’ve come to expect from this sort of thing. Instead, it’ll still be the simple, streamlined Aftermath you’ve come to know and love, but sleeker, more professional, and easier to use. We’re very excited for you all to try it out!&nbsp;</p><p>We then move on to a discussion of how far the site and the underlying business have come, as well as our proudest accomplishments and our hopes and dreams for the future. We want to hire more people and make space for fresh voices, and while that was a pipe dream when we first launched, we’re now tantalizingly on the cusp. Year three, ideally, is when it all happens. Thanks for sticking with us. We wouldn’t – and literally couldn’t – be here without you.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can expand the Aftermath empire until it includes 1,000 overlapping podcasts, at least 500 of them hosted by Riley, who absolutely loves podcasts.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>We got an email, and Riley shared it with the group. It was about two different stories that I had written. A student wanted to write about a serious one that I had written about <a href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lawsuit concerning a <em>Candy Crush</em> scam</a>, and they were like “But my teacher says it has to be from a legitimate website, so can you guys not write about anything weird, like a breast milk river,” which was <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the headline of a story</a> from an interview that I’d previously done. What other site would get that email?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>“Don’t be weird or horny until this time and date.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>They specifically requested a time. They were like “OK, you can return to publishing those sorts of stories after this point in the day.” I think it was 4:30 PM or something? But until then, no weird shit or horny shit!</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Riley followed up to make sure it went OK.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>They were very kind about it, and it went well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nicole: </strong>It went well. It was allowed.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> They were so lovely about it. I think at other sites, you’d get a mean, harassing email. But this was just so kind and lovely.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It was so kind and sweet, and it was because they wanted to show the professor that we are a reputable outlet. They just weren’t sure how the professor would take things like breast milk rivers. I was like “You know what? Thank you for doing us this favor for one day. Now your professor will accept us as a source. It’s good for us, good for you.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>It must also be noted that that professor is definitely a coward. They see a breast milk river and think “Oh, they’re not serious?” No, we’re very serious. We just so happen to be serious about many things, including breast milk rivers. That’s fine.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> That was a serious article, too! It was real journalism. You deserve a Pulitzer Prize.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/solve-these-strange-jigsaws-steam-puzzle-games"><h3>Solve These Strange Jigsaws</h3></a><p>From puzzle maker FLEB, Strange Jigsaws is one of my favorite games this year</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-second-anniversary-special]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1986748540744519784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> by LinkedIn researcher extraordinaire Timur222, an Executive Producer who worked at Free Range Games until last week (she was unfortunately just laid off, as so many game developers nowadays) has practically confirmed that The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will be getting a sequel. On her LinkedIn profile, she wrote: </p>



<p><em>As Executive Producer and Studio Executive at Free Range Games, I lead large-scale creative and technical initiatives that drive the development of AAA titles across global teams. My work includes overseeing the post-production lifecycle of The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria franchise (and sequel) and a new unannounced IP with a $100 million budget and a 130-person distributed team. I partner closely with executive leadership to define production strategy, strengthen operational efficiency, and align project milestones with studio growth objectives. Beyond production oversight. I play a key role in building a culture of trust and accountability, mentoring producers, and advancing sustainable remote collaboration models that enhance delivery consistency and team cohesion.</em></p>



<p>It seems like the independent developer based in Sausalito, California, has two big projects on the works: a sequel to 2023's survival crafting game The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, which has clearly done well enough to warrant another entry, and an even bigger unannounced project with a nine-digit budget.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as covered a couple of weeks ago, Free Range Games is about to launch the <a href="https://wccftech.com/durins-folk-dlc-adds-20-hours-new-content-the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durin's Folk DLC</a>, which will introduce around twenty hours of new content to The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, not to mention new features such as recruitable NPCs with specific skills.</p>



<p>The DLC will add an area known as Durin's Tower, trading camps near Moria’s gates, and the recruiting camp at Dimmer Dale. New gameplay elements include recruiting dwarves with specific skills. In Durin's Folk, players will also manage delvings (mining bases) with buildings. The DLC will go live on November 18 on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p>It's certainly good news for Tolkien fans who love videogames, especially following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second cancellation of Amazon's MMO</a>. According to a recent rumor, there may be yet another project based on The Lord of the Rings: an action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lord-of-the-rings-third-person-action-game-in-development-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly created as a rival to Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The full list of nominees for the 2026 Grammys was announced on Friday, and that includes the category dedicated to video games and interactive media. This will be the fourth year that the award for Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media will be given after it was introduced for the 2023 awards.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">year’s nominees include</a> games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Star Wars Outlaws, and even Helldivers 2.</p>



<p>You may be asking, “How is Helldivers 2 nominated?” Well, that’s because of the timing of nominations and when soundtracks were actually released. The soundtrack for Helldivers 2 <a href="https://milanrecords.com/out-now-helldivers-2-original-game-soundtrack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was officially released</a> on September 20, 2024. To be eligible for the 2026 Grammys, the soundtrack had to be released between August 31, 2024, and August 30, 2025. </p>



<p>The 68th annual Grammy Awards takes place on February 1, 2026. You can check out the five games up for the award below.</p>







<p>Of this year’s nominees, only two were from games that originally released during the nomination window. Helldivers 2’s eligibility was already covered above, but what about Avatar and Star Wars Outlaws? That’s pretty simple, as well, because they were for story expansions that released within the required timeframe.</p>



<p>The full nomination list is:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – Secrets of the Spire</strong>: Pinar Toprak, composer</li>



<li><strong>Helldivers 2</strong>: Wilbert Roget, II, composer</li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</strong>: Gordy Haab, composer</li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate’s Fortune</strong>: Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II, composers</li>



<li><strong>Sword of the Sea</strong>: Austin Wintory, composer</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-past-soundtrack-winners">Past Soundtrack Winners</h2>



<p>As mentioned, this will be the fourth year in a row for the Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media. In 2023, <strong>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok by Stephanie Economou</strong> took home the first award after beating out Aliens: Fireteam Elite, Call of Duty Vanguard, Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Old World.</p>



<p>In 2024, it was <strong>Stephen Barton and Gordy Haab winning for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</strong>. Other nominees that year included Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, God of War Ragnarök, Hogwarts Legacy, and Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical. </p>



<p>Last year, <strong>Winifred Phillips won for Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</strong>. Wizardry beat out Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and Star Wars Outlaws.</p>

Bowser's minions will try to stop you in a variety of ways, which is awkward since Kamek is Bowser's right-hand Koopa, but perhaps Bullet Bill, Dry Bones, Lakitu, and the castle itself are jealous of that. The track has one tall loop that sends your racer through the castle door.</p><p>This 34-inch track is one of the larger Mario Kart Hot Wheel sets actively being produced today. As mentioned, Bowser's Castle Raceway implements the new Speed Snap connection system, which makes track pieces easier for kids to assemble.

And just last week, Rockstar fired between 30 and 40 employees, claiming later that they were "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</a>" against company policy. The fired employees, however, say they were participating in a union-related Discord chat, and that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">their firing was "blatant" and "ruthless" union busting</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is defending the company's culture and labor record, saying Take-Two is "incredibly proud" of its labor relations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN yesterday ahead of the earnings announcement, Zelnick pointed me to Take-Two and Rockstar's existing public statements when I asked if he had any response to the allegations of union busting, and reiterating that "we fully support Rockstar."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So then I asked Zelnick, what is Take-Two's stance on unions, generally? Zelnick did not reply to that specific question. But here's what he did say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Here’s what we have a stance on. We value every one of our colleagues greatly. We have 13,500 colleagues worldwide. We’re so proud of our culture. In the last few years we’ve been recognized over 15 times as an employer of choice... we’ve been certified this year as a great place to work in the U.S. and UK, Forbes recently called us one of the world’s best employers, and further... our attrition rate is half or less of the industry average. To be specific, our global attrition rate is just over 6%, in the UK it's less than 4%. The industry average is over 12%, and Rockstar is even lower than our average."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, you know, the proof is in the pudding, and the food is good, and I think our culture is extraordinary. And we strive to be the most creative, most innovative, and most efficient company in the business. So that’s how we look at it. We’re incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/07/gettyimages-1440125158-1762538511589.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Strauss Zelnick has defended Rockstar's company culture. Photo by Steven Ferdman/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>[A Take-Two spokesperson later clarified Rockstar's global attrition rate is 4%, and in the UK it is "half that number." IGN followed up to ask for the source of the over 12% industry average attrition. The spokesperson clarified it was for "entertainment and tech" and that the source was Take-Two's own internal research: "we use a variety of related data platforms/sources to compile."]</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelnick's response comes amid ongoing uproar over the firings, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-employment-protests-outside-take-two-and-rockstar-north-offices-as-fired-staff-deny-leaking-company-secrets">affected employees and supporters picketing outside Rockstar and Take-Two's UK offices yesterday</a>. According to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the only non-Rockstar people inside the private union Discord were union organizers. IWGB boss Alex Marshall issued IGN the following statement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Rockstar continue to deflect from the real reason for these dismissals: they are afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA 6, and that they’re prioritising union busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In recent years, Rockstar executives have benefited from £443 million in tax relief, while showing total disregard for the law or the livelihoods of their staff. At every turn, they’ve chosen profits over both workers and fans of their games. The only non Rockstar employees in the union Discord channel were union organisers."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar maintains that the firings were for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first instance of labor unrest at the company.

<figure data-uuid="fce842f35f96c"><a title="Mega Man 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fce842f35f96c/mega-man-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mega Man</strong> artist and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mighty_no_9">Mighty No. 9</a> creator Keiji Inafune has been a huge name in the industry for nearly four decades, so you could say he's got a fair bit of experience. Recently, the producer gave a talk at South Korea’s Console Game Developer Conference 2025, and has a few strong words for developers and publishers relying on big IPs and genre trends.</p>
<p>Reported on by <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/406514">ThisIsGame</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mega-man-creator-keiji-inafune-criticizes-game-industrys-growing-reliance-on-ip-fame-and-trendy-genres-we-need-developers-with-a-clear-message/">Automaton</a>), Inafune was critical of studios that rely on those established brands and IPs or just shoot for "genre trends" because they're supposedly guaranteed to make money.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying it’s bad to continue existing franchises or make games that riff on popular genres," Inafune states (translated via machine by Automaton), "What I mean is that these shouldn’t be the only games being made."</p>
<p>It's hard to argue with that, though obviously every studio is going to vary. Nintendo has a huge range of IPs to dip into, for example, and while we see regulars such as <strong>Mario</strong>, <strong>Pokémon</strong>, and <strong>Zelda</strong> pop up every other year (or sometimes every year), the Big N occasionally dips into its deeper past (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven</a> in 2026, anyone?).</p>
<p>In terms of "popular genres", looter shooters, Battle Royales, and extraction shooters are all carrots the industry has been trying to chase for years with varying results.</p>

<p>In his speech, Inafune mentioned "<strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-style" and "<strong>Final Fantasy</strong>-style" games and that, back in his day, new concepts were "simply the norm" and put down his own success to jumping between different projects, even though he spent the most time working on the Mega Man series.</p>
<p>He told the audience that his success "was possible because I didn’t dwell on my past hits”, and that the industry has taken a much more "defensive" stance as the industry has matured.</p>
<p>While he understands that business may need to fall back on the more-popular things, "when considering the essence of game development and the passion for creation, it should not become the entirety of the gaming scene."</p>
<p>Inafune has indeed had an extremely varied career, worked as a graphic designer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a>, various Disney Capcom games, producer on the DualShock release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil_directors_cut">Resident Evil</a>, the <strong>Onimusha</strong> series, executive producer on <strong>Lost Planet</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/apollo_justice_ace_attorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/ghost_trick_phantom_detective">Ghost Trick</a>... we could list <em>hundreds.</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="351278c84ddf8"><a title="Mighty No. 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/351278c84ddf8/mighty-no-9.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Deep Silver</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Post-Capcom, Inafune has worked with Inti Creates on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/azure_striker_gunvolt">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a> series and launched the hugely successful Kickstarter for Mighty No. 9, a game which was heavily inspired by Mega Man and, unfortunately, turned out to be a critical flop. In 2022, he announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/05/nft-project-with-artwork-from-mega-man-artist-and-mighty-no-9-creator-keiji-inafune-confirmed">an NFT project called Beastroids</a>, once again inspired by Mega Man.</p>
<p>Inafune also joined Level-5 after the purchase of Comcept in 2017, eventually working as producer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>. He <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/fantasy-life-i-development-was-restructured-in-2024-as-keiji-inafune-left-company">left the company in 2024</a>, with Level-5 CEO Akihiro Hino saying that following his departure, "we had to reassess and restructure the project". He has since joined Rocket Studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The original Soldier of Fortune was a Raven Software title that was released on PC in the year 2000, and if you look at gameplay from the original title, it's a clear showcase of just how far we've come since those days. However, thanks to modder 'Pathtraced Paradise,' a new RTX Remix mod currently in development breathes new path-traced life into the classic first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/take-a-look-at-this-soldier-of-fortune-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">DSOGaming</a>, the modder currently has YouTube videos uploaded of the first two levels, though<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/solider-of-fortune-rtx-remix-mod-wip-demo"> files for the tutorial and first three levels have been compiled so far</a>. It is still a work-in-progress, though, so you'll have to wait for Pathtraced Paradise to finish developing the mod to play the whole game in this new light. There's currently no download link available for the mod.</p>



<p>That said, what they've shared of the first two levels already looks like strong work, as you can see from the videos below.</p>

<p>It's always fun to see old games like Soldier of Fortune get another chance at life with mods like this, which easily make going back to classic titles a much more enjoyable experience than they otherwise would be if you had to deal with the original graphical settings.</p>



<p>Other recent RTX remix mods that added path-tracing to older games include <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-soon/">a recent Max Payne 2 mod that looks incredible</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/">Grand Theft Auto IV RTX remix mod</a>, and an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/">Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind path-tracing mod</a>.</p>



<p>There's also path-tracing mods worth checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-rtx-mod-path-tracing/">for Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">the Half-Life remake, Black Mesa</a>. Also, it should be noted that the same creator behind the aforementioned GTA IV path-tracing mod has made successful path-tracing mods for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-4-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">Portal 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's unfortunately no word on when Pathtraced Paradise will be done modding the rest of the game, but at least for now, these videos provide a sneak peek at what we can look forward to, especially considering the fact that these aren't even representative of what the mod will look like when it's finished.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developer-behind-hit-2025-game-thinks-the-response-has-been-%E2%80%98too-positive%E2%80%99.1347313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I am convinced that I can get better at <a href="https://kotaku.com/ballxpit-devolver-kenny-sun-brickbreaker-indie-2000635720">playing <em>Ball X Pit</em></a>, but whether I win or lose often seems to have little connection to my actual moment-to-moment skill. Sure, I can be smarter about my upgrade picks. I can aim and maneuver to maximize my DPS and avoid some attacks. But in the aggregate, my success feels more or less predetermined by an invisible curve that’s slowly progressing me through the metagame.</p> <p>“I think there is a bit of a skill curve, but I do think it plateaus pretty quickly,” lead developer Kenny Sun <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ball-x-pit-x-interview">told<em> Game File</em></a> this week. “Once you get it, there’s not much you can do to improve your play. So, it is very much a game about pretending that you’re getting better by getting better stats, actually.”</p>

 <p>Rarely has a developer so perfectly articulated my ambiguous and conflicted feelings about their game!</p> <p>Look, <em>Ball X Pit</em> is great. The smart mashup of <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132"><em>Breakout</em> and <em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> is way more than just a cash-in on one of Steam’s hottest genres. It’s part shoot ’em up, part buildcrafting roguelike, and part management sim. And it’s not just nice to look at and listen to while you’re watching the numbers go up. There are new levels to reach with unique hazards and tons of characters to unlock that subvert the core ball-throwing mechanic in interesting ways.</p>

 <p>But still, I have a hard time not feeling slightly tricked and manipulated as I play, even if after each break I eventually come back for more. It’s the same way I felt about <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and later <em>Balatro</em>, and most recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-silent-hill-jurassic-world-dispatch-2000638933"><em>Slots &amp; Daggers</em></a>. Sun said this is partly by design.</p>

 <p>“I kind of like the idea of having it start off as one thing and then slowly evolve into an idle game,” he told<em> Game File</em>. “Like, the more you play, the less you play.” He continued, “That’s something that one of my artists was talking about: He had this idea about how games were kind of turning into a thing where players just want to play less of the game. Like, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> is all about not playing the game.”</p>

 <p>In other words, the more I play, the more I’m actually not playing, which makes me want to play even more. This is nothing completely new. You can sense the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-loot-is-so-addictive-according-to-the-c-1846695147">dark DNA of <em>Diablo</em></a> in each of these recent RNG-driven skinner boxes. But they are getting so much more streamlined and optimized.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s some small part of why Sun seems somewhat reluctant about <em>Ball X Pit</em>‘s wild success.</p> <p>It sold 400,000 copies in its first week. That number has almost doubled in the weeks since. “It just feels weird for so many people to like this game,” he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-07/how-ball-x-pit-became-a-hit-video-game?srnd=undefined">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a separate interview. “I think the response has been a bit too positive. I think, like, there are plenty of flaws…I think the good things are good enough that it makes people ignore the flaws.”</p> <p>Whatever those flaws are, they haven’t dented the roguelike’s 96-percent positive user rating on Steam. No wonder my inbox is flooded with new indie games pitching themselves as “<em>Vampire Survivors</em> meets X” or <em>“Balatro</em> crossed with Y.” Unfortunately, I don’t think most of them will be cleverly designed as <em>Ball X Pit</em>, let alone as successful.</p>

                <p>The entire video game industry is currently preoccupied by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Regardless of when it arrives, the next GTA is going to be a blockbuster no matter what Rockstar's competitors do. In fact, Saints Row designer Chris Stockman believes that there is no competing with GTA anymore.</p><p>"You have to be something else," said Stockman during an appearance on <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/saints-row-creator-says-devs-cant-compete-with-gta-6-because-gta-online-has-propelled-it-to-beyond-just-a-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FRVR's podcast</a>. "You can't compete with them anymore. You can't. It's impossible. You can't make a Western game and try to compete with Red Dead."</p><p>Stockman went on to describe GTA Online's continued success as a "lifestyle" that has "propelled it to be beyond just a game." Instead of trying to take GTA's crown, Stockman suggested that there's room for someone to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-gta/2900-5629/" data-ref-id="2900-5629">the No. 2 game like GTA</a>.</p><p>"The industry is bigger than its ever been in the sense that people hunger for games," said Stockman. "People hunger for new experiences. I think it's entirely possible to be a number two, there's nothing wrong with trying to be a number two if you play your cards right. You don't go crazy, you be very focused, you don't look at GTA as a North Star and say, 'I wanna be that.' You have a clear identity and this is what you're trying to do. And you don't have to be a 100 hour masterpiece, and you just gotta be smart about it."</p><p>Stockman recently disclosed that he has been asked to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-creative-director-wants-to-bring-the-franchise-back-from-the-dead/1100-6535875/" data-ref-id="1100-6535875">pitch a Saints Row sequel</a>, but that project hasn't fully come together yet. The most recent game in the series was the 2022 Saints Row reboot.</p><p>For the time being, there are no new Saints Row games officially in the works, and the wait for GTA 6 is now much longer, a fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-delays-gta-6-and-the-internet-responds-exactly-as-youd-expect/1100-6536039/" data-ref-id="1100-6536039">fans online haven't been happy about</a>. Barring another release date change, Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 19, 2026.</p>

It's a "more straightforward racing" kind of mode. Meanwhile, City Trial is a "free-for-all battle for 16 players online." You collect power-ups, survive Field Events like falling meteors and "powerful boss battles," and compete against rival Riders in Stadium contests.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-is-getting-a-kirby-air-ride-sequel/1100-6530561/" data-ref-id="1100-6530561">A sequel</a> to a series that's been dormant for over 20 years, director Masahiro Sakurai said Kirby Air Riders is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/" data-ref-id="1100-6534066">basically Mario Kart</a>" in August 2025, so if you like that racing game, you may like this racing game. He also said it won't get any DLC, claiming that "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-wont-have-dlc-sakurai-confirms/1100-6535652/" data-ref-id="1100-6535652">everything is here</a>."</p><p>Kirby Air Riders hits Nintendo Switch 2 on November 20.</p>

                <p>An early quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> tasks you with finding Antiseptics, Syringes, Durable Cloths, and Great Mullein for Lance. While this may sound overwhelming at first, it's actually a pretty easy quest to complete once you realize all of the items are likely to be found in the same handful of areas. Below, we'll fill you in on where to find all of the items for the first quest from Lance, as well as how you can simply craft a few of them if necessary.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Where_to_get_Antiseptics__Syringes__and_Durable_Cloths">Where to get Antiseptics, Syringes, and Durable Cloths</a><ul><li><a href="#How_to_craft_Antiseptic">How to craft Antiseptic</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_craft_Durable_Cloth">How to craft Durable Cloth</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Where_to_get_Great_Mullein">Where to get Great Mullein</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Where_to_get_Antiseptics__Syringes__and_Durable_Cloths">Where to get Antiseptics, Syringes, and Durable Cloths</h2><p>Antiseptics, syringes, and durable cloths can all be found in medical POIs, with the latter occasionally showing up in Commercial buildings as well. Some excellent early spots to seek out these items include the Testing Annex on the southeastern side of the Dam Battlegrounds, or the Hospital or Piazza Arbusto pharmacy on Buried City. All of these locations have a high probability of serving up at least one or two of these items while thoroughly exploring their interiors.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598672-share_20251107_0504583.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598673-share_20251107_0506480.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598674-share_20251107_0506491.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598672,1300-4598673,1300-4598674" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598672-share_20251107_0504583.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598673-share_20251107_0506480.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598674-share_20251107_0506491.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598672-share_20251107_0504583.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598673-share_20251107_0506480.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598674-share_20251107_0506491.jpeg"></figure><p>Alternatively, Antiseptics and Durable Cloths can also be crafted if you have the Refiner workshop bench built in Speranza.</p><h3 id="How_to_craft_Antiseptic">How to craft Antiseptic</h3><ul><li>Chemicals x10</li><li>Great Mullein x2</li></ul><h3 id="How_to_craft_Durable_Cloth">How to craft Durable Cloth</h3><ul><li>Fabric x14</li></ul><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598670-share_20251107_0504572.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598671-share_20251107_0504561.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598670,1300-4598671" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598670-share_20251107_0504572.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598671-share_20251107_0504561.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598670-share_20251107_0504572.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598671-share_20251107_0504561.jpeg"></figure><p>Sadly, Syringes can't be crafted, so you'll need to do some looting one way or another if you want to get your hands on those. Luckily, as you'll see below, the spot you find Great Mullein easiest is also a great choice for finding these medical supplies, so it shouldn't pose too much of a hassle.</p><h2 id="Where_to_get_Great_Mullein">Where to get Great Mullein</h2><p>Great Mullein can be found across multiple maps, typically in areas with a lot of water. The easiest place to find some near-guaranteed drops is the Testing Annex on the Dam Battlegrounds map. On the bottom floor of this facility is a pool of water that almost always has multiple spawns of this plant available for you to pluck up--assuming no one else has passed through and taken them before you. As referenced above, it's also a fantastic location for finding the other items you need as well, so make sure you loot upstairs, too, if you haven't finished the other quest requirements.</p><p>Refer to the image below for what Great Mullein looks like.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598675-share_20251107_0504550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598675" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598675-share_20251107_0504550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598675"></a><figcaption>Great Mullein in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598675-share_20251107_0504550.jpeg"></figure><p>When you've found all of the items needed for Lance, return to him at Speranza and turn in the quest. Next up, he'll send you off to loot a bunch of containers across multiple maps for the Medical Merchandise quest, so make sure you're ready for plenty of exploring when you head topside next.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Traders in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> will send you on plenty of quests to find them specific items, such as A Reveal in Ruins, where Lance requests that you find him an ESR Analyzer from a pharmacy in Buried City. This quest is straightforward at a glance, but you'll want to know where to go to find this item, as getting back out alive is all part of the task.</p><p>You heard right--you'll need to take the ESR Analyzer back to Speranza, so you'll want to bring an augment with a safe pocket to ensure that you don't lose the item if you happen to die. Once you've equipped an appropriate augment--and hopefully a good gun and a few heals--it'll be time to set off.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle A Reveal in Ruins, follow the steps below to find the ESR Analyzer.</p><h3>Where to find the ESR Analyzer for A Reveal in Ruins</h3><p>The first quest objective for A Reveal in Ruins states you can find an ESR Analyzer in any pharmacy in the Buried City, but the safest and most easily-accessible option is located in the Piazza Arbusto POI on the southeast part of the map. This location is generally quiet with slightly fewer ARC and raiders wandering around than in higher-traffic areas around the Buried City.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598595-share_20251107_0409440.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598595-share_20251107_0409440.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598595"></a><figcaption>Pizza Arbusto pharmacy location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598595-share_20251107_0409440.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the pharmacy in Piazza Arbusto, you'll discover the front door is barred. You'll need to breach it by interacting with the barricade, which will take a few moments to complete and make a lot of noise. You'll probably be fine--but if it <em>does</em> alert any nearby ARC, you can either fight them or quickly close the door behind you when you enter the pharmacy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598597-share_20251107_0409473.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598597" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598597-share_20251107_0409473.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598597"></a><figcaption>Breach the door to enter the pharmacy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598597-share_20251107_0409473.jpeg"></figure><p>Inside the pharmacy, you'll be able to find a variety of useful healing items and resources, so feel free to check all the shelves in this room. When you're ready to pick up the ESR Analyzer, you'll find it in plain sight on the counter here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598598-share_20251107_0409451.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598598" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598598-share_20251107_0409451.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598598"></a><figcaption>Take the ESR Analyzer from the counter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598598-share_20251107_0409451.jpeg"></figure><p>With the ESR Analyzer found, you'll want to toss it in a safe pocket (if you have one), as you need to extract with the item and take it back to Lance to complete the quest. The Eastern Station extraction point is just southwest of your location, so that's likely to be your safest bet for getting out alive. Head there and carefully make your way downstairs, as there are sometimes explosive ARC Pods wandering the steps. Call the train, head back to Speranza, and give Lance the ESR Analyzer to complete A Reveal in Ruins.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>You're probably accustomed to using the normal method of extraction in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, such as elevators, trains, or air shafts (depending on the map). However, Raider Hatches provide an easier and faster method of getting back to Speranza if you have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-arc-raiders-hatch-keys-and-what-they-do/1100-6535839/" data-ref-id="1100-6535839">Raider Hatch Key</a>. You'll learn about these unique escape hatches during the Hatch Repair quest--but you'll also need to repair a hatch to complete the quest.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Hatch Repairs, but as you'll find further below, the quest makes it quite easy for you to do so if you wish. Either way, it's never a bad idea to load in with a free loadout to ensure you don't lose any hard-earned items or guns if you die during the quest.</p><p>Once you're ready to take on Hatch Repairs, follow the steps below to find a Raider Hatch and repair it.</p><h2>Where to find a Raider Hatch</h2><p>The first step to repairing a Raider Hatch is to, well, find one. Luckily, there are multiple Raider Hatches on the Dam Battlegrounds map, so the one that will be best suited for you to visit will depend on where you spawn. Below are the four spots you can go to find a Raider Hatch, so pick the one closest to your spawn--or wherever you are during your exploration--and head that way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598589-share_20251107_0339422.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598589" data-ratio="0.58888126286891" data-width="2914" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598589-share_20251107_0339422.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598589"></a><figcaption>Raider Hatch locations on Dam Battlegrounds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598589-share_20251107_0339422.jpeg"></figure><p>As a side note, you can complete this quest on other maps, as well, as Raider Hatches are available on every map. However, since this quest is given to you early in the game, we've opted to keep this guide simple with the Dam Battlegrounds locations, as this map is available to all players immediately. In contrast, other maps won't unlock until you've played a specific number of matches.</p><h2>How to repair a Raider Hatch</h2><p>When you arrive at a Raider Hatch, you'll need to repair it. This part is very easy, as you'll simply need to <strong>click on the pipe coming out of the hatch</strong>, which should glow yellow in your game to indicate that you can interact with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598590-share_20251107_0339411.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598590" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598590-share_20251107_0339411.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598590"></a><figcaption>Repair the Raider Hatch by interacting with this pipe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598590-share_20251107_0339411.jpeg"></figure><p>With this done, you'll have completed the Hatch Repairs quest. Before you leave, note that finishing the above task will cause a small box to spawn near the hatch, which will contain a Raider Hatch Key. These can be used to escape through any Raider Hatch. Your quest is done, so you don't have to use this key right now if you'd like to continue exploring--but if you're ready to bail out, this makes for a quick and easy return to Speranza.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/2k-take-two-ceo-zelnick-mafia-old-country-sales-single-player-linear-2000642150</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick seems pretty happy with this year’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a>.</em> In a new interview, he said the relatively short and linear semi-open-world action game proves that a lot of players will buy games that are focused, not super bloated, and offer a good story. And boy howdy, as someone who loves a nice weekend single-player game, I’m very happy to hear that.</p> <p><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again?r=52dp8y&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true#:~:text=The%20other%20big,the%20perfect%20result.%E2%80%9D">In a recent interview with T<em>he Game Business</em> newsletter</a>, Zelnick talked about some of the successes Take-Two has had over the past few months. It turns out <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em> isn’t selling as well as expected, which the CEO blames on PC issues and says he expects it to do well in the long term. On the flipside, <em>Mafia: The Old Country,</em> a different game published earlier this year by 2K (a wholly owned subsidiary of Take-Two), actually <em>beat</em> internal sales expectations. According to Zelnick, it proves that people want well-made, narrative-driven single-player games.</p>

 <p>“What we suspected was confirmed,” Zelnick told the outlet. “Which is just…if you give consumers a great narrative experience that’s a lot of fun, somewhat contained, and at a fair price, then you can have the perfect result.”</p>  <h2>Remember when everything wasn’t a live-service thing?</h2> <p>Released in August and developed by Hangar 13,<em> The Old Country</em> is smaller than past <em>Mafia</em> titles, only takes about 11 hours to complete, has no online components, and launched at a reduced price of $50. It’s also the kind of game we don’t really get anymore from AAA publishers like 2K: <a href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions">a big-budget, solo-only, linear action game</a> that lacks a lot of replay value or in-game purchases. Back in the PS2 and even Xbox 360 eras of gaming, this was pretty standard stuff. Not so much anymore.</p>

 <p>However, as Zelnick points out, there is definitely a demand for these types of games. I think a lot of people don’t have the time to dedicate to the latest big online hit, nor can they invest 200 hours into some giant open-world RPG. But a 10- to 12-hour action-adventure game with some great cutscenes, good writing, and no bullshit? Yeah, that’s appealing to a lot of people, myself included.</p> <p>Hopefully<em>, Mafia: The Old Country</em>‘s success can be used as a blueprint for Take-Two, and the publisher can greenlight similarly sized projects at its various studios. And we can play those games while we wait for Take-Two’s juggernaut, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> to finally release one day. Eventually</a>.</p>

This will add dynamic weather to Arc Raiders with an electromagnetic storm that produces lightning. This weather element will affect parts of the game's maps, making some areas more dangerous to explore. However, the developer also teases lightning strikes will leave behind curious formations, so players may want to investigate those areas.</p>
