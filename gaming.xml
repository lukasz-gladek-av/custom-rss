<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/generation-exile">Generation Exile</a> is the new eco-conscious turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy sim</a> from Sonderlust Studios, a Canada-based independent developer whose members include Nels Anderson (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mark-of-the-ninja">Mark of the Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>), Karla Zimonja (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tacoma">Tacoma</a>), and Marri Knadle (Far Cry 5 &amp; 6). A talented gang indeed. The game puts you in charge of a scrappy band of humans living on a colony ship so huge it can harbour mountain ranges and lakes. 
</p>
<p>
The ship puts me heavily in mind of the grandest and most luxurious vessels from Iain M. Banks's Culture novels, except that it's a polluted and treacherous hexagonal wilderness that is closer in vibe to Scavenger's Reign. Your job is to emerge from below decks, bolt together an outpost, and restore each sprawling biome before the colony ship completes its journey. Along the way, you'll have to reckon with personality dynamics and branching dialogue quests redolent of 11-Bit's management sims, and deal with some kind of marauding "entity" from the Earth you left behind.

<p>
I had a quick go of Generation Exile's early access build yesterday, and have bleary, late-night Thoughts that are very much not a proper review. I really like the premise, though I've seen it before in the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ixion">Ixion</a>, and the glowing, bacterial aesthetics. The game operates according to the principle of a circular economy. Some of the resources at your disposal are finite, requiring you to dismantle structures (and reduce those tiles to unbuildable rubble) everytime you build something else. One mechanic I'm especially keen on so far is power. Rather than building nuclear reactors and suchlike, this sees you retiring the atmosphere scrubbers that surround your emergence hole to free up juice. The trade-off is that the surrounding habitat will grow less stable.
</p><p>
As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a>, the habitat restoration stuff is heavily shaded by real-world environmental clean-up strategies. When you encounter a body of water, for example, it's advisable to install an algal bioreactor to purge excess nitrates. Then you'll want to invest in a granulizer to process and store the resulting sludge. We're a far cry from building Orc huts in Warcraft, aren't we. Rather than there being a research component, you get new techs and building types once certain conditions are fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
When building in regions that have gone a bit sickly, you'll have to complete a task check, which sees you assigning named, backstoried crewmates with relevant skills to offset a stack of crisis counters. The outcome of these task checks is to raise the odds of either a miraculous windfall of some kind - possibly an actual windfall - or a cataclysm, as illustrated by an icon of a meteor (I hope there won't be any actual meteors).</p>
<p>There are also pop-up quests that might see you, for example, deciding how to deal with a renegade lifeform that has snuck inside a silo. The game's writing is perhaps more New Weird than solarpunk, encouraging the player to embrace a certain level of hideous posthuman infestation rather than aiming to deck the landscape in squeaky clean windmills.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty of terminology to chew through. I can't work out if that abundance of terminology is why my opening playthrough ran out of steam, though it's perhaps a question of overall presentation. There are icons for building states, and arching lines to indicate relationships, but I struggled to work out how to, for example, feed my habitats to produce adequate crew for technician training in order to run my vertical gardens, which I need to feed my habitats.</p>
<p>I think some of this confusion is due to end-of-day brain, mind. Again, this ain't a review! I'm keen to play more and see if something clicks. Or squelches. Or stridulates. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963240/Generation_Exile/">You can find Generation Exile on Steam</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players on PC are editing their game files to force crossplay off, in an attempt to avoid console players.</p>
<p>By going into Battlefield 6's Steam files, specifically the PROFSAVE profile, people can add a single line of code that turns off crossplay. <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538">This trick was posted on Twitter by Swedish competitive gamer Ottr</a>, who claims - at the moment - it'll place those who attempt it into bot lobbies due to a lack of players making use of this little tweak. However, they hope (if it catches on) they might be able to get "solid games".</p>
<p>As for why players are doing this? Well, console players almost entirely use standard controllers to play Battlefield 6 across Xbox Series and PS5 machines. These controllers offer less accuracy than a keyboard &amp; mouse, and as such Battlefield Studios (as well as the developers of many, many other games) offer a degree of aim assist to bridge the gap between hardware.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-lead-confirms-aim-assist-is-getting-nerfed-but-the-25-percent-recoil-reduction-is-staying-for-now-the-stickiness-straight-up-kills-you-if-theres-multiple-enemies/">It's worth noting that Battlefield 6's aim assist <em>is</em> getting nerfed in the near future</a>, though the 25% recoil reduction for controller users is going to stick around for a while longer at least. So those being burned by controller users should hopefully feel a little less frustration moving forward.</p><p>This aim assist, in the mind of a significant portion of PC FPS players, provides an unfair advantage. As such, tweaking the files to turn off crossplay provides matches free from ‘console scrubs’, as it were. This, however, would not prevent players on PC from just plugging in a controller and taking advantage of aim assist that way. This, in theory, shouldn't be a problem, though. The assumption being that those willing to take these steps to disable crossplay are specifically looking for a controller-less experience.</p>
<p>The gripes against aim assist are not solely a Battlefield thing. In fact, the more competitive-minded Call of Duty community often rage endlessly at the advantages granted to console players when it comes to aim assist. The same is true for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, which, to be fair, has perhaps laid on the aim assist a little strong in the past.</p>
<p>As easy as some find it to put anti aim-assist players in a box marked tryhard, it's worth asking, how would you feel if you were beaten by another player given advantages not available to you? Some aim assistance is obviously fine, in fact, it's probably necessary in this age of cross-platform play. But lather it on a touch too thick? You might find some of your better players feeling sour, and not without reason.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Nintendo's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/">excellent quarterly and half-year results</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a 61-page document</a> with investors detailing the Japanese game and console manufacturer's strategy going forward.</p>



<p>Nintendo is mainly focused on keeping the momentum after the launch of the Switch 2 with a schedule filled with first-party releases, such as Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we just reviewed</a>), Kirby Air Riders, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-tennis-fever-launch-february-2026-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park, Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, Pokémon Pokopia, and Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave. But Furukawa also boasted that the console offers the 'largest third-party software lineup for a new Nintendo hardware ever', increasing appeal for those gamers who aren't content with just first-party offerings.</p>



<p>Furukawa recognized that demand has exceeded the company's expectations in certain regions, resulting in ongoing shortages of Switch 2 systems. After apologizing for the inconvenience, he remarked that Nintendo will continue striving to deliver a stable supply of hardware.</p>



<p>With such a strong wind at their backs, it's no wonder Nintendo is now looking to reinvest in several key areas. One of those, according to the document, is the acquisition of game developers. This is not something that the Japanese company is particularly known for, although there have been a few exceptions, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-acquires-luigis-mansion-3-and-metroid-prime-federation-force-developer-next-level-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021's acquisition of Next Level Games</a>. </p>



<p>That studio had already partnered with Nintendo to make games like Luigi's Mansion 3. Should the same criteria be maintained in future acquisitions, possible targets could include Game Freak, HAL Laboratory, and Intelligent Systems, which have often worked on Nintendo IPs. When it comes to Western studios, the most likely option is MercurySteam, the Spanish developer that worked on two Metroid 2D games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-points-to-mandated-crunch-at-mercurysteam-metroid-dread-blades-of-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Its troubled financial situation</a> may prompt MercurySteam to accept such an offer.</p>



<ul>
<li><em>First is strengthening game development. We will work to strengthen the internal game development organization within the Nintendo group. This includes initiatives such as acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries and augmenting our development facilities, and the construction of Corporate Headquarters Development Center, Building No. 2 (tentative name).</em></li>



<li><em>Second is building software assets in non-game entertainment. Taking into account the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, we will allocate funds to more actively pursue business opportunities that have an affinity with our game business, including but not limited to movies.</em></li>



<li><em>Third is the foundation for maintaining and expanding our relationships with consumers. We will utilize funds to maintain and expand our touchpoints with consumers, centered on the Nintendo Account system.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Furukawa also stated that funds will be dedicated to pursuing additional business opportunities to expand the company's assets beyond videogames. There's The Super Mario Galaxy Movie <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in April 2026</a>, not to mention the Zelda live action film scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-live-action-movie-slated-for-march-26-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 26, 2027</a>. Lastly, the Nintendo president aims to utilize the Nintendo Account, which has been created by more than 400 million people to date, to connect Nintendo with consumers and foster long-term relationships with them. </p>



<p>This multi-sided strategy appears to be the best approach to engage with both existing and new fans, although, of course, only time will tell whether it pans out as the company hopes.</p>

            <p>In 'Yeahhh, probably should have had that already' news, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> are getting a new low-power mode that will let the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">handheld PCs</a> continue any active downloads with the display switched off. It’s part of a SteamOS update that’s available right now on the Beta and Preview channels, at last closing a longstanding feature gap that’s had us all downloading games to our Decks with the screens chewing up precious battery life. Like <em>savages</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984">Valve’s announcement post</a>, you’ll be prompted to continue with display-off downloads when pressing the power button while an installation or update is in progress. The Deck will also enter this low-power mode after an idle timeout. You can check the download progress by pressing any button or, thanks to the internal gyroscopes, giving the resting Steam Deck a little nudge. Once the downloads finish, it’ll go enter sleep mode proper.</p>
<p>And that’s about it. While this addition is unlikely to be the difference-maker for anyone choosing between a SteamOS handheld or a Windows machine like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, the absence of a low-power downloads mode has felt like an odd omission for the Steam Deck – a device that Valve have otherwise been very savvy about imbuing with the quality-of-life features enjoyed by, whisper it, consoles. Quick suspend/resume, simplified system and driver updates, a UI that isn’t hateful when navigating it with thumbsticks, all that good stuff.</p>
<p>My only complaint is that I, specifically, could have done with this update a few days earlier, after setting my own Deck to mass-update on glacial hotel Wi-Fi last week and having to leave the room convinced its humming display would either attract thieves or start a fire. It didn’t. But it could have. You don’t know.</p>

<p>Minecraft has received a Dragon Ball Z DLC out of nowhere, adding Goku, Vegeta, and more to the game with different battle game modes. </p>



<p>Minecraft has been receiving really extensive DLCs lately, which don’t just add cosmetics, but new worlds and gameplay elements to the title. We saw this with the Superman DLC in September, where players could <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-players-can-use-supermans-abilities-in-new-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use the Man of Steel’s abilities</a>. Now, the Dragon Ball Z DLC has arrived, and it is receiving a similar treatment. </p>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-dragon-ball-z-dlc-will-let-players-enter-solo-co-op-or-5v5-free-for-all-showdowns">Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC Will Let Players Enter Solo, Co-Op, or 5v5 Free For All Showdowns </h2>



<p>Minecraft’s Dragon Ball Z DLC is available now to purchase for 1,510 Minecoins on the Minecraft <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/marketplace/pdp/cyclone/dragon-ball-z/4730409a-ba78-416b-9589-6d089218047c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marketplace</a>. In this DLC, players will receive 11 new characters: Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Piccolo, Frieza, Trunks, Krillin, Android 18, Cell, Android 17, and Majin Buu. Some of these characters will also have Super Saiyan forms. Moreover, several iconic locations from the popular anime will make their way to the game, too, including Cell Games Arena, World Martial Arts Tournament Arena, Planet Namek, Capsule Corp, and more. </p>



<p>Furthermore, these are not just cosmetics; players will be able to bring out their inner Z warrior with the new Dragon Ball Z DLC for Minecraft. From the trailer, we could see that players will be able to use not only Ki Blasts, but special moves for different characters, including the Kamehameha for Goku, Gallick Gun for Vegeta, Special Beam Canon for Piccolo, and more. Each character brings their own moves, ultimate attacks, and custom VFX. </p>

<p>Two new freebies will be included as well, the first is ‘Become Saiyan’, where players can stay in character inside their “own Minecraft world with this skin pack that includes every famed combatant from Goku, Gohan, and Piccolo, to Vegeta, Bulma, and Frieza.” Second is the Scouter Character Creator item, which makes players look like a member of the Frieza Force. </p>

            <p>Arc Raiders players are waging a war of words online, in addition an actual war in-game. This war is focused on the matter of violence itself, or more specifically, is violence between players in Arc Raiders bad form?</p>
<p>As an extraction shooter, Arc Raiders is by its nature a high-risk, tense experience. When out completing quests, collecting resources, or grinding out points in your weekly trials, a single player shooting you can cause a loss of all your progress. This, as you can imagine, can be frustrating, leading a substantial number of players toward taking a friendlier approach.</p>
<p>So many players, in fact, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">Arc Raiders has struck some as quite a friendly game to play</a>. Many raiders have been opting to hash things out over voice comms rather than let their bullets do the talking. However, others who are staying true to the PvP portion of the experience feel otherwise, thriving in a game where proper aim and smart play can lead one to overflowing loot from knocked-out opponents.</p>

<p>Some players, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oohnf0/i_am_a_changed_man/">including IncompetentCat on Reddit</a>, have seen the value of kindness in Arc Raiders, noting how being revived or otherwise assisted by strangers are special moments in-game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ooqzo8/i_tried_being_the_shoot_on_sight_guy/">Others have felt intense guilt</a> with a "kill-on-site" approach to solo play, hearing verbal sadness flow freely from other players upon being knocked down.</p><p>There is, of course, the other side of the argument. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oncgsr/i_mean_this_in_the_most_respectful_way_possible/">User Garbaggiogreco</a> stated outright: "As long as there is PvP in this game it will never change. Stop complaining and come up with strategies to combat against it," courting lots of agreement from the community at large. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ons1ac/for_the_small_minority_of_people_who_didnt/">Others note that the game is explicitly marked as PvP</a>, and to get upset about that is a touch silly.</p>
<p>There's also a degree of "toxic anti-PvP" behaviour, with the moderator of the Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olgls0/toxic_anti_pvpers_not_welcome/">stating outright in a post that people who rail against those who engage in PvP are not welcome</a>. They wrote: "You are allowed to have an opinion that such players morals in game are not good or they are ‘Villain players’ or what not, that is fine for that is what they are but any time an outside insult is going to be used on people over gameplay you are getting the hammer of doom."</p>
<p>For what it's worth, it's clear at least to me that the friendlier moments in Arc Raiders are only as special as they are <em>because</em> there's a risk of betrayal. It takes a lot to put your life and loot in the hands of someone who'd gain a lot from taking you out. Villainising PvP-focused players would lessen the magic of such moments, making the entire game a little worse. It is perhaps better to cherish those who lend an open hand, rather than decry those who stick to their closed fists.</p>

			<p>Rise of Industry 2 is an industry management game – like if you just zoned your whole city in Cities: Skylines for industry and kicked residential and commercial to the kerb. You’ll be focusing on building infrastructure to harvest, process, and ship resources out and your only real interaction with the nearby town is accepting (or refusing) grants or other support and investing to increase the available workforce. It does all of this very well, and yet it manages to be an underwhelming experience simply because…that’s all there is here.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of Industry 2 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/axcZ96ZpvEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a handy tutorial to guide you through the initial setup for your business, focusing on plastic in this case. Without this tutorial I would have been completely lost as there is a lot of stuff involved here that you might not have anticipated. Obviously you need your lots to have power and probably water, you need relevant shipping and storage facilities, you need waste facilities, the main office building for a lot, and whatever production or harvesting building is relevant. You place all these in a meticulous layout that is hopefully pleasing to your eye because it’ll be there forever, and now you’re harvesting oil! You can sell some of that crude oil by setting up a contract and arranging deliveries, but if you actually want a profit in this riff on the 1980s, you’ll want to process it into plastic.</p>


<p>So now you need a facility to process oil into plastic. This facility needs another lot with power and water, relevant shipping and storage facilities, waste, facilities, main office, and the factory that does the actual processing. Now you’re making plastic! And you can sell this, but you’re better off processing it into an end product like – video cassettes for example. This needs another lot, with power and water, relevant shipping and storage… Do you see the problem here? It’s repetition to an extreme degree. That’s realistic, certainly, but it makes for a dull game.</p>


<p>There is a hell of a lot of detail in the systems of Rise of Industry 2, building your business up can feel satisfying, from picking a resource to start with all the way through to its logical end, but once you have built one lot, all you can do is build another one. Sure you can do a bit of networking, but it’s not like you go and actually play a golf mini-game while hobnobbing with other CEOs and politicians, you just select buttons on a menu and a number to track your relationship with this person and company goes up. The worst part is that, if you do immediately build another lot, you’re probably going to haemorrhage money and go bankrupt. Big profits in big business happen on big timescales, so you can either build your lots, establish their profits and wait until you’ve accrued funds for your rainy day fund, or you can race to build another as quickly as possible, lose too much money and go bankrupt.</p>
<p>It’s like there isn’t quite enough game here, that there’s something missing to keep you busy whilst your business actually makes the money it’s there to make. When you finish developing an area of your city in Cities: Skylines, you can move somewhere else whilst it does its thing, focus on something else that needs your attention. In Rise of Industry 2, you are laser focused on your business and there’s nowhere else to go to keep busy whilst your money slowly rises. It’s a real shame as well, because there is a tonne of depth here mechanically and the actual building of your business and setting up and fulfilling contracts is enjoyable, it just doesn’t feel rewarding after the fact.</p>

<p>There are also a few issues, such as certain problems in your supply chain not always being explained through the UI, leaving you to comb through the fine details of your operation to find the fault, but I suppose that’s part of business anyway. It also unreservedly backs big business in what seemed like it could be a satirical take. You can choose to pollute as little as possible, or you can just use PR to make the consequences go away, and it doesn’t seem to matter either way provided you do one or the other. Maybe there are longer term consequences for the latter that I haven’t seen, because I can only sit and watch a number go up slowly before thinking there must be something I can do to make it go up slightly quicker…and then, following a series of poor decisions, I go bankrupt.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Rise of Industry 2 isn't bad, really. It's actually rather good at what it does, it's just that what it does isn't that entertaining. The long periods of waiting for your businesses and decisions to bear fruit.&nbsp;If you're okay with waiting around for the money to come rolling in exchange for some really quite involved logistics and industry construction, then you'll likely enjoy this. If that doesn't sound too promising to you then you might want a broader city builder, where there's more stuff to focus on.	</p></div>

            <p>After a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mod-path-to-menzoberranzan-breaks-silence-with-update-on-development-re-think-and-character-reveal-tease">scope re-evalution over the summer</a>, the modders behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> custom campaign mod Path to Menzoberranzan have set a new target in terms of releasing the a first publicly playable taste of it. An alpha build made up of a Nautiold-sized tutorial level is now pencilled in to arrive during the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>As we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">covered previously</a>, the original pitch for the project was a custom adventure that'd see you and a party of fresh companions travel to Minthara's hometown via some locations from previous Baldur’s Gates. According to the team, over 130 people are now working on making that a reality on what's being teased as a larger scale than originally envisioned.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That detail comes from a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1336275209560522762/1434696201764081675">new project summary</a> added to the mod's Discord server this week, which has now been followed by another <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1293115909166075915/1293115909166075918/1435290048235831458">monthly progress update</a> from Path to Menzoberranzan community manager Andrew Simone. "The first playable alpha will include the prologue of our game, similar in scope to the Nautiloid of BG3," reads the new summary. "It's expected to be available in the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>"While the release date of the full mod is years away, we intend to release updates over time that include new locations and further the game's narrative. How extensive those updates will be depends on both alpha/beta feedback and implementation feasibility. We want our players to experience a satisfying portion of our game's story with each new update we release, which requires more development to occur between updates, since our game features many interconnected story lines."</p><p>Simone's update meshes with that plan, its main announcement being that production on that Nautiloid-sized "tutorial level" is underway. "Our team is working diligently on the concept art and level design of this first portion of the mod," the community manager wrote, adding that with lots of work to be done the modders won't be hosting any more voice acting auditions until next year.</p>
<p>"On the technical side of things, we're upgrading our backend infrastructure to handle the MASSIVE scope this project is growing into," they continued. "To put it simply, we're setting up the same kind of systems that AAA studios use for large RPGs." As if the word massive in capital letters didn't get your attention, Simone added that in terms of the mod's makeup, this'll allow for "more voice acting. Bigger maps. Cinematics. All the content you've been asking for". </p>
<p>"We're making sure our tech can handle it without causing PCs to burst into flames," the community manager summarised. "The infrastructure we're putting in place now will allow us to deliver on our promise of creating a full original campaign." Sounds great, assuming the group are being careful not to get too carried away and end up with a project that's ballooned to a level they end up struggling to deliver. That's always a delicate and unique balance to strike when it comes to these kinds of volunteer undertakings, though, and odds are it'll be tough to tell exactly whether these modders are biting off more than they can chew until they're a lot deeper into the weeds of it.</p>
<p>That said, other big mods have proven cutting back on <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">areas</a> and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/we-had-ridiculous-scenes-happening-fallout-londons-devs-had-to-ditch-rideable-horses-and-bikes-because-they-wouldnt-stop-flying-up-buildings">features</a> if they prove too tricky and leaving them as potential boxes to reopen if there's capacity to further down the line is always a viable option. At this stage, we'll just have to see what the modders can pull off for that initial alpha whenever it ends up arriving, since it should ideally set a foundation they can build on going forwards.</p>

<p>New data from Alinea Analytics reveals that Battlefield 6 has sold over 10 million copies across all platforms. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has taken the gaming world by storm, hitting new heights of player numbers on Steam with both the full release and the battle royale mode. We already knew that BF6 had become the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest launch in series history</a>, selling over 7 million copies. Now, it seems that the game has reached a brand new sales milestone. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-10-million-copies-may-not-be-enough-to-overturn-call-of-duty-s-overall-market-dominance">Battlefield 6’s 10 Million Copies May Not Be Enough to “Overturn Call of Duty’s Overall Market Dominance”</h2>



<p>Rhys Elliot from Alinea Analystics revealed that Battlefield 6 has surpassed 10 million copies sold across all platforms during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameIndustry.Biz</a>. However, he feels that this momentum is not enough to overtake “Call of Duty’s overall market dominance – this year, at least.” Elliot added that Battlefield 6 has gained a lot of popularity amongst the PC players; however, Call of Duty is a “multi-platform powerhouse” whose sales base “extends far beyond Steam and the PC market.”</p>



<p>Elliot explains that Battlefield 6 is experiencing “a huge amount of goodwill” from the community, thanks to all the improvements they have made from the previous title, Battlefield 2042. Call of Duty, on the other hand, is experiencing a “perception problem” due to the inclusion of “Fortnite-esque cosmetics” and excessive repetition within the series. However, these factors will not significantly impact COD’s sales. </p>



<p>The analyst elaborated that Call of Duty has established a massive audience across PC and consoles, with a vast number of casual players comprising this player base. These casual players end up purchasing the game “each year out of habit and brand loyalty.” Moreover, Call of Duty’s casual player base “dwarfs” Battlefield’s, and thanks to the integration with Warzone, “millions of players are constantly exposed to marketing, in-game promotions, and social tie-ins that convert attention into purchases.”</p>



<p>In other news, Battlefield 6 developers have confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-aim-assist-changes-are-coming-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aim assist changes</a> are coming shortly. Additionally, here are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-final-pc-specs-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final PC specs</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.

Creations (user created content) arrive in Fallout 4 via a brand new in-game Creations menu, which will make it easy for players to find and download the new content on PC and console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Bethesda has detailed Fallout 4’s Creation Menu update, due out on November 10 alongside the release of the Anniversary Edition, and it includes more than expected. However, Bethesda issued a warning to mod users. Fallout 4 mods will undergo maintenance November 6-10, and during this time, Fallout 4 mods and Creation Club will be offline. This means you won’t be able to download or upload any new content (you’ll still have access to change your mod load order and play the game).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda asked players to disable any mods that change the main menu before the November 10 update (which requires changes to the main menu screen). If you don’t, the mods may break with the patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for your patience as we work to roll these changes out and lay the groundwork for things like additional storage for Creations,” Bethesda said in a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/377160/announcements/detail/814714767715337534" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><div id="fallout-4-perks-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3><h3>Fallout 4 Perks Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Fallout 4 patch notes reveal some surprising but welcome gameplay and performance improvements. VATS Accuracy should now be fixed so hit chances are consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values (this has been a problem for some time). Targeting enemies through walls without the Penetrator perk is no longer possible, too. There’s also improved Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide Support, and Resolution Detection (Autodetect now sets supported display resolutions, preventing crashes on launch).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition Creation Club content includes unique weapons, power armor, Pip Boy paint jobs, and more. During Fallout Day, Bethesda teased some of the Creations in the works, including one that will bring a "slice of the Mojave Desert" to the Commonwealth, an escape room experience, and even a mind's eye version of your spouse voiced by the original actors you can interact with. The six official expansions included are the Far Harbor, Automatron, and Nuka-World story add-ons, and the Contraptions, Vault-Tec, and Wasteland Workshop add-ons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will be available on Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Steam and PC. It’s coming to Nintendo Switch 2 at some point in 2026, marking the first time Fallout 4 will be available on a Nintendo console. Patch notes are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Fallout 4 - Creations Menu Update November 10 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Creations Menu</strong>: A new in-game Creations menu has been added, making it easier than ever to discover, download and enjoy content from professional developers and passionate enthusiasts alike. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay &amp; Performance</strong> </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>VATS Accuracy:</strong> VATS hit chances are now consistent across platforms and no longer drop to 0% or show incorrect values.

            <title><![CDATA[Wreckreation Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckreation-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wreckreation-review.1344124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been 6,496 days since the original release of Burnout Paradise, not that I’m counting. With the Burnout series clearly consigned to the same storage cupboard EA has been hiding the corpses of Westwood, Black Box, Pandemic, and all the other studios it shut down over the years, I completely understand the motivation for developer Three Fields Entertainment to craft Wreckreation. It’s an unapologetic Burnout Paradise clone in a stack of very clear ways, built for a ravenous audience that's been starved of one of arcade racing’s heaviest hitters for too long. After all, if you want something done, sometimes you need to do it yourself. Unfortunately, the one core component of its spiritual ancestor that Wreckreation <em>couldn’t</em> recapture was its overall quality, and the result is a janky, unrefined, and often unsatisfying racer that I don’t have much desire to keep playing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wreckreation’s resemblance to Burnout Paradise runs surprisingly deep, even for an independent studio that’s spearheaded by former Criterion Games bigwigs – the home of the Burnout series. In fact, there are times when it borders on self-plagiarism, such are the similarities – from the digital information ticker at the base of the screen to the familiar tone of a successful takedown. As such, Wreckreation often seems more concerned with recreating entire segments of Burnout Paradise’s identity than establishing its own unique one. I’m conscious it’s trying to do this with a fraction of the budget and a sliver of the staff of Criterion’s classic, and that’s admirable in its own way, but comparisons are unavoidable when the parallels are this blatant. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Crashing Out</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">From the opening race it was evident things were awry, from the framerate stutters when I hooked into a drift to the actual sliding itself – which feels a little more cumbersome than I typically like. Arcade racers live and die on their handling, and Wreckreation’s driving dynamics aren’t the best by any stretch. Its brake-to-drift brand of handling is straightforward enough, but it’s not the type of drifting that lets you effectively alter your angle throughout a powerslide. It’s almost as if the throttle has no real impact on your drift angle once you’re sideways. I became accustomed to the handling, but I certainly can’t say I ever warmed to it. I especially dislike its idiosyncrasies, like the fact that cars will screech to a quick halt when braking in a straight line, but stomp on the brakes mid-drift and your car will simply continue to hurtle onwards – even if you’re completely off the accelerator. There are also occasional moments of severe understeer, but I can’t figure out what’s triggering it. It may well be a combination of road surface and car type, but there were times when I just craved more responsiveness and needed my cars to snap back into a drift, and they wouldn’t. There's definitely a lag to the steering that blunts that zippy, arcade feel.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's definitely a lag to the steering that blunts that zippy, arcade feel.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief race across Wreckreation’s elevated stunt tracks, the next event was a stunt challenge, where I was required to accumulate a certain amount of points within a very basic arena of jumps and loops. Unfortunately, while my car could easily make it around the skinny loops during free roam, the moment I tried to take them on during the stunt challenge my car was <em>instantly wrecked</em> for no apparent reason. This wasn’t a one-off thing; it was consistently repeatable and happened every time I tried to drive the loops during the challenge. That’s a bad bug to hit five minutes in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pivoting my approach, I stuck to the jumps in order to build up the points I needed to progress. It wasn’t particularly challenging – and the simplistic approach to auto-leveling cars in the air means the stunting is all rather superficial and shallow compared to something like Wreckfest or Hot Wheels Unleashed – but nonetheless I’d earnt more than six times the necessary score when the time limit expired. At this point I… failed the challenge. I had, in fact, scored <em>zero points</em> – because points don’t automatically bank at the end of the session if you’re still accumulating them in a combo. They just vanish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sort of thing leaves a terrible first impression, and nothing I subsequently encountered was strong enough to affect a course correction.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wreck Yourself Before You Check Yourself</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After the stunt-centric opening minutes, Wreckreation quickly settles down into its largely Burnout-inspired groove. The bulk of what’s on offer here are standard races (where the goal is to finish first), ‘Takedown’ races (where the goal is to wreck a set number of vehicles), plus the occasional time trial and ‘Shutdown’ event (where you must perform a takedown on a special, marked car while exploring the open world, in order to add it to your garage – sound familiar?). You can progress through all this content however you see fit, hitting events in any order as you uncover new ones around the huge map. Unfortunately, this flexibility doesn’t disguise how familiar every race rapidly becomes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The size of Wreckreation’s massive map is almost certainly a major culprit in this. At a reported 450 square kilometres, it’s an environment larger than a lot of contemporary open-world racing games. It makes for a great bullet point, but the reality is that this huge size brings with it major caveats. Its primary problem is that it’s extremely generic. It’s a large, square island, with no towns or cities. It’s just ribbons of tarmac and dirt draped over vanilla countryside, where one side of the map feels no different than the other. There are no obstacle-filled alleys or bustling urban centres; it’s just a big green slab with a lot of trees and rocks. I haven’t encountered any memorable races, because there are no memorable areas. There’s very little to distinguish one race from another, so ticking them off became tedious pretty quickly. There’s also a bug I encountered semi-regularly when selecting “restart race” from the pause menu that removed most of the HUD and made it impossible to open the map. The only fix was to restart the game, which was equally tiresome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s very little to distinguish one race from another, so ticking them off became tedious pretty quickly.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Races occur against just five other opponents, which is low by modern standards, and rely on some pretty egregious catch-up AI to stay tense – but they’re better than the Takedown races and Shutdowns. Takedown races began as a <em>major </em>frustration, with awful AI spawns that placed fresh takedown victims too far ahead. Unlike Burnout’s Road Rage events, which effectively inject opposition around you at all times to smash and bash, Wreckreation messed up massively by making other cars a total chore to catch within the slim time limits. Hell, sometimes they were <em>impossible </em>to catch because they spawned on an adjacent road you couldn’t reach thanks to the guardrails. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A patch released this week addressed this, and now opponents quickly streak into the picture from behind – just as they do in Burnout (although they still occasionally spawn on nearby roads you can’t get to). But I have to wonder how it was released in its previous state at all? How thoroughly was this game tested? At any rate, I’ve always maintained that the Burnout series fumbled when it added time limits for Road Rage events in Burnout Revenge. Burnout 3: Takedown was better without them, with the limiting factor simply being how much damage your car could take. I wish Wreckreation had cribbed from the latter in this instance.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Greatest Racing Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wreckreation also introduces a new spin on its off-brand Road Rage mode, which adds cars you’re <em>not </em>supposed to take down, lest you receive a time penalty. I don’t find this is a fun twist, and I actively dislike competing in these. The penalty cars don’t just chop precious seconds off your time limit – they don’t even count as takedowns if you shunt one off the road accidentally. The worst penalty takedown events have <em>two </em>marked penalty cars you can’t crash into, meaning every batch of opponents will only have two cars to take down. It makes chasing some of the high takedown totals extremely frustrating, and doubly so when it’s being stingy with attributing them to you in the first place. I lost track of the times multiple AI cars crashed out during a slo-mo takedown clip, but I was only rewarded for one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chasing the unfairly overpowered AI during Shutdown attempts is also extremely frustrating. That is, being barely able to catch a pickup that was supernaturally staying out of my grasp by perfectly matching my top speed is a cheap trick. I know speed stats are a bit of a meaningless metric in arcade racers with rubberband AI, but discovering this truck was actually doing at least 40km/h more than what it’s literally listed as being capable of was pretty annoying after chasing it across the map for 10 minutes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Temu Trackmania</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As close as Wreckreation sticks to its Burnout family roots, it admittedly does bring a whole new pillar of play to the party in the form of its customisation and creation tools, dubbed Live Mix. This gives us the ability to do everything from renaming vehicles, to changing the weather and traffic density, to even plonking down massive track pieces to create huge, skybound stunt courses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The track creation suite <em>should </em>speak to me. 1990’s Stunts from Distinctive Software, with its pioneering track building tools, is one of the most formative racing games I’ve ever played and I’ve adored this sort of thing ever since. However, Wreckreation’s track builder has completely failed to inspire me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some elements here that I find quite neat. I admire how most of the track modules automatically generate the necessary support structures beneath them to secure them to the ground, regardless of their elevation. It gives the tracks a feeling of physical presence, like the skyscraper-sized feats of engineering something like this would be. There are some clever considerations baked in here too, like how the scaffolding will handily delete itself if you place new track pieces beneath established ones. However, after clipping together a whole bunch of track segments (and one complete game crash as I tried to add the last piece), the net result is that they’re nowhere near as thrilling to drive on as they look. It just feels significantly out of date compared to the incredible depth and fine tuning available via the track builder in, say, the Hot Wheels Unleashed series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Live Mix ultimately proved handy on occasion for dropping down a jump or platform in the right place to reach a smashable billboard, although I’ve since wound back on that. Tracking down and crashing through the many collectables quickly became rather dull thanks to the fact the world just isn’t very interesting to explore. This is a non-insignificant hurdle considering a lot of these collectables are additional pieces and modules for the stunt tracks. It’s hard to argue the juice is worth the squeeze here. I’d say Wreckreation’s residents would be happy to see fewer obstacles strewn all over the roads, but they simply clip straight through them in a shower of sparks, anyway – like the props are invisible.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/wreckreation-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
How to describe Sorath's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-demon">Hyper Demon</a>, other than by labelling it an arena score-attacking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> from the developer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-daggers">Devil Daggers</a>? Well, imagine you're a caveman, the descendant of a forgotten tribe miraculously preserved in the remote wilds. You accidentally eat some fermented berries one day and stumble upon a billionaire's wilderness Halloween fancy dress party. 
</p>
<p>
Delirious and appalled by the teeming lights and faces, you trip and wedge your head inside the giant, Cirque-du-Soleil-supplied crystal ball the guests are using to predict each other's net worth fluctuations over the next year. Then you're chased into the middle of a firework show by flunkeys dressed as vintage heavy metal album covers, while the jet setters throw jewelry and bioluminescent canapes. There you go, this is approximately the experience of playing Hyper Demon. If you don't believe me, there's now a free 1v1 multiplayer version of the game on Steam.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
OK, so the 1v1 version obviously trades my servant army of Boschian caveman-botherers for the cosier violence of just one enemy player. What do players look like in Hyper Demon? They look like what angels looked like before they learned to wear togas and gold hoops. Get away from me, you coruscating beast!

<p>
"Master your movement, aim, timing and resources to defeat your opponents in intense duels," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2801700/HYPER_DEMON_PVP/">explains the Steam page</a>. "With precise lasers and powerful charge shots, damage your opponent to grow their weak point. Hit the weak point to defeat them instantly. Defeat them 3 times to win the match. Use your recharging shield to avoid damage and reflect projectiles." Sounds elementary enough. Here's your crystal ball viewfinder, Master Homo Heidelbergensis.
</p><p>
The 1v1 version comes with a tutorial and CPU opponent to practice against while waiting for a match to start. Worth a download, then, if you despise multiplayer but are tentatively interested in single player Hyper Demon. There are also private lobbies, a global leaderboard, and some replay and spectator mode options. If you're wondering where you've seen all this before, the PvP mode was originally an Easter egg in Hyper Demon, albeit with fewer features.
</p>
<p>
Here is how Alice O (RPS in peace) summarised the first Hyper Demon in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-demon-review">her review from 2022</a>. "Devil Daggers is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> to Hyper Demon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>. Both first-person score attack shooters are dressed in similar beautiful cloaks of skulls and gurgling industrial soundscapes, but while Devil Daggers nudges you into cautious survival, Hyper Demon shoves you into aggression. In Hyper Demon, a long and cautious run will likely score lower than a short burst of ultraviolence. What glorious ultraviolence it is!"
</p>
<p>Matt Cox subsequently asked the developers to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-hyper-demons-devs-suggest-you-slow-down-to-speed-up">dissect the game's opening wave design</a> - they told him that killing the first few enemies too fast will get you into hot water, at least till you master the basics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6’s console/controller design lead has confirmed that they are reverting to open beta aim assist settings. </p>



<p>It has been close to a month since Battlefield 6 released, and over a week since their battle royale mode REDSEC went live. Now it’s time to implement some changes and fixes to the game to enhance the overall community experience. As revealed by the devs, BF6’s console aim assist is one of the features that will receive a significant change soon. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-will-revert-to-open-beta-aim-assist-settings">Battlefield 6 Will Revert to Open Beta Aim Assist Settings</h2>



<p>The confirmation about Battlefield 6’s aim assist nerf comes through a reply by the game’s console/controller design lead, Matthew Nickerson, on <a href="https://x.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985520194148802793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Nickerson recently responded to a post on X, which discussed BF6’s aim assist, bringing a noticeable change to gunfights, with players recognizing when they are battling against controller players. Nickerson responded to this comment, stating that “we are reverting back to OB AA settings here shortly.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are reverting back to OB AA settings here shortly.</p>— Matthew Nickerson (@The_n0ttus) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985520194148802793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>When asked how BF6’s open beta aim assist settings differ from the full release, Nickerson explained that it has “far less stickiness”, which will not create the “rotational persistence” that players are currently facing. The console design lead also explained that “recoil reduction is a separate system” from aim assist and that it will also be adjusted once the open beta aim assist settings go live. In a later reply, Nickerson also confirmed that the devs “are not resetting player’s currently set values that they have.”</p>



<p>In other news, here’s what Battlefield 6’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-take-a-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take a shower</a>‘ screen means. Additionally, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-casual-mode-added-with-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">casual mode</a> has been added to BF6 with 32 bots in each match.

            <p>The Steam Deck now has a low-power, display off download mode, a feature that's been dearly sought after by users for a good while - since launch over three years ago, in fact.</p>
<p>This will allow Steam Deck users to complete all active downloads without chugging through battery life, entering sleep mode once the downloads are finished. This can be accessed by users by pressing the power button during a download and selecting the new low-power download option, or it can occur automatically during an idle timeout.</p>
<p>During this low-power download mode, pressing the power button or moving the Steam Deck will cause a new status screen to pop up showing the progress of the download. The Steam Deck will automatically enter sleep mode during this new low-power download if the battery life falls below 20%.</p>

<p>If this sounds like a feature you'd be interested in trying out, you can do so now via the Beta or Preview channels.

In it, the reviewer Rich Leadbetter writes: "Across its lifespan, Steam Deck has outstripped expectations - and with Steam Deck OLED, Valve is set to do it again. This is an exceptional piece of kit."</p>

<p>It notes that it opened a new art gallery on 3rd September 2025 showcasing development materials and original character art, while reiterating its plan to host limited-time light displays from December 2025.</p>

<p>Nintendo has offered up a whole bunch of announcements for Mario's 40th birthday, including the debut trailer for <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, plus the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> for the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games and Google have announced they have reached a settlement on their longstanding legal feud, which began in August 2020 and was filed at the same time as Epic's lawsuit against Apple.</p>



<p>The Fortnite and Unreal Engine maker challenged both mobile giants for their monopolistic practices and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wins-landmark-anticompetitive-lawsuit-against-google-with-unanimous-verdict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scored a complete victory against Google in December 2023</a>, which was subsequently upheld in appeals. Earlier this month, Google even appealed to the Supreme Court, but with no avail. </p>



<p>A few hours ago, Google's President of the Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, <a href="https://x.com/ssamat/status/1985920218602918343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a> that a proposed set of changes, devised in collaboration with Epic, would increase developers' choice and flexibility, reduce fees, and encourage greater competition, all while ensuring user safety.</p>



<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney expressed his joy <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1985920786545123613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the following tweet response</a>:</p>



<p><em>Google has made an awesome proposal, subject to court approval, to open up Android in the US Epic v Google case and settle our disputes. It genuinely doubles down on Android's original vision as an open platform to streamline competing store installs globally, reduce service fees for developers on Google Play, and enable third-party in-app and web payments. This is a comprehensive solution, which stands in contrast to Apple's model of blocking all competing stores and leaving payments as the only vector for competition.</em></p>



<p>In practice, Google has agreed to lower its fees to 20% for in-app purchases that include accessing a gameplay advantage and 9% for those that do not. Alternative payment options will be displayed side by side with Google Play Billing in apps like <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Epic Games Store</a>. Moreover, a key point is that starting with a version of the next major Android release through June 30, 2032, Google will modify future versions of the Android operating system to allow users to install a Registered App Store from a website by clicking on a single store install screen using neutral language. </p>



<p>Since these changes would apply globally instead of just in the United States, Epic reckons this is a better option than the previous changes mandated by Judge Donato. Google and Epic are now scheduled to discuss these proposed changes with the Judge tomorrow. If approved, this would also conclude the lawsuit between the two companies.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-releases-a-storefront-app-for-android-and-ios.1344085/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="d3744b6137770"><a title="Nintendo Store 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3744b6137770/nintendo-store-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has launched a storefront app – simply titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_store">Nintendo Store</a> – for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">iOS</a>, letting you browse everything including eShop titles, accessories, amiibo, apparel, and more.</p>
<p>Originally available exclusively in Japan as the 'My Nintendo' app, this has now been updated and reworked for worldwide use. It's not quite a dedicated experience, mind you, since clicking on any given product will take you through to the relevant page in your default browser.</p>
<p>That said, it's a good way to quickly see what's new and on offer, particularly if you enable notifications for new sales. You can also review your play activity for the Switch, Switch 2, 3DS, and Wii U. For the latter two systems, you'll need to ensure you link your Nintendo Network ID with your Nintendo Account, with play activity available prior to February 2020.</p>
<p>Interestingly, play activity for every game is broken down further than ever. Previously, either via console or the Nintendo Switch App, you could see how many total hours you'd sunk into any given game.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Store app, however, it literally breaks this down into play activity each day. So you can see exactly how much time you've sunk into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, for example, every day since its launch back in October (though if you boot something up very briefly, it'll log the play activity as "a little while" rather than an exact time).</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features directly from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Shop on My Nintendo Store</strong> – You can use this app to browse Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch systems and accessories, physical and digital games, and other Nintendo products and merchandise—and then jump directly to My Nintendo Store to make purchases. (Note: Physical products are not available in all countries / regions.)</p>
<p><strong>- Get the Latest Info on Games</strong> – You can stay up-to-date with the latest news on Nintendo games, events, and more!</p>
<p>- <strong>Receive Notifications About Sales</strong> – You can turn on push notifications for when items on your Wish List go on sale.</p>
<p>- <strong>Review Your Play Activity</strong> – You can sign in with your Nintendo Account to see your Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch play activity. If you had a Nintendo 3DS or Wii U system, you can see your play activity logged prior to February 2020. (Note: To view your Nintendo 3DS and Wii U play activity, you’ll need to link your Nintendo Network ID (NNID) to your Nintendo Account.)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>-<strong>Check in at Events</strong> – You can use the app to check in at official Nintendo stores and events and earn related rewards! Your check-in activity will also be accessible within the app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition of the storefront app comes as Nintendo updates its financials for Q2 2026, confirming that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">Switch 2 has already sold over 10 million units worldwide</a>. It's also increased its forecast for the remainder of the financial year from 15 million units to 19 million units.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-feature-screen-off-downloads/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has officially rolled out a new feature for the Steam Deck that allows users to download games and updates while the screen is <strong>switched off</strong>, improving battery life, reducing screen burn, and boosting convenience. The ‘Display-Off Low-Power Mode’ means that users no longer have to keep their device powered on and live while installing things.</p>



<p>This marks the delivery of one of the most asked-for features since the Steam Deck was first released in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-valve-releases-display-off-low-power-mode-for-the-steam-deck">Valve Releases Display-Off Low-Power Mode for the Steam Deck</h2>



<p>The new Display-Off Low-Power Mode enables the Steam Deck to continue downloading content even when the screen is turned off. Once downloads are complete, the device will enter a sleep mode <strong>automatically</strong>, which is similar to how modern consoles like the PlayStation 5 operate.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In a further evolution, it was confirmed that a status screen is accessible by pressing a button or moving one of the joysticks, allowing users to check on their download progress without fully waking their Steam Deck. The Deck will revert to full sleep mode if the battery drops below 20% (unless you’ve got it plugged in or docked).</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-enable-display-off-low-power-mode">How to Enable Display-Off Low-Power Mode</h3>



<p>The feature Valve has added is available in the Beta and Preview channels. To activate it, you’ll need to follow these steps to switch it on:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel</li>



<li>Opt into the Beta or Preview Channel</li>



<li>Navigate to Settings &gt; Power to configure display-off downloads</li>
</ol>



<p>You can then further tweak the setting to choose whether downloads continue when the device is reliant on battery power.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment positively on social media when Valve posted the news, which marks a great step forward for the Steam Deck as plenty of other handheld devices swarm.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-devs-introduce-arcadia-beg-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mindseye-devs-introduce-%E2%80%98arcadia%E2%80%99-alongside-a-song-begging-people-to-play-the-game.1344079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest episode of Build a Rocket Boy and MindsEye, the team has made several changes to the base game and introduced ARCADIA, an integration that allows players to access a repository of missions, races, and challenges. It’s the UGC platform at the heart of MindsEye, and it appears to be a rebranding of the ‘Everywhere’ product marketed by BARB.</p>



<p>While deploying the update that revealed the ARCADIA brand, BARB removed free roam mechanics from MindsEye and added some new movement abilities, like dodge rolls.</p>



<h2 id="h-they-could-have-picked-a-better-song">They Could Have Picked a Better Song</h2>



<p>Earlier this week, Build a Rocket Boy published a short trailer introducing ARCADIA, an ‘ever-expanding world of missions, races, puzzles, and challenges.’</p>



<p>MindsEye is now subtitled as being <strong>powered by ARCADIA</strong>.</p>



<p>However, fans with sharp ears were able to listen to the song that backed the ARCADIA trailer, picking out the most questionable lyrics imaginable. The closing line of the song goes, ‘<em>Play my game is all I’m asking</em>.’</p>



<p>In the six days since the trailer was uploaded on the MindsEye channel, it has picked up just 9,000 views, which is indicative of the complete lack of interest in BARB’s debut title.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Mere weeks ago, past and present MindsEye developers were accusing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/past-and-present-mindseye-developers-accuse-build-a-rocket-boy-of-mistreatment/">Build a Rocket Boy of mistreatment</a> during the development process of the game. More than 100 developers came forward with accusations. </p>



<p>In July, not too long after the game’s launch, it was announced that MindsEye would be ‘relaunched’ after internal struggles and issues with the game were fixed, and that might be what the introduction of ARCADIA is approaching.</p>



<p>It was also the same time that Leslie Benzies, CEO of BARB and former Rockstar North president, suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-relaunch-as-ceo-blames-saboteurs/">‘saboteurs’ had impacted</a> MindsEye’s disastrous launch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tsm-has-left-valorant-esports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tsm-has-backed-out-of-valorant-esports-%E2%80%98with-no-immediate-return-in-sight%E2%80%99.1344076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an update posted on social media, the TSM leadership team revealed that the organization had stepped back from VALORANT esports after being in the scene since the game dropped in 2020.</p>



<p>The organization failed to make waves in VALORANT since joining the space five years ago, coming in first place in a handful of minor events, and never managed to gain too much traction.</p>



<h2 id="h-tsm-is-out-but-nobody-is-surprised">TSM is Out, But Nobody is Surprised</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TSM/status/1985407024457531667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TSM wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 2020, TSM joined VALORANT esports with an entertaining and competitive roster that is fondly remembered to this day. We pushed for co-streaming permissions for Myth to watch party our team before it became a staple of VALORANT as it is today. We signed a main team, a high-level academy team, and were one of the first organizations to sign a Game Changers roster – all with the goal of developing teams and talent from the ground up.</p>



<p>Throughout the last three years, we have continuously navigated the Challengers circuit in the hopes of finally reaching Tier 1. We improved gradually, year over year, culminating in an Ascension Grand Finals berth in 2025.</p>



<p>Now, after half a decade in VALORANT, we plan on exiting the space with no immediate return in sight.</p>



<p>We would like to thank Riot for their coninued attempts to restructure the Tier 2 ecosystem for the better, and for creating a game we all love. We extend our deepest appreciation to all our players over these past five years who have made our history within this esport possible.</p>



<p>Thank you to the fans of the black-and-white who followed us on our journey through VALORANT. Through all the ups and downs, and the barriers placed before us, we always tried to make you proud.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>TSM was one of the first organizations to invest in VALORANT, but it never amounted to much.</p>



<p>This exit follows other strategic shifts the company has made recently. The brand’s LCS spot was sold recently, and it tried to break into emergent games like The Finals, from Embark Studios.</p>



<p>While TSM remains active in the overall industry, the withdrawal from VALORANT marks a broader recalibration for the team.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you think about North Korea, the last thing on your mind is probably <strong>esports games</strong>. From a dictator-led regime to a fiercely censored way of life, North Korea has long remained a mysterious territory that few people see the reality of.</p>



<p>One social media user traveled to Pyongyang, North Korea, and managed to dispel some of that mystery, stumbling upon a gaming café packed with talented esports players enjoying games like Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>It goes against everything we’ve been led to believe about North Korea.</p>



<h2 id="h-north-korea-s-gaming-cafes-look-fantastic">North Korea’s Gaming Cafés Look Fantastic</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, a user named Sally Yin uploaded images of a high-tech gaming café in North Korea, specifically in the region of Pyongyang. It’s a far cry from the drab, miserable images we’re used to seeing in the West, which have long been named ‘propaganda’ by those supportive of North Korea.</p>



<p>Sally went on to explain that the café she found was only opened back in April, and at the start, it was restricted <strong>only </strong>to North Korean locals. Since then, the center has opened up to tourists and foreigners residing in the country.</p>



<p>Back in April, Kim Jong Un, the North Korean Supreme Leader, visited the ‘game house’ and approved of the site and the potential it would bring to young people in the area.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Reportedly, more than 70 games could be selected from the PCs available in the gaming café, which can be used on a pay-as-you-go or a membership basis. The list included top esports titles like Counter-Strike 2, Rainbow Six Siege, and Dota 2.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the café also featured games like Call of Duty and Far Cry, which often portray themes of overthrowing dictators or oppressors, which might be considered ironic for a North Korean business. It was noted that accessing the internet is prohibited in the café and that applications like Steam can’t be accessed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FaZe Clan’s run at IEM Chengdu 2025 ended in heartbreak as expectations were shattered – and <strong>not in a good way</strong>. The Counter-Strike 2 powerhouse of a squad (or <em>former powerhouse</em>) bowed out in last place following an early loss against Virtus.pro, marking a new all-time low for the roster. It has been an inconsistent year for FaZe Clan, to say the least, but the Chengdu loss is a fresh concern for fans.</p>



<p>What happened to FaZe Clan in IEM Chengdu?</p>



<h2 id="h-sudden-collapse">Sudden Collapse</h2>



<p>FaZe opened the series with promise, securing a map win over Virtus.pro on Overpass, which was ironically their opponent’s pick. It was a dominant opener that had the roster feeling confident, but Virtus turned things around, flipping the script and forcing a decider on Inferno.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan faltered, Virtus.pro became methodical, and the series fell apart. For FaZe Clan, it was a quick ticket home with a 0 -2 win-loss record at IEM Chengdu.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that IEM Chengdu wasn’t an isolated stumble, but the latest in a string of underwhelming results for FaZe Clan through 2025. They’ve had a rocky 12 months in tournament placements, failing to secure a truly major victory since <strong>last year’s </strong>IEM Chengdu in April 2024.</p>



<p>It was argued after the eviction from IEM Chengdu that recent roster changes weren’t necessarily to blame, but systemic concerns within the organization are playing a bigger part in the wider picture.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s elimination from IEM Chengdu is more than just another loss—it’s a <strong>wake-up call</strong>. The organization, which was once one of the winningest and most dominant brands in Counter-Strike, faces something of an identity crisis. Ahead of the 2026 season, fans are concerned that not enough bold decisions will be made to change the woeful flow.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s a deeper issue at FaZe Clan? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the ways Nintendo builds relationships with its consumers. As part of this, he revealed some updated data about the player numbers within the company's ecosystem as of 30th September 2025.</p>
<p>There are currently <strong>400 million</strong> Nintendo Accounts, and in terms of active Switch Online memberships, there are <strong>34 million users</strong>. Nintendo mentions how there are also <strong>128 million</strong> "annual playing users", further noting:</p>
<p>"The number of annual playing users refers to the number of Nintendo Accounts, out of all Nintendo Accounts registered to a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 system, that used Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 software one or more times during the 12-month data aggregation period. The count does not include use of services such as Nintendo eShop. Past usage data is collected when hardware is connected to the internet, so the results are revised retroactively."</p>

<p>Nintendo says it will continue to bring its entertainment to an "ever-wider audience". In the same briefing, the president noted how the company is extending beyond dedicated video game platforms with movies and videos, character merchandise, mobile apps, and real-world experiences such as the Nintendo Museum, theme parks and annual Live events.</p>
<p>There were no specific updates attached to this data about future plans for Switch Online content or the Nintendo Classics library going forward, but the company has been regularly updating this subscription service with retro games, extra bonuses and even special apps. Next year, it will bolster the service with the Virtual Boy library.</p>
<p>Nintendo Accounts and the Switch Online service also give users access to online play and other features such as GameChat. You can see all of this in action in the video above.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-5-878/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-878-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-5.1344037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You’ve made it (so far) to the middle of the week, but whatever tribulations you’ve been through, you still need to overcome today’s challenge. The NYT Connections puzzle for today is a tricky one, but that’s where I come in. Below, I’ve shared the best NYT Connections hints you need to wrap your puzzle up nicely and quickly.</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections solutions you need for today.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #878:</p>



<ul>
<li>KNIGHT</li>



<li>COAT</li>



<li>BUTCHER</li>



<li>BAKER</li>



<li>FLACK</li>



<li>KNIFE</li>



<li>CANDLESTICK</li>



<li>MAKER</li>



<li>FRANKLIN</li>



<li>FOREST</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BLOW</li>



<li>SPOIL</li>



<li>WRENCH</li>



<li>BOTCH</li>



<li>ROPE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of verbs that describe messing something up—whether it’s a recipe, a plan, or a performance.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These are the classic implements you’d find in a whodunit board game. Colonel Mustard would know.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Last names only—each belongs to a legendary artist whose vocals defined a genre and an era.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each word completes the phrase “rain_____” to form something familiar, poetic, or practical.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-5-878">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 5 (#878)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BLOW, BOTCH, BUTCHER, SPOIL</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CANDLESTICK, KNIFE, ROPE, WRENCH</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAKER, FLACK, FRANKLIN, KNIGHT</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BOW, COAT, FOREST, MAKER</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>The Mario and Zelda movies are just the start</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="5bc86a535252d"><a title="Super Mario Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5bc86a535252d/super-mario-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's movie business is already booming following the release of the Mario Movie in 2023, which was a global box office hit.</p>
<p>Since then, it's announced a live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> film, and more recently lifted the lid on <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> (a follow up to the first animated Mario Movie). It's also got Nintendo Pictures and Nintendo Stars helping out with the expansion of video and movie content, and Shigeru Miyamoto has been working closely with the current movie projects.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what the plan is beyond this, the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">latest financial briefing</a> has now teased there's even more on the way with a simple graphic. The aim is to build a framework for a "consistent release cadence":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Following up on the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023, we have The Super Mario Galaxy Movie scheduled for release in 2026, and the live-action movie of The Legend of Zelda planned for 2027.</p>
<p>We are continuing to prepare for the ongoing release of movies in the future."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As noted in the graphic above, the next movie is The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, due out in April 2026. This will be followed by The Legend of Zelda movie, which is scheduled for 2027. The main characters for the Zelda movie have been cast, but we don't know much else about it at this stage.</p>

It's even led to the Japanese firm decreasing its overall sales forecast for this particular system.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how long the original family of Switch systems will be supported for, ultimately, it comes down to certain market factors. And even though it's selling less overall, sales are still maintaining a steady pace even after the Switch 2's launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gphzwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's what Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa had to say about <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf">the company's support of the original Switch</a> going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While our business focus will shift to Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch has maintained a steady sales pace even after the June launch of its successor. While taking consumer demand and the business environment into consideration, we will continue sales of Nintendo Switch hardware."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there's no end-of-life date or anything similar (<em>at least for now</em>), and the original hybrid system will still be available to purchase in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously confirmed future support of the system with upcoming releases such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> (both due out in 2026), and even a major update scheduled for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, there's still more than enough time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">for the Switch to topple the DS</a> as Nintendo's best-selling system of all time. The only console ahead of it at that point would be Sony's PlayStation 2, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/sorry-nintendo-but-it-doesnt-look-like-switch-will-overtake-ps2-as-the-best-selling-console-of-all-time?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article">but the two devices are currently about six million sales apart</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo isn’t planning on stopping movie adaptations of its games. Even more so, according to a new sales report, it’s going to be a more common thing.</p>



<p>For the longest time, video game adaptations were a curse on Hollywood. It never seemed to work out, no matter what form it took, from animated (like Final Fantasy) to live-action (like Max Payne). However, the 2020s proved to show it off in style, having massive successes like Sonic the Hedgehog, Fallout, Arcane, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-show-receives-high-praise-from-critics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a>. One of those hits was Illumination’s The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which raked in more than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one billion dollars</a> at the box office. With a sequel and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-the-legend-of-zelda-live-action-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action Zelda film</a>, it’s on one heck of a hot streak. Fortunately, it doesn’t seem like it wants to slow down at all.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a sales report from Nintendo Japan</a>, the company talked about its success with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its plans for the future. One big part of its strategy is multimedia, with a big push for films. Nintendo states that it’s currently involved in multiple projects on its IP in various stages. No specifics were given as to what franchises those are, but they’ll be releasing after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Nintendo plans to be heavily involved in all of the films, from production to financing. Given how well the collaboration worked with Mario, having the creators on the team always leads to a better adaptation. It’ll be interesting to see what the future for Nintendo’s films will look like, whether it be in-house, like it teased with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Close to You</a>, or licensed. Either way, we may see series like Metroid or Animal Crossing make it onto the silver screen soon.</p>
