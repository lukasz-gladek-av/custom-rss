<figure data-uuid="3a50f58e93e84"><a title="Kirby Air Riders/Inazuma Eleven" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3a50f58e93e84/kirby-air-ridersinazuma-eleven.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>I've been having an interesting run lately of games that shake things up, even if it's just a little bit, in the controls department.</p>
<p>Back in the good old days — or at least my nostalgia blinkers have made it seem this way to me — the idea of being bored rigid by a game's control systems wasn't something that ever entered my mind. Was it because I was less of a pro gamer in the 1980s and '90s than I am now? Well, yes, obviously, nobody can be <em>this</em> pro for <em>that</em> long, but that's not the actual reason. Not this time.</p>
<p>No, for all the pot shots you can take at old games for being a bit naff and aged and wrinkly and incontinent and what-have-you, you cannot so easily disrespect them when it comes to their controls. There just seemed to be more variety back in the crazy, lawless days of early video games. Or maybe I just feel that way because I wore a Nintendo Power Glove and a cheap rumble backpack for most of my childhood. A rumble backpack!</p>
<p>Whatever the case, I think it's fair to say things are more homogenised now; players expect, and developers deliver, on a certain style of controls for a certain type of game, for the most part. When the latest shooter shows up, we expect to know exactly how to chuck a grenade, crouch, or run without having to refer to a guide.</p>
<p>And I don't like it. I mean, I like games that control nicely...so I guess <em>I do</em> like it, technically. They've got me there. But sometimes you get your hands on something that really does things differently — whilst still controlling nicely — and remember, 'Hey, unique control schemes can really tie this whole thing together!'</p>

<p>In this way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has been a genuine surprise to me in how deep and addictive its chaotic racing is, whilst still managing to be radically different to the norm at its core. It's been the main culprit in bringing all of this stuff to my mind. I got a bit fed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, you see, as it feels overwhelmingly like more of the same once you're on the track and racing (which is fine, but I've had enough after a decade of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">8</a>), and so I've left it all behind and feel a little deflated with the series now as a result.</p>
<p>The thing with Mario Kart, though, is that it's so refined you know they're never changing it. Well, not massively. Why would they? And so, with Air Riders, there's real excitement in digging in, because it's so unique in its <em>slightly mad</em> take on careening around courses and knocking the stuffing out of opponents.</p>
<p>Rather than your usual racing experience — one button for accelerate, another for brake (and a handbrake button for crashing) — Air Riders is kinda like...well, it's like slingshotting around a course rather than driving the route. It's akin to strategically pulling back an elastic band at just the right moment on corners and then letting rip down straights at its core, with a bunch of <em>other stuff</em> then added on top.</p>
<p>I'm immediately way more invested thanks to this, and mostly just because it's a switch-up, a refresh of the things I'm normally doing with my hands and brain whilst controlling a game. It's something to sink my teeth into. Something new to learn. And it gives Kirby's racer a real unique flavour and strength all of its own.</p>

<p>In a similar way, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> takes football and turns it into something a little more unexpected and unique in its segmented, RPG-esque control scheme. It's really nothing like what you may be expecting if you're a newcomer.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't quite the same sort of comparison (this isn't a pure footie sports game after all), but even then, when approached differently in this way, when a match is started and completed in such a mechanically and narratively different manner, with limited controls and time on the ball interlaced with super skills, boosts and boons — whilst still remaining every bit as compelling as a game of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a> in my mind — it makes me wish there were way more examples of certain types of games being approached <em>differently</em>, just to spice things up a little. Y'know.</p>
<figure data-uuid="419784181ad1f"><a title="Joy-Con 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/419784181ad1f/joy-con-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo, to its credit, has been better than many when it comes to control experimentation; you only have to look at the recently released (and very good, thanks) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, to see how they've taken something rather, well, it's not the most mind-blowing concept, but it's made way more appealing by the introduction of a unique control scheme. You've got me learning stuff; how to turn on a dime and speed up, how best to take a shot or pull off a trick. It instantly raises what could have been a totally forgettable thing into something that had us all talking when we caught sight of it for the first time.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Switch 2, as much as some have had a go at its screen quality and a few other things in the early months, has already been delivering the goods big time in giving us mouse mode to add to our options for shooters, RPGs and so on. Granted, you're just giving us what PC players already have in some cases, so it's not the same brand of 'unique'. However, the option being there, just having the ability to do things differently on the screen, can make a no-buy into something I'll go ahead and purchase.</p>
<p>Of course, a premium- — or even nuclear- — grade example of Nintendo trying new things in the controls department (and one that actually paid off, I won't hear otherwise) is Sakurai's 3DS belter <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a>.</p>

<p>I've heard so many people bemoan this one; I've heard lots of "This should have been a twin-stick shooter!" because of how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/random-sakurai-explains-why-true-twin-stick-controls-werent-possible-for-kid-icarus-uprising">heinous they found its control scheme</a>. But I loved it. And it's a game that will forever sit with me because of those controls. Doing things differently is good! I mean, I did still buy a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/10/retro_city_rampage_to_utilise_circle_pad_pro">Circle Pad Pro</a> because this one gave me sore wrists at points, but don't tell anyone.</p>
<p>Oh, and whilst we're on the subject of unique controls on Nintendo consoles specifically, and I know there are lots of examples, but this one stick out personally; did you know you could hold two NES controllers like Switch Joy-Con to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/smash_tv">Smash TV</a> back in the day with a double D-pad setup? Yes, you could, and it was great.</p>

<p>So, yes, these are all games that would've still sold well, no doubt, without the unique elements they bring to the table with their controls, but they just wouldn't have the same flavour at all in my mind. They'd never be so memorable, regardless of how divisive or even frustrating they can be at times (yes, Kid Icarus, yes, you were).</p>
<p>Whilst new horizons on the old mechanical front can sometimes come a cropper, let's hear it for games that are out here taking risks and making players do stuff a little differently than usual, and let's hope we see plenty more in the near future. I'm well tired of holding the same buttons to do the same things ad nauseam.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Feel like games could do with getting back to experimenting a bit more with controls? Hate/love any of the games I've mentioned due to their unique control schemes? Let us know!</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/netgear-nighthawk-rs700s-wi-fi-7-tri-band-router-review/</link>
            <guid>1373029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Setting up a new Wi-Fi router used to fill me with dread. The idea of pulling all the cables out, rummaging behind the sofa, finding the extremely poorly placed power socket, and then going through the rigmarole of changing every single item in our house over to a new network with increasingly difficult to enter passwords used to rank amongst the worst tasks in modern life.</p>
<p>Thankfully, networking companies have realised they can make things easier for you, while also putting out some of the fastest, most cutting-edge Wi-Fi tech around. It’s clear that Netgear have put serious thought into their brand-new Nighthawk range of Wi-Fi 7 routers, and, after a simple onboarding process, your home’s internet will be ripping along faster than ever before.</p>



<p>In the box, you’re getting the top-of-the-range Nighthawk RS700 router, a power brick with both UK and US attachments, and a standard 2m ethernet cable for connecting to your incoming cable or fibre internet doodah. As you’re pulling everything out of the box, the immediate thing you’re going to notice is how big and imposing the Nighthawk router actually is. It’s a chonky, wedge-shaped beast, with silver metal venting at the top and gloss finish on the LED displays that gives it a real Cyberpunk feel.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, it’s not that big a step away from the back plastics and glowing LEDs of the BT, Virgin, EE and other routers that are sat in most of the homes in the UK, but if you’re moving from something like the dinky and understated white boxes of an Eero setup, you’re certain to notice a change in aesthetics.</p>

<p>The Nighthawk RS700S is heavy. If it’s going to sit in a hallway, in danger of being knocked by flailing coats and grasping children’s hands, you might want to make sure it can’t fall off the side of a table and put a dent into your flooring. That weight does mean it’s fairly settled in place, but its tower-like design means that it’s not completely safe from toppling over.</p>

<p>You begin setup via the Nighthawk app, with some nice, streamlined QR codes pointing you towards the app on either iOS or Android. From there, the cabling experience is similarly straightforward, with a 10Gbps socket for your incoming connection or fibre internet signal, and then five ports for your home network – four at Gigabit speeds, and one at 10Gbps.</p>
<p>There’s also a USB-A 3.0 port for connecting a storage device, which you can then use via Readyshare, which is a really handy inclusion in multi-platform households or workplaces. You can access this drive remotely as a pretty literal interpretation of Network Attached Storage, and if you’re looking for a router that can truly sit at the centre of your home network setup, the Nighthawk makes it as easy as possible. That said, I’d have liked to have seen a USB-C port here as well in 2025.</p>
<p>The Nighthawk app talks you through connecting everything, and it also gives you the option of immediately swapping out the network ID and password, so you can easily just fill in the details of your old network and avoid some of the annoyance of reprogramming everything. I say ‘some’ of the annoyance, as a few of our devices still required me to reconfirm the details, while our LG TV made me completely reconnect. Whether that’s down to the shift from WiFi 6 to WiFi 7, a change in bands the device is connecting to, or a switch to a newer password security protocol, I’m not sure, but it was only a minor bump in the road, and still much faster than a wholesale change.</p>

<p>It’s little surprise to find that the Nighthawk made a clear and perceptible change to the WiFi connection and internet speed in the house. While our previous Eero setup was, on average, providing 715Mbps of download speed, the Nighthawk RS700s provided closer to 1Gbps on our individual devices through most of our testing time. It boasts a combined potential speed of 19Gbps across all its bands, though that’s admittedly a purely theoretical figure, combining 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz bands, very wide spectrum usage (which might be impractical in a busy environment), and accommodating many devices in use at the same time.</p>
<p>It’s also got three times the capacity, allowing connections to up to 200 devices. Even our, incredibly tech-heavy house doesn’t come close to touching that, but in a workplace or office setting, that’s a real selling point, and we ran multiple multiplayer gaming, streaming and chatting sessions, with everything feeling ridiculously snappy and fast.</p>
<p>I’ve also been testing GeForce Now across a number of devices, and the Nighthawk RS700S allowed for a seamless streaming experience over WiFi, while our previous WiFi 6 Eero setup had, at times, struggled to do it justice. Chomping my way through the incredible Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, its timing-heavy combat was still on point, and, unbelievably, I never felt at a disadvantage while playing via streaming. I’ve spent a great deal of time playing over streaming services like Stadia and Microsoft’s Cloud Streaming, and the Nighthawk RS700S brought more stability than ever before. Admittedly, that is as you’d hope, with the WiFi 7 protocol able to halve the latency of WiFi 6. Still, it absolutely played out during our real-world testing.</p>
<p>Range then, is perhaps the final question mark, and the Nighthawk RS700S is capable of 3500 square feet (325 square metres) of coverage. That doesn’t account for walls and ceilings getting in the way and attenuating signal, but through our three-storey townhouse, with the router on the ground floor, I still received a 100% signal on the top floor, albeit with a reduced 512Mbps speed. That’s still excellent, and for most home settings, I think a single Nighthawk router will suffice. If you need even wider coverage, you might want to look at a mesh system rather than a sole router, or a WiFi extender, but these have their own limitations, and can cause you interference rather than improving your internet experience.</p>
<p>At £550 RRP, the Nighthawk RS700S is an extremely expensive addition to your home network setup, but it’s one that has clear and immediate benefits, especially if you’re bringing the latest WiFi 7-equipped tech into your house like the iPhone 17, Honor Magic V5 or the PlayStation 5 Pro. It’s likely only going to truly appeal to those on the cutting edge, but with its ease of setup, comprehensive app support and tangible results, the Nighthawk RS700S is a winning combination, especially in gaming-centric homes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 – Fury Green Item Locations Walkthrough]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-fury-green-item-locations-walkthrough-missile-expansion-energy-tank/</link>
            <guid>1373026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The inevitable happens at the start of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, and Samus Aran is depowered by the time she wakes up on Viewros. Time to search out a whole host of new abilities, weapon power-ups, energy tanks and ammo expansions then!</p>
<p>The first biome in the game, Fury Green, is mainly a tutorial area your first time through, keeping things simple as you gain your first handful of new abilities. You will regularly return to Fury Green through the story, though, and that means there’s time to revisit corners of the map to access blocked areas and secrets.</p>
<p>Here’s a rundown of all the items in the order in which you can find them.</p>


<p>But first, if you want to keep spoilers to a minimum for how you need to explore the world, know that the game does feature item maps that you can unlock once you’re into the final stretch of the game. We’ll soon have a guide on where to find all of the Scout Bots for each location.</p>
<p>Now, onto the Fury Green walkthrough.</p>

<h3>Energy Tank</h3>
<p><em>Requirements – Psychic Glove</em></p>
<p>You really can’t miss this, it’s a core part of the first run through the Fury Green region, with a strange orb that asks you to drag an item across its face using the Psychic Glove. Do this and you’re rewarded with an Energy Tank.</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Missile Launcher</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve earned the missile launcher, you can start smashing the hard orange resin all around this area. In the Grove of the Sacred Tree, just after rescuing MacKenzie and the save station, make sure to blow up the resin wall on the left which hides a Missile Expansion</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Psychic Bomb</em></p>
<p>After defeating the boss within Fury Green, you will have to take a new path to get back to MacKenzie which eventually gets you back to familiar ground. In the ball tunnel between the Psychic Seed and where MacKenzie is waiting, look out for a brightly coloured seed on the side. Place a Psychic Bomb next to this and you’ll have your first Missile Expansion from the game!</p>

		
		

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Psychic Bomb (and Psychic Boots)</em></p>
<p>This needs some back tracking and is only possible from the second time that you visit Fury Green – it’s best to just get this once you’ve got some further upgrades not to waste time. You can start at the original entrance to Fury Green without Psychic Boots, or if you have this double jump, then you start at MacKenzie’s location and backtrack across the bridge.</p>

		
		

<p>On the map, look for Resin Creek, which adjoins with a save station. Here you’ll find a pool with two whipping tentacle plants, where you’ll find an elevated seed that you can blow up with a Psychic bomb. To reach it, bounce yourself up using a bomb, then place a second while in midair.</p>
<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Psychic Boots</em></p>
<p>If returning to or leaving Fury Green via cargo cannon, there’s a missile expansion off to one side up in the air. Double jump up and over the scenery to reach a place with hazy purple smudges that you can scan using the visor to turn into platforms, which you can just jump across using your Psychic Boots.</p>

		
		

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Psychic Boots</em></p>
<p>In the Cliffside Gate area, near to where you first obtained the Psychic Glove, look for the purple signs of psychic platforms, which you can create to lead up to a Missile Expansion on a ledge.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>Between MacKenzie and the Cargo Cannon is a door locked by a Fire Shot lock. This leads to the Sacred Flame Ceremony room. Standing on the central plate and using the Psychic Visor lets you move a circular viewer along purple glowing channels, which you can move in and out in addition to left and right.</p>

		
		

<p>Lining this up with the stone balls opens them up, allowing you to set wooding pyres alight inside. Light all of these up and another grand door opens leading to a statue with a Shot Expansion waiting for you as a reward.</p>
<h3>Shot Expansion (7)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>In the Jungle Path area on the route you first took back after defeating the Fury Green boss, turn to the cliffside by the boss-side entrance and a flammable blocker can be destroyed, letting you morph ball and jump in to get a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion (6)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>With the fire shot, you can grab a few more items by backtracking to the earlier part of Fury Green. In the circular path that you followed to meet MacKenzie, the Isopod Lair features a flammable obstacle which hides a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion (8)</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Fire Shot</em></p>
<p>Keep backtracking to reach the Ravine Overlook area, where a flammable blocker exists in the roots under a tree. It hides another Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Ice Shot</em></p>
<p>With the Ice Shot newly unlocked, return to the Sacred Flame Ceremony room and unlock the ice door. This leads to a little puzzle room. Use the ice shot to lock the left platform being raised by water, then use the visor to grab the power mote and power up the right platform. Use the ice shot to lock this in place and then jump up to be able to reach the Shot Expansion on top of the structure.</p>

		
		

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>The container in the cargo preparation room next to home base needs to be shot on both ends with an electric bolt to award you a Shot Expansion.</p>

<h3>Shot Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>Return to the ceremony area once more and now open up the electric locked room. Here you’ll find a puzzle that requires you to use the Psychic Visor to grab metal objects on the ceiling, pull them all down and turn them to point at the central structure. Now shoot each one with the Thunder Shot and you’ll be rewarded with a Shot Expansion.</p>

		
		

<h3>Energy Tank</h3>
<p><em>Requirement – Thunder Shot</em></p>
<p>Once you’ve completed all three of the elemental puzzles, the statue next to the main Sacred Flame Ceremony room will dish out an Energy Tank for you. Handy!</p>

<h3>Missile Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Super Missile</em></p>
<p>Remember Betsy? You were introduced right at the start of the game! Once you’ve obtained the Super Missile you can revisit her and blow up the storage container by her feet to net yourself another Missile Expansion.</p>

<h3>Psychic Power Bomb Expansion</h3>
<p><em>Requirement –&nbsp;Power Bomb</em></p>
<p>Back track to the earlier area of Fury Green and the Quiet Clearing. There’s a statue leaning off to the side here which says it contains something inside, when scanning. Use the huge explosion of the Power Bomb to break it up and reward you with… more power bombs!</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s everything there is to find in Fury Green!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-banjo-kazooie-sequel-remake-game-built-in-dreams-impressive-2000650541</link>
            <guid>1373020</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It seems very unlikely that we’ll get a new <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> game from Rare and Xbox anytime in the near future. And while an impressive-looking fan-made <em>Banjo</em> game created in <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924"><em>Dreams</em></a> isn’t quite the sequel or remake people might want, it’s probably the best we can hope for in 2025. It’s also wildly impressive for something made in Sony’s five-year-old abandoned game maker.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Eupholace/status/1996263228205080843">On December 3,</a> William Butkevicius, a level designer at Moon Studios, shared a trailer for <em>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</em>, a new non-official one to two-hour game starring everyone’s favorite bear and bird. It looks really good.&nbsp; <a href="https://x.com/Eupholace/status/1996347110762106931">According to the creator</a>, it took about “14 months” and “800+ hours of work” to make <em>Mumbomania</em>. Here’s the trailer for the game, which is out now and available exclusively in <em>Dreams</em> on PS5 and PS4.</p>

  <p>Impressive stuff, right? In fact, if you had shown this to me without telling me it was made in <em>Dreams</em>, a PlayStation-published game-creation tool from the devs behind<em> Little Big Planet,</em> I’d have likely just assumed this was created in Unity or something by a talented team of people. And in a way, it was created by a talented team of creators, as <em>Mumbomania</em> contains various assets built by other <em>Dreams</em> users, <a href="https://indreams.me/dream/mSFcdDKSMkr">all of whom are listed in the game’s credits page</a>. This was one of the coolest things about <em>Dreams:</em> The way it let people collaborate and made sure everyone got credit for their input.</p>

 <p>As for the game’s plot, here’s the setup according to Butkevicius: “The bear and bird are back for their first buddy-trio adventure! Mysteriously disembodied, Mumbo joins Banjo and Kazooie to help collect, fight, and transform into a variety of strange beings.”</p> <p>Sadly, because Sony never did much with <em>Dreams</em>, like porting to PC, the only way to play <em>Mumbomania</em> is to own <em>Dreams</em> on PS5 and PS4 and<a href="https://indreams.me/dream/mSFcdDKSMkr"> play the <em>Banjo</em> fan game</a> there. If you don’t own <em>Dreams</em>, <a href="https://youtu.be/I8GogASuUqE">you can watch this walkthrough of the <em>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</em></a> to see just how much work went into making this thing look, sound, and play like an authentically Rare <em>Banjo</em> sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An old, slow, or just subpar monitor is one of the surest ways to completely kill a fun PC gaming sesh. That’s especially true if you’re in a multiplayer online game where your quick hand reflexes need to translate to quick game reflexes, and a laggy moment or worse will spell your (virtual) demise.</p>
<p>Gaming monitors are usually a “get what you paid for” proposition — the cheap ones are mediocre, and the high-end ones are pricey. That equation doesn’t apply here, because the Samsung 27-inch Odyssey G3 Series FHD Gaming Monitor comes with a terrific picture, AMD FreeSync, and killer response time and refresh rate, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6205/">right now it’s only $143 thanks to a limited-time Amazon deal that cuts the price down by 38%.</a> That puts it right at the intersection of budget price and great performance, which is of course the best place to buy from.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-Time Reactions</h2>
<p>Even more than the size, resolution, and picture sharpness, the refresh rate and response time are by far the most crucial components of a gaming monitor. The Odyssey G3 Series comes in with an exceptionally brisk 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time to keep all of your moves happening in real time and your screen blur- and freeze-free. Those numbers aren’t usually associated with a gaming monitor with a $230 price tag like the Odyssey G3 Series usually carries, and virtually never with the $143 price it’s carrying now during this limited-time Amazon deal.</p>
<p>The Odyssey G3 Series gaming monitor adds AMD Radeon FreeSync to the package as an additional guard against lag and other game-killing visual delays. FreeSync keeps the monitor and the graphics card of your PC or console in perfect lockstep to thwart both lag and image tearing. The result is a smooth, seamless picture that endures even during the fastest action and most detailed scenes.</p>



<h2>Use the Crosshairs</h2>
<p>With the Virtual Aim Point in place, your shooting accuracy in battle royal and melee action will never be better. Virtual Aim Point puts actual crosshairs on the screen to help guide your shot with amazing precision. And when your foe finds a dark corner to hide in, the Odyssey G3 Series’ Black Equalizer feature allows you to adjust even the blackest areas on the screen to expose the danger.</p>
<p>The borderless design of the Odyssey G3 Series extends your gaming field to the absolute limit of the monitor’s frame, and it also allows you to line up a second borderless monitor to create a massive, seamless screen. Deploy the Eye Saver Mode and the monitor’s blue light is minimized and the screen flicker reduced, so you can play longer and more safely.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6205/">The Samsung Odyssey G3 Series comes with far more features and performance than any 27-inch gaming monitor should at its current price of just $143 at Amazon</a>. But the fat 38% discount is only good for a limited time, so don’t miss out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Three Fields Entertainment is a studio in dire straits. The developers of the recently released Wreckreation have revealed that the entire company has been put on redundancy notice.</p>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn on Thursday morning, CEO Fiona Sperry wrote a length message about the situation. </p>







<p>Wreckreation launched in October, and was published by THQ Nordic, a subsidiary of Embracer. However, based on her messaging, there hasn’t been much in the way of support from the publisher.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-ugcPost-7402348124054376448-Yfpq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">her statement</a>, Sperry says that Three Fields Entertainment <strong>“will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.”</strong> The studio, she said, has had to self-fund for most of 2025 and through all of the post-launch content.</p>



<p><strong>“Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form,”</strong> Sperry said. <strong>“Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is a heartbreaking moment for all of us. What makes it even harder is that we have so many things in the pipeline — multiple features, updates, and creative ideas that we were excited to bring to the game, many of which are showcased in the video we’re sharing today. These are things we genuinely believed would have continued to strengthen Wreckreation and grow its community.”</strong></p>







<p>Sperry writes that her hope is that by showing the latest internal work publicly for the first time, it will lead to funding or interest from a different company.</p>



<p><strong>“But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team,” </strong>she said. <strong>“I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it.”</strong></p>

            <guid>1373008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creators of the Fallout TV show have confirmed Season 2 avoids making any New Vegas ending canon by taking what they call "the fog of war approach."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Fallout video games had wondered how Season 2 might reflect the endings of Obsidian’s much-loved Fallout New Vegas, given the show is canon and is set 15 years after the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A quick reminder of where we’re at in the Fallout timeline: the Fallout TV show is set in 2296, nine years after the events of Fallout 4 and 15 years after the events of Fallout: New Vegas. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4"><u>We’ve already seen a debate about which Fallout 4 ending should be considered canon</u></a>, if any. Based on already released trailers, we know Mr. House is in Season 2, so does that suggest a canon ending is being used?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on the choices the player, aka The Courier, makes throughout the course of the game, New Vegas can end with victory for the player during the Battle of Hoover Dam, which drives out all factions including Mr. House himself, a victory for Mr. House in which he remains in control of New Vegas and takes over Hoover Dam, a victory for Caesar's Legion, or a victory for the New California Republic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are variations within these endings, but given Mr. House is in Season 2 in a post-war setting, and is alive (sort of) when the main characters turn up at New Vegas, it seems he survived the events of New Vegas the video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does Season 2 make a decision on who <em>won</em> Fallout New Vegas? It does not, executive producer, creator, and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet and executive producer Jonathan Nolan told IGN in an interview.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nolan said Geneva Robertson-Dworet and co-showrunner Graham Wagner took “the fog of war approach,” which he called "an absolutely brilliant way to make a bit of an end run around that whole question."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This was a really early decision that Graham and Jonah, and I made together,” Robertson-Dworet added, “was that we wanted to try, as much as possible in our show, to honor all gamers' experiences and all the choices they might make as they play the game. So we always wanted to avoid trying to make one canonical ending <em>the </em>ending that led to the events of the show.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Season 2, all the various factions at play think they won the events of the New Vegas video game. “We had the delicious idea that at the end of a conflict, 15 years down the line, every faction might think they won, which I think has a bit of a poetic quality to it,” Nolan said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's like, the story of history depends on who you ask,” Robertson-Dworet added. “That was the idea.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is one fan-favorite minor faction in New Vegas who very much did not win: the Kings. In the video game, the Kings are a street gang made up of people who discovered an Elvis impersonation school and decided to live their lives according to the King’s ideals. But in Fallout Season 2, we see they have become ghouls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It hasn't worked out very well for the Kings, at least some of them,” Nolan teased, confirming the Elvis ghouls we see in the show are indeed the Kings characters from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nolan continued: “One of the fun ideas is that, with all the factions, whether it's the Legion, or the NCR, or the Kings, is that in any version of the ending, there'd be some rebuilding to be done, right? Whoever won, whoever lost, all these factions would be in rebuilding mode, and the sort of sanctity of Vegas, this place that House very carefully protected, has been, for reasons we'll come to understand in the season, has been removed or violated, which means that the folks who were in the game, safe and sound, have had some hard times.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/04/f-1764845484020.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Kings have had a rough 15 years.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there is much about Season 2’s New Vegas that fans of the video game will find familiar. Robertson-Dworet described the Strip, for example, as “a very sacred kind of location.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You really feel like you're almost going into the heart of the game when you reach the Strip. And so it was really unbelievable to see what our production designer, Howard Cummings, pulled off. We took over an abandoned shopping mall and built there, and the scale of it was just phenomenal. So that was really exciting to see come to life. Freeside was also unbelievable, also because it's shot on the same street that Westworld was shot on and Deadwood. So just seeing that transformed at a place that's had so much TV history, for me, as a fan, as well as now making a show there, was really, really exciting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Season 2 kicks off December 17.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Lorenzo Sisti/Prime.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Escape a deceptive nightmare of rainbows and unicorns by making its happy creatures cry.</p><p><strong>A Genre With No Name</strong></p><p><em>Kill Joy</em> is an experiment in complex systems design where a single interaction (swearing) can produce many consequences. That also means that because exploring the rules of the system is the fun part, we won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to make sense of this insane world yourself.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Swearing is Not Combat—It’s How You Explore</strong></p><p>In <em>Kill Joy</em>, you don’t shoot, punch, or cast spells. You swear.</p><p>Swearing at creatures is how you interact with this world. Sometimes a creature laughs, sometimes it panics, and sometimes it weeps—and when it cries, the illusion breaks. Every reaction is a mechanical clue. Every rude word is a probe into the rules of a place that desperately wants you happy, calm, and blind.</p><p><strong>A Pastoral Hell</strong></p><p>On the surface, this world is a manic dream of rainbow meadows, talking bunnies, and friendly unicorns. Underneath, something is very wrong:</p><ul><li>Happy creatures with glossy, empty eyes.</li><li>Joyful clouds humming in unsettling harmony.</li><li>Perfect little critters who desperately want you to smile.</li></ul><p>You know better. You can feel something gnawing at the edges.</p><p><strong>Break the Illusion</strong></p><p>Some illusions are “anchored” to certain entities. Their happiness is a spell holding reality together. Make them cry, and the spell cracks. Behind each illusion is something real:</p><ul><li>Hidden passages.</li><li>Suppressed memories.</li><li>Twisted, half-digested hints left by previous victims.</li><li>And the scattered fragments of your own mind.</li></ul><p><strong>Reassemble Your Mind</strong></p><p>Your mind has been shattered and projected outward onto the landscape. Each dispelled illusion yields:</p><ul><li>A word.</li><li>A question.</li><li>A fragment of meaning.</li></ul><p>Piece them together through small, elegant deduction challenges. Rebuild the logic of your thinking. Recover your identity. Find out what’s eating you—and why.</p><p>If you’re tired of games that tell you what to feel, where to go, and how to think…</p><p>If you want something genuinely new…</p><p>If you’re ready to swear at a unicorn until reality fractures—.</p><p>Welcome to <em>Kill Joy</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="You've NEVER played a game like this." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M4THd1pA3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/systems-driven-exploration-game-kill-joy-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

Many landed on Earth. Since then, magic is real, myths have moved in, and the fabled live side by side with humans in relative peace. Present day and the rifts are back… but this time they bring sinister threats into our world. You and your friends team up as the new generation of fabled citizens whose forgotten powers are awakened by the return of the rifts—you must master your emerging and growing magical abilities to fight the invasion and save the city you now call home.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What genre is it?</strong><ul><li>The game genre is online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [649 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> cooperative action. The genre for the setting is urban fantasy. It blends and deconstructs fantasy and folklore, twisting them into a brand new reality set in London. It’s a familiar backdrop intertwined with fantastical wonder, delivering a sense of newness and nostalgia, discovery and familiar favorites. It’s fantasy in a modern jacket.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What’s the core gameplay loop?</strong><ul><li>Squads of players face overwhelming enemies and supernatural threats, creating high-stakes cooperative moments where success depends on teamwork. Run-based missions call upon players to employ their fluid magical traversal and visceral spell-casting to defeat threats that stand between them and their objectives. Players will utilize tight combat, special moves, team synergies, tag-team casting and team-up moves to save the city from invasion or liberate occupied districts.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Is it <a title="Genres > Open-World [784 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a>?</strong><ul><li>It’s not open-world. We want every district, every street, and every corner to be filled with fun activities and encounters. Using wide-linear maps, we balance large urban playgrounds, which are ripe for player-driven chaos and emergent gameplay, with scripted set-pieces that deliver boss-like encounters and epic moments, set against iconic backgrounds.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What’s the maximum number of players?</strong><ul><li>Currently, the game supports two-to-four players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Are there player-versus-player modes?</strong><ul><li>At this time, we are focused on delivering the best player-versus-environment experience, but in the future, we look forward to opening up more modes and different ways to play.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Can I play single player?</strong><ul><li>No. We have an ambition to deliver an uncompromising, true cooperative experience where players are not simply side by side but connected by the gameplay. The nature of our design is that you need at least one teammate to amplify your powers. It’s a playground for you, your friends and the community.</li></ul></li><li><strong>What platforms are you supporting?</strong><ul><li>We believe in a cross-platform ecosystem and plan to release <em>Cast Outs</em> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series.

            <p>Happy late early December everyone! That can only mean one thing: we've opened voting for Eurogamer readers' top 50 games of the year, and a little earlier than last year, too. I'd love there to be a smart reason for this, but it's really because we simply won't have time to collate all the votes and comments and turn them into an article if we leave it any later.</p>
<p>In terms of actual games released, 2025 has been pretty good, I think. There's a nice and varied mix of games making up my personal top 10, so hopefully you'll have plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>As is the usual way, we're asking you for your ranked top five games of the year, with the option to also tell us why each of them had the special sauce. The rules are thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>DLC/expansions are <strong>not</strong> eligible, unless they are playable as 'standalone'</li>
<li>Ongoing games not released in 2025 are also <strong>not</strong> eligible</li>
<li>Ports of games not released in 2025 are also <strong>not</strong> eligible - but we're allowing Switch 2 versions if what's in the new version has been significantly altered/added to.</li>
<li>Games still in Early Access are <strong>not</strong> eligible</li>
<li>Remakes and significant remasters <strong>are</strong> eligible.</li>
<li>Games released from Early Access into '1.0' in 2025 <strong>are</strong> eligible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempted to provide you with every game released in 2025 via a dropdown box, but this failed for multiple reasons so we're going the old-fashioned way of typing the names into boxes.</p>
<p>If you are happy to provide your Eurogamer username, your words could form part of our final article. This is set to be published on December 30, a day before Eurogamer's own Game of the Year is revealed. I wonder which is going to have the most embarrassing top 10?</p>
<p>If you could get your votes and comments in by the end of Sunday, 14th December, I (and whoever else is tasked with turning an Excel sheet into a readable article) will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn6Hvv-9yq_M1Mgcsv5eByRd0qRcelSkQZ6IZG5yqSN6bP3A/viewform?usp=publish-editor">the form</a> for your choices, so get voting now (unless you're waiting to play through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and need a few more days with it).</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, for reading - and for sticking with us through 2025 even though we (I) said the Switch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> ports were reasonably priced.</p>

              <p><span>Ever since The Pokémon Company </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><span>announced </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a><span>, the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-style life sim game has seemed a little off. Your character is helping rebuild a small town so Pokémon can live there, but the space is filled with desecrated buildings, and humans are nowhere to be found. Fans have been speculating that the cozy game might not be so cozy after all, and that it may take place in a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>post-apocalyptic version of the Kanto region</span></a><span> from the original </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. Now, a leak may have confirmed this.</span></p> <p><span>A leaked map outlines the status of Kanto in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, with descriptions for each “area,” named after the cities and towns that once stood there. A translation posted by Pokémon leak account Centro Leaks describes these desolate areas, and each of them sounds like they’ve succumbed to the elements. Fuschia city, which fans have speculated might be the first area shown in most of </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>‘s trailers, is said to be “dried up and unfertilized fieldland.” Vermillion City, which was once occupied by Lt. Surge’s electric gym and a harbor city for ships to arrive and depart from, is roughly translated as a “constant raining electrical harbor.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The rest of the descriptions sure do make it sound like humanity has been gone for a long time. Saffron City’s metropolitan area is “covered with plants,” Pewter City has been “abandoned” and is covered in rocks, and Lavender Town’s Pokémon Tower is now “rotten” but believed to reach heaven.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokópia is post-apocalyptic Kanto CONFIRMED!</p> <p>➡️ Base game areas:<br>Area 1 – Fuscha Area – Dried up and unfertilized fieldland<br>Area 2 – Vermillion Area – Constant raining electrical harbor<br>Area 3 – Pewter Area – An abandoned mine covered by rocks<br>Area 4 – Saffron Area – Bunch of… <a href="https://t.co/JPySgYGnBW">https://t.co/JPySgYGnBW</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1996007165002199320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Just how much </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>will reckon with this remains to be seen, but the environment isn’t the only indicator that something terrible happened in Kanto in this game. The game includes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-pikachu-pale-form-peakychu-white-2000644025"><span>new forms for Pikachu, Snorlax, and Smeargle</span></a><span> that have elements to their character design that imply a lot of time has passed since they last interacted with humans. I’m really curious to see how deep this game goes into its tragic “what if” storyline when it comes to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-full-clearance-on-its-graphics-cards-as-the-geforce-rtx-5070-drops-to-a-new-record-low-2000650188</link>
            <guid>1372969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Those looking to game better or push some creative boundaries this holiday season; we’ve got good news. The top-rated ASUS GeForce RTX 5070 just hit its lowest price ever, and it’s even better than what it dipped to during Black Friday!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">This graphics card sits at $710, but you can currently grab it for just $570 at Amazon, after the retailer took 20% off its price</a>. The deal is open to all shoppers, and there are no delivery charges to worry about. Even better, this isn’t one of those complicated-to-score discounts. You don’t need to enter any complicated coupon codes or follow long checkout steps to grab the discount. Just throw it in your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The only thing to note is that the retailer has marked the deal as a fast-selling one. That means the stock, or the drop itself, is only going to be around for a short time, and it won’t be long before we see them wrap up. It’s better to act now if you don’t want to run into last-minute disappointments later on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Visuals, Even Better Performance</h2>
<p>RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you work and play. The graphics card is powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture and DLSS 4, featuring fifth-gen tensor cores for better AI performance, latest streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neutral shader, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores specifically built for mega geometry. DLSS4 uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and make the overall image quality top-notch, while the Blackwell architecture makes cinematic quality visuals at unbelievable speeds possible.</p>
<p>The 2.5 slot design of the card offers better build compatibility while maintaining cooling performance, regardless of how intense things get. Cooling mechanism includes a premium phase-change GPU thermal pad that softens under heat to fill the gaps between the GPU and thermal module effectively, resulting in superior thermal conductivity and better heat dissipation throughout your sessions. The axial-tech fans come with longer blades, alongside a barrier ring to increase the downward air pressure, while the 0db tech stops the fans automatically when the temperature of the GPU goes 50 degrees. The latter makes it easy to focus on light tasks without any distracting sound, and puts the fans back to work at 55 degrees when things start to heat up. You can also switch between Quiet and Performance BIOS profiles manually; the former offers a calmer operation, while the latter maximizes performance for resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>The card comes with a GPU guard that applies adhesive to secure all four corners of the GPU to keep it firmly in place. Dual-ball bearings are designed to last up to twice as long as sleeve bearings, while the protective backplate does a good job of keeping the components safe from external damage. What’s more, the Tuning tool makes overclocking, cooling control, and monitoring the performance of your card a breeze. It even comes with MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app that gives the creative inside you a boost by letting you create images, manage ideas, and unlock new inspirations as you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">You can now grab the graphics card for just $570, after an impressive $140 discount on its retail price of $710.</a> This makes the upgrade much more affordable, but only for a short time. Don’t miss out on the chance to grab it for less, as this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the card drop to.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed as the most downloaded PS5 game in the month of November 2025. </p>



<p>Black Ops 7, the latest Call of Duty title released on November 14, 2025, wasn’t able to make the same impact as previous instalments in the franchise. The game suffered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-suffers-worst-launch-in-20-year-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst launch in Japan in its 20-year history</a>, sales were down by 50% in Europe, and it hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">series low Metacritic user rating</a>. However, things don’t seem too bad, as it dominated the PS5 store last month. </p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-dominates-ps5-charts-in-november-2025">Black Ops 7 Dominates PS5 Charts in November 2025</h2>



<p>Sony PlayStation is back again with its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/04/playstation-store-november-2025s-top-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">monthly charts</a>, revealing the top downloads across PS5, PS4, PS VR2, and free-to-play games in the month of November 2025, and we already know where Black Ops 7 shone. In PS4, Red Dead Redemption 2 was the top dog, PSVR 2 had Alien: Rogue Incursion VR in the lead, and the free-to-play section was split between Where Winds Meet and Battlefield REDSEC.

In an alternate 1980s America reshaped by nuclear catastrophe, Phoenix-City has become one of the Corporation’s strongholds – a haven for corruption where outlaws thrive and human life is traded like currency. Step into the role of R.E.A.C.H., expose the Corporation’s hidden agenda, and uncover the purpose behind your creation.</p><p><em>REPLACED</em> is a 2.5D cinematic action platformer wrapped in an intense cyberpunk thriller narrative. Run, climb, and fight through crumbling districts, industrial wastelands, and neon-lit alleys with fluid movement and fast, responsive combat. Chain precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks to take down enemies in high-intensity encounters while keeping the flow of exploration.</p><p>Explore themes of humanity, identity, and control through morally complex characters and the slow reveal of a world pushed to its limits. Feel it being brought to life with hand-crafted pixel art enhanced by modern visual effects, while a moody, synth-driven soundtrack sets the tone. <em>REPLACED</em> delivers a single-player journey that blends cinematic platforming, fast-paced action, and a tense cyberpunk thriller narrative. Immerse yourself in a world where every secret – and every life – has a price.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
Sega has broached the subject of AI following it latest earnings report, confirming its plans to leverage the technology in development as part of "efficiency improvements". However, it also says it intends to proceed "carefully" in order to identify "appropriate" uses.
</p>
<p>
The company shared its perspective during a Q&amp;A session coinciding with its Q2 earnings report, responding to a question inquiring if it would pursue larger projects or efficiency. "Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development," its executives explained in an <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251203_q2_major_QA_e.pdf">official translation</a>, "we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI."
</p>
<p>
It also acknowledged the "strong resistance" AI adoption can face in "creative areas such as character creation", adding it intends to "proceed by carefully assessing appropriate use cases". It suggested one such area might include "streamlining the development processes" but did not elaborate further.
</p>
<p>
Sega is, of course, far from the only publisher to weigh in on AI in recent times, with some companies being less cautious than others. EA CEO Andrew Wilson, for instance, has boasted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">AI is "the very core of our business"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has taken a more measured approach, calling artificial intelligence an "oxymoron" and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-couldnt-be-made-by-ai-suggests-take-two-boss-there-is-no-creativity-that-can-exist-by-definition-in-any-ai-model">saying</a> "no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model." Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/execs-pushing-ai-not-humane-creative-rockstar-co-founder-mad-cow-disease">compared the technology to "mad cow disease"</a>, describing the execs pushing it as "not the most humane or creative people".
</p><p>
Even so, a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development. One of those studios - Let it Die: Inferno developer Supertrick Games - this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">faced the issue head on</a> after receiving significant criticism for its extensive use of generative AI.

<p>In the hardware charts, the Switch 2 stays firmly on top with an additional 97,677 units to its name, followed by the PS5 Digital Edition and the Switch OLED.</p>
<p>Things are so close between the PS5 and Switch 1 this week, that combining the SKU's for the two consoles only narrowly tips things in Sony's favour. The standard Switch, OLED and Lite come together for 35,327, while the three PS5 models sneak in with 35,786.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia launched its first RTX 50-series graphics cards earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit">without support for PhysX</a>, the GPU-accelerated technology that let games realistically simulate shattering glass, moving liquids, smoke, fog, and more. Now, Nvidia is bringing back PhysX support for the RTX 50-series GPUs for top-played games like <em>Borderlands 2</em>, <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, and <em>Batman: Arkham City</em>.</p><p>“We heard the feedback from the community, and with the launch of our new driver today, we are adding custom support for GeForce gamers’ most played PhysX-accelerated games, enabling full performance on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, in line with our existing PhysX support on prior-generation GPUs,” <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-geforce-game-ready-driver/">says Nvidia</a>.</p><p>PhysX was a big part of games like <em>Borderlands 2</em> and <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, and it originally didn’t ship with Nvidia’s latest GPUs because the RTX 50-series dropped support for 32-bit CUDA support. That prevented these older games using PhysX from being GPU-accelerated on the latest Nvidia GPUs. Some titles like <em>Borderlands 2</em> dropped below 60fps, because the games were relying on a CPU to deliver PhysX effects.</p><p>Nvidia has now created “custom support” for top-played PhysX-accelerated games, but not all games are supported yet. Here’s the current list:</p><p><em>Alice: Madness Returns<br>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag<br>Batman: Arkham City<br>Batman: Arkham Origins<br>Borderlands 2<br>Mafia II<br>Metro 2033<br>Metro: Last Light<br>Mirror’s Edge</em></p><p>Nvidia says it’s also planning to support <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em> “in the first part of 2026,” but there’s no word on any additional games. PhysX was always limited to a handful of titles anyway, but <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/">Resetera forum</a> members have been tracking more than 40 games that have been affected by the removal of PhysX support on RTX 50-series GPUs. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Nvidia will fully support all of these older PhysX games.</p><p>You can download Nvidia’s new Game Ready driver (591.44) over at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/">Nvidia’s website</a> or through the Nvidia app.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/838043/nvidia-rtx-50-series-physx-support-driver]]></content:encoded>

<p>GTA Online players can get a free $500,000 bonus in-game, without GTA+; all they need to do is link their Discord account. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 5 has been out for 12 years now, and the game is still going strong, all thanks to its online multiplayer mode. The game’s popularity remains high enough that it’s up for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-5-is-up-for-a-goty-award-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game of the Year award in 2025</a>. As Rockstar keeps on bringing new content to the title, players are now eligible to claim some free GTA Online money. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-link-discord-and-rockstar-account-to-claim-500-000-in-gta-online">How to Link Discord and Rockstar Account to Claim $500,000 in GTA Online?</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/gta-online-promotion-discord-free-money-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, GTA Online players can grab free $500,000 by linking their Rockstar and Discord accounts, no GTA+ subscription required. All you need to do is visit the linked accounts section on the Rockstar Games <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/settings/linkedaccounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> after signing in to your account. Here, you can link your Discord and Rockstar accounts. Once that is done, players will need to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockstargames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">join</a> the Rockstar Games Discord and claim the reward from the designated channel. The reward can then be redeemed when playing GTA Online next. </p>



<p>Before GTA+ came about, Rockstar would provide $500,000 each month for GTA Online through PlayStation Plus, and all you needed to do was go and claim the reward. Since the arrival of GTA+, that bonus is only reserved for subscribed members. Moreover, being a member of Rockstar’s subscription service also provides GTA Online to players for free, so you don’t even need to buy the base game. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-open-beta-launches-again-new-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1372912</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PIONER, an upcoming post-apocalyptic MMO, is back in open beta until December 9, giving GFA Games the chance to optimize it before the game’s ultimate release (in early access) on December 16. This new open beta phase coincides with the release of an all-new trailer showcasing the game’s setting, the ruined island of Tartarus.</p>



<p>PIONER comes from GFA Games, a Serbian studio, and it promises intense, end-of-the-world action in a Soviet-era setting that’s deeply reminiscent of games like STALKER and Fallout.</p>



<h2 id="h-pioner-launching-december-16-but-you-can-play-it-now">PIONER Launching December 16, But You Can Play It Now</h2>



<p>GFA Games’ PIONER is set to drop in just a couple of weeks, but if you want to play it now (exclusively on Steam), then you can simply install the open beta and give it a try.</p>



<p>PIONER is a little rough around the edges, but it’s launching in early access, so that can mostly be excused. It’s a very ambitious title that boasts an MMO, live-service operating model, a branching campaign, a PvPvE ecosystem, and sumptuous visuals.</p>



<p>The newest trailer offers a great look at the environments players will need to contend with when the game comes out on December 16:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PIONER - Mist" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2nUqz-p1_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fans of STALKER will notice the similarities between the two games. In PIONER, which was developed by some former STALKER devs, players must contend with anomalies that are made detectable by a scanner, and to defeat them, they can throw pieces of scrap metal into them to trigger them.</p>



<p>Sound familiar?</p>



<p>It’s a bit of a copy and paste, but there’s enough meat on the bones of PIONER for it to feel unique, and the game’s combat, customization, and freedom mechanics are all top-notch.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re looking forward to PIONER being released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it will publish an unannounced cooperative shooter in development at JJ Abrams' Bad Robot Games studio. The unannounced game is a "four-player, cooperative shooter" that's being directed by Left 4 Dead creator and designer Mike Booth, and it's set to launch on PlayStation 5 and PC sometime in the future.</p><p>JJ Abrams announced in 2018 that his film production company, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/06/07/jj-abrams-production-company-expands-to-bad-robot-games">Bad Robot, was expanding to create a video game studio called Bad Robot Games</a>. At the time, Bad Robot Games entered into a partnership with Chinese conglomerate Tencent for the venture, with Mortal Kombat publisher WB Games involved as a minority stakeholder, but it's unclear if those two companies are involved in this Booth-directed game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game," vice president and head of SIE 2P/3P Content Ventures and Strategic Initiatives Christian Svensson writes in a press release.

			<p>Remember Bad Robot Games? The gaming studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-tencent-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded around seven and a half years ago</a> by Bad Robot's JJ Abrams, in partnership with Tencent. It was supposed to bring JJ Abrams' SPYJINX project, originally<a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-partners-chair-create-spyjinx-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> a decade ago, to fruition. In April 2020, it seemed like <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-and-bad-robots-spyjinx-resurfaces-as-a-mobile-game-beta-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they were still working on it as a mobile game</a>, but the project was eventually quietly canceled.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's not all Bad Robot Games was doing. In February 2021, former Left 4 Dead creator Michael S. (better known as Mike) Booth <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-robot-games-is-working-on-an-awesome-coop-multiplayer-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he had joined the team to create an outstanding cooperative multiplayer shooter game.</p>



<p>Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it has signed on as a partner to produce and publish this title, which will be released for PC and PlayStation 5. Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe. With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</em></p>



<p>Christian Svensson, VP and Head of 2P/3P Content Ventures &amp; Strategic Initiatives at Sony Interactive Entertainment, added:</p>



<p><em>We’re greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game. Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE’s mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players. We can’t wait for gamers to step into the world they’ve been building.</em></p>



<p>There are no further details, so the game's status is unclear. Still, Bad Robot Games has been working on it for a considerable amount of time, as outlined above. Hopefully, that means it won't be long until we can play it. </p>

			<p>This week's GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the full list of PC games being added to the cloud platform's library in December 2025. </p>



<p>One of these games is 2023's best-selling title by Avalanche Software, Hogwarts Legacy. Moreover, GeForce NOW users are finally getting access to the first Activision titles to be made available on Ubisoft+. As you might recall, part of the deal that unlocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-resctructures-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the sale of cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft</a>. Subscribers to Ubisoft+ Premium can now play games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy on GFN, with more to be added later.</p>



<p>Today, NVIDIA kicks off the Half-Price Holiday sale. Premium GeForce NOW memberships are available now through December 50 (while supplies last) at 50% off for the first month for a limited time. Starting today, members can also link their Battle.net accounts directly to GFN for automatic single sign-on across all supported devices, making it easier to access Battle.net games via cloud.</p>

              <p><span>God, Nintendo can be an annoying company. Not 24 hours ago, I was writing about how it made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s music volume options a toggle</span></a><span> that only let you choose between “normal” and “louder,” and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today and has its own obnoxious music options for players to contend with. At least </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s nonsense came at no additional cost to you. </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> has paywalled basic options and features behind $30 amiibo figures.</span></p> <p><span>One of the big additions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-world hub space that Samus travels through on a super cool motorcycle. Unfortunately, this area is pretty lifeless, and you only really have the rattle and hum of Samus’ bike to accompany its desolate, isolating vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s some ambient music in the background, but it’s certainly not doing much to make these sections exciting. Some open-world games, like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, let you turn on a radio station while traveling to make driving segments more stimulating, but </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has no such option…unless you buy the </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>Samus amiibo.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me get this straight: If you pay $29.99 for the collectible Samus amiibo in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetroidPrime4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetroidPrime4</a>  you get to play/select music while driving the Vi-O-La bike in the otherwise quiet desert… In other words: They locked MUSIC while riding through a desert behind a $30 paywall… Am… <a href="https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR">https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/1996340617497227440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The figure allows you to change the music while riding your motorcycle, and paywalling such a basic feature would be maddening if it weren’t also one of the most Nintendo-ass decisions the company could have made. I think I’m more impressed by the new ways it finds to be obtuse than anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Amiibo figures, small figurines of characters that unlock things when you tap them on a Nintendo game system were first introduced in 2014 for the Wii U and 3DS, and have always come with bonus in-game rewards that were, often items or cosmetics. Gating features that would be standard in most games is so weirdly hostile that I’m surprised Nintendo gets away with it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650512">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, the Samus amiibo looks great, but do keep in mind it’s not to be confused with the </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> Samus figure that includes her bike. That one won’t let you change the music; instead, it will let you change the motorcycle’s color and see how much you’ve traveled on your chopper. Good thing these things look pretty on a shelf. I’m trying to imagine what would happen if any other company charged $30 for baseline functionality. It probably wouldn’t go well!</span></p>
