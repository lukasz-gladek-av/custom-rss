            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, IO Interactive gave press and content creators a behind-closed-doors presentation of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-fastest-io-interactive-game-500k-wishlists-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly anticipated upcoming game, 007 First Light</a>. The booth was certainly a looker, especially with a shiny Aston Martin placed in front of it to remind everyone how big this brand really is.</p>



<p>Inside, we were shown footage from one of the game's early missions. After just a few minutes, it was clear that the Copenhagen-based studio was doing things quite differently from its HITMAN series. There's a decidedly more cinematic style to everything, which is far from surprising given that we are talking about James Bond, one of the most iconic movie characters (even though, of course, he originally appeared in Ian Fleming's novels and short stories) of all time. Every character has more flair, starting with Bond himself, who is immeasurably more charismatic than the glacial Agent 47. At this stage, he's also a lot more brash and cocky than we're used to in the movies; that is because IO Interactive and the licensing partners have decided to go with an origin story that's going to explore how Bond becomes a double 0 agent in the first place. In the mission, Bond is assigned to keep watch outside of an important event, but he cannot help himself and goes inside after noticing some odd behavior from certain guests.</p>



<p>The gameplay eventually shows some of the gadgets available to Bond at this point in the game, but what's quickly obvious is that this is not going to be anywhere near as open-ended a sandbox as HITMAN. In fact, it appears to draw a lot of similarities with Uncharted-style games, which is why I came up with the headline. There are even big setpieces akin to what we're used to from Naughty Dog's games.</p>



<p>There's nothing wrong with that - I loved the Uncharted games, and so did millions of people, if the sales are anything to go by - and this is going to be multiplatform, unlike those titles. It's just that HITMAN fans should be aware this will be quite a bit different from the usual fare they've come to expect from this studio. Visually, the game looks great in the latest version of the Glacier engine, although character models aren't quite as good as what we've seen recently from other engines. I noticed frame rate slowdowns at least a couple of times, but 007 First Light is still in Pre-Alpha, so that is to be expected.</p>



<p>After the presentation, I was able to chat for a bit with IO Interactive's Senior Licensing Producer Theuns Smit. As a reminder, the studio is targeting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-cinematic-trailer-revealed-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 launch</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p><strong>Can you explain what your role entails?</strong></p>



<p>As you would expect from a licensed IP like James Bond, we have a great collaboration between IO Interactive and our partners at Amazon and Metro Goldwyn Mayer. This means that everything that goes into the game, we collaborate with them on that, so there's submissions and reviews and approvals and all of that. It also means that, as we've been crafting this experience, we have been granted access to the consultants who have been working on this IP as well, collaborating together on all of that. I help keep track of things that are moving in, getting approved, and working with our brand partners. James Bond is synonymous with working with Omega, Aston Martin, Land Rover, these folks were all equally and extremely excited to partner on this, and I just help manage those interactions..</p>



<p><strong>007 First Light is an original story, though, correct?</strong></p>



<p>That's exactly right. Obviously, we have over 25 years of experience in the agent fantasy genre with HITMAN, but for 007 First Light, a big focus for us is that from the get-go, we wanted to tell an original, standalone, reimagined origin story. This means that we get to go back to before James Bond is at MI6, before he earns his double 0 status, fresh out of the Royal Navy. We are given the opportunity to explore that space.</p>



<p><strong>In the presentation, Bond seemingly kills some people. Does that mean that by that point in the game, he has already earned the famous License to Kill?</strong></p>



<p>I almost feel like I don't want to completely spoil a few things, because there's a deep narrative connection to it. As you know from 007 lore, it takes two kills to earn double 0 status, and that is something that we lean into, of course, and that is part of the journey you're taking on. But that license to kill doesn't just mean you go into any situation with guns blazing. When met with deadly force, you reciprocate, and in certain moments, like the one you saw in the presentation, it is very much all action all throughout, but in other areas, where perhaps there's a more open approach to a specific area. You try to get back to situation contact. So, License to Kill, do what you need to immobilize the enemies around you, and then go back to situation contained.</p>



<p><strong>Of course, you previously mentioned IO Interactive's track record with agent fantasy games. Even in the presentation, it was revealed that 007 First Light would have a mix of linear and more open missions. Can you share whether it will be an even balance between the two, or should players expect to see more of one type?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's about the full experience you get in our game. There's the underlying story, the narrative that drives things forward, but that is in combination with the wealth of gameplay we provide. So, various missions will take you to various locations. Some of them are a little bit bigger. Some of them are a little bit smaller. It is what the story calls for, what we need to drive forward in this moment that we will either, you know, enlarge that space, an environment at that location, or put it a bit more on guardrails to tell what we need to tell. So, it's a third-person story-driven action adventure, and that is what determines kind of where we want to make things go more open up and where we want to be more linear.</p>



<p><strong>During the presentation, at some point, I noticed a lure ability greyed out, and the game told the player that they required more 'agency'. Can you explain what agency is?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. Same as what you saw on your watch, for example, there's a bit of resource management to the different gadgets that you need to use. Here, it's about relying on James Bond's instincts, basically, so your instincts also have a bit of a gamified gameplay element to them. I'm not going to go into too much detail right now, but to keep things fun and balanced and not completely overpowered, there are moments where you need to or you get to rely on your intrinsic 'Bondiness', so to speak—Bond's charm and wit. Perhaps luring people over or bluffing your way through a situation. You saw a glimpse of that in the infiltration, where some folks are startled by this man jumping from the window and Bond goes like, penetration test, all good. That was an automatic reaction, but later in the game, there's this fun gameplay that comes into it where certain actions allow you to hold that metre up a little bit, and then using that to bluff your way out of a situation, something like that.</p>



<p><strong>Obviously, in HITMAN, disguises were a core component of the gameplay. Are they going to be a lot less prominent in 007 First Light?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good question. We definitely wanted to focus on the fact that these two different games and with James Bond, there are certain things that we get to lean in on more. It goes back to that trademark Bond charm, a little bit of social manipulation, espionage, and leaning into Bond's double 0 training. You can manipulate those around you to get into certain areas where you need to be, and so there are contextual outfits for the stories that you go on, but it is not the same of like, just grab an outfit and go as you're used to in the HITMAN games. We lean into the strength of Bond being Bond and his charm and his wit and his guile to get through situations.</p>



<p><strong>Is there some form of character progression system in the game? Can you unlock some new abilities for him through a dedicated system, or is it just narrative-driven?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's a bit more narrative driven instead of what maybe it's picked from a role playing game kind of thing. We have definitely found some really fun and interesting ways of taking you through character and player progression. Some of it is tied to the gadgets that to unlock through the story, but also, as you're going for training, as we said, you start off as a young Bond, you can maybe throw fists a little bit, but yeah, you you haven't been the Mature and well rounded agent that he becomes. As you work through that to earn your number, there are key moments where we can expand on the things that you, as the player, get to do. So, it's about taking you and Bond on that same progression journey together from a narrative point view and I feel it works very well.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share an estimate for the game length of 007 First Light?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. I suppose it depends on what kind of player you are. It comes back to our variety of locations. There's a big story to tell. Some of the locations are going to be bigger. Some of them are going to be a bit smaller. But we'll also focus a lot on the immersion; this is not just an action/adventure game, this is a James Bond action/adventure game. That means there's a certain level of immersion that you would expect of the locations you find yourself in. As you saw in the previous trailer, even going to the MI6, what does that mean as a player? Explore around, feel, get immersed. All of that has an impact on the full flow and works out for you to play for yourself.</p>



<p><strong>I know that you'll be giving players the ability to replay the story missions with modifiers, correct?</strong></p>



<p>It's more coming down to the creative approach. This new chapter for Bond in gaming means that you go through certain areas, perhaps you're focusing more on being stealthy or more on using gadgets or something like that, and we wanted to make it so fun that you played again and perhaps tried something else. Take a different approach. That is where we focus when it comes to replayability.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to have some kind of online leaderboards like in HITMAN, where 007 First Light players compete for mission scores or something like that?</strong></p>



<p>Perhaps in the future, but for now, we're focusing on this standalone, action/adventure experience.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share the status of the game? Was the presentation grabbed from a Pre-Alpha or Alpha build? </strong></p>



<p>Yeah, it was a Pre-Alpha, very much work-in-progress build that you saw.</p>



<p><strong>Good to know. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>IO Interactive just revealed an in-depth walkthrough of 007 First Light, dropping more than half an hour of preview footage. It was a combination of a raw mission session followed by a gameplay breakdown, accompanied by commentary. The entire length and breadth of the game’s core mechanics were unveiled by the team.</p>



<p>During the walkthrough, my eagle eyes spotted something in the background. In one sequence, there’s a row of classic arcade games across the other side of a room, and one is none other than Freedom Fighters, the 2003 third-person shooter from IO Interactive and one of my favorite PlayStation 2 games.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-freedom-fighters-be-playable-though">Will Freedom Fighters Be Playable Though?</h2>



<p>If Freedom Fighters were to be playable as a game within a game, I think I’d lose my mind. I adored the shooter when it dropped more than 20 years ago, and it went on to influence games like Homefront.</p>



<p>Here’s a screencap from the trailer:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The 007 First Light preview was one that I’d seen previously at Gamescom, but this was the first time it had been made public. It also offered up the release date for 007 First Light, which is set to drop on March 27, 2026.</p>



<p>I’ve penned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a full preview breakdown</a> of the walkthrough I received at Gamescom, but little did I know, IO Interactive would show the <strong>exact same preview </strong>to the world today! I didn’t see the Freedom Fighter cameo earlier, though.</p>



<p>007 First Light will drop next year, and fans of Hitman will be pleased with what’s on offer. It will also give 007 fans a look at a refreshing origin story for the legendary character.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-preview-hitman-as-james-bond/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-preview-i-couldn%E2%80%99t-stop-seeing-hitman-with-a-james-bond-skin.1287999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I had the pleasure of attending a 007 First Light preview at Gamescom, where I got a glimpse of live gameplay of the highly anticipated, upcoming spy action-thriller from IO Interactive. The team from IO walked us through a brief mission to locate a target at a gala while undercover, but soon fast-forwarded to some intense car chase scenes.</p>



<p>This was one of the most ‘protected’ experiences I had at Gamescom, hidden away behind the scenes in an area mocked up as a theater flanked by a classic Aston Martin. However, for all the pomp and circumstance of the reveal, I couldn’t help but feel I was watching gameplay pulled from the next Hitman game.</p>



<p>Here’s my full 007 First Light preview.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-beginning-of-bond">The Beginning of Bond</h2>



<p>My 007 First Light preview opened with the IO Interactive squad setting the scene for the game. They explained that this is a brash, young, and somewhat inexperienced James Bond, fresh out of the military and working into what will become a legendary career as one of the most recognizable spy characters to ever emerge.</p>



<p>It was easy enough to see that concept surfacing in the first few minutes of the gameplay walkthrough at Gamescom. This James Bond was making quips, stepping out of his lane relatively early on, and perhaps fumbling where a more experienced 007 might not.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, as the sequence unfolded, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was watching a Hitman game on the big screen. It was also an early build, so a few bugs were present, emotionless NPCs were everywhere, and interactions felt a little flat.</p>



<p>It might be obvious at first blush, but both Hitman: World of Assassination, the most recent game in the series, and 007 First Light share an engine – Glacier. The visual palette is quite similar, but it goes beyond that, and a lot of the movement, UI, and underlying themes feel as though they’ve been ripped from Hitman.</p>



<p>As the IO Interactive team stalked the luxurious gala venue in Slovakia, trying not to arouse suspicion and searching for their target (in this case, 009), I felt as though I’d done the same thing a hundred times in the last 25 years in Hitman games. What’s different is that 007 is a cheeky British chap with a bit more agility than the gruff Agent 47.</p>



<p>Bond fans will absolutely appreciate the origin story that sees them shaping 007 and becoming acquainted with the likes of M, Moneypenny, and Q, but anyone coming into Bond from a Hitman background might feel a little short-changed. The timeline is also a little skewed. This is ‘young’ James Bond, but from the weapons to the vehicles, the game feels decidedly modern.</p>



<p>I <strong>should stress </strong>that these impressions are based on a short preview, so it’s perhaps unfair to tar First Light with such a tough brush this early on, but if I’m in the business of judging a book (game) but its cover (exclusive preview)…</p>



<p>But as the preview unfolded, I found myself nitpicking something awful. There’s not enough room here to expand on that.</p>



<h2 id="h-meat-on-the-bones">Meat on the Bones</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Car chases are high-octane but very scripted (Credit: IO Interactive)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s tough to gauge how sizable 007 First Light will be, but I can see it having replayability value on account of the multiple approaches possible for each mission and situation. There are some extra modes attached to the game, like challenge runs, and the title seems to accommodate both lethal and non-lethal styles.</p>



<p>I witnessed Bond getting his ‘license to kill’ from MI6 first-hand, opening the door to a guns-blazing sequence that showcased the faster pacing of the game present in these scenes and car chases, for instance.</p>



<p>I was also privy to the game’s espionage mechanics, with Bond using distraction tactics, neat gadgets, and tricks of the trade like bluffing and persuasion to make his way to his target unimpeded. These are elements that <strong>you’d expect </strong>to see in a Bond game, of course.</p>



<p>I hate to play a broken record, but they’re also elements that are prevalent in Hitman. If you modded the game and replaced the all-new and original model of 007 with Agent 47, you’d probably not be able to tell the difference.</p>



<p>I want to highlight that I’m not <strong>disappointed </strong>with what I saw from 007 First Light; I’m just not yet convinced that it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-devs-reveal-how-hitman-has-influenced-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standing apart from Hitman</a> enough for IO Interactive to push it as far as it can, especially as there’s a desire to make it a trilogy. I’ve always enjoyed the Hitman games, and I’d almost certainly enjoy 007 First Light, regardless of how familiar it feels.</p>



<p>For some, that familiarity is nothing but a good thing. It’s a comfort. I’m sure that with a fuller preview or a lengthy walkthrough, I’d have a much better sense of how First Light differentiates itself from Hitman beyond a few gadgets and heavily scripted car chases.</p>



<p>007 First Light is set to be released in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Let me know what you think about it on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

As part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-007-first-lights-september-playstation-state-of-play-livestream-with-us-here">Sony's big Bond-themed PlayStation State of Play</a>, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has revealed 007: First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year. Additionally, the studio has unveiled a collector's edition with a price tag likely to leave you at least slightly shaken if not completely stirred.
</p>
<p>
007: First Light was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">announced all the way back in 2021</a>, under the name Project 007, but it wasn't until earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">IO Interactive began discussing the game in earnest</a>. The gist is that First Light serves as an origin story for IO's Bond - part of what's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">hoped to be a trilogy</a> - charting the iconic spy's early days as a "young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless new recruit". It's promising stealthy espionage, daredevil action set-pieces, cool spy gadgets, and seemingly everything else you might expect from a Bond game.
</p>
<p>
IO showed off some of that in more detail during Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play showcase, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">read more about 007: First Light's gameplay fundamentals</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. But perhaps the biggest news of the evening was a confirmed release date. We already knew it was coming next year, but IO has now firmed that up into a 27th March launch. Additionally, it's also <a href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame">announced a bunch of different editions</a> as pre-orders get underway.

<p>
Anyone that pre-orders 007: First Light's £59.99/€69.99/$69.99 USD Standard digital edition - which can be purchased for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store - will be upgraded to the Deluxe Edition at no extra cost. This gets you the game itself, 24 hours of early access, and a Deluxe Upgrade cosmetics bundle featuring four exclusive outfits, one new weapon skin, and the Gleaming pack. After launch, the Deluxe Edition will cost £69.99/€79.99/$79.99 USD.
</p><p>
There's also a physical release - known as the Specialist edition - featuring all the above plus the Classic Tuxedo Skin, for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2, and PC. And for the big spenders out there, IO is releasing a limited edition Legacy variant. This physical-only release for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC costs a not-insignificant £259.99/€299.99/$299.99 USD and includes everything featured in other editions, plus a couple of exclusive weapon and outfit skins, a Golden Gun figurine with a stand and secret compartment, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic steel case. Oh, and a great big box.

<p>
Whether IO Interactive can pull off its ambitious Bond origin story remains to be seen, but Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-one-trailer-io-interactive-has-totally-proven-it-gets-bond-and-its-all-about-the-salivating-consumerism">previously opined that signs are good</a>. "In one trailer, [the Hitman studio] has totally proven it 'gets' Bond," he wrote, "and it's all about the salivating consumerism."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158456/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Spare a thought for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a>, Atari’s newest retro-styled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-metroidvania-games">Metroidvania</a>. Developed for over a decade by the Brazilian studio Ilex Games, it has the unlucky distinction of releasing on the very same day as ultra-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which is bound to take all the oxygen out of the room among the gaming commentariat upon release.</p>
<p>This, however, is an interesting place to start. Samsara’s creators, according to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=g0Y6fvNzSMUiPwMh&amp;v=_39FhizV0Nc&amp;feature=youtu.be">developer podcast</a>, spent years being told by publishers to make their game “more like Hollow Knight.” They resisted calls for ultra-fluid, instant-response combat, opting to stick to their own vision of a platformer where fighting unfolds at a weightier and more deliberate pace.</p>
<p>The result is a surprisingly deep, beautifully rendered but <em>hard</em> indie that draws inspiration from the original <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-prince-of-persia-games-of-all-time-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Prince of Persia</a></strong> titles and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, while paying homage to the archetypal spirit of Warren Robinett’s 1980 classic, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a>, for the Atari 2600 (playable on Switch via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a>). Samsara, though, is not a remake, a sequel, or revival of the latter title – it’s very much its own thing.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158453/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsara unfolds in a universe that deliberately collides with Atari’s original Adventure, in a setting where dragons roam and high technology mistaken for magic is scattered across 10 distinct biomes, which consist of everything from frozen medieval wastelands and dread-infused cloning labs to dense subterranean green spaces teeming with giant insects.</p>
<p>You control a nameless champion resurrected as a vessel of solar power tasked with restoring balance to the multiverse with the help of fractured communities known as the Orphics. They aim to end the rule of Necromancers who seek to end the cycle of death and rebirth — the concept behind the Sanskrit word <em>samsara</em> — in pursuit of immortality.</p>
<p>Core mechanics centre on sword-and-shield combat with a timing-based parry system, supplemented by spells, ranged weapons like the bowgun, and a slow but high-damage hammer. There are also unique tools used to open up environmental traversal, which see you use solar energy to blast away thorny obstacles and restore ruined platforms.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158454/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Metroid influence is clear in both the world design and sci-fi presentation, particularly the armour and visor-like UI, from which you can customise your build by slotting different discoverable items into a gauntlet to shape your playstyle, whether by favouring raw damage, defensive resilience, and healing, or decreasing the cost of spellcasting.</p>
<p>Each of the three weapons carries its own upgrade tree, allowing enhancements like faster charge times for heavy attacks, stronger base damage, or added defensive perks. In combat, you can switch between these weapons on the fly to adapt to the situation, with the bowgun being particularly useful for targeting enemies from afar while avoiding combat damage.</p>
<p>Samsara’s combat has a lot in common with the Souls-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>, which also leans on deliberate and weighty combat, pattern recognition (especially during colossal boss fights), and spellcasting. Once an attack animation begins, you’re locked in, unable to cancel or heal until it resolves. Likewise, precise timing is key to triggering powerful counterattacks when parrying.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158458/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat encounters thus play out like methodical duels. However, given the genre’s emphasis on backtracking, low-level encounters soon begin to feel repetitive. Pair that with parkour-style platforming that isn’t immediately intuitive and knockback from enemies that can easily send you falling into a pit with the loss of a big chunk of health, and frustration is inevitable.</p>
<p>Another quirk is that when jumping to strike a fast-moving aerial enemy, colliding with them by mistake often results in being knocked backwards into another foe, triggering a 'ping-pong' chain of collisions that drains health rapidly. This issue is especially pronounced in tight spaces with multiple enemies out to eviscerate you; positioning becomes quite unforgiving.</p>
<p>Fumbling attacks on even a minor foe can result in taking steep damage. You have elixirs for healing, which can be upgraded, but taking them effectively requires standing still to avoid any simultaneous inputs, and taking a hit mid-use cancels the recovery, leaving health partially restored. The system’s rigidity adds difficulty and feels punishing, especially during frenetic boss fights.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158459/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But, after several hours, I gradually adapted to the rhythm of combat and what the game’s systems demanded — patience, timing, and a careful awareness of spacing — and began to enjoy myself as I manoeuvred with greater confidence. The game also shifts between relentless combat gauntlets to more exploration-driven areas that provided a welcome change of pace.</p>
<p>Boss battles are among the game’s standout moments, with each prefaced by a brief, pixel-art cutscene that heightens the atmosphere as you face colossal foes that initially feel insurmountable. Success comes not from frantic button-mashing but from learning the 'dance' – carefully studying attack patterns, dodging strikes, and parrying with deliberate timing.</p>
<p>Toppling a hulking adversary delivers a rush of satisfaction, just be prepared to try, try, try again. It can easily take 15-20+ hours to get through Samsara’s campaign, but that number will vary based on skill. Still, there are heaps of hard-to-access collectibles used to upgrade and customise your build, as well as secrets to uncover, so completionists will be kept busy.</p>
<figure><a title="Adventure of Samsara Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158455/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The score leans into sombre, atmospheric textures that echo both mystery and melancholy. Boss fights feature epic symphonics, while most traversal plays out over minimalist ambience and your own footsteps. Samsara’s lore is likewise Souls-esque, with storytelling established through myths, rumours, and accounts offered by the Orphic villagers.</p>
<p>Samsara’s ties to Atari’s top-down 1980 classic are largely superficial. There are nods to the original – differently colored dragons that randomly spawn across the map, bats that swoop in to steal items, lots of keys, and scattered references that serve as Easter Eggs. Beyond these callbacks, though, Samsara is essentially a new IP with a few scattered winks to the past.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, the game ran well without any noticeable FPS drops in docked and handheld modes on both the Switch 2 and the base Switch model. I experienced one instance where the game crashed without auto-saving my progress, and another minor bug that occurred after backtracking to a save point after a boss fight instead of progressing forward as intended.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the game auto-saved after I won the fight, saving me from repeating the encounter. These are wrinkles that need to be ironed out in further updates, but they were far from game-breaking. For Metroidvania and retro enthusiasts who thrive on challenge, Samsara has a lot going for it. But, at present, it risks feeling cumbersome and too rich for the blood of more casual players.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For players with a taste for retro sensibilities — deliberate controls, punishing difficulty, and trial-and-error enemy encounters — Adventure of Samsara offers grit and satisfaction with its varied biomes, parkour traversal, and epic boss encounters that reward patience and mastery.</p>
<p>Yet the experience, at least until you get to grips with its control scheme, feels more hindered than helped by rigid inputs, cheap deaths, and difficulty spikes that can wear you down.</p></section>

Before you get started with your journey in one of the game's randomly-generated maps, you'll want to ensure you're using the optimal settings on PC.</p><p>The video settings especially need to be tuned, as Prologue: Go Wayback's performance can be slightly dodgy unless you have a top-of-the-line machine.

If you're someone with a modern PC and seeing an FPS over 100, then you use the settings above to increase performance while also keeping solid visuals in place. However, players who aren't getting above 60 FPS will want to tone down some or all of the settings to their lowest values to achieve a higher FPS.</p><h3 id="Sound_Settings">Sound Settings</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4558698-prologuescreenshot2025.08.28-23.22.55.01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558698" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4558698-prologuescreenshot2025.08.28-23.22.55.01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558698"></a><figcaption>The Sound settings in Prologue: Go Wayback</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4558698-prologuescreenshot2025.08.28-23.22.55.01.png"></figure><ul><li>Master Volume: 100%</li><li>Game Volume: 100%</li><li>Mute Audio: No</li></ul><p>The sounds in Go Wayback are great and allow you to immerse yourself in the experience even more, so we're choosing to keep the audio at its maximum levels.

We moved our sensitivity down slightly from the default setting and increased the FOV to 120 for a more immersive view.

<p>'Radiant Starlets' is targeting Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you've ever played <strong>Mega Man</strong> and thought <em>"hmm, this is great, but what if I could hook up with the Robot Masters?"</em>, then you're in luck. <strong>Radiant Starlets</strong> is a new title from developer Buster X Buster, and it's looking to combine that classic side-scrolling action gameplay with some intriguing dating sim elements.</p>
<p>The game is targeting a release on the Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/busterxbuster/radiant-starlets">Kickstarter campaign</a> now live with 28 days remaining at the time of writing. The developers are looking for a total of CA$ 100,000, which roughly converts to just under £50,000, but a whole bunch of stretch goals have also been detailed should funding surpass expectations. These include a Boss Rush Mode, hard difficulty setting, a secret extra date, and more.</p>
<p>So essentially, you'll be able to choose which 'Starlet' you want to pursue from eight main stages. When you eventually encounter a Starlet, you'll have the choice to either fight them or date them. If you choose the latter, you'll need to complete a minigame unique to each character. Successfully doing so will then essentially recruit the Starlet to accompany you on further playthroughs, introducing fresh power ups and unique endings.</p>
<p>With some beautiful HD2D-inspired visuals, this one is looking really cool. We'll definitely keep a close eye on the Kickstarter campaign over the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Traverse Challenging Environments:</strong> Play 8 main stages and face against <strong>Starlet Overdrive,</strong> a world-famous S-Pop group bent on obtaining Dream for themselves.<br>
- <strong>Per-Relationship Speed-runs:</strong> Each partner provides a separate speed run and endings. With Radiant Starlets, you're encouraged to try every boss order. Replay to experience each partner’s armor set, minigame, and story.<br>
- <strong>Partner Specific Mini Games:</strong> Each partner has a custom mini game, designed to unlock partner-specific power-ups and narrative.<br>
- <strong>Armor Designed by your Partner:</strong> Each partner playthrough will have a custom armor set with unique properties, creating variances in gameplay between runs.<br>
- <strong>Custom Partner Charge Shot:</strong> Each partner provides you with a <strong>custom charge shot that you blast!<br>
-</strong> <strong>Get power ups from each boss:</strong> The Starlets have all modified Dream's power source to power their equipment. When he retrieves them he will get a part of their powers.<br>
- <strong>Endings for Each Romantic Partner:</strong> Each Romantic partner provides narrative changes and their own distinct ending.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

			<p>The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/">Variety</a>.</p>



<p>This is the same series that was announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/">May 2024</a> with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe </a>that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team,</em>" Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "<em>It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…</em>"</p>



<p>For Turner's part, she added that she is "<em>thrilled beyond measure</em>" to be stepping into the role. "<em>She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.</em>"</p>



<p>It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs-tomb-raider-unaffected/">confirmed layoffs last week</a>, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "<em>unaffected</em>," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>True believers, the official <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> has been announced. Alongside its upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exclusive-mtg-spider-man-spoilers-card-reveals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>MTG Spider-Man</em></a> set, Wizards of the Coast have announced several drops of cards featuring the wisecracking wallcrawler.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spider-Man Secret Lair</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/feature/secret-lair-spider-man-superdrop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the Spider-Man Secret Lair will be a Superdrop containing six drops of cards. These drops will feature classic Magic cards reimagined in the style of Marvel's iconic superhero.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=g4hRCsl8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-secret-lair-daily-bugle-promo-artwork.jpg?itok=SXukhCeR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Wizards of the Coast are being secretive about the contents of these drops. The post contains an early scoop of one of those drops, titled <em>Secret Lair x Spider-Man: Daily Bugle Breaking News</em>. As for the other five drops, they are mum at this time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the cards in the <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop are visually striking. As the name implies, it reimagines the cards as front page stories from the Daily Bugle, complete with a front-page photo, headline, and mana cost where the newspaper cost should be. The artwork is striking, featuring Spidey and other iconic characters like Miles Morales, The Green Goblin, and the Rhino.</p>

<p>The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will contain the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Fact or Fiction</em></li>
	<li><em>Frantic Search</em></li>
	<li><em>Scheming Symmetry</em></li>
	<li><em>Blasphemous Act</em></li>
	<li><em>Impact Tremors</em></li>
</ul><p>This isn't the first time a Marvel character has arrived in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. Earlier this year, the fourth-wall-breaking merc with a mouth, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deadpool-secret-lair-brings-merc-with-mouth-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadpool</a>, got the Secret Lair treatment.</p>

<p>As for how much mileage Wizards of the Coast can get out of Spider-Man, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">the previews</a> of the upcoming Magic set have shown that nothing is off the table. <em>Spider-Man</em> villains like Venom and Prowler. <em>Spider-Man</em> supporting characters like Black Cat. Spider-Man memes. It's all free game. The question is how well will it be done.</p>

<p>The Spider-Man Secret Lair Superdrop will be available September 22. The <em>Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop will be available in non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $39.99)</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-playstation-game-is-now-the-best-selling-game-on-xbox.1287924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you ever doubted the “console wars” were over, here’s a new piece of data to consider: <em>Helldivers 2</em>, formerly console exclusive to Sony’s PS5, is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ps5-console-exclusive-helldivers-2-now-tops-xbox-sales-chart-as-sony-continues-to-dabble-with-its-multi-platform-strategy">the best-selling title on Xbox</a>. In fact, it’s the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/helldivers-2-first-third-xbox-best-selling-games-chart/">first <em>and third</em> best-selling game</a>, if you count its more premium edition, and it’s currently the ninth-most played game on the platform — mostly beaten by free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox </em>but also <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>GTA V</em>.</p><div><p>It doesn’t surprise me that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is popular on Xbox, because it was a huge hit on PS5 and PC. Last May, Sony revealed that <em>Helldivers 2</em> had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">become PlayStation’s fastest-selling game of all time</a> with 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, and it <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics/status/1961422671381504312">may have now crossed 18 million</a> after reportedly racking up <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">nearly a million on Xbox</a> in its first week on sale.</p></div><p>No, what’s surprising is that we now live in an era where companies like Sony and Microsoft no longer entirely see their hit games as a way to get players to buy their own consoles, and instead just want to sell as many copies of these games as they can. Back in May, we wrote about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">the top three games on PlayStation came from Microsoft</a>, and now it’s reciprocal!</p><div><p>Sony has come around to this position slowly, but by 2022, it planned for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/26/23142569/sony-playstation-pc-mobile-game-releases-first-party-portfolio">roughly half of its games to come out on PC or mobile</a> instead of just console, and though PlayStation game boss Hermen Hulst suggested in 2024 that some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167560/sony-thinks-its-pc-games-will-tempt-you-to-buy-a-playstation-really">Sony’s big single-player games might be held in reserve</a>, the company revealed this August that it’s gradually <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1953483758667170146">“moving away from a hardware centric business model</a>.” It’s about selling games, not consoles.</p></div><p>Here’s where some of you will no doubt point out: is <em>Helldivers 2</em> actually a PlayStation game? Since PlayStation is merely the publisher and doesn’t own its developer Arrowhead Game Studios, is it really such a big deal?</p><p>I would say yes, because Sony has been the one in control, the one making the strategic decisions over when and where and how much PlayStation goodness to share. When players balked at how <em>Helldivers 2</em> originally required you to log in with a PlayStation account on PC, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">it was out of Arrowhead’s hands</a>. When players wanted an Xbox version, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead said it was entirely up to Sony</a>.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t have to cut such publishing deals to bring Xbox’s biggest games to PlayStation, though. When it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date">chose to bring <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory"><em>Hellblade 2</em> to PS5</a>, it could do so because it owns both giant publisher / developer Bethesda and developer Ninja Theory itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">What is an Xbox</a>, and what is a PlayStation, if not <em>the</em> place to play specific games? Is it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">a launcher and a set of familiar controls</a>? Is it a feeling? That’s the challenge facing Microsoft and Sony if they continue down this road.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox#comments">1<!-- --> <!-- -->Comment</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/770311/playstation-game-helldivers-2-best-selling-game-on-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a> is launching soon on a new platform. No, the popular superhero online PVP shooter isn’t coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Instead, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290">NetEase</a> has quietly announced that <em>Rivals</em> is getting a PS4 port. I can already imagine how loud an old PS4 will sound when Doctor Strange creates a portal.</p> <p>On September 3, <a href="https://youtu.be/67FVMNGMFXU">NetEase released a new trailer</a> for the upcoming fourth season of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, “Heart of the Dragon.” The new season arrives on September 12 and brings Daredevil to the game’s already large roster. However, at the very end of this slick, action-packed story trailer, NetEase included a bit of news.<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1963275058534600760"> Seen briefly in the final moments of the trailer</a> is the logo for the PlayStation 4. It seems the online superhero game is getting a last-gen port.</p>  <p><a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1962496976731214040">Word of this PS4 port first appeared earlier this week</a>, with dataminers finding evidence on the PlayStation Store’s back end of a new PS4 version of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Today’s new teaser seems to confirm that, yes, NetEase is porting its blockbuster superhero game to the aging PS4. Sony’s old home console launched back in November 2013, nearly 12 years ago. And yet, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> will soon be playable on the old hardware. Some fans are confused as to why <em>Rivals</em> is making the backward leap to PS4 while it still lacks a Switch 2 port. It would seem logical that if <em>Rivals</em> can run on PS4, it can likely run on a Switch 2. <a href="https://gamerant.com/marvel-rivals-switch-2/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20game%20director%20Guangyun%20Chen%20stated%20that%20NetEase%20is%20still%20in%20the%20process%20of%20obtaining%20a%20Switch%202%20development%20kit%20from%20Nintendo">Perhaps a lack of</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055">dev kits is to blame</a>?</p> <p>Regardless of all that, it is extremely wild to me that <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is launching on PS4 in 2025. This is a console that launched during the tail end of the first phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is a machine that arrived when Barack Obama was still president of the United States. And soon you’ll be able to play <em>Marvel Rivals</em> on it. Sure, it’s not the first time we’ve seen a current-gen game go backwards with a PS4 port. But it is still odd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Prime Video’s Tomb Raider series has finally confirmed it’s Lara Croft: Game of Thrones’ Sophie Turner. Even more so, the show now has a new co-showrunner and a shooting date of 2026.</p>



<p>The live-action adaptation of the iconic Tomb Raider series has been in the works at Prime Video since last year. Bringing on Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge as creator, writer, and executive producer, the show would continue on Fallout’s smashing success. Still, you can’t have Tomb Raider without Lara Croft and, luckily, we’ve got a good one.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-cast-as-lara-croft-shooting-in-january-2026">Game of Thrones’ Sophie Turner Cast as Lara Croft, Shooting in January 2026</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Sophie Turner set to star as Lara Croft in upcoming Tomb Raider series from Amazon MGM Studios.</p><p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge serves as creator, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p><p>Jonathan Van Tulleken set as director and executive producer and Chad Hodge joins as… <a href="https://t.co/m7aaaZH9Sk">pic.twitter.com/m7aaaZH9Sk</a></p></div>— Amazon MGM Studios (@AmazonMGMStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmazonMGMStudio/status/1963285883374743661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>First <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported by Variety</a>, Sophie Turner, famous for her portrayal of Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones, will spearhead Tomb Raider as protagonist Lara Croft. The 29-year-old English actress was rumored to be in the running last year, but had yet to be confirmed by Amazon MGM Studios until now. In a quote <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series-filming-2026-sophie-turner-1236506192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Variety</a>, Turner stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I am thrilled beyond measure, to be playing Lara Croft,” Turner said to Variety. “She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina [Jolie] and Alicia [Vikander] with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to Turner’s casting, Shogun’s Jonathan Van Tulleken, who’s also working with Prime Video on Blade Runner 2099, is set to direct and executive produce. Joining Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the writer’s room is The Darkest Minds’ Chad Hodge, who’ll showrun and executive produce. Fortunately, we won’t have to wait long for more news, as Prime Video’s Tomb Raider starts filming on January 19th, 2026. </p>



<p>Tomb Raider has had a long line of adaptations since 1997. Academy-winning Angelina Jolie took on the British adventurer in the 2000s, making her a household name. In 2016, another Academy-winning actress, Alicia Vikander, played Lara Croft in an adaptation of the 2013 reboot. While we don’t know what version Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft will be, it’s sure to be one to treasure.</p>

<p>Version 1.9.8 <a href="https://claphanz.com/en/news/nintendo_switch_easy_come_easy_golf_ver198_update.html">arrived earlier today</a> and includes a caddy's worth of improvements for load times, grid display, and 1080p support for the larger Switch 2 screen.</p>
<p>Plus the game, which ran at 30fps on the original Switch back when we reviewed it in 2022, will now let you choos between a 30 and 60fps mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tiuvqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The timing of this update is a little curious, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/everybodys_golf_hot_shots">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, a brand new game in the Everybody's Golf series, comes out on Switch on 5th September (4th in Japan). We've even got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/everybodys-golf-hot-shots">a review up for that today</a>. Is Clap Hanz taking a Hot Shot at Hot Shots...? (Please don't give us a Double Bogie).</p>
<p>Anyway, here are the patch notes straight from Clap Hanz's website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ver. 1.9.8 of "Easy Come Easy Golf" was released.<br>
The content of the latest update is listed below.<br>
- Improved load times<br>
- Improved grid display<br>
- Reorganized home screen menu into a single page<br>
- Adjusted Triple Tap spin input<br>
- Improved Triple Tap gauge UI<br>
- Frame rate selection (30fps/60fps)<br>
You can also play at 60fps on Switch 2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you fancy a shot at Easy Come Easy Golf, then we rather enjoyed it back when it released on Switch, scoring it an 8/10. Now with smoother performance and an updated resolution for Switch 2, there's no better time to try it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-ps4-release-date-season-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marvel Rivals is currently only available on the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, but as of next week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-marvel-go-ahead-to-make-original-marve-rivals-characters-director-says-stay-tuned/">NetEase</a> has announced that it'll drop onto last-gen consoles with its arrival on PS4 alongside the release of the game's Season 4: The Heart of the Dragon on September 12, 2025.</p>



<p>The confirmation comes with a new cinematic trailer for Season 4, which lists the PS4 alongside the rest of its platforms at the end of the trailer. Unfortunately for Xbox One players, they're currently left out of the fun, though that could change with a similarly surprising announcement in a future Marvel Rivals update. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Rivals has been one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">most popular games this year</a> after its arrival in December 2024, and its arrival on PS4 could potentially see another peak to its popularity that just wasn't possible on current-gen only consoles, especially when considering the fact that it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nearly-five-years-into-the-ps5-generation-there-are-more-players-on-ps5-monthly-than-ps4-sony-confirms/">only this past June</a> when Sony was able to confirm that there were more PS5 players active on a monthly basis than PS4 players. Even major games like Genshin Impact are <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">only starting to wind down their PS4 support now</a>.</p>



<p>The PS4 may be a last-gen console, but there are still millions of players who, for one reason or another, have not yet upgraded to a PS5 or Xbox Series console and jumped into the current-gen. </p>

Below, we'll list out the best early upgrades we think you should go with to feel confident in taking on the challenges ahead.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_to_know_about_upgrade_materials_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">What to know about upgrade materials in Cronos: The New Dawn</a></li><li><a href="#Best_upgrades_to_buy_first_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">Best upgrades to buy first in Cronos: The New Dawn</a><ul><li><a href="#Temporal_Shell___Inventory_Slots_and_Suit_Integrity">Temporal Shell - Inventory Slots and Suit Integrity</a></li><li><a href="#Sword_MK_1615__Handgun____Stability_and_Charge_Speed">Sword MK-1615 (Handgun) - Stability and Charge Speed</a></li><li><a href="#Hammer_PROV_2030__Shotgun____Firepower_and_Charge_Speed">Hammer PROV-2030 (Shotgun) - Firepower and Charge Speed</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="What_to_know_about_upgrade_materials_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">What to know about upgrade materials in Cronos: The New Dawn</h2><p>There are two types of upgrade materials: Energy and Cores.</p><p>Energy is used to upgrade your weapons. It's plentiful throughout the game, usually sitting on shelves or other places where you might find items, though it will also sometimes drop from defeated enemies.</p><p>Cores, meanwhile, are used to level up your suit (health and inventory space), as well as your Torch Fuel and Pyre items. These are rare and typically found by seeking out optional paths--such as through chainlocked doors--or by petting cats that are hiding in the world.</p><h2 id="Best_upgrades_to_buy_first_in_Cronos__The_New_Dawn">Best upgrades to buy first in Cronos: The New Dawn</h2><p>Here are the best upgrades to focus on first in Cronos: The New Dawn.</p><h3 id="Temporal_Shell___Inventory_Slots_and_Suit_Integrity">Temporal Shell - Inventory Slots and Suit Integrity</h3><p>Cronos: The New Dawn is very stingy with inventory space, so managing it properly can be a very stressful experience. Is it worth dropping some much-needed ammo to carry a vintage item you found that can be sold back in a safe room for a big chunk of Energy? Should you carry more healing items, or bring along the bolt cutters you found a bit ago that can help you open chainlocked doors?</p><p>It's a lot to think about, but it can be made much easier by investing in Inventory Slot upgrades early so that you can carry some extra items. However, you'll also need to worry about your health, especially in the opening hours when you're coming to grips with how the game plays and may be making more mistakes. As such, it's a good idea to use some Cores to upgrade your Suit Integrity early on, too.</p><p>So, how do you decide which to upgrade? Your best bet in the first half of the game is to switch between the two each time you have enough Cores for an upgrade. Once you fill in the fourth Suit Integrity slot and have your health to 200, you should probably go all-in on Inventory Slots until it's maxed out. The back half of the game is overflowing with stuff to pick up, as well as additional weapons that you'll want to bring with you, so you'll be thankful to have more space for them all.</p><h3 id="Sword_MK_1615__Handgun____Stability_and_Charge_Speed">Sword MK-1615 (Handgun) - Stability and Charge Speed</h3><p>You may be inclined to start with Firepower upgrades for the Sword MK-1615, but since most normal enemies will take between 1-3 headshots from this handgun either way, upgrading its damage is less important than with the shotgun (as we'll discuss below). Besides, more damage is irrelevant if your bullets don't hit their target, meaning your best bet is usually going to be to toss at least a few upgrades into Stability. This will reduce the wobbly aiming and make it easier to re-center after taking shots.</p><p>Speaking of taking shots with the handgun, you'll want to make sure you're charging each shot you take to do maximum damage. So, investing into Charge Speed can make a huge difference when enemies are closing in on you rapidly, allowing you to get your shots out quicker and reposition when needed.</p><h3 id="Hammer_PROV_2030__Shotgun____Firepower_and_Charge_Speed">Hammer PROV-2030 (Shotgun) - Firepower and Charge Speed</h3><p>The shotgun is your true heavy hitter throughout much of the game. Unlike the handgun, which benefits less from Firepower, you'll want to pump up the shotgun's Firepower stat as much as possible. This makes it an immensely deadly weapon against bosses, as well as well as a useful tool for herding enemies into a group and downing them all with a single blast.</p><p>Because you'll be using this against difficult bosses and hordes of foes, it's also imperative that you level up its Charge Speed as much as possible. Even with points invested, it can take quite a while to charge up, but every little bit of time saved is still time you're not vulnerable to enemy attacks.</p>
