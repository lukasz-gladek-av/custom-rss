            <p>Chaotic poker-themed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> quickly captured hearts and frazzled minds when it released earlier this year. However, nowhere in Katharine’s (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">review</a> does it address the one eternal issue: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/can-it-run-doom">can it run Doom</a>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yes, according to reddit user UwUDev, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1eby5y7/literally_nobody_asked_for_it_but_here_it_is_doom/">shared their prototype</a> for how the seminal FPS could be played within the confines of a comedy poker game. The answer, apparently, is to just turn a big pile of Joker cards into portions of a video screen. A simple solution, though one that quickly caught the <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1816567788078870924">approving attention</a> of Balatro dev LocalThunk.</p>
<p>Thus spake UwUDev: "It's super laggy and I often have big lag spikes but it works. I'll see later if I can optimize it because it's really unplayable x)". Wait, if the creator says it’s unplayable then can we truly say Doom is running? Is this a 'minimum 30fps or jog on' situation or do we lower our standards considering someone got it working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-can-now-run-on-a-jailbroken-tractor">jailbroken tractor</a>?</p>
<p>After some initial umming, I think I’d fall into the "lower our standards" camp – surely Doom does not need to actually be <em>comfortable</em> to play for official Can It Run Doom certification, as long as it merely runs. But then this Balatro mod stretches the definition of "runs" as it so heavily manipulates and reshapes the game’s systems that it arguably no longer even resembles the original; at least the tractor screen was intended as a screen. I don’t think Balatro cards were ever meant to be vessels of video output, even if it is fun how shuffling them around also moves the corresponding window of Doom footage.</p>
<p>Then, of course, you get into arguments over whether the wacky device needs to simply <em>display</em> Doom, or to handle the actual processing for it, and honestly at this point I think the fun just stops. Maybe this post should as well, so just go look at the <a href="https://itrunsdoom.tumblr.com/">It Runs Doom! Tumblr</a>.</p>

            <p>I keep seeing those adverts for that Ray-Ban and Meta collaboration, where like, they're smart glasses that let you browse the web with your eyes? Anyway, yeah, they don't appeal to me at all. Not as much as "Dateviator" glasses, which come courtesy of Sassy Chap Games and their upcoming dating sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/date-everything!">Date Everything!</a> As the title suggests: you date everything, from kitchen sponges to lampshades, as they morph into absolute fitties once you've donned the special specs. It looks incredibly dumb but in the best possible way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In what's been coined as a "sandbox" dating simulator, the game sees you explore a home from a first-person perspective and don the Dateviator glasses to chat up everyday objects. We're talking hoovers, cabinets, toasters, fridges - pop those glasses on and anything becomes 10/10 shaggable. While there's not much info on exactly why or how or who or what is going on, the devs do say there's a "critical path tying it all together", with all dateable objects having three "relationship resolutions": Love, Friend, or Hate. Imagine leaning in for a kiss with a nail clipper and getting pied. Unthinkable.</p>

<p>There are other tidbits of info, like there being 100 fully voiced dateable characters (things?) all voiced by strong voice actors from all sorts of games like Final Fantasy XV, Persona 5, HiFi Rush and more. Not to mention that the game will cater for a "wide array of player preferences and tastes", so everyone can get involved in… whatever this game is.</p>
<p>It has got me thinking, though. What household object in my home would I date? My coaster? My laptop sleeve? Truthfully, I think it would be my Sonic The Hedgehog lamp that isn't actually of the character Sonic, but just the words "Sonic The Hedgehog". Dear reader, what household object would you date? I am sure I won't regret asking you such a thing.</p>
<p>There isn't a release date yet, but you can follow the game over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/">Steam</a> if you're curious.</p>

Coral Island developer Stairway Games has responded to the lack of Switch port, blaming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/humble-games-confirms-restructuring-amid-reports-all-staff-have-been-laid-off">recent layoffs at Humble Games</a> for leaving console versions "in a place of uncertainty".

</p>
<p>
The cosy life-sim game received over $1.6m in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coralisland/coral-island-reimagining-the-farm-sim-game/faqs">Kickstarter funding</a>. However, some backers who specifically backed the game for a Switch version are angry at the lack of news for a port. Other backers have claimed requests for PS4 keys have been automatically upgraded to PS5 without consent.
</p>
<p>
At present, the game is available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (plus Game Pass), but not Switch.

<p>
Comments from backers have been shared on social media, describing the situation as "super gross". "At this point, I just want my money back," wrote one backer. "I can't get what I paid for, so I'd like to be refunded."
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coral Island made $1M from kickstarter campaign which included Switch players. There is still no Switch version of the game and these backers are not being offered alternative keys. Essentially being ghosted after they helped fund the game. Why is no one talking about this? <a href="https://t.co/mmeCih248z">https://t.co/mmeCih248z</a></p>— Jupie ✨ (@jupieverse) <a href="https://twitter.com/jupieverse/status/1816135472323641831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Now, Stairway Games has released a statement addressing the situation, claiming "the impact of Humble Games' restructuring on Coral Island remains uncertain for all things related to consoles... as they are responsible for these platforms".
</p>
<p>
"To start, we share in your frustrations regarding the lack of a Nintendo Switch port of Coral Island," the statement reads. "Over the years, there's a lot we've wanted to say in the spirit of transparency, about many different things, but continue to be unable to do so because of the publishing agreement and NDA we have in place.
</p>
<p>
"The impact of Humble Games' restructuring on Coral Island remains uncertain for all things related to consoles, whether porting or pushing hotfixes, as they are responsible for these platforms. We've been in communication with our lawyer since we found out about the restructuring on social media to figure out how to navigate this new situation.
</p>
<p>
"For example, we have an upcoming hotfix for the 1.1 update nearing release for Steam. We have no idea how to get this update out to other platform players as we don't have the backend permission on console platforms to push updates out. We only have access to the Steam backend."
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
As a result, Switch backers are now being offered a key change to Steam, effective immediately, by emailing the developer: contact@stairwaygames.com. However, this doesn't account for the fact some backers may not have a suitable PC to play the game.
</p>
<p>
"We'll keep you posted on developments once we have more information," the statement concludes. "We know it fucking sucks but we hope you understand."
</p>
<p>
It should be noted, though, the Humble Games layoffs occurred just earlier this week. The Coral Island Kickstarter was launched in 2021 and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tropical-island-farming-sim-coral-island-leaves-pc-early-access-in-november">game released out of early access in November 2023</a>.

</p>
<p>
Until now, the only comment for Switch backers on Kickstarter was: "We're still in the game development process and going strong. We don't have any updates to share yet, but we'll keep you informed as soon as we have more to share."
</p>
<p>
The tropical island farming sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tropical-farming-kickstarter-success-coral-island-now-in-early-access">launched into early access in October 2022</a> after its successful Kickstarter campaign. Since then, it's received plenty of updates adding new content, including its 1.1 "Story Finale: Land &amp; Sea" update this week.

</p>
<p>
It's considered a major competitor to Stardew Valley, whose solo developer earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">stated he would "never" charge money for a DLC or update</a> "for as long as I live".

Sony had said it would mainly affect the suspension physics model and tire physical calculation model, “resulting in much more natural weight shifting during cornering.” Tire response was also said to have been improved, along with more realistic tire heating and wear. “Look forward to more dynamic car movement and a further polished driving feel,” Ken Chan, senior product manager at Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/gran-turismo-7-update-1-49-brings-six-new-cars-updated-physics-simulation-model-and-more-on-july-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog post</a>.</p><p>But following the update's release, player discovered that cars had a tendency to bounce their way down the track, or even fly off as Gran Turismo 7's new physics model broke down. Take a look at this:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">コーヒーブレイクNO？？？<br>ドカ沸きするランエボを避けて走ろう！ <a href="https://t.co/PA42FbAUei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PA42FbAUei</a></p>— ハ イサイド齋藤 (@kosmic_gt) <a href="https://twitter.com/kosmic_gt/status/1816403404765483345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ついにミサイル発射出来るようになったんですね。<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GT7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GT7</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%84%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%A27?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#グランツーリスモ7</a> <a href="https://t.co/0qbcwBZcc7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0qbcwBZcc7</a></p>— 会長 (@y31ced) <a href="https://twitter.com/y31ced/status/1816412993145688455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GT7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GT7</a><br>リアルドライビングロケットシミュレーター <a href="https://t.co/1FhwzEnT8h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1FhwzEnT8h</a></p>— ぬえちゃんショッピング (@AIPhard_T0yota) <a href="https://twitter.com/AIPhard_T0yota/status/1816390459176243659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The update didn't just cause cars to bounce or fly, either.

		<div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>March 2020 seems a very long time ago, but it was start of probably the biggest world event any of us will live through. Billions of people were effectively forced to stay home for months at a time through the pandemic, and the impact of that event continues to this day as working from home is for many, normal. We have reconfigured our homes to have multiple functions, so as I type this, I’m at my desk which has three monitors, my work laptop, and my music studio PC, and my PS5 just off to the right. So, it would be damn handy if there was a sturdy chair that I could use both for work and gaming, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451520">To give you an idea of the size, here’s the C7 box next to another office chair purchased from Amazon.</p>
<p>The Flexispot C7 Air is an all-in-one solution to this problem, a premium office chair that also works if you want so slouch back and play some video games. Since the chair is packed full of features and very sturdy it comes in a rather large box and weighs 25kg, You do need to assemble it yourself, but it’s rally just a case of slotting a few things together and using the supplied tool to tighten a few bolts, it’s really quite simple. Even so, the weight and shape mean it’s best if you have a friend to give you a hand.</p>


<p>Once assembled there are plenty of features to adjust including the height, arm rests, and head support, but it’s the lumbar support that is star of the show. Flexispot have done some nifty engineering and the arc-shaped mesh support hinges from the bottom to always find the right place no matter what position you are in. This means you are always sitting in the correct position and fully supported and frankly it’s been a game changer for me and my back.</p>
<p>As soon as you sit down you can feel the gentle pressure of the cushion which pushes your back into the correct place no matter how you sit. Even if you slouch back or lean forward it adapts and Flexispot have taken all sorts of positions in to account – you can even sit cross-legged in the chair. That does seem like a bold claim but I can report that a 6ft5″ 120kg man (i.e. me) can do that, although I did have to use the attached foot rest to support my (humble brag) massive legs.<br>
</p>

<p>While you’ll likely be sitting up while working, the C7 can recline to what almost feels a dangerous angle – it’s not, I’ve tried to make the chair tip over without success. The lumbar support is still in full effect here, so even if you are technically slouching you are fully supported. It’s in this relaxed mode the chair is best for gaming, especially if you add the optional foot rest. I have played many a Destiny 2 marathon without a single ache or pain, but I think the best compliment I can give is that I fell asleep not once, but twice whilst in this position.</p>
<p>The chair is extremely well made and solid and while I can’t comment on the long term durability given the time I have been using the chair, I can tell you that back in 2021 I reviewed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/23/flexispot-e7-electric-standing-desk-review/">Flexispot E7 desk</a> and it’s still the desk I use today. I have not had a single issue with it and the C7 Air seems just as sturdy and durable. It’s also worth mentioning that the chair comes with a&nbsp; five year warranty just in case something does go wrong.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-451526">The C7 and proof that even giant, grumpy looking oafs can sit cross legged in it.</p>
<p>To use an old but accurate phrase, “You get what you pay for”. I have worn out countless £100-200 gaming chairs, with their foam padding and fake leather eventual degrading through basic use and, speaking from experience, leaving lots of bits of fabric across the carpet. The Flexispot C7 Air Chair is more expensive and usually retails for £399 but the company has regular sales – in fact there is one on now and you can grab it for <a href="https://flexispot.co.uk/premium-ergonomic-office-chair-c7-air.html">£299. </a> I know that’s still a lot of money, but it’s by no means the most <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/12/sihoo-doro-s300-chair-review/">expensive premium chair around</a>, and a good chair is an investment now that your back will thank you for a decade from now.</p>

		A good chair is like finding the love of your life, you didn't know you needed it until it arrives. The Flexispot C7 supports you without you even noticing and is quite happy for you to fall asleep in it's arms, if it could cook me dinner then I'd ditch the boyfriend.  	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206720/steam-game-demos-update-library-store-pages<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has introduced some changes to Steam that should make it easier to find and install playable game demos. In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191">new events blog post</a>, Steam said the “Great Steam Demo Update” was based on developer and player feedback, with new functionality that makes demos behave more like standalone games hosted on the platform.</p><p>For one, demos can now have a store page that’s completely separate from the main game, allowing developers to display demo-specific content like trailers, screenshots, and supported features. These pages will also display buttons to both install the demo and visit the main game’s store page, and allow players to leave demo-specific reviews.</p><p>And if a demo becomes available for a game that users have on their wishlists, or from a developer that they follow, those users can now be notified via email or mobile alerts. Demo listings can also now appear on the same lists and category pages as free games, such as the “New &amp; Trending” section of Steam’s homepage charts. Alongside free games, users may see demos appearing more frequently as Steam says it’s made “some changes to the thresholds” in order to “better balance them with paid products.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Free games and the newly supported gaming demo listings will appear more frequently in Steam’s charts.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Steam</cite></p></div><p>Other new features in this update include the ability to add demos to Steam libraries without immediately installing them, allowing demos to be installed even if the user already owns the full game, and making it easier to remove demos by right-clicking on them. When the demos are uninstalled they’ll also be removed from the user’s library.</p><p>The visibility changes introduced in this update may resurface older demos on user accounts, with Steam saying “We’ve tried our best to clean up the demos that we expect you don’t care about anymore, but we may have missed some.”</p><p>Amusingly, Steam added a note in the “<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563#:~:text=Q.%20What%20is%20the%20deal%20with%20the%20Demo%20icon%3F%20Is%20that%20a%20plate%3F%20A%20vinyl%20record%3F">infrequently asked questions</a>” section of the blog for users who don’t know that Steam’s demo icon is based upon the Compact Disc, not a dinner plate. Am I so old that we’re really at the point of modernizing the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/24/16505912/floppy-disk-3d-print-save-joke-meme">save icon / floppy disk</a> gag?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> games could be getting the remaster treatment. An attendee at San Diego Comic-Con was looking at a set of figures based on characters from the series when they saw that the plaque accompanying the figures was labelled with the words "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" alongside the logo for Crystal Dynamics. I suppose if you throw a coin enough times, one day it will land on the side with the head of a jawless vampire on it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>An image of the plaque was posted by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/">Resetera</a>. A reporter from Gamespot went over to the display cabinet to see for themselves, but the sign <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">had by then been removed</a>. There's not much more to go on than that. The QR code on the plaque takes you to a newsletter signup page for Dark Horse comics, which is probably connected to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-getting-a-canonical-prequel-graphic-novel-starring-everyones-favourite-jawless-monologuing-vampire">the prequel comic</a> subtitled "The Dead Shall Rise", coming soon from Dark Horse. </p>
<p>No remaster of the games has yet been announced by Crystal Dynamics themselves. Although the company's CEO Phil Rogers has previously said <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/legacy-of-kain-crystal-dynamics-says-it-hears-fans-loud-and-clear-after-100k-survey-responses/">in earnings calls</a> that they were putting out feelers to see if players would be interested in revisiting the dark realm of Nosgoth. The 25th anniversary of the first Soul Reaver game is also coming up in August. So it's possible the remasters might be sprung on fans to coincide with that. Or maybe that's wishful thinking.  </p>
<p>Whatever the plans, I know Nic will be pleased to see the scurrilous dimension-hopping vampires get a much-delayed facelift. Meanwhile, I only have vague memories of the Legacy of Kain series, and recall the opening cinematic of the first Soul Reaver better than any subsequent levels. That bit where Raziel gets <a href="https://youtu.be/4DOKzTHaPfM?feature=shared&amp;t=162">tossed into the very hot soup</a> and becomes all disfigured and skinny. He lies at the bottom of that green abyss for an eternity, untouched. Perhaps he's about to get up?</p>

            <p>
In a pleasantly surprising move, BioWare will launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> natively via Steam on PC, meaning there's no need to download and install the fussy EA App. 
</p>
<p>
What's more, the game will arrive verified for Steam Deck, so you can continue your quest to defend Thedas while on the bus, train or toilet. 
</p>
<p>
"There's a few more surprises in store for later this summer," BioWare's Michael Gamble <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1816514374670168113">teased</a> via social media platform X, sharing the news. "Here's the first from the DAV team."

<p>
Gamble is a familiar face on social media, though his day job is leading BioWare's Mass Effect team. Still, it's likely he's referring to further Dragon Age details, in the run up to BioWare's next project launching at some poin this autumn.
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the news of Dragon Age: The Veilguard launching native via Steam, games industry analyst Mat Piscatella said he believed the decision by EA would "lead to significant additional sales".
</p>
<p>
"The margin benefit of forcing people to use a proprietary PC marketplace just isn't worth the lost additional volume of not putting a game on Steam," he <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1816550005005824509">wrote</a> on X.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's long-awaited Dragon Age: The Veilguard still lacks a launch date, but is expected to arrive sometime this autumn for PC (via Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Our Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">got a good look at it recently and came away very impressed</a> - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-dragon-age-veilguard-does-kill-varric-it-will-be-long-overdue">we're worried for the safety of veteran fan-favourite character Varric</a>.

            <p>As of today, the The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called a strike of the Interactive Media Agreement - effectively, video game voice acting, motion capture work, and other roles, the full list of which can be found <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members">here</a>. The strike comes after over 18 months of negotiations with some of gaming’s largest companies - including Activision, EA, Insomniac, Take-Two, and WB Games - over AI protections.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Any game looking to employ SAG-AFTRA talent to perform covered work must sign on" to agreements <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">specified in a post</a> by the guild, “These agreements offer critical AI protections for members."</p>
<p>"We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," said president Fran Drescher. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>"The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games," said national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. "That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies."</p>
<p>"Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation," said Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh. "We will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve."</p>

</figure>
<p>The strike was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23885558/sag-aftra-strike-authorization-negotiation-video-game-voice-actors">voted for</a> in 2023, and marks the second of it’s type since 2016, where videogame actors at SAG-AFTRA went on strike for almost a year. This January, SAG-AFTRA struck a deal to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">allow AI voice replicas under licence</a> with company REPLICA, which drew criticism from several prominent actors who felt blindsided and betrayed by the development. "I would humbly consider myself one of the top voice actors working in games," wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deux Ex</a> actor Elias Toufexis. "From what I'm seeing, no one asked any of my peers either."</p>
<p>Last December, union ZeniMax Workers United <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-and-zenimax-union-reach-first-of-its-kind-agreement-over-usage-of-ai-tools-in-gamedev">came to a "first of its kind" agreement</a> with Microsoft over the usage of AI tools in game development. Per the agreement, ZeniMax will "provide notice to the union in cases where AI implementation may impact the work of union members," with the union able to bargain.</p>
<p>AI remains a hot button issue, to put it mildly, and undoubtedly a factor in the staggering number of layoffs across the industry over the past two years, as the sort of people who choose to involve themselves in art despite seemingly have nothing but contempt for both artists and the art itself jump on cost-cutting measures with avaricious glee.</p>
<p>This strike, at least, comes at the end of a week filled with heartening developments, with two large wall-to-wall unions formed under Microsoft by workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">at Blizzard</a>. If you want to find out whether a game you either play or are looking forward to playing is under the scope of the strike, you can search <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result">here</a>. If anyone harasses anyone over this, I will personally escort you to the nearest bin and seal the lid with hot glue. Don’t be a scab now.</p>

			<p>The two Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver games could get remastered in the future, judging from some pictures taken during this year's San Diego Comic-Con.</p>
<p>As shared on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/">ResetERA forums</a> by user Mama Robotnik, two statues depicting Cain and Raziel are being shown during the event with a Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered branding. The attached QR Code leads to a Dark Horse newsletter sign-up, so something is definitely brewing. Original developer Crystal Dynamics has yet to make any announcement, but with the branding being out, it's likely that one is not too far off in the future.</p>
<p>It has been a very long time since the release of any Legacy of Kain game. The final one, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-defiance-looks-incredible-with-reshade-ray-tracing/">Defiance</a>, was released back in 2003, bringing a close to both Kain and Raziel's stories and, apparently, the series as a whole. The game was supposed to be followed by the multiplayer title Nosgoth, which reached an open beta stage in early 2015 but was eventually canceled with the servers shutting down in 2016. Hopefully, the two remasters will pave the way for more remasters to offer modern players the chance to experience the entirety of the series and a new entry in what I personally consider one of the best gaming series of all time.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that its members have voted on a videogame strike after over a year and a half of negotiations with game developers and publishers.</p>
<p>24 of the 25 sticking points have been agreed upon. However, the remaining point is a big one: AI. SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.</em></p>
<p>National Executive Director &amp; Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland stated:</p>
<p><em>The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.</em></p>
<p>Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh added:</p>
<p><em>Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable A.I. protections, but rather flagrant exploitation. We refuse this paradigm – we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our Interim and Independent contracts, which provide A.I. transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve.</em></p>
<p>For its part, Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the main negotiation group that includes Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Llama Productions LLC, Take 2 Productions Inc., VoiceWorks Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.</em></p>
<p>While such strikes in the gaming industry aren't nearly as crippling as they are for movies or TV shows, they could still result in delays. The massively anticipated GTA 6 could be one of those games, according to a quick search in <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAG-AFTRA's videogame status database</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, let's hope an agreement can be reached shortly.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earth-defense-force-6">Earth Defense Force 6</a> players on Steam aren’t happy about having to sign into the Epic Games Store, it seems. The latest entry in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> ant-control shooter launched yesterday, and critics reckon it's a decent time. Still, it’s currently sitting at an angry red 'mostly negative' on Steam. In response, D3PUBLISHER have put out an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378?l=english">apology statement</a>, reassuring players that this third-party log in will only be required once.</p>

<p>"For this game, to enhance cross play and online functionality. Online play requires signing in to your Epic Games account. We apologize for the lack of advance notice," reads the statement. "Signing in to your Epic Games account is required the first time you play online. Usually, once you sign in for the first time, you will not need to sign in again." It then goes on to give helpful instructions for creating a free Epic account.</p> <figure>

</figure>
<p>That "lack of advance notice" part seems to be key. While the game’s Steam page has now been updated to show that the game requires an Epic Online Services account for online play, D3PUBLISHER neglected to inform players beforhand. Personally, I feel it’s worth everyone signing up for Epic anyway, because free things are nice, but it does seem like the sort of thing it would have been triflingly easy for the publisher to be transparent about instead of apologising after the fact.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean it's likely any less disheartening for the developers, however, and I do often wonder about the logistics of having two seperate user review categories on Steam so these kind of issues don't spill over into tarnishing the perception of a game's actual quality. Although, even typing this now, I can sense how utterly naive that probably sounds. No-one wants double the clown emojis. </p>
<p>This is the first title in the Earth Defense Force series to require such a third party login. It is not the first in the series to require that you kill an alarming number of big ants, however. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/earth-defense-force-5-review">I quite liked</a> Earth Defense Force 5 when I played it for review. "A thoroughly confident and largely successful game that seems solely designed for you and some mates to laugh with it, at it, and at yourselves until the frogs come home," wrote I. "It’s camp, sure, but as Susan Sontag put it, 'Oh no! The bugs, they’re everywhere! The frogs! They’re too big!'" I have since learned that quote was anachronistic, however. It was actually John Waters.</p>

			<p>In February 2022, Take-Two and Netflix <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-adaptation-in-the-works-at-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered</a> to create a live action film adaptation of the BioShock game franchise. Around six months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Francis Lawrence, the director of Hunger Games, Constantine, I Am Legend, Sparrow, and Slumberland, would be taking care of the project.</p>
<p>Later that year, Lawrence himself <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-has-ken-levine-involved-in-some-capacity-director-explains-what-makes-the-ip-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about what makes BioShock unique. He also confirmed that franchise creator Ken Levine would be involved in some capacity.</p>
<p>We haven't heard any further news about the BioShock film for a long while. Now, Variety has <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> some news that came out of San Diego Comic-Con 2024, where producer Rory Lee said in a panel:</p>
<p><em>The new regime has lowered the budgets, so we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view as opposed to a grander, big project.</em></p>
<p>That's all Lee had to share about the project, though he also confirmed that Francis Lawrence is still attached to direct. The thing is, the movie director also has many other movies to handle.</p>
<p>Production is currently ongoing for The Long Walk (an adaptation of the 1979 dystopian horror novel penned by Stephen King). The script of the long-awaited Constantine 2 is currently being written, as revealed at SDCC 2024, and I Am Legend 2 is being prepared as well. Moreover, Lawrence is also in talks to direct yet another The Hunger Games prequel titled Sunrise on the Reaping.</p>
<p>There's no word yet on when the BioShock movie will be produced, then, or even on the cast. Fans can't even take solace from any new games, as Cloud Chamber is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for its next installment, hinting that the release is still a few years off. There was, however, a recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-screenshot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> showing off the user interface and a ricochet gun.</p>

            <p>
This summer, Epic Games finally gets its wish when, thanks to new EU regulations, it's launching its own digital store on iOS and Android. And ahead of its arrival, the company has announced it's removing Fortnite and other Epic games from what it calls "rent collector" competing stores, "even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-s-new-game-strategy-for-mobile-stores">announcement post</a>, Epic first confirms developers selling games on its on its new mobile store will be subject to the same 12 percent fee seen on its PC digital storefront (zero percent if a developer uses a third-party payment system). It then reveals plans to pull its own games from some competing stores. More specifically, it says it'll be "ending distribution partnerships with mobile stores that serve as rent collectors without competing robustly and serving all developers fairly, even if those stores offer us a special deal for our own games."
</p>
<p>
It's also pulling Fortnite and its other titles from the Samsung Galaxy Store, in what it calls "protest of Samsung's anticompetitive decision to block side-loading by default" on its devices. Conversely, Epic says it's planning to brings its own mobile games to stores that "give all developers a great deal". One of these will be the <a href="https://altstore.io/">indie-focused AltStore</a>.

<p>
The reason for all this, it insists, is that "we want to do everything we can to support other stores that strive to bring all developers their own great deals." Of course, it probably also helps that by manoeuvring its games from major to minor competing stores, it's pretty much guaranteeing most Fortnite traffic on mobile will come through its own store, where it won't need to pay a cut on its revenue at all.
</p>
<p>
Epic has been battling to return to iOS ever since Fortnite was booted out of Apple's ecosystem in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">deliberately circumvented</a> contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within its Fortnite iOS app. Attempts to reverse Apple's decision through legal means have largely been unsuccessful in the US, with courts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">predominantly ruling in Apple's favour</a> as time has gone on. However, the EU's Digital Markets Act has now provided the Fortnite maker with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year">means of getting its foot back in the door</a> - in the EU at least.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store is set to launch on iOS in the EU and Android worldwide later this year. Epic has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">said</a> it'll be bringing Fortnite and its store to iOS in the UK in the "second half of 2025". That announcement might be a little premature, however, given there's still much to be determined around the UK's new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/guilty-gear-strive-producer-talks-lucy-from-cyberpunk-edgerunners-evo-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Guilty Gear Strive is now entering its fourth year of content updates, and despite now earning the reptutation as being the "old man" on the block, especially when put side-to-side with more recent releases like Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Mortal Kombat 1, Strive is still continuing on just as strong as ever.</p><p>Which brings us to Evo 2024, where Arc System Works made perhaps their biggest announcement involving Guilty Gear Strive to date: In addition to two returning characters, Dizzy and Venom, and one brand new character, Unika, they would also be adding their first guest character to the roster: Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners. I got a chance to catch up with Guilty Gear Strive Producer Ken Miyauchi to find out how this surprising collaboration came to be, along with getting some insight regarding Strive's future. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: We learned that Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners is going to be in Strive. Can you talk a little bit about how long this has been in the works and how this collaboration came around?</strong></p><p><strong>Ken Miyauchi, Guilty Gear Strive Producer: </strong>So yeah, we've tried to find who will be a good guest character for Guilty Gear Strive. And we've been doing this work since 2023, actually. And we've been talking to CD PROJEKT RED because our lead artist, Hidehiko Sakamura, is actually a big fan of The Witchers series. And we've been in talks with CD PROJEKT RED, and then there was several conversation going on and that kind of led to the decision to get Lucy from Cyberpunk Edgerunners.</p><p><strong>Now, I'm not opposed to the idea of Lucy, but Lucy's not the main character of Cyberpunk Edgerunners, David is. What made you want to go with Lucy instead of David?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So I cannot talk much about why because that might spoil what we are trying to do. But there is a reason we decided Lucy. Of course, I personally wanted to see David with Sandevistan, but yeah, so I can't talk about it right now, but I hope people will figure [it] out in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Is there any kind of collaboration happening between you and Studio Trigger who made the Cyberpunk Edgerunners anime? Are you working together with them to make Lucy happen in Strive?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Honestly, we've been in talks with CD PROJEKT RED directly, not through Trigger, but if there could be any kind of collaboration that we [would] be able to do with Trigger, I'd like to do [it]. But that's still not in [the] plan.</p><p><strong>Another thing that you guys announced, which is something that you've talked about in the past, is the 3-on-3 mode. Can you talk a little bit about what makes this mode different than something like Dragon Ball FighterZ or a Marvel vs Capcom?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So you'll eventually see the game mechanics explanation from our website or social post. So what makes the Team of 3 unique compared to the other games is that people will play at the same time, not just you controlling the character and doing the 1v1 in one screen. So I'm just going to explain the first layer of this game mechanic. The team will be formed with one main role and two assist roles, and the two assist roles will be able to select their skills to interact in the battle.</p><p><strong>Oh, interesting.</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>And of course, during the battle, the assist players can switch with main players or assist player can interact into the battle with their own character in certain condition. Well the game mechanics-wise in the open beta test, I think people will be able to find out in tutorial, there's a Team of 3 tutorial mode in open beta test. So I hope people will figure out how they can utilize the new game mechanics that's exclusive for team of 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>And then another character that I'm sure people are very excited for is Dizzy. Can you talk a little bit about how Dizzy is going to perform in this iteration of Guilty Gear? And specifically, I saw that she was Queen Dizzy, can you talk a little bit about what the significance of that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>I want to explain the details, but I'll keep it secret for now why she's called Queen Dizzy. I had the same question when I first received [the] Queen Dizzy name from Daisuke Ishiwatari. There's a interesting story going on and you if actually see the trailer, you might find some hint of why she's called Queen. But for more details I'd like to say please look forward to actual her arcade story mode.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a interesting story going on and you if actually see the trailer, you might find some hint of why she's called Queen. </p></div><p><strong>And then other characters that were announced were Venom and Unika, from the anime. I know they're probably early on development, but is there anything you can tell us about how those characters are going to play in Strive?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So yeah, Venom, and also Unika, I can't explain the details of how their battle styles are for now. I think Venom is going to be quite similar to how he played in the past series, but sort of like how we've been doing, [it won't be] exactly same as the past series. Because if you want to play his past series style, you can play for example Xrd or XX. At the same time there is certain type of [uniqueness] in what makes Venom, Venom. And we would like to keep that as his gameplay. Regarding Unika, anything that I talk about her is going to spoil the anime series. So I'm going to expect people to watch the anime and then also try to maybe bring up their own theory of how she's going to play in the game play and check her actual game style later.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Did you ever expect Strive to be going this strong for this long? It had a lot of entries at Evo this year.</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>Yeah. I'm actually very, very surprised to see that we've been getting [consistently] over 2000 [entrants], throughout all the years of Evo for now. And I'm really, really happy that communities are supporting our game. And it's achieved all because I think the Guilty Gear community is very enthusiastic and they keeps wanting to support the game, and really appreciate it, and I really want to pay back their support with Gear Guilty updates.</p><p><strong>Is there anything you can tell us, any kind of hints you can give us about what to expect mechanically from the updates that you're bringing to Season 4?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>In a Developer's Backyard just a month ago that I released, I kind of talked about what's coming in the next few months, which are the Battle Balance updates, the minor version, it's coming out at the end of this month. And also the major one is coming sometime... I don't remember when I said this, but I think it's around October, end of October timing. </p><p>But the minor updates is more of mainly targeted to those characters who have less chance of getting access to their potential. So more of, buffs to those characters. And also adjusting on some of the universal mechanics such as the burst meter gain and also the positive bonus kind of thing. And also we have some changes to Roman Canceling mechanics on some of the invincible moves. So those are coming in the next character balance update. And I think this update will sort of shake up some meta in the current competitive fighting scene and I hope people will look forward to it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Beyond new mechanics, is there any kind of intention of improving some of Strive's more, let's say, base level features? Are we ever going to get frame data in training mode? Are we ever going to get matchmaking that doesn't go through the lobby system? Anything like that in the works?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So those are updates that I've been always thinking that I want to accomplish, I mean, implement in some point. This is just from the producer perspective, I've been always talking about it with director. And we are always talking about when we'll be able to do this update. And currently we announced the new updates that's coming in next, which is the Team of 3, and the development on Team of 3 is going so hard right now. And once we release that, I think we'll be able to take our hands on those updates. So I'd like players to look forward to them, too.</p><p><strong>I apologize for this in advance because I feel like I ask you this every single time that I've talked to you, but insta-kills, fans love them. It's one of the things that I think fans love the most about the Guilty Gear series. What are the chances of them still making their way into Strive? And if it's something that you've thought about, are there any unique challenges involved with implementing insta-kills into Strive?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>So implementing instant kills is something that we would also like to do, and I do agree that it's some, how do I say, very, very unique mechanic that presents Guilty Gear. So we would like to make that happen sometime in the future. I can't tell when will that be possible because developing instant kill actually takes a lot of time. And also the character animations, emotions, which makes instant kills very, very unique and cool, will take a lot of time developing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Implementing Instant Kills is something that we would also like to do. </p></div><p>We try to make it unique because we animates them by frame, by frame. And if the instant kill motions are long and cool, that means we have to have more time to make sure every pattern looks cool, right? And if we decide to implement instant kill to all characters, that means we have to develop that to all characters, which is almost nearly equal to developing maybe two characters. So we'll try to find a chance. Our team has been expanding still even now, we have our motion designers and animators recruited in our team and our team is getting bigger. So I'm looking, please look forward to future updates if we'll be able to do it.</p><p><strong>Final question, I'm asking this of pretty much everyone that I'm talking to here at Evo, but we've just crossed a milestone of Rollback netcode, everyone kind of has rollback netcode now. It's now become standard among fighting games. I think fighting games are a lot better for it. What do you think is the next step for fighting game evolution across the genre?</strong></p><p><strong>Miyauchi: </strong>That's something that we've been also discussing among the development team. Of course, as you know, Arc System Works has been making fighting games and we'll continue making fighting games. And if we make new fighting games, we'll always discuss about what will be something that we can bring, revolutionize the fighting game, how do I say, industry. And I don't have the answers yet or I can't share any answers for it, but I will be always thinking about it. And I honestly think the community right now, fighting game community right now, is in the best form of the current era. In the past, there was always... I mean, I wish if I would be a player in this fighting game era right now, people are expecting more and more fun things to the fighting game and we'll try to find out what we'll be able to provide to the community.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is a Senior Producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-doesnt-stray-far-from-overwatch-but-its-super-fun-regardless<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Doctor Doom needs you to run some 6v6 matches.</h2></div><section><p>Marvel Rivals is not attempting to reinvent the wheel. When it was first unveiled earlier this year, the gut response—from fans and skeptics alike—was that it looked a whole lot like an Overwatch facsimile with licensed Marvel heroes and villains filling in the roles abdicated by Genji, Winston, and Roadhog. After jumping into the closed beta for a few hours, I can confirm all of those suspicions. This is a hero shooter that has studied the established formula hard, but so far, that has resulted in an experience that's flashy, polished, and ready to get under your skin.</p><p>Like most multiplayer games, Marvel Rivals glosses over the specifics for why this alliance of superheroes has decided to beat each other to death over a variety of team-based objectives. (It has something to do with a partnership between two different versions of Doctor Doom. Beyond that, who knows?) But everything else here should be very familiar to anyone who's spent time in a big, bouncy arena shooter. You'll be split into two teams of six players, with rosters categorized into basic tank, support, and DPS roles, all of whom are blessed with a variety of unique abilities and an Ultimate that charges up over the course of the game. Victory will be achieved if you can move a payload to the end of its route, or if you're able to camp on a control point, and all of the action takes place in blooming battlefields plucked from the greater Marvel canon. Remind you of anything?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Yes, Rivals takes its cues from Overwatch much more than it does from Valorant or Team Fortress 2. The tactics here aren't built around twitchy gunplay. In fact, a sizable chunk of its cast aren't wielding firearms at all, and across the board, they tend to absorb a ton of bullets before keeling over. Naturally, that makes Rivals more approachable to those who are turned off from traditional shooters. Do you want to toss up protective magical barriers and weave portals to teleport around the map? Dr. Strange might become your main. Would you rather bring a wide arsenal of munitions to the fight and try to win with your well-hewn Call of Duty skills? Then The Punisher might be more your speed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A sizable chunk of its cast aren't wielding firearms at all, and across the board, they tend to absorb a ton of bullets before keeling over.</p></div><p>The asymmetry in each of these heroes is genuinely staggering. Developer NetEase has clearly dedicated a lot of time and resources into making sure the vividness of the Marvel fantasy is able to come to life within the narrow confines of a hero shooter. Consider Iron Man, who operates like a mobile artillery unit, throwing out huge splashes of damage to anyone below him. Star-Lord, meanwhile, has two blasters in his holster that automatically reload whenever he dashes forward. String those together correctly, and you can absolutely melt the lifebar of whoever was unlucky enough to be caught out of position.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Rivals also does a good job of emphasizing one of the great traditions in comic books: team-up abilities, where two heroes combine their strengths and start wrecking shop. These are character-specific, and they often play off of the relationship between the heroes within the Marvel universe as a whole. For instance, Rocket Raccoon can leap onto the shoulders of his old pal Groot, hooking him up with damage reduction and added mobility. It's a cool wrinkle, and one that sounds difficult to balance. Ideally, at high levels, Marvel Rivals won't boil down to matches that feature a prescribed set of established synergies, and still allow players to express their own creativity with their compositions.</p><p>Because even now, in its unfinished state, Marvel Rivals is beautifully rendered. The characters are all gorgeously exaggerated and rippling with muscles, far more reminiscent of a comic shop in 1997 than anything from the MCU. The maps themselves are equally resplendent and surprisingly modular. (Take aim at a wall, and you might be able to blast it to smithereens.) And perhaps most importantly, Rivals seems equally attuned to the whims of a select few esports-adjacent diehards, and those who simply want to burn off a weeknight crushing the opposition with The Hulk. The package that NetEase has put together here is rock solid. Let's hope it stays thrilling when it jumps to live servers.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Crystal Dynamics' beloved dark fantasy action-adventure series Legacy of Kain could be poised to receive the remaster treatment, if newly sighted branding at Comic-Con is to be believed.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/">Resetera</a>, logos for an unannounced "Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" were included on display plaques accompanying statues of game characters Kain and Raziel at this week's Comic-Con San Diego show.
</p>
<p>
A Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver graphic novel prequel, The Dead Shall Rise, was recently announced by Dark Horse Comics, and GameSpot has now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">received confirmation</a> from the publisher's VP of product development and sales that this is due to release in August.

<p>
Given the Dark Horse logo also appears on the (now removed) Comic-Con plaques, it's hard not to speculate the graphic novel and remaster might arrive in tandem - particularly as the first Soul Reaver game is 25 years old on 16th August this year.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Crystal Dynamics might be considering a Legacy of Kain revival first surfaced in 2022, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">sent out a survey</a> asking if recipients would be interested in seeing the series - which spanned five titles between 1996 and 2003 - make a comeback.
</p>
<p>
Over 100,000 people responded positively, to which Crystal Dynamics CEO Phil Rogers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-hears-legacy-of-kain-fans-loudly-and-clearly-following-huge-survey-response">replied</a>, "Rest assured, we hear you loudly and clearly, and we'll continue to update you on the 'what if' possibilities ahead for Legacy of Kain in the future." Since then, parent company Embracer has embarked on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-now-laid-off-8-of-staff">devastating programme of layoffs and project cancellations</a>, making a Legacy of Kain revival seem unlikely - but here we are now.
</p>
<p>
Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 were written and directed by Amy Hennig - perhaps best known as the creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Uncharted series - and the series celebrated its 20th anniversary back in 2019. If you're curious to learn more, Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-turns-20-lets-remember-why-it-was-brilliant">recalled why the series was so brilliant</a> at the time.
