            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the release date for upcoming anime fighting game&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em>, which promises to offer the chance to engage in battles just like the ones you've seen in the manga and anime.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will arrive on March 21st. It's heading to PC and consoles, but like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">many games launching in the next year or so</a>, it seems to be skipping the Switch.</p>

<p>Many characters from&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>are set to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls</em>, including Ichigo, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Renji Abarai, among others. If you're a&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>fan, then it's likely your favorite fighter will make the cut.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-ichigo-renji.jpg?itok=95Ar6YLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-release-date-ichigo-renji.jpg?itok=Kkf9mIWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>promises to be the definitive&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>arena fighter.</figcaption></figure><p>Each character in&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will have access to unique sword abilities to help them turn the tide of combat, just as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Bandai Namco is also promising that&nbsp;<em>Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>will allow you to use a single strike to "spell defeat for your opponent", so it sounds like you'll need to have your wits about you to avoid getting put down before the fight has even begun.</p>

<p>Additionally, as battles progress, you'll "unlock new forms and new blades" to help you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In short, it sounds like the game is aiming to mimic the desperate last-gasp shonen fights for which&nbsp;<em>Bleach&nbsp;</em>became so well-known.</p>

<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Bleach</em>'s first foray into the world of video games, although it's arguably the first major 3D arena fighter to be based on the property (if, that is, you <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-jump-force-trailer-shows-off-bleach-characters-pretty-visuals" rel="nofollow">don't count&nbsp;<em>Jump Force</em></a>, which I'm assuming a lot of folks would rather not do).</p>

<p><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689620/BLEACH_Rebirth_of_Souls/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10001710" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-pre-order/9MW2PF98HPNG/0017/9VHRG4FW3X1N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 21st.</p>

It’s a dangerous area, filled with bandits and Snorks. My first time setting foot outside the Army Warehouse was pitch-black, and a small horde of Snorks ambushed me from all sides. It was one of the most terrifying gun battles of my playthrough. But in the end, I prevailed and walked away with the Lullaby.</p><h2 id="h25554"><a id=""></a>Where To Get The Lullaby Unique Assault Rifle</h2><figure id="" data-id="b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-recommend-id="image://b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-recommend-id="image://b30cb5f7d8031914254083d3257e8108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player stands outside an abandoned army warehouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I initially learned about the location of Lullaby, I thought its proximity to the Lesser Zone would mean a cakewalk compared to the Riemann SMG up north. I was incorrect, though. You see, the Chemical Plant is filled with enemies, and due to the A-Life quirks, they continuously spawn. By the time I clambered through the upstairs window to open the Journalist’s Stash to acquire the Lullaby, two more bandit groups and another small horde of Snorks spawned and were fighting in the streets below.</p><p>But for now, let’s focus on acquiring the unique assault rifle. To get it, start by climbing up the truck outside the front entrance until you’re aligned with the second floor, then hop across to the awning hanging over the front door. From here, mantle over the windowsill and into the second-floor hallway. </p><figure id="" data-id="49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-recommend-id="image://49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-recommend-id="image://49a158058a2afcc068b6fe207ce8e65c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An in-game screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash containing the Lullaby at the Chemical Plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll end up in front of a locked gate leading to the first floor.

You’ll find the stash with Lullaby inside the back corner of the room.</p><p>Once you have the weapon, leave the area immediately. Enemies will continuously spawn around the corner and across the bridge, pinning you between warring factions as you attempt to evacuate. Oh, and Lullaby is heavy, so it may weigh you down and force you to walk out of the area instead of running.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644">Don’t Let Your Weapons Decay If You Want To Survive <em>Stalker 2</em></a></span></p><p>Of course, once you have Lullaby and any other unique weapons you want to wield, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-weapon-upgrade-attachment-repair-broken-1851707644">don’t forget to maintain them</a></span>.

<p>As 2024 winds down, another game studio has closed its doors for good. Deceive Inc. developer Sweet Bandits Studios has announced that it is shutting down, effectively immediately.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forum post</a> on Tuesday, the Canadian studio announced that it is “no more” after reaching “the breaking point for the studio”.</p>



<p>“After a long and difficult road of trying to get Deceive inc. in a state where it could thrive, we have reached the breaking point for the studio, unable to continue this adventure with you,” the studio said.</p>



<p>“While this is a moment of great sadness for us, we are happy to have been given the chance to create this universe and share it with you all. We were amazed by the passion of this community and this has been a driving force for us all along, pushing us to try and make this project reach the potential it has. We’ve put our heart and soul into this game and nothing makes us happier than seeing it resonate with other people across the world.”</p>



<p>Sweet Bandits launched Deceive Inc. in 2023 to a “very positive” response from players on Steam. According to the studio, they are working with publisher Tripwire Interactive in order to maintain the game and keep it online.</p>



<p>“We will share news with everyone once we have more details,” they said. “In the meantime, servers and game access will continue as they have been.”</p>



<p>While the company didn’t confirm how many people have lost their jobs, the <a href="https://www.sweetbanditsstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s website</a> says that it had 18 employees. It’s unclear, however, if that number was still accurate.</p>

<p>The footage in question is of a demo at the Siggraph Asia 2024 computer graphics conference in Tokyo. This demo sees the user taking part in a cleaning mini-game. The actions on screen are achieved by using hand gestures, with no controllers required (see first embed below)</p>

<p>Text accompanying the PlayStation VR2 demo states this feature "tracks the position and posture" of the users' hands, and the "library is available with the latest SDK of PlayStation 5".</p>

<p>Sony's demo booth additionally lists the tracking rate at 60 fps, claiming the system "displays the hands smoothly" with "low latency". According to the text, the hand tracking tech will be able to detect 12 types of gesture.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while PS VR2 hasn't had hand tracking up until this point, other VR sets such as Quest 2 and 3 have hand tracking as standard.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment on the PS VR2's potential hand tracking future. We will update you when we know more.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in VR news, we recently got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vr2-exclusive-alien-rogue-incursion-lands-december-release-date">release date for Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>. That's coming later this month. If getting yourself into a number of different disguises to pop off unsuspecting victims is more your VR bag, I am afraid you will have to wait a little bit longer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>'s PS VR2 release.</p>

			<p>Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer is a genuinely enjoyable and fairly well-thought-out way to exercise, just so long as you’re confident in your ability not to hurt yourself when punching thin air. As a fitness nut of sorts, I like finding new ways to workout, but the main thing that any exercise method needs to be is fun. Ultimately, if I don’t feel like it’s working and it’s generally an unenjoyable slog, I’m never going to do it, and yes, I am pooping on cardio as a whole here because I hate it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fitness Boxing 3: Your Personal Trainer – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTrnSqzU3JM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, one thing I adore is immediate feedback, and while some of the voice options in Fitness Boxing 3 can feel a little bit robotic, the mix of noises, haptic rumble, and your incredibly happy personal trainer telling you how great you are, means that every workout feels genuinely good. I’d still love to see amped-up versions of classic Nintendo tracks in favor of the generic dance songs that are present here, but maybe that’s just because I think F-Zero music is already worth working up a sweat to.</p>


<p>Each workout offers you a time upfront along with the moves you’ll be doing during it, and a rough calorie burn that you’ll get from it. There’s some new modes here, including Mitt Drills and Sit Fit Boxing, which is great for accessibility, but for most people on most days you’ll be doing the daily workout that the game puts together for you once you’ve put in your goals and body stats. This is a nice way to eliminate the hassle of booting up the game and worrying about what you should be doing, and being able to choose from a 20, 30, or 40-minute version of your daily workout is a wonder for anyone who’s on a time limit, which you probably are.</p>


<p>What I really like though, is that during workouts, and sometimes after them, your personal trainer will suggest shifting to a slightly harder workout, or a short high-speed one to really get you sweating. I’m actually a qualified personal trainer, and this is something I do a lot, so it’s incredibly funny to be on the other end of it. It’s just a nice way to get you doing a little bit more when you’re already doing something, and it’s genuinely very effective.</p>
<p>Along with the punchy workouts themselves, you can also customize a bunch of things throughout the game, like the hair colour, eyes and clothes of the personal trainer. This is nice, if you need a specific version of a person to tell you to do things. We’re not judging you, and neither is the game, given that you can build up a rapport of sorts with the trainers to unlock special kinds of training.</p>

<p>You’ve then got a bunch of stats you can track and scores to beat as well, which is another nice incentive if you’re feedback-driven – you probably are if you’re looking into Fitness Boxing 3 as a way to train.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I really like Fitness Boxing 3 as a training tool. I've been incorporating it into my workout routine getting my cardio in the morning with Fitness Boxing 3, and then doing my weights at lunchtime for a more complete experience. If you're looking for a fun way to start moving, then this could well be it.	</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/danganronpa-and-zero-escape-creators-srpg-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-launches-in-april.1051647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Xseed has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, a strategy JRPG from the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, the game will launch for PC and Nintendo Switch on April 24th, so you'll only have a few more months to wait to get your hands on it. There's no word of a release for other major platforms yet, sadly.</p>

<p>It's good to know that&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>'s Kazutaka Kodaka and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>'s Kotaro Uchikoshi have managed to get this one over the line. Back in June, Kodaka <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">said that he and his team were "risking their lives"</a> to secure financing for the game and get it made.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date-darumi-dialogue.jpg?itok=4neohwCf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date-darumi-dialogue.jpg?itok=8r9kKKsP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>'s creator. Can you tell?</figcaption></figure><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>will tell the story of Takumi Sumino, a "totally average teenager" who's whisked away to the titular Last Defense Academy following an attack on his hometown by monsters.</p>

<p>Sumino, along with 14 other students, must keep their school safe for 100 days as part of the Special Defense Unit, and as they fight, they'll learn how much they're "willing to sacrifice to take back their normal lives and save the world".</p>

<p>Appropriately enough, the premise feels rather like a marriage between&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>, and since&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is the brainchild of the creators of those franchises, that probably shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>

<p>You can check out the new "Extreme Despair Trailer" for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>below. As you can probably surmise from that title, we're not exactly in for a laugh-a-minute comedy extravaganza with this one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as Nintendo Switch, on April 24th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

<p>Torn Banner Studios, the developers behind No More Room in Hell 2 and Chivalry 2, have announced layoffs amid a “restructure” at the company. </p>



<p>The news was announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/torn-banner-studios_a-message-from-steve-piggott-torn-banner-activity-7269735996861091841-xf_y/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> by CEO Steve Piggott.</p>



<p>“Today I want to share some unfortunate news for Torn Banner Studios,” Piggott said. We have made the very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce.</p>



<p>“As a fully independent, self-funded developer, we’re up against many challenges. Our team is navigating this process with a tremendous amount of care and appreciation for those that are impacted. Torn Banner Studios would not be the place it is today without the dedication, passion, and accomplishments of these great people.”</p>







<p>Piggott continued to say that No More Room in Hell 2’s development will continue on, and that the studio is “fully committed as we move forward with a full 1.0 release in 2025”. The game, he says, is “central to our goals as a studio”.</p>



<p>“We are still actively working on everything we’ve spoken about in our roadmap, and more,” he said. “Torn Banner will continue to work hard to develop the game alongside our community.”</p>



<p>The studio’s other game, Chivalry 2, will have servers remain active after the game received its final update earlier this year.</p>



<p>Those being let go at the company will receive severance packages and are able to keep their work computers.</p>



<p>“We’ll also be working hard to help people find positions at other studios where we can,” Piggott added.</p>



<p>At this time, it’s unclear exactly how many people are being let go from Torn Banner Studios in this round of layoffs. Insider Gaming has reached out for clarification, and will update this article should a response be received.</p>



<p>The gaming industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 14,600 confirmed jobs</a> lost across 170+ companies in 2024. Based on Insider Gaming sources, the real number — including unannounced layoffs — totals over 16,000.</p>

It’s all part of the “Seek and You Shall Find” side quest, which involves tracking down the Journalist’s Stashes across the map. One of the first locations you should focus on is in Rostock, northwest of Zalissya and just outside Garbage. It’s a trek but a worthwhile one.</p><figure id="" data-id="43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-recommend-id="image://43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Stalker 2 map shows the location of the Riemann SMG at the player’s location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Stalker 2 map shows the location of the Riemann SMG at the player’s location." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-recommend-id="image://43284b68ffa83d3cf9e4e8975c28417c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Stalker 2 map shows the location of the Riemann SMG at the player’s location." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the screenshot above, you’ll note the green icon denoting the player’s location at a rectangular military complex northwest of Rostock. It’s a short walk from the Slag Heap, though you’ll encounter plenty of mutants, anomalies, and bandits on the journey, so be mindful of your surroundings and don’t walk through the swamp. It’s deadly.</p><p>Once you arrive at the barracks, be wary of the gravity anomalies outside and inside. You can toss a screw into any of the floating anomalies to disperse them momentarily, allowing you to pass. Once you’re through the anomalous obstacle course, head inside the Eastern entrance, then turn left inside the building to navigate through the broken barracks. You’ll find the blue crate containing the Riemann SMG in the far back corner between two bunk beds.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-recommend-id="image://3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash in Rostok containing the Riemann SMG in Stalker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash in Rostok containing the Riemann SMG in Stalker 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-recommend-id="image://3d0439b17de57362aeb02bcd30a668e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Journalist’s Stash in Rostok containing the Riemann SMG in Stalker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Riemann SMG, is a competent submachine gun capable of propelling you through the mid- and late-game missions in <em>Stalker 2</em>. It features a high rate of fire, exceptional accuracy, and moderate range/ Its relatively low damage per shot is offset by the high DPS . Lastly, it goes for approximately 32,000 coupons if you choose to sell the rifle.</p><p>Of course, the Riemann SMG in <em>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>is only one of the many unique weapons across the Zone. The Lullaby is another high-end assault rifle you can track down even earlier!</p><p>.<br>  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Humble has revealed its December lineup of games, and this month, there's a great selection of intriguing sci-fi, sandy action, and cyberpunk fun to pick up. In case you haven't used it before, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice costs $12 monthly</a> and offers several perks, including a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if your cancel your subscription. Other benefits include exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice December 2024 Games</h2><ul><li>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</li><li>Old World</li><li>Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City</li><li>The Invincible</li><li>Moonstone Island</li><li>Inkulinati</li><li>Venba</li><li>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip</li></ul><p>This month you can grab Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, a spiritual successor to Sega's Jet Set Radio. Like the games that inspired it, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has a cel-shaded art style and it's set in a city where local gangs compete for clout by being as <em>extreme</em> as possible. There are various ways to get around New Amsterdam--from rollerblades to skateboarding--and you can leave your mark on the city with fresh graffiti. Assemble your crew, explore the five boroughs, and avoid the fuzz as you take on rival crews and strange enemies.</p><p>Another noteworthy game this month is Atlas Fallen, a solid action-adventure that recently received new enemies, quests, a reworked campaign, and a revamped progression system through a major update. It's a satisfying game where you wield strange powers to take on deadly beasts and cruel gods, so if you've been looking to pick this up, then this is a good time to do so following its overhaul.</p><p>For anyone looking to explore a seemingly deserted alien planet, you can check out The Invincible. Billed as a story-driven game inspired by the sci-fi stories of Piolish writer Stanislaw Lem, The Invincible is a philosophical look at humanity's place in the cosmos. Then there's Crime Boss: Rockay City, a bad game about pulling off heists and escaping with some sweet loot. It's basically Payday with a cast that includes Chuck Norris, Vanilla Ice, Danny Glover, Kim Basinger, Danny Trejo, and Michael Madsen, and reviews were lukewarm at best when it launched last year.</p><p>Other highlights this month include the cozy life-simulator Moonstone Island, medieval turn-based strategy with a unique look in Inkulinati, delicious storytelling in Venba, a colorful tale of burnt rubber and love in Monster Roadtrip, and incredibly deep strategy in Old World.</p><p>As a reminder, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. If you're looking to grab a few Humble Bundle deals this month, you can also check out the list below of what's currently available.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fscifi-shooters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sci-Fi Shooters Bundle</a> -- 8 items for $19</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdisney-classics-black-friday&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Classics: Black Friday Bundle</a> -- 17 items for $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-telltale-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Telltale Collection</a> -- 8 items for $12</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Frawcember-to-remember&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raw Fury: Rawcember to Remember Bundle</a> -- 14 items for $15</li></ul>

Developer GSC Game World <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/" data-ref-id="1100-6527951">released a day-one patch</a> to address some of Stalker 2's lingering issues. However, the title is still missing the A-Life 2.0 system that was initially promised on its Steam page. Now, GSC Game World is opening up about why A-Life 2.0 isn't in the game and how the Steam page was changed.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, creative director Maria Grygorovych explained that A-Life 2.0 is still in Stalker 2; it just isn't working as intended yet. The first Stalker used the initial A-Life--which was created as an AI program to give NPC characters in the world of the game a life of their own beyond any interactions with the players. A-Life 2.0 was meant to be the next generation of that program, if it can be made to function correctly.</p><p>GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych told IGN that as the game's launch date neared, the team attempted to shrink the area around the player affected by A-Life 2.0 before they encountered game-breaking bugs that forced the team to turn off the feature for now. Maria Grygorovych added that the change in the game's Steam description came from someone in the marketing department who made the edit without telling her. Both Grygorovychs also insisted that the developer is still committed to implementing A-Life 2.0 and ironing out its issues.</p><p>"For now we [are] committed to players to make it work and it can be done from directions both optimizing, giving more resources to A-Life, fixing bugs, making it work properly, and then putting more efforts to make it more advanced," said Ievgen Grygorovych.</p><p>As if that issue wasn't enough to deal with, Russian propaganda outlets recently began accusing of Stalker 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/russian-propaganda-claims-stalker-2-is-drafting-players-into-the-ukrainian-military/1100-6528177/" data-ref-id="1100-6528177">drafting players into the Ukrainian army</a>. The documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> demonstrated how GSC Game World's team was affected by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Half of the team was forced to flee the country to finish Stalker 2, while the rest remained and some among them choose to fight in the war. Regardless of the game's ongoing issues, Stalker 2 has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">sold over 1 million copies across PC and Xbox</a>, and it remains available on Game Pass.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-developer-sweet-bandits-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>developer Sweet Bandits has announced that it will close down, but the studio says it's currently "considering options" with regards to what will happen to the game itself.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/a-message-from-sweet-bandits.2340721/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the forum of <i>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</i>publisher Tripwire, lead designer and Sweet Bandits co-founder&nbsp;Philippe Pelletier Baribault, also known as Baribandit, says he and his company have "reached the breaking point", and that they are "unable to continue this adventure".</p>

<p>Baribault says he and Sweet Bandits walked a "long and difficult road of trying to get&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>in a state where it could thrive", but that they haven't managed to achieve this goal, hence the studio's closure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deceive-inc-sweet-bandits-shut-down-punch.jpg?itok=MzxVFU2h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deceive-inc-sweet-bandits-shut-down-punch.jpg?itok=QUe5-KeL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>developer Sweet Bandits is shutting down.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to "the path ahead" for&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc</em>., Baribault says that he and his studio are considering the best way for "maintaining this game that we all love". It's possible, then, that&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>won't be shutting down.</p>

<p>In fact, right now, servers and access to the game will remain active, although a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/820520/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quick look at the game's SteamDB numbers</a> indicates that this might not be the most meaningful decision, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Even if&nbsp;<em>Deceive Inc.</em>'s servers do remain available for play, however, it doesn't look like we'll be getting any new games from Sweet Bandits in the future, which is a shame.</p>




<p><em>Deceive Inc.&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deceive-inc-release-date-unmasked-for-march" rel="nofollow">released back in March last year</a>. It's a competitive multiplayer shooter based on espionage and subtlety; you're better off sneaking around rather than going in guns blazing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems that the game's quirky, cartoony art style and focus on stealth rather than arena combat failed to help it find an audience.</p>

<p>That said, Sweet Bandits' demise is just the latest tragedy in a long line of studio closures, project cancellations, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">widespread industry layoffs</a> that have affected both big companies and small developers alike.</p>

There’s just one thing that makes his life hard: he’s so anxious about being in social situations that his head would explode if he ever talks to anyone. Fortunately, that’s never happened yet: as you’ll see, Giraffe has gotten good at sneaking around, distracting, and avoiding the overly chatty residents of Friendly City (voted friendliest city in the world!).</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Ubisoft recently made the shocking announcement that it would shut down its Call of Duty competitor, XDefiant, close Ubisoft San Francisco, and lay off nearly 300 people in what was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">just the latest unfortunate development for the people who make video games in this business</a>. Now, internal memos from CEO Yves Guillemot and chief studios boss Marie-Sophie de Waubert have emerged.</p><p>Guillemot said in a memo obtained by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> that the decision to cancel XDefiant, close Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka, and ramp down its Sydney office was "among the most difficult decisions we've had to make." Guillemot praised the XDefiant development team and its ambition to "challenge the best shooter on the market." However, "it was not enough," he admitted.</p><p>For those being laid off, Guillemot said he expresses his "deepest gratitude" and that the company will do "everything possible" to help affected staffers.</p><p>Guillemot went on to say Ubisoft is indeed going through "turbulent times," adding that he is working with his executive team to find the "best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny." When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">Ubisoft's stock price</a> began to tank earlier this year, some theorized the lower company value might make the company an acquisition target.</p><p>In October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">a report claimed Ubisoft was talking to Tencent about all manner of options</a>, including turning Ubisoft private or having Tencent acquire the company. Nothing has materialized from this as of yet, but Guillemot's wording about being able to "maintain control of our destiny" suggests something may be afoot, or perhaps it doesn't mean that at all.</p><p>"I'm doing everything I can to help us regain momentum, so that we can continue to make Ubisoft a key player in our industry, a creator known for its unique and exceptional video games," Guillemot said in his memo to staff.</p><p>As for the memo to staff sent by Marie-Sophie de Waubert, it was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published on Ubisoft's own public website</a> and shed some additional light on what happened with XDefiant. She said the game had an "encouraging start" but failed to "attract and retain" enough players.</p><p>"The game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it," she said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that Ubisoft's lack of success with XDefiant doesn't mean the company will stop pursuing games-as-a-service titles. In fact, she said games-as-a-service remains "a pillar of of strategy," citing examples of success like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor.</p><p>"It's a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles," she said.</p><p>XDefiant was developed by Ubisoft San Francisco, and about half of the developers are shifting to other projects within Ubisoft as a result of the game's shutdown. The game was produced by Call of Duty veteran Mark Rubin and launched in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-launch-reportedly-hit-1-million-players-in-under-3-hours/1100-6523688/" data-ref-id="1100-6523688">attracting lots of players right out of the gate.</a> The momentum could not be sustained, however. On October 15, Rubin responded to claims that XDefiant would shut down after Season 4, saying there were <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no plans to do that and in fact, he was already planning content for the game's second year.</a></p><p>De Waubert also teased larger, structural changes coming to Ubisoft in the future in the areas of production and business practices. Guillemot, for his part, said in his memo that Ubisoft will try to have "fewer unnecessary processes" so its workers can focus more on making games.</p><p>These latest layoffs at Ubisoft come after a previously announced cost-cutting program that already resulted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">more than 1,000 layoffs at the company.</a></p>

            <p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, from Ukrainian developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>, was released last month after multiple delays, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">sold exceptionally well</a> but received a mixed reaction from critics due mainly to issues with its performance and bugs. </p>
<p>However, another delay simply wasn't an option for the team, which found itself exhausted at the end of a long development during a time of war.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer this week, GSC Game World studio CEO Ievgen Grygorovych compared the game's development and delays to running multiple marathons. "It's very hard to explain your state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do and in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," he said.</p>

<p>"You have no energy at all and you decide - should we take one more marathon? And you just can't say yes, let's make one more marathon, because you're already broken."</p>
<p>Even with more time to polish the game, there was never a time where everything was fixed, added Grygorovych. And with the end of the year and its key sales period looming, the decision was made to continue on and release Stalker 2 in the best state possible.</p><p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," said Grygorovych. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'." After that, further patches and story expansions can then always be added, he continued.</p>
<p>I spoke with Grygorovych, and creative director (and his wife) Mariia Grygorovych, after a screening at BAFTA of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">documentary War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> (which you can watch on YouTube, above). The film follows development of the game during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's a powerful and harrowing watch that provides further context to the game and explains its status as a political piece of art.</p>
<p>In particular, one thread of the film explores the development team grappling with traitorous feelings as they fled Ukraine for their own safety - though other team members did remain in Kyiv to lend support. I had to ask, then: has that feeling changed since the release of the game?</p>
<p>Grygorovych noted the "good response from players from our nation" and the extent of coverage from TV news outlets mentioning the game and the release of its patches. "It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said.</p><p>"It touched everyone in the country, but after releasing this it slightly justified that, yes we left our country and decided not to stay there, but we still made something that could help Ukraine in some way. We are artists, we are creative people, but it was our way to bring value to our country."</p>
<p>He continued: "When you finish the project, you release it and show that it's a good game. And not everyone will love it, that's ok, but for the people who like it we made them happier."</p>

<p>Releasing the game (and the documentary) has helped highlight the plight of Stalker 2's developers, but also raise awareness of the continuing situation in Ukraine at large, Grygorovych continued. "It's very important to remind people what's going on, because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," he said.</p><p>"One layer is we are making the game and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p>
<p>As such, the only way to develop and release the game was to divide the team and make it work across two offices in two countries - one in Kyiv and another in Prague. Yet Mariia Grygorovych added that had the team remained in Kyiv, it still would've released the game in some form. "I can't imagine that we would give up in this theoretical situation," she said, "because giving up is something not about even our culture. It's hard but you will do it. Why? Because we don't have any options. Why is Ukraine even fighting with big evil Russia? Because we don't have any options."</p>
<blockquote>"I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</blockquote>
<p>Stalker 2 has proven so popular in the studio's homeland that there were countrywide internet issues for five or six hours once the game was released. "It was hard for the whole country and it's a bad thing because the internet is important, but at the same time it's like whoa!" she said.</p>
<p>"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier than they were before release," she continued. "We did something for our home country, something good for them.</p>
<p>"It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems. But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems, you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p><p>As for fixing those bugs, Ievgen Grygorovych said doing so was the easy part in comparison to the creative process of making the game itself. Still, it struggled with wanting to release the game in a playable state, and not make matters worse by introducing fixes to some issues that then destablised other parts of the game elsewhere.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, GSC Gameworld's team say they are still adjusting to their new normal, split over two locations and with Ukraine's future still uncertain. Grygorovych believes the studio is now forever changed. "It's like an evolution," he said. "There's no way for evolution to move somewhere in the past... it leads you to the place where we are now and it's impossible to get back to the place that was safer, better, warmer. We are in this state and sadly we can't go back, but we can move forward and we can be better."</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-gets-third-big-patch-in-less-than-a-week-this-one-targeting-crashes-memory-leaks-and-more">Stalker 2 received its third major patch</a> in less than a week, bringing crash fixes and more.</p>
<p>The game's success has also reportedly made it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">target of a Russian disinformation campaign</a> claiming it's used to draft players into the Ukraine war.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
