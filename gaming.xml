<p>Kicking off later this week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yes, it really is here — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>, the soccer RPG from Level-5 which has seen multiple delays and <em>two</em> name changes, finally launches on 13th November 2025 on Switch and Switch 2. And ahead of that day, the developer has shared the first 30 minutes of the game's story mode.</p>
<p>The footage (above) is from the game's Story Mode, and as you can see, it's <em>very</em> story-heavy. There's not even any footie. But there's plenty to do as you explore the grounds of the school for the very first time.</p>
<p>Plus, one of the early highlights are the gorgeous animated cutscenes from MAPPA, the animation studio best known for its work on <strong>Jujutsu Kaisen</strong>, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> Season 4, <strong>Vinland Saga</strong> Season 2, and <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>.</p>
<p>You might have seen that some people are already playing the game online; that's because pre-orders for the PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions of the game grant Early Access to the game. That's <em>not</em> the case on Switch 1 or 2, unfortunately. So we'll have to wait until Thursday for a kickabout...</p>

<p>You might also be wondering about official reviews, too. We'll echo the words our sister site Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/site-news-wheres-our-inazuma-eleven-victory-road-ps5-ps4-review">shared yesterday</a>: we don't have a pre-release code.</p>
<p>And, as we'll be reviewing the Switch 2 version — which has Mouse Mode, along with better performance and visuals and other features — we also don't have access to... early access, so we won't be able to make a start until we get a code or until the game's officially out.</p>
<p>So, basically, we'll have a review for you as soon as we can, but as you're likely aware, this game is <em>massive</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You probably heard the big news about </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> last week: Rockstar’s open-world crime drama </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>has been delayed until November of next year</span></a><span>. However, that was not the only major </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>-related bomb that dropped. The studio also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525"><span>fired a few dozen workers</span></a><span> for “gross misconduct,” including what Rockstar claims was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525"><span>the public leaking of company secrets</span></a><span>. Now, the affected developers are organizing with in-person protests, and preparing for a possible legal battle if Rockstar doesn’t reinstate their jobs.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of these developers were part of a growing attempt to unionize within the company’s UK branch that had reportedly recruited just over 10 percent of the studio’s workforce, which would qualify the Rockstar workers for “statutory recognition,” requiring the company to recognize the union.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite what the developers and IWGB Game Workers Union are calling an attempt at union-busting, the dozens of employees affected still want to go back to Rockstar office to finish their work on </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>, and depending on how the company responds, it could lead to a lengthy legal battle. The workers have been picketing outside Rockstar and publisher Take-Two’s offices, with footage from the demonstrations showing they aren’t backing down from the fight.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Fired </b><b><i>GTA 6 </i></b><b>devs just want to get back to work</b></h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI"><i><span>People Make Games</span></i></a> <span>was on the ground at one of the picket lines and interviewed some of the affected workers about the questionable circumstances regarding their termination, the culture of fear that current employees feel after these firings, and the underlying desire to reunite with their colleagues to bring </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6 </span></i><span>past the finish line after years of work.</span></p>

  <p><span>Thus far, the union has put in an appeal for Rockstar to voluntarily reinstate the workers it fired, but if that doesn’t happen, the issue could escalate into a legal battle.</span></p>

 <p><span>“What happens next is up to Rockstar,” IWGB organizer Fred Carter told </span><i><span>People Make Games</span></i><span> last week. “We’ve just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they’ll resolve this with us amicably. This is, in the end, this is egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organizing in the last 20 years. This is the moment where they can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don’t, they’ve seen what they have to contend with.</span></p>

 <p><span>Rockstar’s official stance on the issue is that the developers were allegedly “distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum,” and that these firings were “in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.” The only place </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>developers say they were discussing anything about the company was on a private Discord server where members of the union spoke about working conditions at the </span><i><span>GTA </span></i><span>company and organized union-based activities. Rockstar declined to comment when </span><i><span>People Make Games </span></i><span>asked if this server was the “public forum” the company referred to, but according to IWGB president Alex Marshall, the conversations should have been protected by British Trade Union legislation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“It looks like they’re essentially trying to decapitate the union when they see it’s gathering momentum, when they see it’s kind of passing this 10 percent threshold, when they can see it’s picking up,” Marshall told </span><i><span>People Make Games</span></i><span>. “And instead of actually thinking, ‘Oh, our workers are unionizing. Clearly, there’s something we should engage with,’ they’ve just tried to steamroll it, and completely gut the company of a union so they can continue with the behaviors that we’ve seen have been deeply problematic and toxic, and were the exact reason why workers started unionizing. I think what Rockstar has done is just proven out in the open what the workers were actually trying to counter behind closed doors.”</span></p> <h2><b>A fight for the soul of Rockstar</b></h2> <p><span>In addition to the ongoing protests, the firings could also be a huge hit to the morale of people at Rockstar still working on </span><i><span>GTA 6</span></i><span>. One anonymous former employee told </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-union-protest-rockstar/"><i><span>Aftermath</span></i></a><span> that losing people in the game’s final development year could have catastrophic consequences for the team, but knowing that many people still in the company are on their side has been heartening.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account,” they told </span><i><span>Aftermath</span></i><span>. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The most raw account we’ve gotten of these events has come from an anonymous Rockstar employee on the </span><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/#comment-1072605777"><span>GTA Forums website</span></a><span>. The worker, whose identity the site’s moderators say they verified, described a very brief and dehumanizing firing process, one that didn’t offer any evidence or specifics of the supposed “gross misconduct.”</span></p> <p><span>“Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear,” they wrote last week. “Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we’re next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom.”</span></p>

 <p><span>They continued,&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>&nbsp;When we should be excited about what’s to come over the next year, we are now totally deflated, and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot. Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make Rockstar a happier, fairer, safer, and more equitable place. That’s all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the well-being of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does. The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning. This fight is critical; if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.”</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Whatever happens, </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>has at least another year of development to go before it launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 19, 2026. According to industry </span><a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1985132691206135905"><span>insider Kiwi Talkz</span></a><span>, the game is content complete and just needs additional polish to avoid a “</span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>” situation. </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>’s Tom Henderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiosAignxbM&amp;source_ve_path=MTc4NDI0"><span>reports</span></a><span> that the game’s latest delay could cost an estimated $60 million more in development costs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But the fight to reinstate the fired developers goes beyond a single game. If Rockstar doesn’t reinstate them, IWGB Game Workers Union co-founder Austin Kelmore tells </span><i><span>Aftermath </span></i><span>the organization “intends to pursue every legal avenue available” to get these developers their jobs back. The larger ramifications this will have on Rockstar and its public perception won’t stop at the launch of </span><i><span>GTA 6 </span></i><span>next year. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>To celebrate Veterans Day in the United States, EA has teamed up with the veterans’ charity group <a href="https://www.nationalrgrassociation.com/">National Ranger Association</a>&nbsp;and released a new cosmetic bundle in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> honoring Army Rangers. It looks a lot like a charity bundle, but some fine print makes it clear that’s not the case, as none of the proceeds from sales of the new pack are being donated to the veteran charity group.</p>

 <p>On November 11, EA released the “Lead the Way” cosmetic bundle in its hit multiplayer FPS<em> Battlefield 6.</em> The pack costs $12 and includes gear inspired by Army Rangers, including a new weapon skin, character outfit, and camo parachute. It’s a pretty grounded, realistic cosmetic pack, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">the kind of thing<em> Battlefield 6</em> fans love.</a> And if you head over to the<em> Battlefield 6</em> store online, <a href="https://store.ea.com/battlefield/en/bundle/lead-the-way-pack">you’ll see a preview image with text that states</a>: “Join <em>Battlefield</em> in our support of the National Ranger Association.” That seems to imply this is a charity pack, and the store listing’s most prominent text does nothing to indicate otherwise. But if you scroll down far enough, in small text, you’ll find that EA clarifies that the “Lead the Way” pack isn’t directly supporting vets.</p>

 <blockquote><p>“No portion of the Lead The Way pack sales is donated.”</p></blockquote> <p>Now, to be clear, EA did explain this pack isn’t benefiting vets more directly <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/veterans-day-lead-the-way-pack">in a blog post on Monday</a>. In that article, EA explained that this isn’t a charity pack way at the bottom of the post. Here’s the text included:</p> <blockquote><p>While proceeds of the Lead the Way Pack are not allocated to charity, our independent donation to the National Ranger Association helps advance their important work for the Ranger community. We encourage you to learn more at their website and consider supporting their mission.</p></blockquote> <p>Still, it’s very strange to obfuscate the fact that this pack, which looks a lot like a bundle dedicated to supporting real-life vets, won’t directly benefit those people. <em>Kotaku</em> contacted EA and Battlefield Studios about the bundle and donation, but didn’t receive a response.</p> <p>Sure, EA donated money independently to the group and is sponsoring the charity’s “Best Ranger Competition.” That’s nice and all, but it seems a bit scummy to sell a Veterans’ Day cosmetic pack that is directly connected to a charity organization, but not make it extremely clear that the proceeds aren’t going to that group or toward helping its mission. Compare this to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_Endowment#Funding">Activision’s<em> Call of Duty</em> Endowment organization,</a> which sells cosmetics in-game to support vets finding new jobs after service and donates 100 percent of the proceeds to the group, and it makes EA’s bundle seem much worse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Nintendo "will never position themselves as a direct competitor to PlayStation."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime has said he "scratched his head a little bit" after seeing the company's first line-up of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> software. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsg5P9fcx4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a>, the ex-Nintendo veteran shared his thoughts on the company's handling of the Switch 2 this year, as well as Nintendo's position in the video game market overall compared to Microsoft and Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the dominance of PlayStation, Fils-Aime, who left Nintendo in 2019, said he expected the company to continue to thrive alongside Nintendo as the latter would never position itself as a direct competitor. As for Xbox, Fils-Aime expressed surprise that Microsoft hadn't already released more games for Nintendo's new console.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/11/gettyimages-1384659694-1762881485957.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Reggie Fils-Aimé. Image credit: Samantha Burkardt/Getty Images for SXSW.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"From a business perspective, when I first saw that line-up, I scratched my head a little bit," Fils-Aime said of Nintendo's decision to fill Switch 2's first six months with Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby's Air Riders, a new Hyrule Warriors game and two cross-gen titles: Metroid Prime 4 and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not a threadbare line-up by any means, but it lacks the big one-two punch of a new 3D Mario and Zelda that the Switch received during the same time period, alongside a breakout new franchise: Splatoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Certainly, what I underestimated was the enhanced Nintendo Switch 1 content, which I think has been compelling," Fils-Aime continued. "The stuff that you get for free as part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I think that has helped drive some of the momentum. And then certainly, [Donkey Kong] Bananza was a key driver for them."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fils-Aimé was more complementary about Switch 2's potential to act as a platform for the biggest third-party games, though said that Nintendo needed to ensure it was enabling other developers to take advantage of its hardware potential in the same way it did — squeezing enormous games like Tears of the Kingdom onto a tiny cartridge through intimate knowledge of the Switch's innards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But let's be clear," Fils-Aimé stated, "Nintendo, in my opinion, will never position themselves as a direct competitor to PlayStation. It's not in their DNA. It's not how they think about the business opportunity. However, would they welcome some of the latest core gamer-type of content, whether it's the latest Assassin’s Creed or Call of Duty, onto their platform? Absolutely. Do I think that there's a player base there for those games? Absolutely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The key, and this is something that the team there thinks about every day, is making sure that third-party developers have the tool sets so that they have the full capability to bring the best of their games onto Switch 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One company that has notably held back from going all-in on Switch 2 is Microsoft, which launched a couple of games on Switch 1 (including Grounded and Pentiment) but is yet to discuss any future plans for Nintendo's platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective," Fils-Aimé noted. "Certainly some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I'm surprised that we haven't seen more of that. I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday. All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement," he continued. "And I'm surprised it hasn’t happened." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After bringing Sea of Thieves and Hi-Fi Rush to PlayStation 5, Nintendo fans have been waiting patiently for Microsoft to confirm those games, and others, for Switch 2. There's also the small matter of Microsoft's previous pledge to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo hardware — though there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2">no sign of that happening for this year's Black Ops 7</a>. Perhaps 2026 will finally see Microsoft make its intentions clear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, Fils-Aimé said he had "enjoyed" playing his Switch 2 so far, though noted: "the company did not send me one for free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Samantha Burkardt/Getty Images for SXSW.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possessor-s-review-the-devil-you-know.1350286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>is a new, rather awkwardly-titled Metroidvania from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow">Hyper Light Drifter</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Heart Machine and indie powerhouse Devolver Digital, and it asks a very important question: what would happen if you found yourself sharing your brain with a demon?</p>

<p>Well, if this roughly 15-20-hour adventure is anything to go by, it turns out the answer is simple: you'd end up exploring a sprawling map, unlocking a suite of movement abilities, and fighting challenging bosses to progress a story about "codependency, loss, and survival", according to the devs.</p>

<p>I won't mince words at the outset:&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;offers a pretty bog-standard example of its genre, at least in gameplay terms, and I'm not entirely sure its narrative explores the aforementioned themes with enough depth or complexity to make it worth recommending either.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Metroidvania By the Numbers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=L83ybhHF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-exploration.jpg?itok=THqnYZPC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>doesn't have much new to offer in structural terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite an initially enthralling and fascinating setting - that of a city wracked by an apocalyptic event and still shuddering with the aftereffects of demonic invasion -&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly settles into a rather rote Metroidvania rhythm.</p>

<p>If you've played the greats in the genre, like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" rel="nofollow">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>(or, indeed, <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/castlevania-symphony-of-night" rel="nofollow">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>&nbsp;</i>and <i>Super Metroid</i>), then you'll know what to expect here.</p>

<p>You'll gradually uncover a large, interconnected space full of themed areas, using newly-acquired traversal powers to reach hitherto-unavailable spaces, all while upgrading your combat abilities and survival capacity as you go.</p>

<p>It's not a particularly inspired take on the genre's typical gameplay conceits, and short of repurposing certain household objects as weapons - main character Luca will wield kitchen knives or a baseball bat rather than swords and spears - there's not much here that's pushing the envelope.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're looking for nothing more than a structurally unchallenging exploration-based platformer with some solid combat, that may not be a drawback for you, but if you're searching for any kind of innovation from your next Metroidvania hit, it's safe to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the level design and art style will offer a diverting vista; you'll see a huge rupture in reality off in the background, for instance, or a series of floating office desks serving as platforms - but they're little more than set dressing for a very straightforward set of maps.</p>

<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Is Fun, but Repetitive</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=dJdGrZyW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-tygo.jpg?itok=lZZhmk0Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss fights in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>are a rare highlight.</figcaption></figure><p>Solid is very much the word to describe the combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>. Heart Machine says the combat here contains "elements of platform fighters" like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Smash Bros</em>.</a></p>

<p>That's&nbsp;superficially true; you can juggle enemies and use a variety of different special attacks mapped to directional button-attack combos, and you can utilize an aerial dodge to keep yourself safe from nasty air attacks as well.</p>

<p>Honestly, though, I managed to make it through&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>without using most of the purportedly&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros.</em>-inspired moves at Luca's disposal. Early on, you'll unlock a parry (another increasingly overused mechanic, I think), and that'll carry you through the majority of <em>Possessor(s)</em>.</p>

<p>For the most part, combat in&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>works pretty well, even if it fails to realize its full&nbsp;platform fighter potential.</p>

<p>Attacks land with a fairly satisfying heft (provided you're using a heavier weapon like the baseball bat), and knocking enemies against walls once their&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>-style poise is broken can be cathartic as well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>falls into a very common trap that's littered with the corpses of lesser Metroidvanias, and that's enemy variety. Put simply, you'll have seen every enemy on offer here within the first handful of hours, and the rest is essentially going through the motions.</p>

<p>As it progresses, Heart Machine's adventure will throw enemy variants at you, but they're little more than palette swaps with slightly more powerful attacks, so dodging or parrying them is a matter of dull course.</p>

<p>As is usually the case with games that struggle with enemy variety,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>quickly devolves into muscle memory and tedium. I was begging for just one or two surprises to be hurled at me, but those surprises never came, and fighting the same set of possessed objects and animals became insanely repetitive.</p>

<p>Bosses are a slightly different matter; while there aren't many of them (and&nbsp;the sidequests reuse them in a borderline unforgivable manner), they're fun to fight and surprising in terms of their movesets. It's just the parts in between that feel boring.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Has an Okay, If Uninspired Story</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=gDaMcKCY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-story.jpg?itok=Yzu-rYFG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Possessor(s)</em>' story isn't particularly new, but its characters are alright.</figcaption></figure><p>With combat and map exploration proving relatively unexciting, it's up to&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>' story to pick up the slack, but I don't know if it's ready to bear that kind of weight.</p>

<p>The characters here are endearing enough. Luca is a guarded young girl who's suddenly having to share her head with a demon, Rhem; they both need each other to survive at the outset of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, so their relationship is initially an uneasy one.</p>

<p>From that setup, however, I'm sure you can quickly guess how things are going to end up. Could it be that Luca and Rhem will find a grudging respect for one another as they both learn about their respective histories?</p>

<p>That's the core problem with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)'&nbsp;</em>story in a nutshell; everything unfolds in an entirely obvious and predictable manner. A corporation called Agradyne, which manufactures batteries, is involved, and the fact that it's a corporation is literally all you need to know about its role in the narrative.</p>

<p>There are no twists or turns here, nothing that surprised or engaged me beyond the baseline level. At times,&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>revealed information to me that I think it thought was surprising, but I just rolled my eyes and said "well, obviously".</p>

<p>With that said, Heart Machine must have been doing something at least vaguely right, because I did have a tiny little lump in my throat at&nbsp;the story's conclusion. I don't think it's a particularly memorable tale, but it serves its purpose while it's around.</p>

<h2><em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=Xi-wx6bG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/possessors-review-whip.jpg?itok=tNoGmtIe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From downtown!</figcaption></figure><p>I enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)&nbsp;</em>exactly enough to play through it once and then never think about it again. Its well-worn story is played out and unengaging, but its characters are fun enough to be around for exactly the time they're on screen and no more.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of Metroidvanias, like me, you'll quickly settle into the familiar Sunday-afternoon rhythm of&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>, but those who don't like the genre or who are still coming down from the high of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow">Silksong</a>&nbsp;</em>can safely wait before being possessed by this particular demon.</p>

              <p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920"><em>Kotaku</em> has been reporting for the whole year</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em> has been in a crisis from which it’s showing no signs of recovery. As new card prices hit record highs, it naturally draws in many new collectors hoping to hit it big, which causes scalpers to swoop in to drive up scarcity and prices, attracting more new collectors, then more scalpers, and so on, a vicious circle that is increasingly tightening, strangling the hobby. This situation has now reached a spectacular new low, with reports that people are attempting to sell the Mega Gengar ex special art rare card from <em>PTCG</em> set Mega Dream ex for $800. But there’s a small problem: the card doesn’t exist yet. It’s set to be part of Japan’s Mega Dream ex special set, only officially announced on Friday, which doesn’t go on sale until November 28.</p>

 <p>Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">multiple promises throughout 2025 from The Pokémon Company</a>, it remains the case that it’s close to impossible to walk into either a specialist or mainstream store and buy a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months. Since November 2024’s pre-orders began for the Eevee-themed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-pull-rates-rares-1851742071">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, new sets have sold out before human beings can click on sites to buy them, while <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-scalpers-mega-evolution-tiktok-2000638182">stock in stores has been stripped from shelves by camping scalpers</a> before kids can spend their allowance. The only solution is to outprint the demand, but as yet The Pokémon Company has demonstrated that it either can’t or won’t do this, and in fact <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">seems to be going out of its way to make the situation far worse</a>. And following on from the gold card fiasco of Mega Evolutions, the latest English-language set that goes on sale November 14—Phantasmal Flames—ups this ante by including a single gold card, and having it be the most desired Pokémon on cardboard, Mega Charizard. It’s going to be&nbsp;<em>crazy</em>.</p>

 <p>But if there’s one card that could potentially prove more popular than Mega Charizard ex (which is also getting a Special Illustration Rare version that will inevitably fetch more than $500), it’s Mega Gengar ex, and that ghostly beast is appearing in&nbsp; Japan’s Mega Dream ex later this month. And as reported by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-gengar-ex-240-pre-sale"><em>Wargamer</em></a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/weve-reached-unprecedented-levels-of-cooked-the-mega-gengar-pokemon-tcg-is-selling-for-usd800-even-though-it-doesnt-actually-exist-yet/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), people are <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/397243002072?_skw=Mega+Gengar+ex+%23240%2F193&amp;itmmeta=01K9PPMWXCK456FFJQCCGRDSZG&amp;hash=item5c7d872cd8:g:T~kAAeSwdQlpD~Dz&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA0FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1dNIO%2F55w8M20oPYIKOiRGJYfOPTDZbfsqACeI0yA58V9SgTbGZAjx5jzskijh0KLARlhOnqiyoxGbOxSSqCge0%2Fc0KZ51o9SqnbF%2FvDvkeODnztPa3GHAB%2BdPoLIll6UNOAteF9UtmUl1DdKYKfJ4sEn%2BqZ68kmmWn5CgG5Q40dXRGfJwlfFbSfRUxLH6Lo8fGHPhuzdakr%2Bec9lHbZ3BGZaeMOv9DjJbMFexcO2HnxbjHI2M48amPrcvzaMFjiIk%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-bO09bNZg">already putting the card up for sale on eBay</a>. For $797.99.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643010" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643010"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643010">© eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To be clear, even though you will see American YouTubers ripping open packs of international cards long before their street dates (either because they are sent samples by TPCi, as we are, or because they get retail stock ahead of sale), this isn’t the case for the Japanese sets. No one has these cards yet. The art for the Mega Gengar ex Special Art Rare was only revealed digitally on Friday. Then cut and pasted onto eBay with a price tag.</p>

 <p>Japan is having all the same problems with stock as the rest of the world, such that even physical Pokémon Centers over there are—I’ve been told—limiting customers to four single packs each. Scalpers will likely be abusing retail options to get hold of the booster boxes, stripping them down to resell valuable cards, and then dumping the bulk. That’s how someone could be confident enough to believe they can honor a sale of a card that is probably still in production right now.</p>

 <p>Presumably the only thing stopping people from trying to hawk copies of the English version of the Mega Gengar ex is that they haven’t got an image of it yet. It will likely be included in whatever January’s special set of Pokémon cards proves to be, and guarantees that this tiresome situation will drag on into at least the start of 2026. It’s a bubble, and it <em>will</em> burst, but the concern is just how much harm it will have done by that point. Not only is <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">an entire generation of children being excluded from the hobby</a> (and thus from becoming the next generation of collectors), but it’s having a real-life impact on specialist card stores. Store owners are telling me they’re unable to get stock, and that TPCi is actively refusing to engage with them about the issues, meaning customers aren’t coming in. One store owner told me he’s resorted to getting up in the early hours of the morning to try to buy packs online from other retailers, just so he has something to sell on his shelves, while knowing he’s driving the problem by doing so. It’s miserable.</p> <p>So, don’t buy from these scalpers. Don’t endorse those selling sealed product at double or triple the MSRP. Refusing to participate is the only action we can take to address the situation, and thinking, “Well everyone else is doing it, so…” makes you part of the problem. Yes, it’d sure be great to pull that gold Mega Charizard—it could pay for a vacation—but you most likely won’t. (The pull rates for one of the Mega Evolution golds were one in every 2,250 packs, ffs.) Oh, and especially don’t buy from people claiming to sell you a card that’s not even printed yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Game Awards, the final major video game industry event for the year, will take place at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles on December 11, 2025, and will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok, as per usual. This year, however, for the first time, the trailer-show masquerading as an awards show will be available to watch on Amazon Prime Video as well.</p>



<p>Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley announced the news <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1988291558417068465">with a post on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, where he writes, "<em>We’re excited to welcome</em> <em>Prime Video as another distribution partner for</em> <em>The Game Awards live on Thursday, December 11. For the first time, The Game Awards will stream live on Prime Video around the world in more than 200 countries and territories</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's a significant move for the awards show and for Amazon as it is seemingly finding ways to keep ties to the video game industry through its TV show adaptations and now the live streaming of its most popular awards show, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">but not through the actual development of video games</a>. </p>



<p>As part of the partnership, not only will Amazon be livestreaming the show, it will launch a Game Awards-dedicated store for users to purchase Game Awards merchandise and take advantage of "<em>Prime-exclusive, limited-time deals across nominated games, new releases, hardware, and more, revealed in real time</em>."</p>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/">Variety</a>, Keighley said, "<em>The great news about this is that it's additive and we still get to air everywhere we already air the show, and we're adding Prime Video as a partner, which is really exciting for us. We've had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we're like, there's no way, there's no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch - where it was born back in 2014</em>."</p>



<p>Keighley also added that Amazon's involvement will not "<em>change</em>" the show. "<em>We're still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. This is still The Game Awards. It's the exact same show. They're really just another distribution outlet, and they're really letting us build the show the way</em> <em>we always do. We're not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform</em>."</p>

<p>Former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé says he’s surprised that Microsoft hasn’t released more Xbox games for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In an interview with The Game Business, Reggie discussed Xbox’s third-party strategy and admitted he expected to see far more crossover between the two platforms by now.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m surprised that Xbox has not yet fully embraced Switch 2 from a software perspective,”</strong> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">Fils-Aimé sa</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-reggie-fils-aime-about">d</a>. <strong>“Certainly, some games could easily be ported over to Switch 2. And I’m surprised that we haven’t seen more of that.”</strong></p>



<p>Fils-Aimé went on to say he thought Xbox would have announced several new titles ahead of the holidays.</p>



<p><strong>“I thought there would be much more, especially during this timeframe leading into the Holiday,”</strong> he said.<strong> “All through the fall, I was fully expecting some dedicated announcement. And I’m surprised it hasn’t happened.”</strong></p>



<p>Currently, Microsoft has released Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 on the Switch 2 with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle set to come sometime in 2026. Aside from that, however, there hasn’t been any other first-party port or new released announced for Nintendo’s latest console. </p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-says-they-want-to-support-the-switch-2">Xbox Says They Want To Support The Switch 2</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, just after the Switch 2 was announced, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said that he wants to support the Switch 2. He even went as far to say that Nintendo has been a “great partner” for Xbox.</p>







<p><strong>“I’m really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them,”</strong> Spencer said at the time. “<strong>And getting the support from them for our franchises, I think, is an important part of our future.”</strong></p>



<p>While many expect more first party Xbox games to make their way to the Switch 2, when it happens remains anyone’s guess. In the meantime, all fans can do is hope.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1904a2299f646"><a title="romancing saga 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1904a2299f646/romancing-saga-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>I think it's fair to say we got a bit of an unexpected gift when Square Enix re-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">Romancing SaGa 3</a> for Switch back in November of 2019.</p>
<p>While it may not generate quite the same level of excitement as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasies</a> (and that's understandable), Romancing SaGa 3 deserves any plaudits it gets for bringing a level of freedom and randomness to the RPG genre that was quite unique back in 1995. In fact, the whole series does.</p>
<p>With 3 in particular, we have a game that was bold, and still feels bold, in how it gave players a selection of eight protagonists to get stuck into the story with. Just like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, and its (much better) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler_ii">sequel</a>, you can journey through Romancing SaGa 3's narrative multiple times thanks to the clever, criss-crossing storylines that make for a genuinely engrossing experience.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hkuxjz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>It helps that the actual story here is fairly strong as these things go to boot, with players assuming control of their chosen protagonist in the immediate aftermath of a Death Eclipse (or Morastrum), a horrifying event that occurs every 300 years that sees all newborns in the year of the Eclipse die, save for one, who becomes a Child of Destiny.</p>
<p>Right, I didn't come here to spoil the story, so that's enough of that. It's a cracker of a premise, and the game does a solid job of exploring it. Back in 1995, RPGs were very much still on-rails for the most part; they didn't allow for much in the way of "experimentation" in some of the ways that Romancing SaGa 3 does.</p>
<p>And it's experimentation that comes through allowing you to choose who to roll with, leading to events playing out from shifting perspectives, whilst also imbuing the whole endeavour with a striking sort of <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laissez-faire">'laissez-faire'</a> attitude, thanks to levelling up systems that sort of just go "yeah, mate, eh...here, have some random boosts for your efforts." In true SaGa style.</p>

<p>Rather than being able to count on a fixed upgrade rate to any specific aspect of your character, here it's random all the way, and it feels great. There's a ramshackle sort of approach...perhaps ramshackle isn't quite the correct word as it feels organised, but there's certainly an attempt - and a successful one - to make things feel <em>organic</em>, to make the world feel like one you can inhabit and meander around in, rather than just blowing through in a straight, precise and calculated manner. So, maybe it allows <em>you</em> to approach <em>it</em> in a ramshackle manner is a more appropriate description.</p>
<p>The weapon "sparking" system (returning from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_2">Romancing SaGa 2</a>) continues this approach, which gives each of the characters the chance to gain new skills randomly as they fight. Whilst some players may not gel entirely with this I personally love it, and I think it's a system that enhances the organic vibe in a smart way, whilst also ensuring that you still upgrade and progress.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do agree it probably works to the detriment of the overall focus of the gameplay loops, and that's something picked up on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/romancing_saga_3">in our 6/10 review</a> of the re-release. It can be frustrating and off-putting if you want to methodically improve and do the usual sort of RPG things with character progression. For me, though, it's successful in what it sets out to do with being a little bit free-wheeling, that the loss of some direction in the more traditional video game sense is acceptable.</p>
<p>I also love how the underlying ethos of all of this is carried into Kenjo Ito's soundtrack for the game. Again here, rather than have a plan or specific theme in mind, the composer approached it with the idea of allowing its sound to develop and evolve over time. It's all very zen, lads.</p>
<p>Have a happy birthday, Romancing SaGa 3. I'd ask you if you'd planned anything, but I don't see that being your style.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Have you played Romancing SaGa 3 in its original or remastered form? Agree that its uniqueness outshines its frustrations? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ARC Raiders is, at the time of this writing, one of the most popular games in the video game industry. There are currently more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">300K people on Steam alone playing it right now</a>. Its developer, Embark Studios, just celebrated <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/">700K+ concurrent players over the weekend</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">over 4 million copies sold since it launched less than two weeks ago</a>.</p>



<p>Embark is also a relatively small studio making huge waves in competitive genres, with its free-to-play first-person shooter, The Finals, and now with its third-person extraction shooter, ARC Raiders. In many ways, it's great to see a small to mid-size team have such an impact where historically only juggernauts can survive, and yet, a cloud of controversy hangs over the game, and conversation around that controversy has bubbled over in online spaces, thanks to debate surrounding a single review.</p>



<p>In its review, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer gave ARC Raiders 2/5 stars</a>, and specifically called out Embark Studios' use of generative AI voices for NPCs as a core criticism (it's worth noting that the same writer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">reviewed The Finals for Eurogamer</a>, and gave it 3/5 stars, while also critiquing the use of GenAI voices).</p>



<p>What has followed in the wake of this review is a large conversation across the video game industry about how we should talk about games that use generative AI, how we should review those games, and what should or should not go into a review. Game developers, players, YouTubers, and now, even Epic Games' chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, have joined the conversation to give their two cents.</p>



<p>Sweeney entered the conversation by first saying <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> responding to the review, "<em>Political opinions should go into op eds folks</em>." While it's worth pointing out that a review is inherently a person's opinion (which other users point out to Sweeney), the point that Sweeney expounds on is his argument that falling one way or the other on GenAI is 'political.'</p>



<p>Responding to a user asking him if it is political or not to dislike and critique GenAI within the context of a game review, Sweeney writes, "<em>Yes. This technology increases human productivity in some areas by integer multiples, and views on whether this is a net good and should be rewarded, or bad and should be fought against, are speculative and generally distributed along political lines</em>."</p>



<p>He continues, "<em>Since the author states the pessimistic case, I'll put the optimistic one here. Game developers compete to build the best games in order to attract gamers. When tech increases productivity, competition leads to building better games rather than employing fewer people</em>."</p>



<p>Sweeney further claims that he sees GenAI voices as "<em>an even bigger opportunity for in-game voice and voice actors</em>," and that he "<em>always found pre-written lines of fixed dialogue super limiting. It was painful to write text dialog in ZZT in 1991 after writing more dynamically-composed text adventure games in the 80s! AI dialog generation</em> <em>+ human personality tuning could totally transform gaming</em>."</p>



<p>It's difficult to understand how generative AI voices tuned by humans create "an even bigger opportunity" for actors, since those production pipeline models would inherently be designed to use fewer actors, resulting in fewer acting jobs available and ultimately less opportunity. Also, while any writer will tell you that writing can be a painful exercise at times, any writer worth their salt would rather work through those pains than let someone else, and even worse, something else, do it for them. Writing, like practically anything else in life, is a 'no pain, no gain' craft.</p>



<p>All that aside, Eurogamer's review has clearly hit a nerve and sparked further conversation about using generative AI in games, particularly in ways that directly replace jobs historically done by humans. Last month, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1988053268535406695">Starfinder: Afterlight developers told Wccftech that "<em>there's no point in using AI for any creative endeavor</em>."</a>  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games is addressing the launch issues of <em>Riftbound: Origins</em>. The debut launch of the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> trading card game has been marred by production and supply problems, negatively impacting the user experience.</p>

<h2>Riot Games' Response to the <em>Riftbound: Origins</em> Launch</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://riftbound.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/announcements/riftbound-origins-launch-learnings/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Riot Games starts with gratitude at the reception to <em>Riftbound: Origins</em>. Furthermore, they confirm that the next set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riot-teases-league-of-legends-fans-with-riftbound-spiritforged-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em></a>, is still on set to launch some time next year.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-starter-deck-promo.jpg?itok=bYk0kZZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-starter-deck-promo.jpg?itok=CCZLwWpf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The focus on the post then shifts to the various production issues players have found while opening their first cards. For collectors, there was the fact that a certain percentage of booster packs were missing a rare card. Since each booster is supposed to contain 2 rares, this is a big deal. Worse still, it is an issue that won't be addressed until the game's third set.</p>

<p>The good news is you can get replacement rares. You simply have to fill out a form on UVS Games' website, then wait to see if you're approved. But if you bought packs in bulk, you may still miss out since the program is limited to 3 per person and 6 per household.</p>

<p>The second issue is a more subtle, textural issue regarding the cards themselves: Riot explains that due to the card stock used for printing, more wear was applied to the cutting tools, leading to burred, or rough, edges on the cards. The good news is this process has been mitigated and shouldn't be present for any future sets.</p>

<p>Issue three affecting the <em>Riftbound: Origins</em> launch is one most tabletop players may be familiar with: shipping delays. While Riot isn't specific on what is causing these delays, they do state they are dedicated to shipping out all of the first wave of product by the end of the week. To achieve this, products you bought will be shipping to you the minute they are available. So expect multiple packages.</p>

<p>Lastly, Riot will be making Proving Grounds cards more available. Certain promo packs containing many Proving Grounds cards (Legends, Champions, Signatures, etc.) will be available at Nexus Nights. These packs will contain foil versions of cards currently not available in Proving Grounds. There is currently no concrete info on price or availability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5's release date, and the two heroes who will be joining the game's roster are none other than iconic X-Men Gambit and Rogue.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, the Cajun card sharp and the Mississippi power-sapper will be part of the hero shooter's fifth season, which will debut across all platforms on November 14th (so in just a couple of days!).</p>

<p>Usually, one of the two heroes arrives alongside the season's start, while the other will be added to the roster a few weeks into the cycle. We don't yet know which of the two will be the first to enter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' arena, nor has it been officially revealed what class the two heroes will occupy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue.jpg?itok=LhtVKXPH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-5-gambit-rogue.jpg?itok=ZgQrsMoG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 will add two fan-favorite X-Men to the roster.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer for the two heroes, titled "Love Is a Battlefield", suggests that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' fifth season will revolve around Gambit and Rogue's marriage, which is interrupted by "destiny". This prompts Gambit to set out on a journey to "win back the moment time itself stole from [him and Rogue]".</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 follows on from the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-4" rel="nofollow">fourth season back in September</a>, during which Daredevil and Angela were introduced. The former is a Duelist and the latter is a Vanguard, which might well suggest that Gambit will be another Duelist and Rogue will take the form of a Strategist.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 right here. It doesn't give too much away about what you can expect from the season, but it does show off the designs for Gambit and Rogue, which are pretty nice.</p>




<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Season 5 will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on November 14th, and you can also check the game out for free right now across all of those platforms.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-year-later-i%E2%80%99ve-forgotten-i-even-own-a-ps5-pro.1350178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One year ago this week, Sony launched one of its most expensive video game consoles ever: <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-unboxing-inside-review-comparison-1851688605">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The company promised improved performance and visuals over the standard PS5 as well as DLSS-like upscaling. And while some games definitely benefit from the power, I’ve mostly forgotten I even own a PS5 Pro.</p>

 <p>When Sony announced the PlayStation 5 Pro last year, it received a mixed reception. While some were excited to have a more powerful console that could run games at higher framerates, many weren’t convinced it was necessary.<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-specs-release-date-sony-preorder-1851644442"> And then Sony showed everyone the $700 price tag</a>, and it became even harder to justify the new console. But despite all that, I was still excited to get a PS5 Pro. I have a big ol’ 4K TV and I care about framerates and all the minutiae that impacts how a game looks. And over the last year, I’ve enjoyed some great games on my PS5 Pro. <em>Battlefield 6,</em> for example, looks and runs wonderfully on Sony’s beefier machine. Likewise, <em>Death Stranding 2</em> looks incredibly sharp on PS5 Pro while still running flawlessly.</p>

 <p>Yet, many other games I play on my PS5 Pro either don’t look or feel noticeably better, or feature no improvements at all. It doesn’t help that the PlayStation Store still lacks detailed information about what PS5 Pro enhancements are included in a given game. Sometimes I have to go digging around online to find a blog or Reddit post to determine what, if anything, has changed because I’m playing a game on PS5 Pro. That’s not a great experience for a console that now <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">costs $750.</a></p>

 <p>I can confirm that after a year of use, the PS5 Pro hasn’t given me any troubles. It runs quietly, still feels snappy to use, and hasn’t broken in some other way. In comparison, my base PS5’s USB-C port stopped working after just a few weeks. So at the very least, the PS5 Pro seems well-built and sturdy, which is nice, I guess. But is all of that worth $750?</p>

 <h2>Should you buy a PS5 Pro in 2025?</h2> <p>After using the PS5 Pro for a year, I find it hard to recommend. While I do think there are some people out there who will get some benefit from owning a PS5 Pro–<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">mainly folks with 4KTVs who really care about performance</a>–most people don’t need Sony’s more powerful console. Heck, I’m a bit of a graphics snob who loves running games at 120FPS, and I often forget the PS5 Pro is sitting in front of me because games so rarely feel like they’re benefiting from its enhanced specs.</p>

 <p>The lack of third-party support is disappointing, too. It’s surprising how many games are still launching on the PS5 via the PlayStation Store without any PS5 Pro benefits. You’d think at this point, Sony would be pushing devs and publishers to support the pricey console more. But it doesn’t feel like that is the case, which I find very strange, and that makes it even harder to recommend plopping down the cash for this thing.</p> <p>At this point, I’d suggest sticking to your PS5 (if you have one) and just enjoying it for a few more years and buying a PlayStation 6 instead when that console finally launches in the next few years, likely at a similar price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>California governor and likely presidential aspirant Gavin Newsom is dogshit at <em>Fortnite</em>. Over the course of an hour, he awkwardly exclaims that he’s “on his hands and knees” multiple times without even once recognizing the double entendre (Twitch chat is thrilled). But skill at <em>Fortnite </em>isn’t really the point of <em>Fortnite </em>Friday, despite its name. Instead, Twitch streamer ConnorEatsPants (who has not publicized his real name), 26, uses the battle royale as a pressure cooker, piling on a mix of deadpan jokes, legitimate questions, and comically-timed reminders to pay attention to the game – all in the name of keeping guests ever-so-slightly off-balance.&nbsp;</p><p>Newsom, during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inuZ7mcNlq0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>an October episode of the show</u></a>, wants to talk about Intellivision, the game console of his youth. Chat – and Connor – want to hear about Israel and Palestine.</p><p>“Bit of a breakthrough today, I hope, where Hamas said they’d turn over all the hostages,” says Newsom in response to Connor and chat’s combined prodding.</p><p>“I mean, they’ve been saying that for over a year now,” replies Connor.</p><p>“Yeah, though, this, uh, appears,” Newsom stammers, “at the moment to be more real than we’ve seen in the past.”</p><p>“It was real in the past,” says Connor. “They’ve made it very clear in the past that they intend to release the hostages.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inuZ7mcNlq0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="🔴 Fortnite Friday w/ Governor Gavin Newsom"></iframe></figure><p>Newsom stammers some more. “I’m a little more optimistic based on what we heard quite literally a few hours ago,” he eventually says, clearly off his game in multiple senses.&nbsp;</p><p>They go back and forth about Newsom’s relationship with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which Newsom says fell apart after a public spat two years ago. “I was not just privately critical,” says Newsom.</p><p>“Sometimes you’ve gotta cut people off, bro,” Connor replies. “Sometimes they are mean and talk behind your back. Sometimes they’re rude. Sometimes they commit genocide. It’s a couple of different things. It just depends.”</p><p>After that, they argue over the merits of a two-state solution (which Newsom favors) versus a one-state solution (which Connor came to prefer, he tells Newsom, after Netanyahu’s controversial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZvCmAgRWI0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>appearance on the Nelk Boys podcast</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“I want you to see the tweet that [the show] is happening tomorrow, and you're already laughing at the fact that it's happening.”</blockquote><p>This is Connor’s shtick: He jokes, he pushes, and he jokes again. He rarely, if ever, loses his cool. He does not break character. As a result, no guest fully settles in, especially if they’re figures of political significance like Newsom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeoNHG4gG5U&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>George Santos</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIBrxWKve-Y&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Adrian Dittmann</u></a>, aka that guy we all thought was Elon Musk for a second. What’s remarkable about <em>Fortnite </em>Friday is that, despite lines of questioning far less predictable than your standard press or talk show interview and a distinctly unserious backdrop – or perhaps because of those things – <em>Fortnite </em>Friday keeps securing bigger guests, the kind you’d never see coming. That, Connor told Aftermath at TwitchCon last month, is by design.</p><p>“I want you to see the tweet that [the show] is happening tomorrow, and you're already laughing at the fact that it's happening,” said Connor. “People reach out like 'Oh, I'm a State Congressperson from Massachusetts.' Well, I don't really care, because that'd be a de-escalation."</p><h2 id="for-the-bit"><strong>For The Bit</strong></h2><p>Like all good things, <em>Fortnite </em>Friday began as a bit. Actually, a bit born of a bit: Connor repeatedly made jokes about Soulja Boy until he manifested an actual appearance from Soulja on his stream into existence.&nbsp;</p><p>"Over the pandemic, I played <em>Fortnite </em>on a Friday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ta6AG513tLs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>with Soulja Boy</u></a>, and it was really funny,” Connor told Aftermath. “So I would joke for a couple of years when coming across a celebrity about 'We've got to get them on <em>Fortnite </em>Friday' as a bit. And then about a year and a half ago, I actually started doing it."</p><p>Slowly but surely, week after week and month after month, things escalated.</p><p>"I had the Musical.ly kid, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wEYHE4UgNo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jacob Sartorius</u></a>, on, and then I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfbMQAcJEAI&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Baby Gronk</u></a>, who was an [Instagram] and TikTok [sensation],” said Connor. “And then that built up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehe1cTazEEM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>the Tiger King one</u></a>, where I had Tiger King [Joe Exotic] calling from jail, and that was really funny. That got a lot of attention, which led to George Santos and so on."</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">if you have free time before your new job, you should join me on the Battle Bus (free fares)</p>— connor (@ConnorEatsPants) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1986013197527339461?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>This snowball effect is how Connor – whose following across Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter is large but not eye-poppingly enormous – managed to land Newsom in what remains his most surprising interview to date. If you follow Connor on Twitter, you’ll see the outline of a simple yet effective strategy: <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1986013197527339461?ref=aftermath.site"><u>tweet</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1984013128892608649?ref=aftermath.site"><u>at</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1982361994297810945?ref=aftermath.site"><u>famous</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1980409570750288225?ref=aftermath.site"><u>people</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1974280801052471455?ref=aftermath.site"><u>until</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1968761004809949229?ref=aftermath.site"><u>someone</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1968414554133823892?ref=aftermath.site"><u>says</u></a> <a href="https://x.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1966973007286640696?ref=aftermath.site"><u>yes</u></a>.</p><p>"I would tweet at a lot of people and try to gather whatever I could, to see who would want to do it,” said Connor. “I know certain agents of celebrities and people, but with [Newsom], I think his communications guy knew about the George Santos [episode] and DM-ed me on Twitter. He got in touch through that, and then over a couple months, we just figured out a time to do it."</p><p>Also, while Connor does have a talent agent who represents him, the ball is entirely in his court when it comes to procuring guests for <em>Fortnite </em>Friday.</p><p>"It's all me,” he said. “I don't have a booking agent. It would probably help to get one or figure one out, but every single person that's come on has been direct – like, through contacting them."</p><figure><figcaption><span>The mood board for Fortnite Friday's Gavin Newsom episode</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is not the only element of Connor’s approach that walks the fine line between haphazard and brilliant. Instead of diligently referencing a list of questions during interviews, he uses a “mood board” made up of relevant imagery. The Newsom mood board, for example, was a collage that included images of George Santos, Hasan Piker (seductively posing), Donald Trump Jr, the Israeli flag, Asmongold, Taylor Swift, Jeffrey Epstein, a meme-ified version of JD Vance, a trans flag, Kamala Harris' book, and Netanyahu next to a much smaller picture of the Nelk Boys.</p><p>"I think it's both just because of how my brain works,” said Connor, “but also when doing a discussion, playing a video game, and balancing reading Twitch chat, it's easier to have this board on the right [of my main screen] that's more [visual]. I mean, I'll write questions in my notes app on my phone beforehand and then make this mood board, and then I just know when I look at this image or something reminds me of the question I'd thought of, it's easier than having a list that I'm reading. Because that slows me down."</p><p>It is not a flawless method: "I forgot what some things meant during [the Newsom episode],” Connor said. “Like I had Donald Trump Jr, and I forgot I put that on there to ask about Kimberly Guilfoyle, [Newsom's] ex-wife, who dated Donald Trump Jr."</p><p>In the case of political figures who have something to gain by reaching a younger audience, like Newsom and Santos – or even those with an ideology to propagate, like sadsack MAGA-is-my-whole-personality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMC21Dh4O40&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>UFC fighter Colby Covington</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TnjH1aBaN4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Shazam </em>star Zachary Levi</u></a> – Connor recognizes that he’s walking a fine line. He can’t just let them spout off because a) that’d be a poor use of his platform, and b) it just wouldn’t be funny.</p><p>"There's a responsibility, I think, when you're interviewing someone with that amount of power and that amount of influence, that if you're given the opportunity to talk to them, you need to ask them certain hard questions about things they've done or they support,” said Connor. “Otherwise, you're kind of giving them a platform to humanize themselves without the weight of their actions and decisions. So I have to balance that when someone like that is on the show. I mean, I'll ask funny things, and we'll joke about stuff, but I can't finish the episode without making sure I bring up his comments on, say, Israel or things like that, because otherwise I lose credibility with people, too."</p><blockquote>"There's a responsibility, I think, when you're interviewing someone with that amount of power and that amount of influence, that if you're given the opportunity to talk to them, you need to ask them certain hard questions about things they've done or they support."</blockquote><p>Connor does not, however, view himself as any sort of political commentator or expert. Venturing into the political realm has forced him to learn on the job, and he admits that he doesn’t always nail it. After the Newsom stream, for example, he agreed with chat that he could’ve pushed harder on trans issues (Newsom has repeatedly come out against trans athletes and, the week after the <em>Fortnite </em>Friday episode, ended up <a href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/gavin-newsom-vetoes-important-hrt?ref=aftermath.site"><u>vetoing a key trans health bill</u></a> after bragging about his pro-trans legislative track record during the episode). Connor also acknowledged that he failed to engage Newsom on the topic of homelessness – another area in which Newsom has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/newsom-california-ban-homeless-encampments?ref=aftermath.site"><u>proven notoriously cruel</u></a> – citing his own lack of expertise.</p><p>"To be honest, I tried to do research on the homeless stuff because people were really upset at the way he acted toward homeless [people] in California,” Connor said during a stream immediately following the Newsom interview, “but honestly I could not understand the issue of unhoused people and housing enough to feel like I could comment on it – at least to that extent. With Israel/Palestine, I feel like I knew enough with how much I've learned over recent years to at least talk about it [competently]."&nbsp;</p><p>Connor’s willingness to challenge influential figures – after lulling them into a false sense of security with jokes and one of the world’s most famous family-friendly video games – makes him an outlier. To wit, shortly after the <em>Fortnite </em>Friday episode, Newsom – whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThisisGavinNewsom/videos?ref=aftermath.site"><u>prolific podcasting track record</u></a> mostly includes figures from the center and the right, rather than the progressive left – returned to his traditional ways, <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979327053431476566?ref=aftermath.site"><u>taking private meetings with high-profile Twitch streamers</u></a> outside Twitch’s Hasan-Piker-adjacent left flank at TwitchCon.&nbsp;</p><p>"The reason I wasn't invited [to a meeting with Newsom]," Mike "Mike From PA" Beyer, the second biggest leftist political commentator on Twitch, told Aftermath, "is because I'm actually political and have my own opinions. Whereas Gavin Newsom is trying to figure out how to manipulate Twitch and use Twitch for his own campaign. He's not interested in give-and-take where he gets where young people are politically and changes his platform to appeal. He wants to have creators who he can offer his cooperation with their platform-building in exchange for them cottoning onto whatever he wants. So it's the same old Democratic party."</p><p>Connor’s approach to shoring up his own strengths and weaknesses – and the recognition that he can’t do it overnight – also informs his decision of where to draw the line in terms of potential future interviewees.</p><p>"Lately people are like 'You've gotta get [antisemetic white supremacist] Nick Fuentes on,'” Connor told Aftermath. “That wouldn't be funny because he's good at being funny and playing the media, and I would just kind of give him a platform to do that more. I'm not an expert political guy, either. I'm just trying to be funny. So I'm not ready to debate these issues with people that I think are super ready for that. I'm more here to have a good time and humanize the guests. Regardless of who they are, whether good or bad, it does show people who they are."</p><blockquote>"Being more casually open about being progressive while being funny, I think, has opened a door for political discussion."</blockquote><p>He does not believe that comedy as a primary aim absolves him of responsibility, though. It’s a tool, like anything else. As someone who grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta surrounded by right-leaning peers and then learned more about the world via the internet, Connor recognizes the power of humor as a means to win people over.</p><p>"Even early on, in 2016, I remember the Reddit for Trump was posting memes and stuff, and what's crazy is that hasn't progressed at all for them,” he said. “They're still very much stuck in this 2016 era: really edgy humor and dated memes. It's just kind of cringey now if you are at all not stupid. It just dates them."&nbsp;</p><p>He hopes to pull people in the opposite direction by actually being funny, albeit not in a way that relentlessly punches down. He thinks his approach resonates because, again, the sort of right-leaning comedians who’ve dominated pop culture in recent years only have one trick, and because as the country careens ever closer to a state of all-out upheaval, people – even <em>Fortnite </em>players – don’t want entertainment that simply distracts them anymore.</p><p>"I think it's harder for people to put their head in the sand [where politics are concerned],” he said. “I think a lot of comedians people look up to now are losing a bit of their credibility and trust with their audience. A lot of them are going down a Joe Rogan route. Being more casually open about being progressive while being funny, I think, has opened a door for political discussion. And it's not just me. People like Adam Friedland are doing it too. I think that's a good thing."</p><h2 id="all-aboard-the-battle-bus"><strong>All Aboard The Battle Bus</strong></h2><p>Though Connor at one point during the Newsom stream said he’d “do <em>Fortnite </em>Friday on a Tuesday” if it meant getting <a href="https://aftermath.site/kai-cenat-eric-adams-nyc-fanum-nypd-giveaway"><u>disgraced still-technically-mayor of New York City Eric Adams</u></a> on, he has no desire to transform the show into a purely political vehicle. Past guests have included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0hi4f1uegw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Rizzler</u></a>, who despite immense overnight fame showed himself to be a shockingly normal and video game-obsessed kid, and with whom Connor still plays the odd <em>Fortnite </em>match off-stream.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"He's a really sweet kid," said Connor. "I know people say he's gonna grow up [to be a disaster] or people talk about the parents of these young stars, but [his dad] was asking me advice on what to do. Like 'Should I let him do this, this, and that?' There's no guide on how to do that as a parent when your kid suddenly becomes a huge celebrity. If the kid's enjoying it, you don't want to take that away from them. But at the same time, you want to balance being a normal kid. It's not easy, but he's got a good family, so I'm optimistic [about his chances of growing up into a well-adjusted adult]."</p><blockquote>"People say that streamers are fake, and I've always disagreed with that."</blockquote><p>Connor’s dream non-political guest is Miranda Cosgrove from <em>iCarly</em>, a show he believes “embraced and almost predicted” modern internet culture. He’s also been campaigning to get Justin Bieber, who now <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/justinbieber?ref=aftermath.site"><u>streams on Twitch himself</u></a>, but to little avail so far. Rapper Lil B, Connor says, was supposed to be the first <em>Fortnite </em>Friday guest, but technical issues prevented it from happening. All these years later, he’d still like to revisit that idea, though at this point, he’s not putting any money on it.</p><p>"Whenever the vibe is there, I'll text him like 'Lil B, <em>Fortnite </em>Friday?'” said Connor. “And he'll just heart the message and be like 'It's love, family.'"</p><p>Connor’s goal, more than anything else, is to keep both guests and viewers on their toes. At TwitchCon, he told me his next guest would be yet another who would make people laugh the moment he made their name public. It turned out to be Haliey "Hawk Tuah" Welch, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwpYzF1d9wo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>made her appearance on <em>Fortnite </em>Friday</u></a> late last month. More guests, Connor said, are “loosely lined up” for the future, but beyond that, anything is possible. It all depends on who responds to his tweets. For now, he just wants to keep talking to people who are worth talking to, as long as it’s funny.</p><p>"I think that's something I carried with me since I was younger: I always try to see the real person in people and the good part of people – see where their heart is at,” Connor said. “I think that lends itself to Twitch, too. When you're interacting with so many people and you're live and people are seeing a lot of you a lot of the time, it's hard to [conceal who you are]. People say that streamers are fake, and I've always disagreed with that. When people are live so much, you really are seeing a lot of them. That's typically how they are, even if it's a played-up version. And I think that lends itself to <em>Fortnite </em>Friday."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>After its launch on PC, PlayStation and Xbox earlier this year, Dead Mage and Humble Games have announced that the magic roguelike sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend_2">Wizard of Legend 2</a>, will be appearing on Switch on <strong>25th November</strong> (from a puff of smoke, presumably).</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, Wizard of Legend 2 will see you building magical loadouts from a wide range of elemental arcana, and casting spells to take out waves of enemies, navigate elemental hazards and tackle bosses.</p>
<p>All this can be played alone or with three friends in local or online co-op, and the dev promises "refined controls for Joy-Con and Pro Controllers, and optimised performance across both handheld and docked play" in this Switch version.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Humble Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>4-player Co-op:</strong> Play solo or with up to three friends in seamless online or local multiplayer. The Switch release incorporates refinements introduced during 1.0, including faster Arcana responsiveness, improved camera tracking, adjusted boss HP scaling, and streamlined item interactions for smoother co-op runs.<br>
<strong>Diverse Biomes and Bosses:</strong> Each region presents new elemental hazards, enemy archetypes, minibosses, and area bosses. From the heights of the Sky Citadel to the depths of the Chaos biome, every area features distinct mechanics and rewards for players to uncover.<br>
<strong>Elemental Arcana System:</strong> Experiment with 77 Arcana spanning Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Chaos elements. Mix and match to discover synergies, from chain lightning combos to earth-based crowd control, and adapt your spell kit to each Trial’s demands.<br>
<strong>Expansive Language Support:</strong> Support in 13 languages, including English, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Persian, and Turkish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wizard_of_legend">The first game</a>, developed by Contingent99 launched to much acclaim back in 2018, quickly racking up thousands of '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445980/Wizard_of_Legend/">Steam</a>. With Dead Mage now in the dev seat, its sequel has not been as well-received since it first launched in ver. 1.0, though the promise of playing on the go might be enough to bring some people around to the idea.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The YouTube channel People Make Games has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a video interview</a> with several workers who were suddenly fired by Rockstar Games earlier this month and have been protesting outside Rockstar North ever since. Right away, the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it was a pure act of union-busting, as the workers had just secured a 10% agreement from the workforce at the Edinburgh office to unionize. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> that they had been leaking information on a public forum; however, the employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim</a> there was no evidence of that, and that they were rushed out with no due process or representation.</p>



<p>The author of the video notes that they had already been contacted about the new union, which was set to be announced shortly, and planned to create a video about it before the layoffs occurred. Throughout the interview, the employees express their dismay at the circumstances of their termination, which could also negatively impact their resumes due to the studio's claim of 'gross misconduct' as the cause. But they would also like to be reinstated into Rockstar and get back to work to finish Grand Theft Auto VI (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for November 19, 2026</a>, following another delay). Bran said:</p>



<p><em>If I have gross misconduct on my CV, on my resume for the rest of my life, that is a huge detriment to any future career prospects. Something important to notice as well is you feel shame to be kicked out of work this way. Like, all of us still want to be here. We want our jobs, we want to finish what we were working on. And now the internal shame feel of having this gross misconduct with you forever, it's hard to explain.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>What's happening next? Fred, an organizer from the IWGB, explains it:</p>



<p><em>The immediate goal here is very clear. It's the reinstatement of all 31 workers in the UK who've been fired and the three workers in Toronto. We know that our sister union in Canada is working to support. It's a reinstatement for those workers. It's full compensation for pay lost during this period. It's clear accountability for the way these dismissals have been handled, these very clear, unfair dismissals without procedure, without evidence. So clear accountability from the company, and a commitment to following employment law in the UK in the future.</em></p>



<p><em>What happens next is up to Rockstar. I just wanna be really clear. [...] We've just submitted our legal claim. The ball is in their court to respond. We hope they'll resolve this with us amicably, right? This is, in the end, egregious, and to be honest, shocking. I have never seen a thing like this, not just in the game sector, but in UK trade union organising in the last 20 years. This is the moment where Rockstar can make that right. These are workers who just want to go back to work, to work on a game that they love. If they don't, they've seen what they have to contend with. The force of public feeling is against them on this, and we'll continue to put pressure on them through legal, through demonstrations, speaking about what these workers have experienced.</em></p>



<p>The layoff timing would seem odd if you consider that the studio wouldn't want to part with experienced workers while finishing a project of the magnitude of Grand Theft Auto VI. However, the UK is currently on the verge of passing the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67f6711f555773bbf109e21a/employment-rights-bill-overview.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Employment Rights Bill</a>, which will enhance security for workers starting next year, making this the best time to lay off people if someone really wanted to.</p>



<p>For his part, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games">told IGN</a> that the work culture at the publisher and at Rockstar is 'extraordinary', though he did not make any further comment on the actual layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First, I’m telling you to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966">stop exploiting the ledge grab</a> in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, and now I’m telling you to stop obsessing over something that probably isn’t worth your attention. Sorry to be “mom” here, but I’m pretty sure the Hidden Bunker mystery in Spaceport isn’t really a mystery at all.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-ledge-grab-spaceport-exploit-movement-tech-2000642966"><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Ledge Grab Exploit Is Bad, Actually</a></p> <p>Each map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see various timed events come and go. Some just see the map swapped over to a night theme, while others have dangerous electrical storms. Most recently, a mysterious hidden bunker underneath the Spaceport map was thrown into the rotation. It works like this: After an activation sequence on the surface, players can explore the corridors beneath the map to find some decent loot as well as some computer terminals to download data from. You get 500XP for downloading the data, and earn progress on your weekly Trials, but not much else happens. Fans, however, are not convinced that’s all there is to it (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/arc-raiders-new-hidden-bunker-puzzle-has-players-completely-stumped-3281779/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>).</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://youtu.be/yhQIigWZcZ4">documented by YouTuber The Gaming Merchant</a>, downloading the data in the Hidden Bunker <i>feels</i> like it should make something happen somewhere else or deeper in the Bunker, or like it’s part of a larger puzzle. You press a button, a meter fills up, a light turns green and you get XP, but if you walk away without doing this, the light turns red. There are multiple computer terminals that do this within the Bunker, which has led some to believe that they all either need to be activated at the exact same time or in some unknown sequence. There are more terminals than players the game allows for in a single party, so you’d have to gather together a bunch of randos to fully exhaust the options here, but I’m pretty sure that earning XP and making progress on your Trials is the whole point here: Activate the terminals and defend the room until they’re finished downloading.</p>

 <p>Downloading the data is not as easy as just flipping a switch and walking away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2oTiy1D6l6Q">Gamers Heroes’ video on the Hidden Bunker</a> documents this well. There’s a bit of <i>Siege</i>-esque Defend-The-Room™ required as the Hidden Bunker is likely to be swarming with players looking for other loot.</p>

  <p>Do this successfully, and you earn three stars in your Trials progress.</p> <h2>Is there a secret beneath the Spaceport?</h2> <p>Some folks are not convinced the XP and Trials progress is the point here. They’re running around trying to crack sequences they think exist, or they’re trying to activate them all at the same time, but to no avail.</p>

 <p>Honestly, I think too many folks still have their spinfoil hats on from <i>Destiny</i>.</p> <p>A megathread on the game’s subreddit is presently documenting some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no81af1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">borderline Charlie-Day-meme</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no379fo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">theory crafting</a> about what’s going on here.</p>

   <p>The biggest piece of evidence, in my opinion, that there’s no <i>there there</i> is in a lone comment indicating that the download progress of each computer is different for each player, which would mean it’s a different instance for players outside of your squad and that timing the downloads is nigh impossible because, well, they’re not designed that way. You get your data, you get your XP, you get your Trials progress. That’s it!</p>

When you download the data, a light on the computer turns green. That light, as it turns out, is the same model as found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">Field Depots</a>, of which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2j64j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">there is one sitting right on top of the Hidden Bunker’s location</a>. Another theory concerns the language found on <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ official website describing the event, particularly that “whatever is inside [the Bunker] must be worth the static.” This has folks obsessing over what “static” means.</p> <p>Comments in the megathread indicate that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no2hhan/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a variety of attempted solutions</a>, such as downloading everything at the same time, or downloading the data and then <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no66rp9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">racing to a suspicious location on the map</a>, offer no alternative outcomes. Also, while exploring the Hidden Bunker, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no299el/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">someone managed to fall through the map</a> and, based on their screenshots, there doesn’t appear to be any secret sublayer below. So, various activation methods don’t trigger anything and there don’t appear to be any unlockable portions of the Hidden Bunker.</p> <p>But curious minds aren’t so easily dismayed. Even the fact that the data downloads are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/comment/no57p16/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">required for this week’s Trials</a> has folks suspicious: “I feel like this could either mean that collecting the data for that 500 XP is its own reward,” one reply says, “or this is to incentivize people to run it more and more until someone figures it out.”</p> <p>I think ya had the answer right the first time there.</p> <p>But maybe I’m just a wet blanket of a skeptic as always. I’d like to believe!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-loot-boxes-gambling-roblox-2000642980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-opens-the-loot-box-flood-gates-in-its-race-with-roblox.1350145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Epic Games ended controversial loot box purchases in<em> Fortnite</em> back in 2019, but it’s bringing them back <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">to the battle royale platform</a> as an option for creators in the form of “paid random items.” While there are rules in place about disclosing odds and not targeting minors, loot boxes are essentially back on the menu for the larger <em>Fortnite</em> creator island platform as Epic tries to compete with <em>Roblox</em> for players’ attention and wallets.</p>

 <p>A new developer blog post details Epic’s rules for “<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite">In-Island Transactions Restrictions</a>” that will be available in creator islands in the future, including transactions fueled by RNG. “In addition to your responsibility to comply with laws, you must comply with certain restrictions that apply when offering Paid Random Items,” the company, which makes billions a year from microtransactions, writes. “Failure to utilize the functions described below will constitute a violation of Epic policies. ”</p>

 <p>The policies governing how creators can deploy loot boxes in their games are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Paid Random Items are restricted in Singapore, Qatar, Australia, Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK/Brazil for players under 18 years old.</li> <li>Developers must “disclose the actual numerical odds of what the player may receive before the player makes a purchase.”</li> <li>They must “ensure the language you use relating to transactions is not misleading or overtly pressuring.”</li> <li>They can’t “directly prompt a minor” to buy something.</li> <li>Bundled items in Brazil must be available to purchase individually.</li> </ul> <p>And that’s it. Outside of those restrictions, or any other legal requirements unique to individual countries, <em>Fortnite</em> creators have free rein to design and sell loot boxes however they want. With no shortage of imagination, I’m sure some of them could design very clever and very lucrative systems for both entertaining players and extracting lots of V-Bucks from their virtual wallets.</p>

 <h2>Epic promises it’s not promoting gambling</h2> <p>But Epic Games is adamant that none of this will amount to gambling and that random paid items themselves do not count as such. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-adding-gambling-in-future-update-leaks-reveal/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that the company reached out to the outlet to ask it to remove references to gambling in a recent article covering leaked info about the update, noting that gambling is against <em>Fortnite</em>‘s rules.</p>

 <p>“Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency,” read Epic’s <a href="https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/fortnite/developer-rules">developer terms of service</a>. “Islands that teach or prominently feature images or activities that are typically associated with real-world gambling, casino style games, or games of chance that offer a prize, even if they are not directly simulating a gambling experience, are not permitted in any form.”</p>

 <p>Epic and other companies have been making this argument about loot boxes <a href="https://kotaku.com/esrb-says-it-doesnt-see-loot-boxes-as-gambling-1819363091">for years</a>, claiming that if odds are disclosed and the items can’t be easily resold for actual money, then they don’t count as gambling, even though they otherwise perfectly mirror the experience of a lottery scratch-off. No matter how you define gambling, though, it’s clear loot boxes are <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">designed to exploit people’s psychology</a> to get them to spend money they wouldn’t otherwise part with.</p>

 <h2>The race to keep up with <em>Roblox</em></h2> <p>Why is Epic Games tip-toeing back into a pond that was once so controversial it <a href="https://kotaku.com/u-s-senator-introduces-bill-to-ban-loot-boxes-and-pay-1834612226">led to Congressional hearings and legislative proposals</a>? The most obvious reason is that it’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/17/arts/grow-garden-roblox-record.htm">currently competing with Roblox</a> to operate the platform of choice for user-generated games and the millions of people who play them. It paid out over $350 million <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">to its island creators last year</a>, and announced <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">plans in September</a> to let them start selling in-game items just like regular <em>Fortnite </em>does.</p>

 <p>Roblox, of course, was already doing this. <em>Grow a Garden</em>, one of its biggest surprise hits with concurrent players peaking at over 22 million, is essentially a farming sim with a daily shop that refreshes and where you can spend Robux on microtransactions to acquire rare seeds or make harvesting more efficient. The game isn’t popular in spite of the pay-to-win mechanics underlying it, but in part because of them. The success of gacha games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> and card pack modes like <em>EA Sports FC</em>‘s Ultimate Team shows this isn’t isolated to UGC games either.</p> <p>Epic is currently trying to beat Roblox with a more generous cut of the profits. <em>Fortnite</em> creators can earn 74 percent of in-game sales through the end of the 2026, after which it will drop down to 37 percent. That’s still substantially more than the cut creators are currently getting at Roblox, which only pays out 25 percent of in-game sales. I’m sure none of this will create perverse incentives for what <em>Fortnite</em> creators make moving forward.</p>

<p>The Game Awards continue to grow, and have a new broadcast partner to show for it. Show creator and host Geoff Keighly announced on Tuesday that The Game Awards 2025 will stream on Amazon Prime Video for the first time.</p>



<p>In addition to being on Prime, The Game Awards will continue to stream on YouTube, Twitch, and other platforms. </p>







<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/game-awards-streaming-amazon-prime-video-twitch-1236574939/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> about the news, Keighly said that the fact it’s an additional platform instead of a replacement makes it a “really exciting” addition for the show.</p>



<p><strong>“We’ve had lots of conversations with people over the years, and we’re like, there’s no way, there’s no world where we could ever really take the show off YouTube and Twitch — where it was born back in 2014,” </strong>he said.</p>



<p>Keighly also said that despite being on a large platform like Prime Video, it won’t change how the show is produced and air. He also said that Amazon was receptive about a non-exclusive deal with the show.</p>



<p><strong>“It’s important people know it doesn’t change our show at all,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re still making the same show. I came out of a life of working on television networks. And you had television folks that would give opinions and things on what you want the show to be. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“This is still The Game Awards. It’s the exact same show. They’re really just another distribution outlet, and they’re really letting us build the show the way we always do. We’re not changing anything about the show to accommodate a new platform.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, The Game Awards 2025 will air on Twitch and YouTube like always. On Twitch, however, another first will happen as the show will air in 2K. There will also be Twitch Drops for those watching on the platform.</p>



<p>Are you going to watch The Game Awards on Amazon Prime Video this year, or stick with a traditional platform like YouTube or Twitch?

<p>Players already knew that Rogue and Gambit are coming to Marvel Rivals Season 5, but a new trailer has made it official. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 5 is something players have been looking forward to a lot, especially after knowing which two characters will be taking the center stage in the new season. Rogue and Gambit were already revealed through several leaks and an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ad-rogue-gambit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertisement on TikTok</a>. Now, players have received an official trailer, providing a background for the upcoming season’s plot. </p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-rogue-and-gambit-revealed-through-new-trailer">Marvel Rivals Rogue and Gambit Revealed Through New Trailer</h2>



<p>The official <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1987913327197016501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter) for Marvel Rivals teased yesterday that something new was coming with an invitation to Rogue and Gambit’s wedding. This invitation was followed by a new trailer, where we see the duo gearing up to tie the knot; however, their plans are met with an unforeseen roadblock as a timestream entanglement tears their world apart before Gambit and Rogue can say “I do” on Krakoa. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Love is a Battlefield | Marvel Rivals Season 5 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXOUHb64164?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, Gambit will not let this go so easily and will set forth on a “daring cosmic heist to steal the universe’s rarest ring – and win back the moment time itself stole from them.” The new trailer offers no gameplay details or abilities for the upcoming characters; instead, it features a cinematic video that primarily sets up the narrative for the next season, “Love is a Battlefield”. Marvel Rivals Season 5 is set to release on November 14, 2025, and we can expect to receive more details about the two characters leading up to this date. </p>







<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals’ PvE Zombies mode helped provide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-steam-player-count-spike-pve-mode-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major player spike on Steam</a> recently. Additionally, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delay-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to late 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/10/ignfirst-routine-3-finalpreview-banner-1762810914943.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a lover of puzzle games, what can elevate my puzzle-solving experience more than having horrifying monsters breathing down my neck and ready to snap said neck if I fail to solve their puzzle in time? I love these types of games that keep me on edge for hours on end, so Routine is exactly the type of aesthetically pleasing and brutally tense kinds of horror experience I’m always on the lookout for. And with a deeply cool 80’s-tech lunar setting and the beginnings of a story that has me interested in seeing more, I’m willing to overlook some of the things I was less impressed by during the roughly 90-minute demo, like the fact that the monsters searching for me were about as bright as the desks I hid behind and underneath. It remains to be seen if the story will pay off as much as its promising setting and compelling vibe might imply, but I’ll definitely be diving deeper in the future to see how it shakes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Routine is one of those horror games where you’re forced to run around solving little puzzles while absolutely horrifying monsters stalk the halls, ready to kill you on sight if you fail to avoid their notice – you know, in the same vein as something like Alien: Isolation or My Friendly Neighborhood. That comes with  all the same pros and cons as its genre peers, where you have these really tense moments as you manage to solve a puzzle and rush through a door just before the bad guy you can’t possibly hope to kill catches up with you. But you then also have plenty of instances where you’re stuck in a room waiting for the dumb bad guy to turn around and walk away, leading to lots of moments where the tension sours into a monotonous waiting game. I tend to really enjoy these kinds of protracted hide and seek sequences, even if they do occasionally involve a bit of waiting, so this was right up my alley.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this particular case, I found myself on a moon base that had been taken over by killer humanoid robots, whose lidless, unblinking eyes searched for me as I repaired various broken electrical systems and tried to get through each area unnoticed. The ambience of this dilapidated lunar base with an ‘80’s tech aesthetic really worked for me, clearly drawing inspiration from fellow retro-tech science fiction worlds like Alien. But Routine also brings with it a unique sense of humor, with silly arcade games to play in between sweat-inducing horror sequences and cheeky, non-murderous robot helpers to find along the way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Routine's immaculately creepy vibes, unique retro aesthetic, and tongue-in-cheek jokes in between bouts of utter terror, all coalesce in a way I haven’t seen before.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the biggest ways in which Routine sets itself apart, as its immaculately creepy vibes, unique retro aesthetic, and tongue-in-cheek jokes in between bouts of utter terror, all coalesce in a way I haven’t seen before. I didn’t get a very strong sense of whether or not the story will deliver something worth all the stress and jump scares along the way, but hopefully all this neat worldbuilding will translate into something as awesome as the setting. With some solid environmental storytelling and hints at some kind of mysterious viral disease at work, it has certainly piqued my curiosity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The areas I explored ranged from= fairly unremarkable metallic hallways filled with busted droids and signs of something catastrophic having happened recently to really neat areas like an abandoned arcade with janky retro games to play and a shopping mall littered with debris. And, of course, since the whole thing takes place on a base on the moon, they take every opportunity to give you a nice view of the beautiful majesty of good ol’ Selene. Gotta love that. I’m a tad skeptical that they can manage to keep things interesting when you’re stranded on a fairly generic space station on a barren rock in outer space, but hey, so far so good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although much of the demo I played featured some fairly by-the-numbers puzzles, like finding codes around the world to enter into a keypad to unlock a door, it also had some neat mechanics built around the C.A.T device you’re given early in the story. This tool is basically just a handheld camcorder that can also do things like fire an electrical bolt at targets in your path. What’s cool, though, is that it evolved as I progressed, like when I unlocked an ultraviolet mode called the Ultraview Module that allowed me to see trace substances like bloodstains that helped me solve some of the space station’s more unintuitive riddles. I only unlocked two modes in my time with it, but it’s clear that upgrading this bad boy is going to be the primary way in which you power up, and so far I like that idea quite a bit. It’ll be interesting to see what clever new uses they find for it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While you upgrade your C.A.T., read snippets of lore around the space station, and solve puzzles, you’ll find yourself almost constantly hunted by extremely violent robots that chase after you on sight with intent to kill. Naturally, that makes even the most simple brain teasers that much more stressful, as you spend every other second double-checking over your shoulder, or wincing when you hear a robotic sound come from somewhere nearby. It’s not exactly an original premise, but it’s certainly the classic type of horror gameplay I’ve come to know and love over the years – and something we could definitely use more of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that was a bit disappointing, at least during my extremely early time with the story, is just how easy it was to outsmart the fairly dim robots hunting for me, to the point where I never actually was killed during my time playing. They make a ton of noise as they march around electronically, give up the chase as soon as you start running away since they can’t hope to compete with your speed, and don’t do a very thorough job searching for you if you’re hidden in an obvious corner they haven’t bothered exploring yet. What’s more, one of the abilities you unlock for your C.A.T. early on, is a mode where you can tase the robots chasing you, shorting them out for a second or two to buy valuable time you need to get away, as if it weren’t already easy enough as-is. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t still as intimidating as hell – the robotic shrieks they make every once in a while made my skin crawl, and the few times where they were able to get close without me noticing sent me screaming in the opposite direction. They may not actually be very deadly killers (at least early on), but they’re still pretty damn stressful to be around nonetheless.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/routine-the-final-preview-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> will cost $70 and only be available physically as a Game-Key Card, it appears — something that has stunned some Nintendo fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-confirmed">confirmation of the game's March 5, 2026 release date</a> earlier today, store pages for the highly-anticipated Pokémon life simulation have now gone live, detailing its price and status as a Game-Key card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the U.S., Pokopia is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> to pre-order now for $69.99. In Japan, meanwhile, Pokopia costs 8,980 yen — the same price point as Mario Kart World ($80 in the U.S.), and more than other Nintendo-published titles such as Donkey Kong Bananza and even Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's Japanese <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/pocoapokemon/ja/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> specifically lists Pokopia's physical edition as a Game-Key card, and while the same information isn't shown in the U.S., Nintendo has simulataneously published a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ldQYMwzWrY&amp;t=15s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> instructing users on how "Game-Key Cards on Nintendo Switch 2" work — which uses Pokémon Pokopia as an example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Game-Key Cards have proven controversial among Nintendo fans who dislike the fact that the cartridges only contain a prompt to download the game, rather than its full game data. That means you do need to connect your Switch 2 online after buying the game, and then also need to wait while it downloads. However, Game-Key Cards differ from digital downloads as they can still be re-sold or shared with others — just like a regular game cartridge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> that it had "no plans to use Game-Key Cards for Nintendo-developed titles" — something some fans today have pointed to as a broken promise. But, of course, Pokémon is not a solely Nintendo-owned franchise and Nintendo does not develop Pokémon games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Nintendo <em>is</em> publishing Pokémon Pokopia, and this does appear to be the first Nintendo-published game offered on a Game-Key Card. But this is also a game developed by Koei Tecmo — which, last time we checked, was not a Nintendo development studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, Nintendo announced a new trailer for Pokémon Pokopia will debut later this week on Thursday, November 13 at 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern, or 2pm UK. Eagle-eyed fans believe the video will feature over 10 minutes of gameplay — suggesting Nintendo is confident in what it has to show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/shuhei-yoshida-top-games-exam-cheat/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shuhei-yoshida-reveals-his-top-games-and-how-he-cheated-at-his-exams.1350079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Former President of Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, indie game and PS Vita champion, and much-missed industry star Shuhei Yoshida has appeared on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Perfect Console with Simon Parkin</a> podcast and revealed his top five games.</p>
<p>Before we get into those, can I recommend you check out the full podcast at some point, it’s a really great listen with lots of wonderful stories about PlayStation and game development. You can find the podcast on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/my-perfect-console-with-simon-parkin/id1665581266" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6PzHHkwpOs8YFgzqoKRXAi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify</a> and all the usual places.</p>


<p>On to his game choices and the first title he picked was PlayStation 3 and Vita classic,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey/"> <strong>Journey</strong></a></p>
<p>“The impact the game had to human emotions was so powerful,&nbsp;I don’t remember any other game (doing that) before Journey,” said Shu. “People played the game and had tears in their eyes, so that shows the power of the medium and at the same time power of indie games.”</p>
<p><iframe title="JOURNEY | 10 Year Anniversary Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FZkTXs3Td8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was another PS Vita game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sound-shapes/"><strong>Sound Shapes.</strong></a></p>

<p>“What was brilliant about the game was it allowed ou to create your own levels. As you play the game, you gain these objects and you are free to lay out and draw things. That was such a creative game,&nbsp;especially when you play on PS Vita. (PS Vita) has touch, so it is very easy to lay out your level and because you play with headphones and the music, it’s really kind of perfect on PS Vita.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Shapes™Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zfPbJE6XDxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>His third choice is<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/inscryption/"> <strong>Inscryption</strong></a>, a PC game published by Devolver Digital that eventually made it to PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to talk about the game because I don’t want to create a spoiler,” said Shu. “I really want people to try this game without any knowledge. This is one of the games that makes me want to erase my memory so I can replay the game.”</p>
<p>“I played through the game twice because I really, really loved it, but the first time I played, I went, “What?”, you know, “What’s going on?” It’s such an amazing creative work by this, you know, young individual Daniel Mullins, and it was really fun.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Inscryption | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aneRbQGRIMc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fourth game is another indie title, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/before-your-eyes/"><strong>Before Your Eyes</strong></a>. The game is the story of a young boy and it has a unique method of control, the game advances when you blink. Shu explained how he convinced the young developers to bring the game to PS VR2.</p>
<p>“I met them at a BAFTA pre-event gala. Everybody is dressed up and there are these two youngsters who looked like the didn’t know what to do, and so I talked to them! Because PSVR 2 has the eye tracking it’s the best way to play Before Your Eyes because you are put in exactly the position of the boy and you’re able to see the scene from boy’s perspective. I want every single human being to try this game because this game’s amazing.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Before Your Eyes - Launch Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9OhfCk51Mo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Finally is a PC and console game from last year, <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nine-sols/">Nine Sols.</a></strong></p>
<p>“It was my Game of the Year game last year,” said Shu. “There are many Souls-like games and Metroidvania game but they came up with unique, secular-like, 2D action game with beautiful graphics and really interesting stories and amazing, amazing gameplay.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NineSols - Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYJLa2HOQhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Shu also revealed that his degree in Economics is probably not worth the paper it is written on.</p>
<p>“I majored in economics,” he explains. “Not that I was interested in economcs, but I knew that it’s so easy to graduate from university if I major in economics. Especially at Kyoto University, it was notorious that they just let people graduate. I didn’t even have to attend the classes.”</p>
<p>“There’s only one exam per year for each class and it was pre-announced so people who attended the classes created the ideal answers, and that was distributed. We just copied that into our paper and submit it!”</p>
