			<p>Former Bungie developers are speaking out about the problems Bungie is facing internally, and all signs point to leadership and structural issues following Sony's acquisition of Bungie, and a human resources department, or at least, a single member of that department, covering up internal issues of harassment for personal gain on their exit from the studio.</p>
<p>Internal issues at Bungie, unfortunately, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-was-never-in-development-bungie-will-now-be-run-by-playstation-studios-head-say-insiders/">aren't anything new</a>, but this latest slew of details comes from Destin Legarie, who published a video on his YouTube channel after speaking to former Bungie developers. Many of the comments are quite damning, and paint the picture of a Bungie that is not the same studio it once was when every first-person shooter fan on the planet couldn't wait to see what they would do next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Inside Bungie’s Decline: Former Devs Speak Out" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No direct names were mentioned in the video as to who the former Bungie employees were calling out, everything was kept in more general terms with just the word 'leadership' being used to represent Bungie's top brass.</p>
<p>All of this came about after Bungie was caught using artwork and/or art assets from another artist without their permission or crediting them for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">the fourth time in recent years</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed</em>," a former Bungie developer told Legarie. Another quote went further, saying "<em>Bungie's problem stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture.</em>"</p>
<p>Another quote reads "<em>Internal language shifted from 'studio,' 'games,' and 'players,' to 'company,' 'product,' and 'customers,' during the Sony acquisition,</em>" highlighting how the studio has seemingly shifted its viewpoint that making good games for players to enjoy is no longer the ultimate goal, and is instead making games that make <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/21/more-bungie-reveals-from-destiny-2-subscriptions-to-eververse-demands/">as much money as possible</a>.</p>
<p>There have been negative stories about internal problems at the Destiny 2 developer for the past couple of years, and morale certainly can't be helped by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">layoffs the studio has suffered</a>. All of leadership might be part of the problem, which is what seems to be the speculation in this video, but as Legarie points out, the buck has to stop somewhere, and in the case of Bungie, that's with chief executive officer Pete Parsons.</p>
<p>It's extremely unfortunate that the studio behind Halo and Destiny, two of the biggest shooter franchises in video game history, is facing all of this, and could see its end due to its allegedly greedy and inconsiderate leaders who have lost the plot, and the fact that if not for the studio making games that people wanted to play in the first place, none of them would be where they are.</p>

Reminiscent of the Nintendo Switch Online classic games library, the collection includes <em>Pitfall, Grand Prix, </em>and more than 50 other Activision titles from the 1980s and 1990s. It’s not as many titles as the 1,300 retro games that Antstream, Microsoft’s partner in the offering, has available on its streaming service, but it won’t cost Game Pass subscribers any extra.</p><p>Retro Classics, which Microsoft writes is part of its “commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility, is available on Xbox consoles, PC, or via Xbox cloud gaming on compatible devices like some LG and Samsung smart TVs, and the Meta Quest headset. Other games included in the collection include <em>Cosmic Ark, Mechwarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, </em>and <em>Atlantis.</em></p><p>Based on screenshots, it looks like the collection will include titles from the original PlayStation, the SNES, MS-DOS, and more. Players will be able to collect achievements and participate in events like tournaments and community challenges, as well. Microsoft says this is only the start: the collection will expand to include more than 100 games from Activision and Blizzard, eventually. Like Nintendo’s retro collection, you’re out of luck if you don’t have Microsoft’s gaming subscription, as the titles in the collection aren’t available for sale separately.</p><p>Antstream Arcade <a href="https://www.antstream.com/post/xbox-launches-retro-classics-for-game-pass-powered-by-antstream">separately announced</a> a temporary deal for Game Pass subscribers. Until June 4th, members can sign up for a year of access to Antstream’s library, which includes more than 1,300 games, for $9.99 via the Microsoft Store.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Once you learn that gimmick, and get into some of the deep skills in his tree, though, Verso can become the linchpin of your team. We’ll show you how. </p><h2 id="h125953"><a id="1"></a>Basic kit</h2><figure id="" data-id="80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-recommend-id="image://80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-recommend-id="image://80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, one of the things right upfront that eases the Gustave-to-Verso transition is the fact that <strong>he immediately inherits all of the weapons you collected as Gustave</strong>. Remember back in the day when a party member left, and they’d take all the good armor and weapons with them? God, we lived as savages in the 90s. </p><p>Anyway, that means you’ve got a nice deep armory of sword options to start with. That said, sticking with Verso’s basic loadout for a bit is the best way to go, given that <strong>he’s the only character who can wield Light magic right out of the gate</strong> without having to prime the skill (i.e. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">Lune’s Mayhem</a></span>). </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>This is handy as all the enemies in the first major area you get to after Verso joins up are weak to Light. You’ll get plenty of practice if you just stay the course of the main story. In addition, it’s not quite his default loadout per se, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dualliste-phase-2-verso-1851781495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dualliste-phase-2-verso-1851781495">the Dualliste boss</a></span> at the end of that area drops the Dualliso sword. This allows Verso a second turn after a basic attack To get such a weapon so early after obtaining him makes it worth mentioning as a crucial part of his kit, especially because of his... </p><h2 id="h125954"><a id="2"></a>Special mechanic: Perfection</h2><figure id="" data-id="4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-recommend-id="image://4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-recommend-id="image://4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Devil May Cry</em> fans will be right at home with this mechanic. Verso basically just has that game’s ranking system as a gimmick. Very simply, you start at grade D, and landing attacks, dodging, and parrying all add a certain amount of Perfection Points that raise the grade from D, C, B, A, all the way up to S, with points taken away if you take a hit.</p><p>The twist, however, is that while all of Verso’s skills get a damage boost depending on his rank, many of them also have a specific rank where they are enhanced even further. Using an ability tied to a specific letter rank that Verso has achieved enables a secondary effect. This can be anything from earning more Perfection if the attack hits, to dealing more damage, or it can even make expensive skills cheaper. </p><p>An excellent example here is Verso’s Perfect Break Skill. By itself, it’s a pretty powerful Light attack. However, if you hit it while you’re exactly at Rank B, it only costs five AP to cast (down from seven). So, while getting to rank S does have its benefits, building your offense around specific ranks—especially in the early goings of Act II—is where the real fun lies. It’s not always about racing to get an S lined up for him.</p><h2 id="h125955"><a id="3"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><figure id="" data-id="4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-recommend-id="image://4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-recommend-id="image://4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s another running aspect of Verso’s skill tree that, while not necessarily a core gimmick, does deserve shouting out. That’s the fact that there are quite a few skills predicated on sacrificing either health, status, or rank to either benefit the party, or dealing absurd amounts of damage. That’s actually a really well-implemented way to tie combat in with his place in the narrative, but it also means that on top of being able to build a character based around skills hovering around a certain rank, <strong>if you’re willing to take a risk, you can build Verso into a devastating glass cannon.</strong></p><p>Even if you don’t go fully down that road,<strong> Berserk Slash should be a permanent skill for any Verso player.</strong> It allows him to deal more damage the less health he has left. If you feel like getting extra nuts, pair that up with Overload (gives nine AP, immediately jumps Verso to Rank S, but drops his health to one point), and watch Berserk Slash send your enemies screaming into the goddamn Shadow Realm. </p><p>This is a safer strategy once you get ahold of the Cheater Picto from beating Sprong (the massive Nevron hanging out in the ocean)—and it’s one of those combos that can utterly break the game once you get the Painted Power Picto that removes the 9,999 damage cap. There’s glory waiting for those who can walk the edge of life and death with Verso. </p><p>But hey, if you’d like to keep your boy safe and still do a number on enemies, there’s plenty of options for that too. As mentioned, the Dualliso blade you get from the Dualliste grants a second turn after a basic attack, Pair that up with Energizing Shots (20-percent of Free Aim shots go back to you in AP) and Blitz (grants another turn), and you can absolutely monopolize an enemy if you get lucky enough. Pair Strike Storm up with any Pictos that enhance critical hits, and you’re almost always guaranteed to hit Rank S in no time. Once you get into the latter portions of Act II, you can basically just spam that and Perfect Stars—his most powerful Light attack—and you’ll put a whole lotta Nevros in the dirt. </p><p>In the early going, though, your options will be a bit more limited. Depending how not-adept you are at dodges and parries, it’s perfectly viable to build Verso’s whole loadout around staying at C rank. Berserk Slash and Strike Storm both benefit at that rank, which helps the case, but you can also build Verso as a support character using Leadership and Paradigm Shift (both granting AP to the rest of the team). In which case, you’ll want to pick up the Lanceram sword at some point in your journey, since it guarantees you’ll never drop lower than C. </p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ara: History Untold's upcoming DLC, Untold Scenarios, will arrive on PC this coming June 18, 2025, developer Oxide Games has announced.</p>
<p>The expansion will be available for $9.99 USD, and will include several scenarios that blend historical events with alternative history to create 'what-if' scenarios for "<em>more event-driven strategic challenges</em>," according to a press release for the upcoming expansion.</p>
<p>While Ara: History Untold is playable through Xbox Game Pass PC, that's only for the base game. If you want to play any of these new scenarios, you'll need to grab the DLC on its own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold | Dev Q&amp;A | Ep. 9" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCsXUG3ZsyA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ara: History Untold arrived on PC and through Game Pass PC last September, and overall arrived as "<em>a mixed bag,"&nbsp;</em>according to our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/">reviewer, Chris Wray</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is the perfect example of a mixed bag. Some genuinely great ideas, but some negatives are trying to counterbalance them. Focusing on supply chains and adding real to is an excellent idea, but the implementation has left the game with significant micromanagement, which could put people off. The region and city development systems are on a whole new level and could be how 4X games go in the future, but the AI manages to mess it</em> up," he wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Ara: History Untold is a highly ambitious 4X game that looks to branch out and add even more depth to an already detailed genre. In many ways, it succeeds, bringing in a map and city-building system that far surpasses others in the genre and successfully interlinking practically every area. However, with some successes come issues, with the added depth in the supply chain making it a bit of a micromanagement nightmare; it tries to alleviate some of these issues with a user-friendly UI, but it could be a sticking point for some.</em>"</p>

Lost In Cult is one of a growing number of smaller companies now trying not only to preserve that history but to celebrate it with physical releases as artfully constructed as the games they contain. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Known for its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lostincult.co.uk/001-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/001-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lock On</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lostincult.co.uk/animalwell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/animalwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Design Works</em></a></span> series of lavish printed volumes of art and writing about games, the UK-based publisher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lostincult.co.uk/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this week announced</a></span> a new Editions label that will be packaging and distributing bespoke physical versions of acclaimed indie titles. The debut releases are interactive film puzzler <em>Immortality</em>, the folk horror point-and-click adventure <em>The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow</em>, and the absurdist comedy <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here! </em>though in addition to these, <em>Lost In Cult </em>promises it already has lots of games in the pipeline, with new collections to be announced on an almost monthly basis. </p><p>“People might think that we’ve selected our best games to start with,” marketing director Ryan Brown told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We actually haven’t. We’ve pretty much just released them in the order that we’ve signed them, because one thing we wanted to do right is not just in optically, in front of people, but also behind the scenes with our developer partners, like we want to make sure that they’re treated right, that they don’t get contracted and have to wait many years for the games to be released.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-recommend-id="image://6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-format="png" data-width="955" data-height="537" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost In Cult / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-recommend-id="image://6ab91e8d52c0bac7dffa80b95c3090a8" data-format="png" data-width="955" data-height="537" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each collection runs roughly $80 and includes colorful boxed sleeves, posters, art cards, slip cases, and booklets featuring critical essays and developer interviews. Also a copy of the game with curator group Does It Play’s seal of approval certifying that everything is playable to completion right out of the box. Brown said they’re even working with some developers to time upcoming releases to when big new patches are ready so the physical version feels definitive. The platforms currently supported are PlayStation 5 and Switch, with Switch 2 following later in the year. Xbox remains MIA, though it’s not off the table for future releases.</p><p>In just 24 hours since the announcement, the company has already sold through almost half of its limited-run collections of around 1,500 units each. But anyone who wants just a physical copy of one of the games being sold will still be able to secure retail versions for just $40 each. Those won’t come with original art or the rest of the materials that make Lost In Cult’s collections stand out, but they will be restocked on an ongoing basis. </p><p>“I don’t think you can say that you’re all about preservation if you make a game and then it’s limited to 2,000 copies and it’s gone forever and costs 300 pounds on eBay,” Brown said. “For us, in promising preservation and availability, we don’t want to lock these games away. There’s going to be so many people that just want the game in a box and that’s fine. They can go do that.”</p><p>The Criterion Collection, A24, and special-edition book publisher The Folio Society are cited as inspirations for Lost in Cult’s Editions publishing label, both in how games are presented and how they’re selected in the first place. “It’s really hard to pin down what that curation process looks like without sounding too overly artsy fartsy, but it is a little bit artsy fartsy, and that, you know, we kind of just know what a Lost in Cult-type game is when we see it. And that’s really hard to define, but it is a game that is usually very artful, whether that’s through its design, through its visuals, through its story. Again, that is in some way pushing the medium of video games as a serious form of art forward.”</p><p>The physical medium of gaming also faces certain limitations that movies and books do not. For one, platform holders like PlayStation and Nintendo have strict rules about the certification process for physical games, down to where company logos and legal language appear on the boxes. You also can’t include developer commentary or other extras directly on a disc the way you might with an Ultra HD 4K Blu-ray re-release. When it comes to the rest of the packaging and physical inserts, however, publishers can let their imaginations run wild. </p><figure id="" data-id="bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-recommend-id="image://bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lost In Cult / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-recommend-id="image://bda6b5734e9b5e72b2a01881fc40cef0" data-format="png" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A devotion to physical media in the increasingly digi-fied gaming space adds Lost in Cult to a growing landscape of boutique curators who scavenge for smaller indie titles that wouldn’t otherwise have the scale or notoriety to play in a market still mostly structured around big retail stores. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Fellow travelers include Limited Run, iam8bit, and Super Rare</a></span>, where Brown worked previously. These companies serve collectors and fans who still cherish not just how a game plays but what it looks like when it’s displayed on a shelf, and knowing the magical experience that resides inside isn’t reliant on servers a thousand miles a way to bring it to life.</p><p>“The way that we see games is just very different from how most do, like I personally care, slash we care, [that] if I pull a game off of my shelf in 40 years time I [can] go, ‘I remember that game, I want to play that.” You can pull it off your shelf, you can play it, and it’ll work. Most companies, unfortunately, aren’t really thinking about that.”</p><p>While big publishers frequently invest in Deluxe Editions and Collector’s Editions, they more often prioritize digital rewards and branded merch over the games themselves and highlighting their artistry.

But at the moment it is increasingly on boutique companies to solve this physical problem. And it seems a bit far-fetched for me to sit here and say I wish it wasn’t, because I have one, but I do wish it wasn’t.  I do wish that this was taken seriously, and the sort of presentational aspects and ownership aspects were taken seriously across the board. I would love it if some other companies copied us.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-ubisoft-is-giving-rayman-an-aaa-revival-after-last-years-exploration-phase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Remember Ubisoft's announcement last October it was currently in the "exploration phase" of a new Rayman project? Well, it seems full development has now been given the go ahead, with a recent job listing indicating the publisher is currently staffing up on a "AAA" Rayman game.
</p>
<p>
To rewind a bit, all this came about following reports last year that Ubisoft had assembled a small group of developers - including around a dozen members of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-development-team-disbanded">now-disbanded Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown team</a> - to work on a remake of Rayman. Somewhat unusually, Ubisoft didn't immediately reach for the 'does not comment on rumours or speculation' button, instead confirming that, yes actually, it was sort of true. "We are pleased to confirm Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan have recently started an exploration phase on the Rayman brand," it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">said at the time</a>. "The project is still in its early stages, and we will share more details later."
</p>
<p>
There was a sense, then, that nothing might come of the project if that "exploration phase" didn't bring encouraging results. But it now appears those initial experiments showed sufficient promise, because Ubisoft Milan is currently <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000060046042-3d-gameplay-animator-rayman-brand">seeking a 3D gameplay animator</a> to work on a "prestigious AAA title for the Rayman brand." There's also a second, slightly less specific job listing <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/744000058351278-senior-game-designer-rayman-brand">searching for a senior game designer</a> to "work on the Rayman brand", but it seems likely both positions are related to the same project.

<p>
So that's some encouraging news for Rayman fans, particularly given Ubisoft Montpellier and Milan's historically stellar output. Between them, the studios have released the acclaimed likes of Mario + Rabbids, the beautiful Valiant Hearts series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-origins">Rayman Origins</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a> - two absolutely gold-standard 2D platformers.
</p>
<p>
The only troubling element of Rayman's revival is last year's controversial admission by Ubisoft that original Rayman creator Michel Ancel had been drafted in as a consultant. Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">departed the publisher in 2020</a>, allegedly following an investigation into employee complaints accusing him of toxic leadership, and his involvement with the new Rayman project was reported to have "raised some concerns among team members". It is, however, unclear if Ancel is still serving as a consultant now Ubisoft's initial "exploration phase" appears to be complete.
</p>
<p>
Signs that Rayman may be making a "AAA" return come at a challenging time for Ubisoft. The publisher has  faced a tumultuous few years amid tumbling share prices and a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">high-profile flops</a>, resulting in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">string of layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">studio closures</a>. As part of its attempts to right the ship, Ubisoft announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary dedicated to its big three IPs</a> - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry - earlier this year. With those game under a new banner, Ubisoft itself will concentrate on a number of key areas, including "nurturing the development of iconic franchises" - which is presumably where Rayman comes in.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-most-popular-window-air-conditioner-has-disappeared-from-store-shelves.1195668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The Midea U-Shaped AC was a breakthrough. This week, it disappeared. Credit: Midea Group</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In 2020 I reviewed <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-ultra-quiet-window-air-conditioner-has-the-most-ge-1844313001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new and novel device for Gizmodo</a>: the Midea U-Shaped Air Conditioner. It combined a few simple innovations: an inverter that made it less noisy than other window units and a groove in the middle that allowed the window to partially pass through it, radically reducing the noise. Though annoying to install and not without its quirks, it has since become the go-to pick for everyone trying to cool their house. In the last week or so, it has vanished from store shelves.</p><p>I cannot stress how popular the Midea has become. Not only is it the main pick for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-air-conditioner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best air conditioner</a> for The Wirecutter, <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-window-air-conditioners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, <a href="https://www.techgearlab.com/topics/electronics/best-window-air-conditioner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Gear Lab</a>, and various other publications, but The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/best-air-conditioner-midea-window-u-shape-f0a246ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ran a glowing profile</a> about the four years that went into its design. This is all for good reason, as it is simply far quieter than almost every window unit on the market that doesn’t have a similar design, with notable competition being Windmill, the GE Profile ClearView and a fairly new unit from Hisense. By using the window as a sound barrier, less noise is transferred into the house. This design not only allows the unit to operate at tolerable noises in the summer, it also ingeniously lets you open your window should you want to let some fresh in. It even features wifi, although I have been trying for years to find a drop-in controller to make it run local only (there is a <a href="https://github.com/geoffdavis/esphome-mitsubishiheatpump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half-finished github project devoted to just this</a>.).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Midea U AC Installation Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5AIKmLvIKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The rate at which the Midea overtook New York City was astounding. We are a city of old buildings with cheap landlords, and the unit offered a massive quality of life upgrade. Walking through the city and looking at the windows, it’s hard to miss its iconic profile on at least one window on every residential street. It regularly would be sold at rock bottom prices; less than a month ago I saw a mountain of them at the entrance of my local Costco.&nbsp;</p><p>But when I went to go check for sales on an additional unit recently, I was surprised to find Costco did not have them in stock. In fact, nobody had them in stock. Amazon, Home Depot, even Midea’s own site has them out of stock, right before their busiest season. The most popular window air conditioner has suddenly vanished.</p><p>The first signs started appearing this week on r/airconditioning. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AirConditioners/comments/1kmrodf/midea_ushaped_window_ac_units_removed_from_sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiple</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AirConditioners/comments/1kmwxz6/the_reason_for_the_midea_u_acs_being_pulled_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts </a>noticed the absence of the unit on store shelves. At first it appeared to be localized to the United States, although someone who follows me said they contacted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jessienab.bsky.social/post/3lpoo5s365k2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canadian tech support</a>, which would suggest something of larger scale if true. Several people speculated about the rationale, and it remains unclear if this is simply a stop sale or a major recall, but signs seem to point to a perennial problem these units face: mold.</p><figure><figcaption>One interaction I had with Midea Tech Support. I will update this if I hear back with an official statement.</figcaption></figure><p>For my own part, I reached out to tech support twice and attempted to contact Midea corporate multiple times, although the publicly listed phone number for Midea’s corporate office appears to be disconnected. Both tech support people confirmed that the units had been taken off of store shelves. One tech support member on the phone used the word “recall,” while another confirmed that the issue was a concern involving mold. I have reached out to Midea for comment, and will update if I hear back. I also called the Consumer Product Safety Commission, but they told me they had not received any update regarding Midea in an official capacity.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Midea U Shape A/C Mods. Warning This Will Void Your Warranty!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQSixXZT9-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Mold is an issue that is common in many air conditioners, people simply do not clean them enough, but the Midea U-shaped air conditioner has been singled out on YouTube and Reddit many times for this. Though I cannot confirm the current issue is the same, one basic issue is that condensation pools at the bottom (seemingly to assist evaporation) and that condensation can get frankly nasty – I have had to clean sludge out of mine multiple times during the summer months. Many people attempted to fix this by modifying their units, drilling holes in the bottom to allow pooled water to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, people have commented that the interior fan is basically impossible to clean without removing the finger guard. I have done this mod as well, removing the guard with flush cutters, and can confirm that it has made the experience of cleaning the guts of the device far easier for me personally, although I am not recommending you modify an air conditioner.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How to Clean a Moldy Midea U-Shaped AC Air Conditioner | NOT EASY!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wMZkCYNl2Bs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>It would seem that Midea was aware of some of these concerns. In the last few years, they updated the unit to have a removable drain plug, seemingly mirroring the mod that appeared on YouTube. This makes the choice of a possible recall more interesting. Was the drain plug mod an insufficient answer for a recurring issue of mold? Is the mold issue something that exists independently of water pooling at the bottom of the unit?&nbsp; Was mold the reason Midea pulled the unit from shelves?&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to all this, I wanted to know exactly what this looked like on the ground, so I went to Costco. A manager confirmed that the 12,000 BTU unit had been pulled from shelves, but was vague on details. When I talked to a crew member, he confirmed what I suspected: all the Midea U shaped units in stock had been sent back.&nbsp;</p><p>Midea Group is a juggernaut, a huge Chinese company that is the original manufacturer for more appliances than you even know. I do not know if this will be a blip in the company’s history or something potentially larger. But it seems significant to me that the most popular window AC unit has gone away, following a roiling tariff war and right before summer. And that’s a shame, because for its many, many flaws, it’s not a bad air conditioner.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-journals"><h3>Clair Obscur’s Real Heroes Came Before Expedition 33</h3></a><p>The game's journals can be helpful, insightful, or just really funny</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/going-rogue-galactic-andor-star-wars-rogue-one-tabletop"><h3>Tabletop Game Going Rogue Puts The Revolution Back In Star Wars</h3></a><p>Jess Levine, designer of Going Rogue, talks political organizing and taking the Disney out of Star Wars</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/suplex-wrestling-love-letter"><h3>A Love Letter To The Suplex, Wrestling’s Greatest Move</h3></a><p>If you ever get suplexed in real life, you probably deserved it and it was raw as fuck</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In part of a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-reliable-insider-suggest-sonys-next-event-will-be-in-september-skipping-not-e3-season.1195542/">ResetEra</a> thread, insider John Harker suggests that Sony and PlayStation won't hold an event this summer, and that instead players should look to September for when the next big event, whether a showcase or State Of Play, should happen.</p>
<p>Responding to a different user who was speculating that there would be a September event, Harker, in agreement, responded, "<em>Indeed</em>." PlayStation has commonly hosted events between late August and September, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise if there was an event in that part of the year.</p>
<p>Harker has previously been a reliable source, though even still, it's worth taking what is a small suggestion towards an event in September with a grain of salt. Right now, after Death Stranding 2, there's really nothing that we know about in the summer coming from PlayStation.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be that PlayStation doesn't have anything loaded for the summer and is holding out until it can have a big blowout presentation in September. But it's not out of the question that PlayStation will hold an event focused on its third-party partners, with currently unannounced games to show or games that don't yet have release dates getting a summer date set, to hold players off until we get some insight into what PlayStation first-party has been up to sometime in September.</p>
<p>The last State of Play event we had (that wasn't a game-specific event, like the Borderlands 4 one), was this past <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">February</a>. A third-party showcase for the summer, followed by a first-party State of Play or Showcase event in September, sounds about right as far as the kind of cadence these events usually happen with.</p>
<p>At the time of writing in the latter half of May, we're all looking towards Summer Game Fest for the next batch of big announcements. We could see PlayStation sneak in before SGF 2025 kicks off, as it has done before, or after, with some kind of smaller event ahead of their bigger showcase in September, if Harker is right about that.</p>

The group is told that they’re defending <em>something</em> within the walls of the school that is vital to humanity’s survival against the Invaders, but before they can be told what they’re actually defending, Sirei, the ghost-like mascot in charge of the whole operation, is found massacred by an unknown assailant, his remains discarded in a trash can. The “Last Defense Squad” is left with no real explanation for their mission, but they have to defend the school for 100 days, lest everyone they’ve ever known and loved be doomed to an agonizing death at the hands of the Invaders.</p><p>The uncertainty that springs up from Sirei’s early demise is a key part of the tension across all 100 days in the Last Defense Academy. Some of the students have agreed to fight in this war, while others have to be convinced to take up a weapon in the game’s turn-based tactical battles. As the war goes on, people betray each other and mysteries are uncovered, and by the time you reach day 100, there’s still a lot you don’t know.</p><p>I’m gonna get into some major spoiler territory here, because talking about what makes <em>The Hundred Line </em>such an incredible game, one worthy of being seen as a contender for 2025’s Game of the Year, requires me to blow the lid off of some of its secrets. I fully understand that not everyone wants to see something get cracked wide open as they listen to a game recommendation, but I do believe that if the initial premise isn’t enough to fully win you over, hearing about the full scope of what <em>The Hundred Line </em>offers might push you over the edge. I’ve talked to people who had no interest in playing the game until I told them about the midgame twist, and then they completely changed their tune.<em>&nbsp;</em><br></p><figure id="" data-id="b95ad127b75289f2d5a4385acd992c17" data-recommend-id="image://b95ad127b75289f2d5a4385acd992c17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi closes his eyes with the text &quot;Return to the Past?&quot; and a Yes or No dialogue box in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Takumi closes his eyes with the text &quot;Return to the Past?&quot; and a Yes or No dialogue box in front of him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b95ad127b75289f2d5a4385acd992c17" data-recommend-id="image://b95ad127b75289f2d5a4385acd992c17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi closes his eyes with the text &quot;Return to the Past?&quot; and a Yes or No dialogue box in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you approach the 100th day of your mission as the Last Defense Squad, pretty much everything that could have gone wrong has. You’ve lost people, the mission was a failure, and all that’s really left to do is take your team’s escape pod and reunite with the rest of humanity’s doomed remnants. However, throughout this series of unfortunate events, protagonist Takumi Sumino has gotten an unintended upgrade. Each member of the Last Defense Squad has a “Specialist Skill” in combat that lets them do something their teammates can’t. Eito, the team’s scythe wielder, gains random buffs each time he attacks, for instance. Meanwhile Ima, the group’s troublemaking little shit, becomes more powerful when his sister, Kako, is below a certain health threshold. And Takumi has the ability to reset turns in battle if you find yourself in a pickle. Because of some of the late-game reveals, Takumi’s Specialist Skill goes into overdrive, and he becomes able to go back farther than one battle. In fact, he can go back all 100 days and try this entire mission over. Maybe this time he’ll succeed.</p><p>When I reached this reveal while playing the game before its release, I felt a mix of awe and anxiety. The latter was only because I was on a deadline and was taken aback upon realizing that <em>The Hundred Line </em>was going to be, at a minimum, twice as long as I was expecting. But holy shit, finding out that what you thought was the full game was basically just a 30-hour prologue for the real thing is a bonkers twist not many developers can pull off. <em>The Hundred Line </em>is a collaborative effort led by <em>Danganronpa </em>creator Kazutaka Kodaka and <em>Zero Escape </em>lead Kotaro Uchikoshi, two writers known for huge narrative swings, and if you asked me to pick two game developers who could pull off such a maddening, ambitious twist, I would have likely chosen them.</p><figure id="" data-id="4339a84ab4af80d375eefedbe000d94e" data-recommend-id="image://4339a84ab4af80d375eefedbe000d94e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hundred Line chapter select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hundred Line chapter select screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4339a84ab4af80d375eefedbe000d94e" data-recommend-id="image://4339a84ab4af80d375eefedbe000d94e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hundred Line chapter select screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kodaka and Uchikoshi’s collaboration here sees each one’s creative tendencies brought to their most extreme. <em>The Hundred Line</em>’s first half is full of <em>Danganronpa</em>’s signature school life, ham-fisted (complimentary) themes of hope and despair, and the same disruptive slapstick humor that frustrates as much as it delights. The second half is when <em>Zero Escape</em>’s time travel<em> </em>influence takes over, and Takumi’s second chance at success adds a new layer to the storytelling: branching paths. You’ve seen this whole thing play out once already. Surely you can use all that knowledge to find the “good” ending, right? It’s up to you to make the right decisions, save everyone, and uncover every truth hiding within Last Defense Academy’s walls. This stretch of <em>The Hundred Line </em>has you repeatedly walking through an elaborate time loop, keeping your hand against the wall and feeling your way through every turn in the dark, hoping you’re on the right path.</p><p>Some choices feel small, such as whether or not to reveal a secret to the group you only know because you’ve experienced these 100 days before, but doing so can completely change a route’s trajectory in ways you can’t anticipate. You might think you’re doing everything right, but by the time you reach the end of a route, your choices may have snowballed into something unsalvageable. If moving through hours of compelling narrative branches just to find yourself at a dead end sounds more frustrating to you than rewarding, I understand, but as someone who is always drawn in by Kodaka’s grandiose, exaggerated themes and writing, I’ve been enjoying seeing just how many ways this team can riff on the same concept.</p><p>I’ve spoken to several others who have been chipping away at <em>The Hundred Line </em>and learned about routes I couldn’t have even fathomed. I guess there have to be some pretty wild variations for there to be 100 endings. I don’t know that I want to put in the work to see them all, but I will find the true ending if it’s the last thing I do.</p><figure id="" data-id="ac4308881cc5675113b4acee9ff2c671" data-recommend-id="image://ac4308881cc5675113b4acee9ff2c671" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac4308881cc5675113b4acee9ff2c671" data-recommend-id="image://ac4308881cc5675113b4acee9ff2c671" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kodaka has been pretty candid about the fact that securing funding for <em>The Hundred Line </em>put Too Kyo Games into a great amount of debt, and despite some high praise and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1921370017678946504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1921370017678946504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decent sales</a></span>, the studio is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loa6no5b2c2j&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loa6no5b2c2j" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“still on the brink of going under.”</a></span> While nothing has quite reached the highs of Kodaka’s work on <em>Danganronpa </em>for me, I have a lot of love for the studio’s projects like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span><em> </em>and the <em>Akudama Drive </em>anime. I enjoyed those projects, but <em>The Hundred Line </em>feels like Too Kyo Games finally finding its footing. Its premise is such an incredible Hail Mary that it would be an absolute tragedy if we lost this studio just as it had put out its breakout game. So if you’re a fan of tactics games, social sims, and the kind of plot twists that would make M. Night Shyamalan blush, I can’t recommend <em>The Hundred Line </em>enough. I would love to see it in conversations around Game of the Year come December, and it would be great if Too Kyo Games still exists then, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Build a Rocket Boy is launching its first game, MindsEye, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in around two and a half weeks</a>. The development studio founded by former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Benzies has finally shared the PC system requirements that users must meet to play the game on the platform.</p>
<p>MindsEye is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5, so its requirements are fairly in line with what we've seen in the genre.</p>
<div><p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em></p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10/11 64 Bit with latest updates</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i5-12400F / AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB VRAM</em></li>

<li><em><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;70 GB available space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em></p><ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10/11 64 Bit with latest updates</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel Core i7-13700K / AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT 8GB VRAM</em></li>
<li><em><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Network:</strong>&nbsp;Broadband Internet connection</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;70 GB available space</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On PC, the game will feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a>, guaranteeing accelerated frame rates for owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs. GeForce RTX 40 users can still enable Frame Generation, while RTX 30 and 20 users can activate Super Resolution. The integration of AMD and/or Intel upscalers hasn't been confirmed yet, though it is likely.</p>
<p>Despite MindsEye Game Director Leslie Benzies's previous work on GTA, this game won't be an open-world extravaganza with tons of activities and content. Instead, it is a narrative-driven action/adventure thriller that aims to deliver thrilling cinematics, car chases, combat, and the like.</p>
<p>MindsEye also ties into <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everywhere</a>, Build a Rocket Boy's user-generated content platform. In the future, players will be able to create UGC for this game in a way that Associate Game director Adam Whiting has compared to customer Minecraft servers. Users will also get to exploit MindsEye assets elsewhere in Everywhere's creations.</p>
<p>Everywhere doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

But I wanted to see if there’s other ways that we can have people engage and get to know Pikmin that’s outside of the population that plays video games, for example.” </p><p>Miyamoto continued, apparently having waited years to unleash all his <em>Pikmin </em>thoughts on the first person lucky enough to ask him about the strange franchise featuring a tiny alien man controlling an army of small, cute critters. </p><p>“And it really stems back to 20 years ago when we did a presentation where it starts off with, there’s a Pikmin next to you,” said Miyamoto. “And so in Nintendo there’s sort of like an unwritten rule. Mario needs to stay in the <em>Mario </em>universe, or <em>Splatoon </em>needs to stay in <em>Splatoon</em>, and we don’t use different characters in the same place. But <em>Pikmin </em>has this kind of unwritten rule where they’re okay to appear with other characters.”</p><p>When asked if <em>Pikmin </em>could ever appear in movies or TV shows, Miyamoto couldn’t say yes or no, of course, but explained that he would love for that to happen one day. </p><p>“I really see Nintendo as sort of like a talent agency and we have within our roster a lot of talented characters,” said Miyamoto. “So we create a game with a certain gameplay concept, gameplay experience, and then we look at the roster and see who would best fit this gameplay concept or experience.”</p><p>“So looking at things from that perspective, I think <em>Pikmin </em>has a lot of potential to be used in many different occasions. When you’re looking at small kids, they have a certain appeal for things that are cute and when they grow older, maybe in their twenties, they start to lose appeal for that. But I think <em>Pikmin </em>has this unique ability to have appeal across a broad range in that it’s still appealing for both younger audiences and older audiences and in Japan. And so I’m hoping that we can expand that globally. So whether it’s some kind of a movie or show, things like that would be really fun.”</p><p>Look, Nintendo, Miyamoto has done so much for you and your company. I say you give the man a few million dollars and a team and let him make all the weird <em>Pikmin </em>crap he wants to make while he’s still able to do so. It’s the least you can do. And the world would be a better place if we had more <em>Pikmin </em>stuff in it. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-elden-ring-nightreigns-combat-designer-aimed-to-speed-up-the-action-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As our exclusive IGN First coverage of Elden Ring Nightreign continues, we bring you our interview with game and combat designer Takuya Miyazawa. Enjoy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>To start, can you describe what it's like working at FromSoftware and getting to work on such highly acclaimed titles like Elden Ring and Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Takuya Miyazawa - Game and Combat Designer on Nightreign:
</strong>I, myself, previously a huge Souls fan. I'm a big fan of these games and what the company's made, so it's a huge honor to get to work on such titles and as well as the fun of creating these games. I do feel a little bit of pressure and responsibility from the fans who enjoy these games as well, so thank you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Going into Nightreign, there are a lot of really subtle differences between the combat mechanics of base Elden Ring and Nightreign. Can you talk a little bit about why you felt like you should change up some of those mechanics for a multiplayer game like Nightreign and how the resulting gameplay fits Nightreign's fast-paced multiplayer style a little bit better?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the changes for the design of Nightreign… Well first, let me give a little introduction to the general design of Nightreign itself. So, as you know, it uses Elden Ring as a base for the design, so the world and a lot of the assets and the base combat flow comes from Elden Ring. But while it does use it as a base for enemies and such, one area that we wanted to focus on with Nightreign was how we encounter these enemies, the flow of the battle, and the abilities you can use. And so having Elden Ring as a base allowed us to branch out and experiment in these other areas, making it into something that stood out from Elden Ring and becoming its own new thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"While the game base sits with Elden Ring at its core, we wanted to create a gameplay experience that was ultimately very different."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the game base sits with Elden Ring at its core, we wanted to create a gameplay experience that was ultimately very different. Elden Ring is a much more slow-paced, a lot more open-ended. You take your time and carefully go through the world, but Nightreign is what we're calling a short RPG. So there are some constraints here. For example, the three-day, three-night time aspect, and the limitations on the player; but at the same time while we’re putting these limitations on the player in terms of structure, we wanted to allow them some freedom points that they didn't otherwise have with Elden Ring. So the way they traverse the map, they can sprint and they can clamber up walls quickly. Let's see… there's no fall damage compared to Elden Ring. So while we put these constraints on the players from a structural point of view, we wanted to open up and allow them this freedom from a gameplay point of view as well. So it was about creating that balance and that contrast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of status leveling and how the players build their character: With Elden Ring, of course, you had a character creation and building from the very start, but with Nightreign, you select from a preset character as a sort of archetype to start with and then you're free to change your weapons, change your equipment, and change your play style a little bit on the fly. So while you could start as a tank, you don't necessarily have to fulfill that tank role from a gameplay perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted players to enjoy the role play of each character more from their sort of character traits and their abilities than a sort of preconceived notion of approach. We also wanted to reduce the amount of time players spend in the menu, actually, within the game. So instead of carefully checking their stats and going through the leveling process, it's a lot more on the fly, it's a lot more ad hoc, and we wanted to reduce and condense these elements that we found in our previous games but in a tighter, more compact experience, this short-form RPG experience for Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So those are just a few of the aspects that we've tried to consider when approaching this from a multiplayer co-op standpoint.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The boss that we got to check out today as we were playing was Libra: Creature of Night</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for this particular boss battle… Obviously for each boss battle in the game, we're trying to give them their own idiosyncrasies and their own unique touches to make them stand apart and feel original. We wanted each of them to feel like their own experience. So with Libra in particular, we kind of added this trade-off feature that takes place before the battle. And of course, this can allow the players to acquire a new special weapon or a significant level-up or something that benefits them. But of course, being the nature of Libra and the nature of the game, it's not always going to be exactly in their favor, so we wanted to create this interesting risk-reward sort of feature for this particular boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the actual experience during combat itself, we wanted this sort of nature of Libra to be reflected in the gameplay as well. So this sort of duality aspect of the character, both in terms of its appearance and its behavior. So we wanted to give it a two-type move set. So first, it has the sorceries and traps that can kind of confuse and trick the player and then also the sort of more power and damage-focused attacks that come as well. So we wanted this duality to reflect both in its appearance and the pre-battle and the gameplay experience as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that really struck me about the boss battle was that it almost reminded me of an MMO raid kind of boss with how you had to work together and coordinate with your squad to avoid the full effect of some of its attacks. Was MMO boss design any kind of inspiration in creating this boss fight and if not, what really inspired you in those aspects of the boss design?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we paid attention to other genres such as MMOs and the boss fights within them and we did take some notes and some inspiration from these. But one thing we wanted to be careful of was the fact that seeing as Nightreign is a co-op, multiplayer focused game, we still wanted to take care during these boss fights that when another player is drawing aggro, the boss still feels like a significant threat to other players in the group. So even if another player is drawing the aggro, the attacks that the boss is going to do and the way it's behaving is still going to keep other players on their toes even if they're sort of flanking it or taking a more solo-oriented approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I definitely felt that, by the way. Feeling threatened even while I didn’t hold the aggro of the boss. Shifting gears to classes, what goes into designing a character class for Nightreign? Are you looking to fill specific archetypes? Do you come up with a cool idea for a skill and then design a class based around that, or what does that process really look like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite an unorthodox approach we took to character design in Nightreign, similar to what we started with in Elden Ring. So for instance, we start with these kind of general roles or role titles for each of the characters, such as the tank we mentioned earlier or a mage type. So we start with these very general and loose kind of bases for the character archetype. And then from the director, we get an idea of the characters and their individuality and the sorts of abilities that they're going to use and things like this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to give one example of that. You might have used her in the network test or in your play session, the Recluse. Her archetype actually started as a mage, a magic user, plain and simple. But from there, we started to think about and discuss what's fun and what's interesting about playing as a mage from a player's perspective. And that is, of course, using magic, using your intellect to kind of suss out the enemy and its weaknesses and sort of piece the puzzles of the battle together as you go. Of course, just blasting magic is fun in itself, but we wanted there to be an extra layer to that such as how you use your resources, the timing of your spells, using multiple spells in conjunction. And so we started to design a system around that new kind of concept of a mage and how players would interact with that. So that's the kind of approach we took to the character design.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"One area we did concentrate on is the feeling of a role or responsibility within each character."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of our approach to the class designs was how you engage with them in a multiplayer environment. So of course, Nightreign is a three-player co-op game at its core and we wanted these skills and characters to be interesting both from a solo and multiplayer perspective. So one example of this could be the restage skill of the Duchess. So obviously, this is a very powerful skill when you're playing in solo play, but if you're going to take it to the next level and master it, a nice idea might be to watch what your allies are doing, watch for when they're doing some big damage and then restage their attack patterns and get some extra damage that way. So it really encourages this sort of teamwork and thinking as a group and thinking in terms of co-op play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is really the first from Soft Souls with fully developed, pre-made classes that each have their own unique skills and abilities. Does that have any effect, or rather, does it raise any challenges with regards to how you design bosses or enemy encounters, knowing the powerful tools that a squad will be able to take into a fight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of each character's individual abilities and their ultimates and skills, we didn't want to have that dictate how we approach the enemy design or encounter design and vice versa as well. We didn't want the player action level to infringe too much on the enemy action level. We wanted to concentrate on these characters and making them feel unique and fun to players in and of themselves, first and foremost, rather than having these encounters and these boss battles sort of affect that negatively and impact the fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area we did concentrate on is the feeling of a role or responsibility within each character. So you might have somebody who feels it's their duty to try and protect the others during a difficult boss fight or try and distract the enemies, the adds (enemies) during a certain boss fight. Something like this was a feature of the pre-made designs that we could include in Nightreign that maybe we didn't experiment with too much in previous titles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, another aspect is because this is a co-op game that focuses on having a three-person team, we did want to make the bosses feel particularly hardcore from that standpoint as well. So they will use very large-scale attacks. They will use certain abilities that will inhibit or restrict the player or kind of put a sort of urgency to their moves like the timer that's inflicted on them in the Gladius Boss fight. Things like this, we really wanted to make them feel unique and imposing in each their own way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned the Duchess ability and comboing that with a very strong ability that one of your allies will use. Do you have any other favorite ability combos or synergies from the available character classes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example I could give is the Raider character who raises a giant totem from the earth. This itself does damage to the enemies and bosses, but at the same time, the different characters can clamber up atop it. So you could, for example, have the Ironeye character raining down arrows from the safety of the tombstone or reviving a character by shooting them with long-range attacks. Something like this, we feel that there's a nice breadth and synergy that you can experiment with each of these characters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example might be a more general example is the Recluse who you could also use in the network test. Her ultimate art actually marks enemies, puts this sort of seal on them which grants you HP and your teammates HP as you attack. So this, used in conjunction with high damage output or fast subsequent attacks from your teammates, could be very effective at healing the team, keeping them alive. Things like this, we hope players will really have fun experimenting and playing around with these different combinations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Was the Libra Boss battle inspired by any specific characters or mythos?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, he can't speak to any specific titles or names. One of the main inspirations for the Libra Boss battle was this sort of massively multiplayer raid battle sort of focus, so with this idea of having a lot of players coming together to fight this boss battle together. This involves not only the kind of exciting and dangerous elements of that fight, but also the puzzle elements as well, sort of figuring out the right time to attack, figuring out the time to retreat, figuring out the different elements to this boss fight. So we wanted it to feel like an intelligent boss design rather than just an all in, every man for himself kind of appeal.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Personally, what Nightreign character is your favorite to play and what is a build that you really hope players will dig into and enjoy?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A personal favorite of mine is the Guardian, the avian-type knight character with the shield. He favors a more defensive-y and tank-y kind of build that this character archetype provides. I enjoy being able to both attack and defend at the same time or provide that kind of bulwark and that area of safety for his team. If players are more not so keen on the fast dodge rolling and sort of the perfect timing of the parries and things like that, this is a nice character for them to feel like they're really contributing to the team aspect and able to enjoy the battle in that sense as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, we designed the game for the players to be able to beat it as any character. So we wanted them to feel like they could choose a character they liked, either from an ability standpoint or from an appearance or backstory standpoint, and beat the game just in their own play style and with a character they enjoy. That said, balance is still important and the team synergy we talked to, finding a good balance of, say, a tank type character, a mage type character, and a damage deal type character. This is often important as is the boss selection that you make as well. So sometimes, a different Nightlord Boss fight will encourage a different synergy or a different sort of group of roles, a different team composition. So we want players to enjoy figuring out these aspects and experiment with various characters and while they're doing that, find some that really resonate with them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We really wanted both the boss characters, these encounters, and the player characters themselves to feel unique each in their own way. And we wanted it to feel unique enough that players can go back to the game and approach with another character entirely. So even if they have beaten a boss with the Guardian, they might want to go back and try it as the Recluse and see what other tricks they can come up with. Players also might enjoy doing a three-Recluse team, so tripling up on a certain character and seeing what kind of crazy stunts they can come up with, so I'm really looking forward to that aspect of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Final question, and this might be the hardest one, but just what are some of your favorite video games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I mentioned earlier, I really like From’s games, these action RPGs that we make. I'm also a big long-time fan of Final Fantasy 14 and other multiplayer online games as well.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – 21 Minutes Of Official Grand Prix and Free Roam Gameplay | Nintendo Switch 2</p>

<p dir="ltr">"We were thinking about what to do for the next Mario Kart game even during the development of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and we began prototyping in March 2017," Yabuki said. "It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project."</p><p dir="ltr">Many of Mario Kart World's defining features, like its open world and support for 24 players, were there almost from the start of development, as was the game's name. Even in early development the team used the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-titled-mario-kart-9-because-nintendo-wants-to-take-the-series-to-the-next-level/1100-6531709/" data-ref-id="1100-6531709">Mario Kart World name instead of calling it Mario Kart 9</a>, as the team wanted to move away from the strictly track-based gameplay the series had been known for.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the increased player count led to technical challenges when developing for the original Nintendo Switch, according to Mario Kart World's programming director Kenta Sato. He said it was "difficult to incorporate everything we wanted" when developing on Switch 1, and that the team was "always conscious" of what sacrifices were being made.</p><p dir="ltr">"We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30fps in some cases," Sato said. "It was a tough situation."</p><p dir="ltr">The team kept "kicking the can down the road" in terms of what to scale back on, before the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-8-deluxe-all-dlc-tracks-released-so-far/2900-4261/" data-ref-id="2900-4261">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Course Pack</a> gave the team more development time, Yabuki said.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do," Yabuki said. "It was truly a ray of hope."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Mario Kart World will release alongside the Switch 2 on June 5</a>. Nintendo has previously detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/" data-ref-id="1100-6530931">Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode</a> as well as its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">playable characters</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">confirmed items</a>, and more recently put to bed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-issues-statement-on-mario-kart-world-ai-image-speculation/1100-6531436/" data-ref-id="1100-6531436">speculation that it had used AI to generate certain billboards in Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
