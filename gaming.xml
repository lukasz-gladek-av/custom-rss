I swore off trading card games when I realized how much money people dump into cracking packs, but I can still appreciate some good <em>Final Fantasy </em>art when I see it. Something I also appreciate is a good bit, and the <em>Magic </em>x <em>Final Fantasy </em>collab handled one of the series’ long-running constants in a truly clever way that even I, someone who doesn’t understand the ruleset of the card game, can appreciate. I’m talking about Cid, a recurring name given to different characters in each mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p><p>For those who don’t play Square Enix’s RPG anthology series, every <em>Final Fantasy </em>has a character named Cid (though he doesn’t appear physically in the first game, thus he isn’t featured in the <em>Magic</em> collab), but it’s never the same guy twice. If you were to line up every version of Cid next to each other, you’d probably have no idea any of them were related in any way. But they all share the same name, and some of them are among the most beloved characters in the series. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s iteration was easily <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-cid-voice-actor-ralph-ineson-ramuh-1850570377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-cid-voice-actor-ralph-ineson-ramuh-1850570377">the breakout star of the RPG in 2023</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cid-highwind-shera-smoking-1851298459&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cid-highwind-shera-smoking-1851298459"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>’s Cid</a></span> is a personal favorite of mine across the series’ long history.</p><p>So, how do you handle 15 disparate characters who only share a name and (usually) some mechanical skill? You make a card for each of them, of course. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will include 15 different cards titled “Cid, Timeless Artificer.” Each card has the same in-game function, so there’s no favoritism on display here, even for more popular Cids. You can have any number of them in your deck, so you could have several variations to use in a game rather than having to pick your favorite. However, there is one wrinkle in all of this worth mentioning: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-features-the-first-female-cid-1673478411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-features-the-first-female-cid-1673478411"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em>’s Cindy (Cidney in some territories)</a></span> is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>This omission recalls some weird semantic debates over who the true “Cid” of the 15th game is, as there is indeed a character named Cid in it and he has a card in this set, but his granddaughter Cindy is the mechanic the team interfaces with most of the time. The character spurred strong and sometimes divided opinions among players in 2016, as she was the first female Cid in the series, while also appearing in one of the most notably male-centric <em>Final Fantasy</em> games (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/male-intimacy-and-final-fantasy-xv/1100-6425749/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/male-intimacy-and-final-fantasy-xv/1100-6425749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for good and ill</a></span>) and wearing a revealing outfit that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/final-fantasy-xv-has-some-big-problems/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/final-fantasy-xv-has-some-big-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial</a></span>, to say the least. She may get a card down the line, but she wasn’t part of the initial Cid showcase.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has announced some good--and bad--news for cosmetic completionists, as the studio is considering bringing back older battle passes to the game, albeit at a higher price. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-season-0-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6028/" data-ref-id="2900-6028">The Season 0 battle pass</a> that will be available to purchase once again starting May 15 when the Galacta's Gift event begins, but instead of paying 490 Lattice for it, the price has now increased to 590 Lattice.</p><p>The battle pass will also be available until May 29, but once purchased, the rewards contained in it can be unlocked at your leisure. In terms of price, this works out to roughly $7 for the battle pass if you don't have any of the premium in-game currency saved up. NetEase added that it is considering bringing older battle passes back in the future, but these will cost at least 20% more. There'll be no free rewards in these limited-time battle passes either, as NetEase noted that access to all rewards will require the purchase of the Luxury Battle Pass.</p>

<p>"Future Battle Pass returns might occur, but any such plans will span at least two seasons and be priced at a minimum of 20% higher than the original seasonal rate," the studio said in a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend of gaming becoming more expensive lately, as a variety of factors like turbulent market conditions, the increasing cost of video game development, and US President Donald Trump's tariff threats <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">have had a knock-on effect on the industry</a>.</p><p>As for why digital goods like battle passes are increasing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-digital-game-prices-are-going-up-too/1100-6531277/">there are multiple reasons here as well</a>. Increasing prices on a digital product can help offset rising costs in other departments, but the simplest explanation here is that these price increases are being made simply because a developer or publisher <em>can </em>do it.</p><p>With the Switch 2 launching next month, we've seen Nintendo raise the price of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">several of its first-party games to $80</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">while Microsoft has announced price increases for its Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> and games as well.</p>

The Illuminate have emerged from the Meridian singularity, and they're bringing the fight to Super Earth. As detailed by Arrowhead in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" rel="nofollow ">latest Sony blog</a>, this update includes the Stingray, which are enemy fighter jets that provide aerial support for the Illuminate. Stingrays can target players and line up devastating strafing runs. Another new threat is an enemy called Fleshmob, which the developer describes as being a failed Illuminate experiment and a "Frankenstein's monster of Voteless parts."</p>

<p dir="ltr">These are just some of the new enemy types players can encounter. The developer also alludes to other threats by saying, "There have been sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities," so players will likely have a few surprises to discover.</p><p dir="ltr">The update adds weapon customization and progression to Helldivers 2. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then will unlock new attachments players can obtain through Requisition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off 3% of employees, taken from across all levels, teams and regions that the tech giant works in.</p>
<p>In what will be the biggest set of job cuts since early 2023, this will affect around 6,800 jobs –&nbsp;if we take 3% from the 228,000 strong workforce that the company had in June 2024.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">a statement to CNBC</a>, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.”</p>
<p>These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said, which is in contrast to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html">more targeted cuts made back in January</a>. Of course, blanket percentage job cuts couldn’t really be performance related, especially when Microsoft just announced better-than-expected quarterly results, with $24.8 billion in net income and a positive forecast.</p>
<p>That said, given the gigantic scale of the company, the number of markets that it tries to serve and how various different departments could be performing in relation to one another, some of these job cuts could serve to optimise internal structure. It just absolutely sucks that there’s seemingly no good reason for this – good quarter, bad quarter, good economic outlook, bad economic outlook, it doesn’t seem to make a difference these days.</p>

<p>For Microsoft’s now sprawling gaming empire, the impact will likely look like hundreds of job losses. Having ballooned in size thanks to the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard in recent years, Microsoft made job cuts over the last few years with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">1,900 job losses in early 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed studios like Arkane and Tango Gameworks</a> (which was later rescued), split off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-but-promises-no-studio-closures-or-game-cancellations/">then cut a further 650 jobs</a> last September.</p>
<p>One thing that could help preserve jobs is that a number of studios and teams within Microsoft are unionising. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment">the World of Warcraft team last July</a>, and testers at Bethesda and Raven, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">the Overwatch team at Blizzard unionised last week</a>, meaning that the wall-to-wall team of 200 employees will be able to bargain collectively and have some ability to push back against layoffs such as this. Of course, while Microsoft should be recognised for not engaging in union-busting activities, they have also been very slow to actually respond and negotiate with these unions under their umbrella.</p>

The R-rated original live-action horror flick starring Michael B. Jordan (in two roles) brought in more than $120 million domestically over its first three weekends. <em>Sinners </em>even made more money its second weekend than its first, a very rare feat in modern Hollywood. And now it’s pulled off another impressive trick at the box office.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>The Wrap</em></a></span><em>,</em> <em>Sinners </em>is the first original Hollywood film to bring in over $200 million domestically since Pixar’s <em>Coco</em> in 2017.

If you want to find the last time an original live-action Hollywood movie crossed $200 million at the box office, you have to do go all the way back to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl89622017/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl89622017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013's <em>Gravity</em></a></span>.

It’s better than <em>Avatar</em> and its sequel. But in terms of sheer box office revenue, I doubt it can compete with James Cameron’s uber-blockbuster. </p><p>That doesn’t change the fact that <em>Sinners</em> is a big hit and will hopefully convince Hollywood that original movies featuring sex that star and are created by Black people can do well in 2025. You don’t have to keep pumping out comic book slop to make money. The people yearn for new, horny movies. Give them what they want. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Studios have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">announced</a> a Galactic Emergency, as the Illuminate have begun their "<em>true</em>" invasion, with their goal being to hit Super Earth directly.</p>
<p>The new update adds new enemies for Super Earth's defenders to squash in the name of freedom, including Stingrays, which are described as "<em>jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky</em>," and the Crescent Overseer, which specializes in attacking Helldivers who are trying to regroup and take cover.</p>
<p>The third new enemy is the one we get the best look at in the trailer for the Galactic Emergency update, the Fleshmob, which looks like what you'd think something called 'Fleshmob' would look like. A big pile of organic matter with more arms than anyone should ever have stomping around in an unsightly manner.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Galactic Emergency Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bO9qCGVQsFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To combat these new foes, Helldivers will have new methods of customizing their weapons, with primary weapons now featuring different attachments that can be unlocked by achieving new levels for each primary weapon. Once you've hit the required level for a weapon, you can unlock the attachment through Requisition, according to the PlayStation Blog post. Customizations range from being able to adjust ammo capacity, muzzles, and add under-barrel attachments. You'll also be able to unlock new cosmetic customizations for your weapons.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Arrowhead also announced that new patterns for previously released Warbonds will be released on May 15, 2025, alongside the launch of the latest Warbond, Masters of Ceremony.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the biggest games in 2024, and one of the year's biggest surprises, since no one was looking to its release as one of the marquee launches of the year, until it launched and absolutely exploded in popularity. It is easily the biggest success story regarding Sony's live service efforts, which is interesting to note given the context that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-praises-sony-for-their-creative-freedom-was-inspired-by-no-mans-skys-comeback/">as Arrowhead chief executive officer Shams Jorjani said earlier this year,</a> Sony and PlayStation have let Arrowhead steer the ship with Helldivers 2.</p>

            <p>
More than two years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft's</a> last mass round of layoffs, the company is laying off a huge amount of staff once again. As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a>, the tech giant is laying off 3% of employees across the entire company, meaning all levels, teams, and geographies. While nothing has been directly confirmed as of yet, this does include the possibility that some games studios it owns will be affected too - we'll provide an update if there is one.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to CNBC, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the company will "continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The spokesperson also said that one objective of the layoffs is to reduce layers of management. As always, a ridiculously heartless way to frame such a thing. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As of last June, Microsoft had around 228,000 employees, meaning a little under 7000 workers could be out of work soon. This is by far the biggest round of layoffs the company has enacted since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, though 650 workers were put out of employment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">last September too</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that these layoffs come after Microsoft reported that their net income increased by 18% year-on-year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">just this April</a>. Doesn't exactly scream a company that desperately needs to make cuts.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's unclear if any games studios under Microsoft's ownership have been affected by this decision. But as a reminder, based on the stats of an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">unofficial games industry layoffs tracker</a>, so far this year there's been an estimated 2200 jobs lost. 2024 saw around 14,600, 2023 around 10,500, and 2022 around 8500. Good luck to those affected.

A remake of the 2004 JRPG The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, this new version follows the same adventure led by Joshua and Estelle, but with 3D graphics, new gameplay mechanics, and more quality of life improvements. You can preorder the game now at a variety of retailers (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gb1wn?object_uuid=d322f80e-b065-4000-bd5a-9ce4369dfd33&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).

It didn’t make its way to the West until 2011, when it came out here for PlayStation Portable. The game has two direct sequels, Trails in the Sky SC and Trails in the Sky the 3rd. The overarching Legend of Heroes series spans much more time, with entries releasing between the 1980s and now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of the first entry in this sub-series. In it, you play as Estelle and Joshua, two Bracers-in-training who travel around the world, helping people in order to earn full Bracer status. The main overarching storyline revolves around the mystery of what happened to Estelle’s father, who has gone missing. The game is known for its many characters and many lines of dialogue. It’s sort of a relaxed, slow moving, hang-out game that verges on visual novel territory at times. It’s great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of the PS1-style sprite-based graphics of the original, this remake features full 3D anime-style graphics that look basically like the Tales or Dragon Quest games. It looks pretty great, especially since the story of the original is so good. It will be nice to experience it with a more modern presentation. The original game is still available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-nintendo-switch-2">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-where-to-preorder">Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition-switch-2">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

And while it sounds like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s director is fishing for it, there hasn't been a bit on the line from Waffle House.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Tekken game director Katsuhiro Harada was responding to fans still eagerly asking for a Waffle House stage in Tekken 8. It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-responds-to-the-many-fans-asking-for-a-waffle-house-level">a frequent demand</a> that's gained a lot of steam as Harada himself has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">expressed interest in learning more on the matter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada said he "fully understands" fans' requests.

It went on to become a Bethesda tradition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-players-show-off-its-physics-playground-by-playing-dominoes-with-books-and-sandwiches">that was continued with 2023’s Starfield and its more advanced physics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, that tradition lives on, with one player spending seven hours lining up books to get the Dominoes chain reaction just right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1kl8pfa/someone_stole_my_video_and_uploaded_it_without/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Muaxh03</a> uploaded the video below showing their work. We see the books slowly fall and knock the following book in a satisfying fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muaxh03 said they did not use mods to place the books, rather placed them one by one, which sounds particularly grueling. They admit to spawning the books, however. The entire process took seven hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... almost every time I loaded the save something broke, it was not reliable so yes I had to deal with books falling or glitching most of the time, that's why you can see some desynchronizing on the books, some fall slower or faster,” Muaxh03 explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NPCs were disabled, of course: “I would lose my mind if there was NPCs walking around,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this effort is a good start for Oblivion Remastered Dominoes, previous efforts in past Bethesda games were more elaborate and involved varied objects. But playing around with books in Oblivion, even Oblivion Remastered, is a lot harder than you might think because you can’t rotate and place objects in Oblivion in the same way you can in Starfield or Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent the first 1-2 hours trying to learn how to place them good, after that the stairs took 2-3 hours because every time I tested it, it gave me different results, every time I loaded the save something broke,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Oblivion players has been universally positive, with a mix of disbelief at the time, effort, and patience that went into placing the books so precisely in a game as fiddly as Oblivion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What next? “Cool now fill a bookcase!” joked one player. “I would sooner fight a god in hand-to-hand combat unarmed. Last time I tried to put a book back the whole room ended up in shambles — SHAMBLES!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Nicotero Leatherface Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gun Interactive says that it feels The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "has reached its full potential" and that it has been able to realize its future for the asymmetrical multiplayer game, allowing it to see its vision for this project toward its "natural" creative end.</p><p>"From the very beginning, we've always had a clear and concise vision for this game. We wanted to push the envelope on multiplayer asymmetrical horror, shed light on this iconic film to a newer generation, and place folks into the beautiful but macabre world of Muerto County and we feel we have achieved that," <a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/tcsm-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio explained</a>.</p><p>As for the future, Gun Interactive hasn't revealed what its next project is, but it is urging fans to stay tuned.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/">One of several asymmetrical multiplayer games based on a horror movie IP</a>, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre stands apart from other games by utilizing a 4v3 structure for its gameplay, forcing survivors to keep an eye out for the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface and his homicidal family. An authentic recreation of the classic slasher movie--right down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-devs-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-recreate-leatherface-chainsaw/1100-6511374/" data-ref-id="1100-6511374">Leatherface's signature chainsaw</a>--the game was well-received at launch.</p><p>"As one of the year's scariest and best-designed experiences, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has reset the bar for multiplayer horror games," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>. While the game will still live on with the dedicated fans who regularly play it, the same can't be said for Evil Dead: The Game, as after a brief run, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-has-been-mysteriously-delisted-from-several-storefronts/1100-6531206/">it was pulled from digital storefronts</a> by publisher Boss Team Games.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">turned 20 last year</a>, and now one of its most viral moments, Leeroy Jenkins, has too.</p><p dir="ltr">The video, originally uploaded to the WoW forums but gaining more traction on May 11, 2005 when it was uploaded to <a href="https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=1666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warcraftmovies.com</a>, shows a guild of WoW players in voice chat looking to conquer the Rookery room in the game's Upper Black Rock Spire raid. After going over an elaborate battle plan with a "32.33, repeating of course, percentage of survival," one AFK player, a paladin named Leeroy Jenkins, bolts up and shouts "Time's up, let's do this! Leeeeroyyyy Jenkinsssss!" He runs into the adjacent room and aggroes every dragonkin in sight. Chaos ensues and internet history is made.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mLyOj_QD4a4?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins instantly became an internet icon and helped cement WoW in the public consciousness, his name becoming a call to arms for anyone who was about to do something with gusto without thinking about the consequences. The video has been watched tens of millions of times in the last two decades and became a viral sensation at a time when the modern internet as we know it was still in its infancy (YouTube, for example, was just a few months old at the time of the original video). An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HD reupload</a> of the video posted to YouTube in 2014 has racked up 26 million views alone.</p><p dir="ltr">That the whole video is staged is beside the point. The comedic writing and timing (and the absolutely absurd strategy of trying to clear out the Rookery room, rather than just avoiding the eggs entirely) was always too good to be true even before the folks behind the video openly admitted it.</p><p dir="ltr">But that is what makes the video so funny and also makes those early days of WoW so special. Here was a time before every raid strategy was known and when players hadn't quite min-maxed the fun out of encounters like this. Leeroy Jenkins blew up not because it was real, but because it was, despite its over-the-top nature, still believable as something that could happen if you joined a random UBRS group of well-meaning idiots. Such was the beauty of WoW's earliest days--something that developer Blizzard looked to recapture with its launch of WoW Classic in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">References to Leeroy Jenkins would go on to appear in everything from a Jeopardy! question to episodes of Family Guy and How I Met Your Mother. Blizzard has immortalized Leeroy Jenkins in a number of different ways too, including an official NPC who was added to the game during the Warlords of Draenor expansion and more recently played a role in WoW's in-game 20th anniversary event. He is also on various Hearthstone cards, and Blizzard even reward's WoW players with a special title, "Jenkins," for succeeding in UBRS where Leeroy and his group failed.</p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins continues to be an important reminder of what kind of hilarity can ensue when players don't take games too seriously and instead live in the moment. Even though his group failed miserably (on purpose), Leeroy's final words in the video still ring true today. Even in the face of ridicule and adversity, it's the fun we had along the way and the little things that matter. After all, at least he has chicken.</p>

		<p>Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>“We have an important update: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026,” the team wrote on a certain <a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">social media hellscape</a>. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!”</p>


<p>The Amy Hennig-led superhero game was announced back in March of last year, having originally been teased in 2021. Plaion had been partnered with as the game’s publisher, and 2025 was the stated launch target, but we’ve had nothing since the cinematic reveal trailer last summer. We could get a gameplay reveal this summer, but it did feel like details were thin on the ground for a game expected this year.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s much better to take your time, get things right and try to release the best game possible… but depending on how big of a delay this ends up being, Skydance do risk slipping back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">that GTA 6 window</a>, which itself has just been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>

<p>The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-to-lay-off-3-of-its-total-employees.1188201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is about to lay off thousands of employees across all of its divisions, a new report released today claims.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CNBC</a>&nbsp;(which cites a statement given to it directly by Microsoft), 3% of all employees will be laid off "across all levels, teams, and geographies". That's CNBC's wording.</p>

<p>As CNBC points out, Microsoft counted 228,000 employees on its books as of June last year. That would mean that roughly 6,800 employees will be losing their jobs in the largest round of company cuts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-gaming-employees-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs-at-microsoft" rel="nofollow">since January 2023</a>, when around 10,000 staff members were laid off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=AdIDYF6M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=08Y7Teu9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of Microsoft's divisions, including Xbox, will presumably be affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement as loaded with corpo-speak as you'd expect, a spokesperson told CNBC that the layoffs are part of "organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>These cuts aren't related to performance, according to Microsoft; instead, they're about reducing "layers of management", as CNBC puts it.</p>

<p>Despite Microsoft wanting to "best position" itself for "success", it seems the company is already achieving that success. Back in April, the company celebrated a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buoyant third quarter</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year, with revenue up 13% year-on-year and operating income up 16%.</p>

<p>Xbox's "content and services revenue" was up 8% in that same period, so whatever Microsoft's motivation is for laying off thousands of its employees, it can't be to turn around struggling fortunes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-fable-microsoft.jpg?itok=uRU3z3jE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-fable-microsoft.jpg?itok=bzJM5mfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's upcoming Xbox slate includes&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>These layoffs come just a couple of weeks after EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">announced sweeping cuts</a> to its own workforce, with&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> among the EA subsidiaries most affected by the layoffs. Other studios hit by cuts in recent months include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a> and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft again</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the staggering number of employees the tech giant has laid off in recent times didn't stop CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> in 2024. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Microsoft's Xbox division is gearing up (no pun intended) to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">release&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>later this year, and upcoming major titles include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: E-Day</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Fable</em></a>, although neither has a release date as of yet.</p>

As the name implies, the new SteamOS Compatibility system will rate how compatible games are with third-party devices, similar to how Valve already rates the compatibility of games for its own Steam Deck.</p><p>The new rating will only show up on devices running SteamOS that aren’t a Steam Deck and are designed to quickly indicate to users if all of a game’s features and functionality, including any anti-cheat tools it may be using, are fully supported by the OS. Games will be marked as either “SteamOS Compatible” or “SteamOS Unsupported” in the Steam Store and Steam Client.</p><p>The rating “does not include testing results for performance and input, since we will not know (and have not tested) how all titles will run on all potential hardware,” as Valve points out in an announcement shared to its community pages yesterday. But the company expects “over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate.”</p><p>Because the new ratings are “automatically generated from Steam Deck verification results without additional testing,” Valve says that developers don’t need to take any additional steps to ensure their games are compatible with third-party SteamOS devices. “If your title already has a Steam Deck Compatibility rating, an automated process will use that data to give it a SteamOS Compatibility rating.”</p><div><p>The Legion Go S will be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">first handheld gaming PC to trade Windows for SteamOS</a>, the gaming-focused operating system that powers Valve’s Steam Deck.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Anyone that's played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Souls</a> game knows how it tells its stories. You meet a wide range of characters, all of which mostly just talk at you in varyingly cryptic ways. There's also tiny bits of lore offered up from weapons and items too, all of which build up a messy picture. But in something like the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, where the main focus is gameplay that encourages you to constantly be on the move, I've been left wondering how its story will play out. As it turns out, it's quite different from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-taking-a-unique-approach-to-storytelling-ign-first">IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki set the scene a little bit explaining that "Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention - it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition."
</p>
<p>
That opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, the preset characters you play as. As opposed to Elden Ring, where there is a main plot so to seek, you'll mostly be trying to learn about the Nightfarers' respective pasts through Remembrances.
</p>
<p>
In Nightreign's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a>, you can check out the character you play as' Remembrances through a journal. Sometimes these are just logs, other times you'll be taken to specific areas to live out memories. Once you've spoken with an NPC within a Remembrance, you then get a task to complete. These vary from character to character, like how Wylder might need to go find a particular item in a cave, or how Raider has to win 1v1 boss fights.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'll have to wait and see how I feel about this structure when actually playing the game. I'm confident all the Nightfarers' backstories will have that classic FromSoft appealing vagueness, I just worry that they'll just feel a bit tacked on rather than properly woven in. Happy to be proven wrong, I do like the sound of each character needing to do different things, so I'll cross my fingers that it works out.
