		<p>Nintendo featured a new trailer for Pokémon Legends: Z-A during the latest Nintendo Direct, giving a look at another, darkerside of the city of Lumios that is the main setting for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tezs2FsIxgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer covers a lot of ground for what we’ve previously seen of the game, such as the Wild Zones that Pokémon tend to live in within the city – supposedly safe havens, but not when you’re around and have a Pokéball or two… hundred in your pocket. If they’re hostile to this (and why wouldn’t they be?) then you’ve got the overhauled real time combat to indulge in, and the return of Mega Evolutions.</p>
<p>However, Pokémon Z-A will also feature a day-night cycle, and things get much trickier after night. At this time, more challenging rival trainers will emerge to take part in the Z-A Royale, adding a little extra peril to your battling.</p>
<p>Once again, there’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time.</p>

		<p>Nintendo shared a new gameplay and story trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, the latest entry in the popular third person take on the genre-defining series. Psychic abilities? A mysterious red and black suit? Tasty…</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is currently only confirmed for Nintendo Switch and a 2025 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmwAhBxakw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond takes Samus to the planet Viewros, trapping her in a jungle with a giant tree at its heart. You’ll scan relics and statues to find the paths forward, while also running into hostile alien creatures that live in the gloom.</p>
<p>Samus naturally has her suit and weapons, which will be enhanced over the course of the game, but there’s also new psychic abilities that will be granted to Samus – she’s got a new story arc as a “chosen one” it seems, which is a bit generic. These could be used to manipulate energy balls and mechanisms in environment, but can also apply in combat, being used to guide the trajectory of weapons fire to hit the target.</p>

<p>Confirmed for release this year, there’s plenty speculation that Metroid Prime 4 will be a cross-gen launch game for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, especially with Nintendo still avoiding pinning an exact date on the game’s launch. Perhaps a second news drop will come next week at the Switch 2 Direct?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>
<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

			<p>New Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the next entry in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmwAhBxakw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The new footage</a>, shown during today's Nintendo Direct presentation, shows Samus Aran as she lands on Planet Viewros and takes on the many challenges she will find on her journey using mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, such as scanning. The new footage also provided a new look at combat, showing Samus fighting against multiple alien creatures.</p>
<p>The new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage also introduced new abilities called Psychic Abilities, which promise to spice up the series' experience considerably. Thanks to these abilities, Samus can operate mechanisms, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams using the power of her mind. The footage doesn't show a lot of these abilities and their usage, but the possibilities look rather intriguing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new Metroid Prime 4: Beyond footage didn't confirm the game's release date, which is still scheduled for a generic 2025 release window. With the Nintendo Switch 2 launching this year with full backward compatibility, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game launch alongside the next-generation Nintendo console.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-first-trailer-release-date/">2025 release date</a> on Nintendo Switch. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 is alive and well after it was shown off during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct Presentation. It didn’t reveal a precise release date, but we know it’s still locked in for 2025.</p>



<p>As it was predicted, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond was not shown off during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> Showcase. However, Nintendo’s end-of-life Direct—showing off new games and remakes—revealed new gameplay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announced-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a>.</p>



<p>Samus is coming for Metroids and Space Pirates this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025-release-date-confirmed">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond 2025 Release Date Confirmed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pretty. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest reveals during the March 2025 Nintendo Direct was easily <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond-2593922.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</a>. The long-awaited sequel was in the wilderness for many years. But June 18 finally gave us a real glimpse of what the developer has been working on, and now we’ve seen more.</p>



<p>The latest gameplay trailer revealed the new Planet Viewros we’ll be traversing, along with new powers, abilities, and weapons. The most eye-catching inclusion is psychic powers, which allow Samus to manipulate the environment, which should make for new and exciting puzzles.</p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch is at the end of its lifecycle, Metroid Prime 4 still looks mightily impressive. The techno soundtrack and thrilling action look like everything we’ve come to know and love about the franchise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the trailer still states it’s “<strong>Coming 2025</strong>,” so we’ll hopefully learn more throughout the year. Stay tuned for updates, and check out the new gameplay trailer below.</p>

First footage of Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake has been revealed, following last year's Dragon Quest 3 remake.
</p>
<p>
While that game ends with a tease of future remakes after the credits, the footage shown at today's Nintendo Direct is the first look at gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The two games will come as a pair, set to release later this year. Though revealed for Switch, the game will presumably be coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as with the previous game.

<p>
Why out of order? Dragon Quest 3 was a prequel to the first two to complete what's known as the Erdrick trilogy. So while DQ 1 &amp; 2 were released earlier, DQ 3 is chronologically the first so was the starting point for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s remakes.
</p>
<p>
The company will have high hopes for sales of Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake. The remake of Dragon Quest 3 became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">best-selling game of 2024 in Japan after just one week</a>.

A couple of weeks later, Square Enix announced <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539">2m sales globally</a>, while at its following earnings report it stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">the game exceeded expectations</a>.

            <p>
At today's Nintendo Direct, we finally got a first proper look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>: Beyond gameplay.
</p>
<p>
It takes place on the Planet Viewros and promises the start of a new story. Most interestingly, Samus will be given new psychic abilities.
</p>
<p>
There's still no firm release date beyond 2025, but the game's inclusion at this Direct - focused solely on the original Switch console - confirms it will be released on the older system. A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version is yet to be announced.

<p>
So what about those psychic abilities? The trailer explains Samus can use them to operate mechanisms from afar, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams in slow motion.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, Metroid Prime 4 is more 3D Metroid in first-person. So far only a verdant jungle biome has been shown, with Samus scanning flora and fauna, rolling in morph ball form, and shooting alien creatures with her beam weapon.
</p>
<p>
The trailer ends with Metroid in a new scarlet suit, with a mysterious voice stating: "We place our faith in you, Chosen One".
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 will follow the excellent remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> released on Switch in 2023. There's still no news of similar remasters for Metroid Prime 2 and 3.

<p>Crystal Dynamics, the developers behind the recent Tomb Raider games, has announced that it has held layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In an announcement on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_this-morning-crystal-dynamics-made-the-difficult-activity-7310735917680377859-DthD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, the studio said that it made the “difficult decision” to let go 17 people from the company. In it’s statement, they said that the decision wasn’t made “lightly”.</p>



<div><p>“Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio’s future success,” the statement reads. “It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.</p><p>“We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.”</p></div>



<p>The statement ended with the studio saying that it “remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games” nor does it change any of their current projects.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more details on the support and “transition packages” the impacted employees are receiving. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics is just the latest studio to hold layoffs in 2025. As of publishing, <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">roughly 1,500 confirmed jobs</a> have been lost across nearly 50 companies this year.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained.1146285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-inzoi-have-denuvo-denuvo-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Denuvo continues to be brought up with every new PC release, and Inzoi is another instance. The life simulator is being compared to The Sims in terms of scale and superiority in the genre, but it could be hampered by Denuvo software.</p>



<p>For all the childish talk of the “PC master race” over the years, PC players get the short end of the stick much of the time. While the platform is undoubtedly the best way to experience games (if you can afford the hardware), it also has drawbacks. It’s late to many AAA ports, is often poorly optimized for the format, and has to contend with Denuvo issues.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> has taken 2025 by storm—highlighted by its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-most-wanted-wishlist-game-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam wishlist numbers</a>—but let’s see if it’s fallen victim to Denuvo.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-denuvo-used-in-inzoi">Is Denuvo Used in Inzoi?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Phew. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s good news as I can confirm Inzoi doesn’t support Denuvo, so you don’t have to worry.</strong></p>



<p>Invoi has a lot going on at any one time. So I can see why you’d be concerned if Inzoi used Denuvo as part of its configuration. Thankfully, the developer has confirmed that Denuvo isn’t supported, but this hasn’t always been the case.</p>



<p><strong>Previously, the game has included Denuvo</strong>, but it was removed during Early Access.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-was-denuvo-removed-from-inzoi">Why Was Denuvo Removed From Inzoi?</h2>



<p><strong>Denuvo was removed from Inzoi after negative feedback from the community and the developer wanting players to have more freedom for “long-lasting enjoyment for the community.”</strong></p>



<p>Inzoi suddenly added Denuvo overnight during the Early Access period, and this did not go down well with players. It took Inzoi Studio less than 48 hours to see the error of its ways and undo the action.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-inzoi-developer-removes-denuvo-following-players-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80LV</a>, Inzoi producer and game director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim had this to say: “”Our initial application of Denuvo on our main development build made it so that the inZOI: Creative Studio demo build, a branch from the main build, was also applied with the same anti-tamper,”&nbsp;<strong>Kjun wrote</strong>. “Unfortunately, we failed to properly inform our players of this application during the demo period, and we sincerely apologize for that oversight.”</p>



<p>They explain that a lack of Denuvo “increases the risk of the game being cracked and illegally distributed after release,” but the team is encouraging “Inzoi to become more freely configurable – unlocking new ways for players to shape new experiences for other players.”</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy Inzoi Studio has reversed its decision? Do more developers and publishers need to sacrifice the need for Denuvo’s anti-tampering, anti-pirate software to ensure a smoother PC experience? Share your thoughts with us.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-nintendo-pr-managers-question-whether-switch-2s-mario-kart-9-is-the-slam-dunk-people-think-it-is<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Hmm, I'm not sure we need this Timmy."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the hotly anticipated Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, two former employees of the company have expressed concern about Mario Kart 9's ability to convince people to upgrade to Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo revealed the Switch 2 with a brief look at the new Mario Kart game, which gave us an idea of what to expect from what is likely a launch title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a huge deal of excitement around Mario Kart 9 and the Switch 2, but in <a href="https://youtu.be/eQkig2bRVSk?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video published to their YouTube channel</u></a>, former Nintendo PR managers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang questioned Nintendo’s ability to out-d the all-conquering Mario Kart 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Everybody has the expectation, ‘oh my gosh Mario Kart it's a slam dunk, it's a system seller, this is definitely the right game to put in front of this new system,’ but I think you're right because if you look at the situation of Mario Kart up to this point, it's a little bit different than what has been in the past and I'm not sure that transition for Nintendo or for the people who have been playing Mario Kart, I'm not sure that's the slam dunk that people think it is.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellis and Yang’s point here is that Mario Kart 8 and the Switch version, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, have been so successful for so long, that Nintendo faces an uphill battle convincing the mainstream Nintendo audience to upgrade, especially if they’re having to hand over at least $400 on a Switch 2 to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is, they believe, a victim of its own success here. Mario Kart 8 has sold an incredible 67.35 million copies on Nintendo Switch, which itself is the second best-selling console of all time with 150.86 units shifted. Pretty much everyone with a Switch has Mario Kart 8 at this point, and while it isn’t part of the video game zeitgeist, it is about as perfect a Mario Kart game as can be expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How does Nintendo top Mario Kart 8 and 67 million sales, then? Ellis and Yang believe Nintendo may struggle to do so, which is bad news for a company that always wants to see the numbers go up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a bit unconventional to have a game coming out that's probably going to be the premier launch title for your new console to have this kind of history,” Yang said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is very unlike Nintendo. Usually when they have a launch title, like Breath of the Wild for example, it's like this new game-breaking, genre-bending thing that's never been seen before, and that's what's going to make you want to buy the new hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we're kind of in a bit of a different situation with Mario Kart and honestly it's because of how successful Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been for Nintendo.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart 9 - First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is whether Nintendo has done enough with Mario Kart 9 to convince existing Switch owners to upgrade. While there are plenty of familiar vehicles and faces in the Mario Kart 9 footage we’ve seen so far, there’s also a new track and some interesting details that suggest a new twist on the established formula. The most prominent theory posed by the community so far is that this may be the Mario Kart entry that finally takes the series open world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undoubtedly, the pressure is on Nintendo to deliver. “How is Nintendo going to convince me that I want to get the new Mario Kart?” Yang wondered. “That I need a Switch 2 to get the new Mario Kart?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellis added: “I do think there are going to be some people who ask themselves, ‘I'm pretty happy with the Mario Kart I've been playing,’ and… Mom: ‘hey kids, we have Mario Kart at home…’ like, looking at this box and be like, ‘hmm, I'm not sure we need this Timmy.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no doubt this is going to be an incredible game. I have no doubt that every Mario Kart sells well. But in terms of the hill that this one in particular has to get over… This is Nintendo's goal. This is always their goal: ‘we have to do better than the last one.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's like, well are you really going to do better than 75 million? And it's the same question with the Switch 2. It's like, ‘oh you just did the best-selling console ever.’ It's just these goals that they have for themselves are going to be incredibly hard to match.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellis said that because of how extensive Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is already with the sheer number of tracks and characters already available, Nintendo can’t use the same messaging with Mario Kart 9 that it did with Mario Kart 8. Nintendo needs, according to Ellis, find a new angle to differentiate Mario Kart this time around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pair also called into question Mario Kart 9’s visuals as being significantly improved on Mario Kart 8, saying that in graphics terms “it’s not really blowing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I could probably play that for another 10 years and still think it looks okay,” Ellis said of Mario Kart 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Its positives is also its downfall,” Yang added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll find out hat Nintendo has up its sleeve for Mario Kart 9 soon enough, of course, during the Nintendo Direct on April 2. In the shorter term, Nintendo is set to host a Nintendo Direct focused entirely on the existing Nintendo Switch today, March 27.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Nintendo held its final Nintendo Direct event on Thursday for the original Nintendo Switch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-march-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Confirmed on Wednesday,</a> the March 2025 edition of Nintendo Direct ran for about 30 minutes in length and focused on games for the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei’s senior communications manager has just reconfirmed that the game is still looking at a 2025 release window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sucker Punch’s senior communications manager, Andrew Goldfarb’s recent post on <a href="https://x.com/garfep/status/1902455637679943833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X </a>(via The Gamer) reconfirms Ghost of Yotei’s plans of release in 2025, as he is looking for “an experienced community and support specialist “ to help launch the game “this year”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghost of Yotei, the sequel to Ghost of Tsushima, was revealed last year during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s State of Play</a> event. Sucker Punch arrived with a full-fledged trailer at the showcase, providing players with a glimpse of what to expect with the new adventure set in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei. Interestingly, towards the end of the trailer, they announced that Ghost of Yotei will be released in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Get ready to feel the nostalgia, millennials. The first game in the Backyard Baseball series, Backyard Baseball ’97, has been released on mobile devices for the very first time.</p>



<p>The game is available for $4.99 on both iOS and Android devices.</p>



<p>“It’s honestly surreal to play&nbsp;<em>Backyard Baseball ‘97</em>&nbsp;on a device that didn’t exist in 1997,” Playground Productions CEO Lindsay Barnett said via release. “Playing on a mobile device makes for the ultimate nostalgic, cozy gaming experience for me and other millennials.” </p>

<p>The game’s mobile release includes all of the features players expect from the original game with mobile-optimized controls. The game also allows offline play, meaning no internet connection is required after the game is downloaded. </p>



<p>You can check out the full list of game features and modes, below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Random Pick-up: </strong>A quick way to jump right in! The computer chooses a random team for you and itself, and the game starts immediately.</li>

                <p>Backbone has revealed its new limited-edition controller for smartphones, and for fans of classic Xbox vibes, this could be a very nostalgic device for mobile gaming. The Backbone One: Xbox Edition controller will go on sale starting March 27 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET. Since this will be sold in limited quantities, it'll be available exclusively through the <a href="https://backbone.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone store</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/8067al4hlgeap?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17430825347459?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

It's a darker shade of green that references the classic aesthetic of Xbox, and it includes a black PCB and the iconic Xbox button. Beyond that, you're getting the standard range of inputs that you'll find on other Backbone controllers, allowing you to play games with a traditional selection of controls.</p><p>This is also a second-gen model, so you're getting a USB-C connection that can pair with your phone, even if it's protected by a phone case. This makes the Backbone controller quite appealing as you won't need to strip the protective cover off of your phone every time you want to use it. Additionally, there is passthrough charging, a 2.5mm headphone jack, and support for most iPhones and Android devices.</p><p>If you're looking to pair this with other devices, 8BitDo also launched a mechanical keyboard and mouse that are also equipped with transparent green shells. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMTLLSBN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox-inspired transparent green keyboard</a> is on sale for the first time since its release earlier this year and the matching <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro R8 Wireless Gaming Mouse is priced at $60</a>.</p><h2>Backbone One controllers</h2><p>In case it sells out, you can grab a Backbone controller for your phone in either a carbon-black color scheme inspired by the Xbox Series X console or a PlayStation white version. As mentioned above, the second-gen models feature USB-C connections, but if you're using an older iPhone, you can get a first-gen model equipped with a Lightning port.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, USB-C, White)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, USB-C, Black)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, Lightning, White)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, Lightning, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (1st Gen, Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RL7VLKY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (1st Gen, Lightning, Black)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>When it first released, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-controller-review/1100-6491699/" data-ref-id="1100-6491699">Backbone One review</a> praised the controller for being a "combination of solid hardware and smart app design" that has only gotten better with its second-generation update.

                <p>In the early '80s, the Commodore 64 was at the forefront of the home computer revolution. Now, retro publisher Ziggurat Interactive is bringing back a selection of the classic games from the C64 era in Cosmi: Forbidden Forests, which will also include a new remaster of Forbidden Forests.</p><p>1983's Forbidden Forest and its 1985 sequel, Beyond the Forbidden Forest, are both included in this compilation. But the primary attraction of Cosmi: Forbidden Forests is the modernized version of the title game that transforms the 2D art style into something that resembles a medieval tapestry. Players will have the option of toggling between the original style of Forbidden Forests and the new graphics and audio. A glimpse of the remaster is included in the announcement trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDu0WSdbhww" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nDu0WSdbhww" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The remaining games included in this retro release include Aztec Challenge, Caverns of Khafka, Seal, Delta Man, Chomp!, Chernobyl: Nuclear Power Plant Simulation, Spite &amp; Malice, and Navcom 6: The Persian Gulf Defense. These titles retain their C64 style graphics and gameplay, while adding features like the ability to rewind the action or create save states.</p><p>Comic-book veterans Ant Williams and Andy Lanning's Ideas &amp; Inks provided the compilation's new box art, and oversaw a collection of digital comics based on Forbidden Forests and Caverns of Khafka. This package also includes a digital gallery of the manuals that came with the games as well as their promotional art from the '80s.</p><p>Cosmi: Forbidden Forests will be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on May 27.</p>

            <p>Neil Druckmann is "really curious" about how viewers will react when The Last of Us season two debuts next month.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' second season is set to air in just over two weeks time, and will pick up the lives of Joel and Ellie several years after the events of season one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">Along with awards and praise</a>, in 2023 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">first season was reported to be the most-watched HBO Max show in Europe</a>, and as such, there are some pretty high hopes for The Last of Us' second season, mine included.</p>
<p>However, as those who have played Part 2 will know, there are some plot points that may surprise and shock viewers unfamiliar with the source material. So, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> exec and showrunner Neil Druckmann nervous or scared about the reception, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">especially given some of the volatile abuse following The Last of Us Part 2</a>? Well, no, he isn't.</p>

<p>"When we're making it, we're just so focused on making it that I try not to think about what the reaction will be, but I'm very excited and curious to see what the reaction will be from people who are not familiar with the story and people who are familiar with the story, going over similarities and differences," Druckmann told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the">GameInformer</a>.</p>
<p>"I loved that conversation over season one, and I'm very much looking forward to it across season two."</p>
<p>During the same interview, Druckmann said he "used to be more concerned with fan reaction", adding he had "experienced the worst of it when [Naughty Dog] had the leaks and Covid hit with the second game", but has now "stopped caring" about all that.</p>
<p>"I've always operated under that, 'I'm not going to be worried about what the fan reaction is going to be. I don't have any control over that so I'm not going to be worried about it'.</p>
<p>"What I do have control over is the crafting of the thing that's in front of me and leading a team to do that. So I want to make sure that we make something we're extremely proud of, that we're very thoughtful in making. And then we put it out into the world and the reaction is not up to us. That's up to our fans and how they react."</p>
<p>As to <em>that</em> particular moment that may provoke reactions (won't spoil it here), well Druckmann refrained from commenting on whether or not it will feature in the second season. He dodged the Ellie-phant in the room, if you will. </p>
<p>"I'm not confirming or denying anything," Druckmann said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>From the opening strains of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s beautiful title track, it’s clear that this is an RPG that’s embracing its own sense of style. With French-language vocals and sweeping orchestration, it sets a tone for a game that feels unequivocally French. When you see the twisted remains of Paris, you’ll understand why.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EsElVZ0sLtU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clair Obscur begins in Lumiere, a city set within a fantastical interpretation of France. In this world, the oldest members of society die out, erased by the Paintress, who paints a number on her cursed monolith once a year, erasing everyone of that age. Each year, that number gets lower, slowly but surely edging towards zero. Clair Obscur opens with you bidding farewell to those aged 34, your love amongst them. Gustave, our central character, voiced by Daredevil star Charlie Cox, sets out as part of Expedition 33, a group dedicating the final year of their life to trying to combat this inevitable destruction of the human race, fighting back against the Paintress and her inexplicable taste for number-based death.</p>


<p>Clair Obscur is simply stunning. You should check out one of the game’s early trailers to get a true sense of it, but the team at Sandfall Interactive have captured the fantastical and the unlikely in a way that feels genuinely unique. Sunlight reflects off the dust particles floating through the air, the landscape shifts and shimmers while mist caresses your character. Looking upwards, though, it becomes clear that this is a broken land, with floating rocks and giant growths filling the purple-hued skyline. Beneath it, you soon find the ugly side of this world, coming across the remains of your Expedition, routed beneath the enemy’s banners.</p>


<p>Gustave takes this poorly, sitting amongst the fallen bodies of his bodies and manifesting a pistol that he holds to his own temple. It’s only the interjection of teammate Lune that stops him from joining them. There’s a close-run vein of darkness and depression that Clair Obscur looks to plough, and Cox’s delivery only heightens the sense of pain and loss that lies at the game’s heart. You can expect the drama and emotion to be maximised by the stellar voice cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and Final Fantasy XVI’s Ben Starr, and I found myself hanging on every word of dialogue during the preview.</p>
<p>The Expedition’s health and safety is at the centre of your experience. You can heal the entire group using Chroma Elixirs, as well as keep a watchful eye over the Expedition’s status and key objectives at any time, and this plays into the idea that this quest isn’t just about one person, it’s for every remaining member of the human race.</p>

<p>Combat is played out via turn-based battles, and the same attention to visual design found in the environment has made its way into these encounters. The UI experience has to be the most stylish we’ve seen since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio’s</a>, with your battle wheel letting you access Attacks, Skills, and Items, all of which you’ll need to utilise to prevail against Clair Obscur’s fantastical enemies.</p>
<p>There’s an active element to these turns, though, where pressing the dodge button at the right time might see you escape from damage. If you time it at the last moment, you’ll gain a Perfect Dodge and earn additional charges on your Overcharge Meter.</p>
<p>That Overcharge Meter lets you perform your most powerful attacks, and here too Clair Obscur wants you to be involved, giving Skills extra damage if you successfully time the right button press with your attack. You might wonder about the return of QTEs, or hark back to your favourite Mario RPGs, but they serve to keep you on your toes, unable to look away for a moment.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Parrying, which rather than getting you out of the way, sees you hitting a smaller window of opportunity to repel enemy attacks. If you’re able to successfully Parry multiple attacks in a row, you can answer back with a devastating counter. Parrying feels excellent here, maybe even a little overpowered, but successfully pulling one off gives you a shot of endorphins that most turn-based RPGs can only dream of.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Clair Obscur doesn’t want players to be passive observers during its turn-based battling, and it feels closer to an action title than many other RPGs. You have to be well prepared and engaged if you want to get the most out of it, getting your party through encounters in the quickest time possible, while incurring the least damage.</p>
<p>Giving you something else to think about, some characters can inflict Stains on enemies. These elemental marks can cause additional damage if you’re thoughtful about the order in which you attack, and single attacks might produce multiple effects. Lune’s Ice Lance skill inflicts both an Ice Stain and a Light Stain, and you can then consume them with opposing skills, such as a Fire Skill like Immolation. These also play into Elemental Affinities, and while some might cause additional damage, you might heal enemies if you choose the wrong one.</p>
<p>Tonally, there are aspects of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that remind me of Eternal Sonata, the JRPG set within the dying mind of Frederic Chopin. There’s the same quiet sense of the inevitable that creeps into every moment here, while the exquisite orchestration brings both melancholy and grandeur to the incredible events. There’s a darkness here that’s utterly unmatched, and while some might find the atmosphere oppressive, there’s a kernel of hope to wrap yourself around.</p>

<p>There’s plenty to juggle in Clair Obscur’s combat systems, and I came away from our preview thoroughly invested in the world and its turn-based action. For fans of role-playing games, this is one Expedition you don’t want to miss.</p>

			<p>This week, NVIDIA has added twelve games to its GeForce NOW cloud platform. This includes an exclusive first look demo at Sunderfolk, a rather unique game developed by Secret Door and published by Dreamhaven. In Sunderfolk, up to four players share the magical and dangerous world of Sunderland in a turn-based tactical RPG adventure where your mobile device becomes the controller. The game was designed with a couch co-op experience in mind. Each player chooses one of six classes (Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, or Rogue). Together, players venture into the Sunderlands and engage in turn-based tactical combat. During combat, there is no set order of player turns, so your strategy can change on the fly to react to evolving battlefield conditions. With new enemies appearing at every turn, it's up to your party to work together to find the best path to success.</p>
<p>In the First Look Demo (which is available on GeForce NOW through April 7), players will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first 4 missions from Act 1</li>
<li>All 6 playable characters</li>
<li>Experience core aspects of the game (MIssions, Relationship Building, Town Building</li>
<li>Upgrades, Crafting)</li>
<li>Unlimited playthroughs</li>
<li>Estimated 2-3 hours of gameplay per campaign</li>
<li>Local and remote co-op play</li>
</ul>
<p>GeForce NOW users can also play the newly released games <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomfall-shadow-of-cumbria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, both of which were recently reviewed on Wccftech. The other highlight is undoubtedly inZOI, which features the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and ray tracing, both available to GFN Ultimate tier subscribers. The game also marks the debut of the NVIDIA ACE technology through the so-called Smart ZOI NPCs, powered by a 0.5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model that runs exclusively on GeForce RTX hardware. inZOI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launches tomorrow in early access</a>. Lastly, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a> is also available via GeForce NOW.</p>
