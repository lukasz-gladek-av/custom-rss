Even though I’m not big on the look of Funko Pops sanding down every art style and character design into a uniform look, there are some cute details in all three figures. Shadowheart carries the Mysterious Artefact she stole from the Githyanki before the events of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and Karlach wields an axe and comes bundled with a little figure of her teddy bear Clive that you can find at camp if you recruit her. Astarion is where things get a little interesting, as the vampire can either wield a dagger or has a one-in-six chance of holding the Necromancy of Thay tome. It’s like a dice roll. It’s meta. Either way, he has red eyes instead of the usual black ones most Funko Pops have, which is a cute touch.</p><p>I make jokes, but Funko Pops are at least an affordable alternative to the expensive premium statues that are so often released as tie-ins to major games. I can be a hater, I’ve got a few of those beady-eyed little fuckers on my shelves at home. As I write this I can see Ryuji Sakamoto from <em>Persona 5</em> in all his chibi glory from my desk. I’m a mark first, a hater second. So if you’re interested in a cheap tchotchke of your <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> fave, click through to see more. Maybe if enough people buy these they’ll also make Gale and I’ll have to eat crow.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esl-faceit-contribute-22-million-counter-strike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ESL FACEIT has announced a massive contribution to the world’s premier Counter-Strike 2 circuit through 2025 and 2026. A press release confirmed that a whopping $22 million will be contributed to ‘multiple professional ESL CS2 tournaments’ spanning the two years, with an equal portion of $11 million supporting each competitive calendar.</p>



<p>It’s a stacked schedule that kicks off in January 2025 with IEM Katowice, one of the most renowned tournaments in the world of esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eager-investment">Eager Investment</h2>



<p>ESL FACEIT is one of the biggest and most valuable esports organisations in the world. The company’s origins can be traced back to 2000, and in 2022 a merger brought together the two components – ESL and FACEIT. This merger occurred during an acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s Savvy Games Group, which proved to be a roaring success.</p>



<p>In a recent press release disclosing the news about this multi-million-dollar contribution, ESL FACEIT’s Marc Winther said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The EPT for Counter-Strike 2 is the definition of EFG’s commitment to fostering a fruitful competitive environment and continually nourishing Counter-Strike’s heritage, as we’ve done since 2000</em>.</p>



<p><em>With a circuit that spans multiple continents and integrates diverse levels of competition, we are excited to further fuel opportunities for world-class teams and passionate fans alike.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a stunning year for Counter-Strike esports. In the summer, the most-watched IEM Cologne event in history took place with a peak viewer count of more than one million users. We saw the 100th IEM event held in Dallas in the spring, and across 2024, more than 140 million hours of Counter-Strike content were consumed.</p>



<p>CS2 also had a spotlight moment in Brazil as IEM Rio 2024 unfolded. Per a data-backed report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/iem-rio-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Esports Charts</a>, IEM Rio 2024 was a roaring success thanks to multi-streams and watch parties hosted by popular streamers.</p>



<p>The 2025 calendar is <strong>dense</strong>. Here’s what fans can look forward to next year in the Counter-Strike space:</p>



<ul>
<li>IEM Katowice (Jan – Feb)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S21 (Feb – Mar)</li>



<li>IEM Spring 2025 (Apr)</li>



<li>IEM Dallas 2025 (May)</li>



<li>IEM Cologne (Jul – Aug)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S22 (Sep – Oct)</li>



<li>IEM Chengdu 2025 (Nov)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a positive time to become a Counter-Strike 2 esports fan. What tournament are you most looking forward to? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-puts-team-on-notice-for-redundancy.1013460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has put its development team "on notice for redundancy" as it looks for funding for its next project, the studio has revealed.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1847194285545848933" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Surgent says that while everyone on its team "worked incredibly hard to create&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>", studio management has decided "to put the work of the Surgent games division on hiatus".</p>
<p>The developer says it's created a prototype for what it says is a "bold new project". Surgent describes its new game as "darker, edgier, and more visceral than [<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>]", although it still retains that game's "high-octane combat and cultural depth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-redundancy-notice-boss.jpg?itok=jtMVP3lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-redundancy-notice-boss.jpg?itok=K9J6Zb4Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>'s development team is currently on redundancy notice.</figcaption></figure><p>Surgent goes on to say that it's currently looking for a publishing partner for this project, a position that's becoming all too common among the indie sphere; recently,&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>developer Italic Pig revealed that it, too, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paleo-pines-future-uncertain">seeking a new production partner</a> for a potential&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>
<p>The developer also teases "a couple of exciting updates coming down the pipeline" for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, although it doesn't say what those updates are, so you'll have to wait and see to find out what's coming to the game in future.</p>
<p>When asked whether its next project takes place in the same world as&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, Surgent said it was "hoping to answer" that question "soon". Sounds like the answer will at the very least be a qualified yes.</p>

<p>Surgent's announcement comes at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">trying time</a> for the gaming industry as a whole, with many studios both big and small suffering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-strike-stjv-union">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs">cancellations</a>, or outright <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">closures</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Surgent will suffer the same fate remains to be seen, but given that&nbsp;<em>Zau&nbsp;</em>seems to have failed to make a major impact either <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16584/tales-of-kenzera-zau" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critically</a> or <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2316580/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commercially</a>, the studio seems to be in a bit of a tight spot.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/keywords-studios-acquires-halo-and-call-of-duty-studio-certain-affinity.1013457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keywords-studios-certain-affinity-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Certain Affinity, a studio that's helped out with co-development on major games like&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</em>, has been acquired by Keywords Studios.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/keywords-acquires-halo-co-developer-certain-affinity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the acquisition, which is for an "undisclosed sum", will consist of an upfront cash purchase combined with an "earn-out component" that will be based on Certain Affinity's performance going forward.</p>
<p>This is a fairly standard way to do business when it comes to studio acquisitions, as is the fact that Certain Affinity will seemingly largely be left alone, with its management team and workforce of around 180 apparently remaining intact.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=LW64Bs6o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=G4cyKf7N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Certain Affinity has worked on projects like&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Certain Affinity CEO Max Hoberman says he's "thrilled to be able to provide stability and a supportive home" for Certain Affinity at what is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">"most difficult time in the market"</a>.</p>
<p>As GI.biz points out, Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.certainaffinity.com/message-from-max/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">laid off 25 of its workers</a> back in March, so hopefully, this Keywords acquisition means that more employees' jobs won't be at risk, at least for the meantime.</p>
<p>For his part, Keywords CEO Bertrand Bodson says his company has "enormous respect" for Certain Affinity, and that the new acquisition will complement Keywords' "existing skills", as well as "expanding [its] presence notably in the US and Canada".</p>
<p>If you feel like Certain Affinity's name is familiar to you, it's probably because you remember 343 Industries (which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-unreal-engine-5-new-games">now Halo Studios</a>) announcing in 2022 that Certain Affinity would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/certain-affinity-is-further-evolving-halo-infinite-with-343">joining&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>as a co-developer</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=nWbRGrJB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=6CYAElw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also recognize Certain Affinity's name from its work on<em>&nbsp;Halo Infinite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the latest in a string of acquisitions for Keywords. In recent years, the company has also acquired&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keywords-studios-to-aquire-age-of-empires-developer-forgotten-empires"><em>Age of Empires&nbsp;</em>developer Forgotten Empires</a>, former&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Hardsuit Labs, and porting outfit Wushu Studios.</p>
<p>Whether Keywords' acquisition of Certain Affinity changes anything about the studio's development process remains to be seen, although given that Keywords isn't making any personnel changes, more drastic shakeups are unlikely.</p>

As the latest Call of Duty games also did, Black Ops 6 allows users to connect and play with friends and strangers across all supported systems, and this includes Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p><p>For cross-progression, all game progress is shared on your Activision account. As such, players who start Black Ops 6 on one platform and later move to another will find their progression moves with them. Players must use the same Activision account, however. Progress will not carry over to a different Activision account.</p><p>Cross-play and cross-progression are made possible through your Activision ID. Also referred to as your Display Name, this is a unique account name to your Activision account that allows you to play across systems. The Display Name is your given PSN ID, Gamertag, BattleTag, or Steam ID, extended by a hashmark followed by a series of numbers to make your account unique to you.</p><h2><strong>How to turn off cross-play</strong></h2><p>Not everyone wants to play against people on other platforms, and that's a choice you can make in Black Ops 6. From the system menus, players can choose to toggle cross-play on (allows matchmaking with other gaming platforms) or off (matchmaking only uses current gaming platform). Scaling down to your individual platform will make the player pool smaller, but finding a match in a game as big as Black Ops 6 should not be a problem for anyone, whether or not they have cross-play on or off.</p><h2>How to change your Activision ID/Display Name</h2><p>Activision allows players to change their Activision ID/Display name by applying a "username change token."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-alarmo-is-cute-and-cozy-%E2%80%94-but-it%E2%80%99s-still-just-an-alarm-clock.1013430/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have always had an adversarial relationship with alarm clocks. They are gadgets designed to ruin my most precious time, and in order to work effectively, they must be as annoying as possible. Which is why I was intrigued by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo’s surprise reveal of Alarmo</a>. (Once I got over my surprise of it not being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">the long-awaited Switch 2 announcement</a>.) What if getting up in the morning could be a little more playful? Maybe what I really needed all along was Princess Zelda’s soothing voice or the chirps of tiny pikmin to ease me into consciousness in the morning.</p><p>After a week with Alarmo, I have to admit that it hasn’t changed much about my sleep patterns. It has some clever ideas, and it looks great on a shelf, but ultimately, it’s still an alarm clock.</p><p>But what a cute alarm clock it is. Alarmo is a red cylinder with a rotund white button / knob on top and a 2.8-inch rectangular LCD display with a big ol’ bezel around it that makes it <em>almost</em> seem circular, particularly in the dark. You can pick one of (currently) five different games — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pikmin 4</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a> — to customize how the clockface looks and sounds, so that Link or Captain Olimar can walk around the screen. It’s the kind of thing that’s just nice to look at, and the characters even follow you around when you move in front of it.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Alarmo has a number of Nintendo-ized alarm features. You can choose from 35 video game “scenes” to wake up to, which range from Zelda calmly saying “wake up” to, for some reason, the sound of a pikmin drowning. Each scene starts out relatively chill and will get progressively more intense the longer you stay in bed. The top button will even start flashing colors to get your attention. Alarmo lets you customize the alarm schedule by day of the week, and it tracks your daily sleep times along with how long it takes you to actually wake up after your alarm goes off each day. All of this info is available on the clock itself; it doesn’t sync with other devices or apps.</p><p>Navigating the device is pretty easy: for most things, you simply smack the big button on top. This works for everything from turning a blaring alarm off in the morning to opening the menu to tweak settings. Otherwise, you can twist the button to adjust things — like picking the time for your alarm to go off — and there are also back and notification buttons. (So far, my notifications have all been informing me of existing Alarmo features, but in the future, it will be used to alert users for updates to add more sounds and styles based on games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>. This does require linking an existing Nintendo account to the device, the only real online feature I’ve encountered so far.)</p><p>But you shouldn’t be spending much time with those buttons because Alarmo’s big hook — aside from its Nintendo style — is its millimeter wave motion sensor. The idea is that you can interact with it simply by moving around. When it goes off in the morning, rolling out of the bed is enough to shut the alarm off. Wave your hand around a little, and it will snooze for a few minutes. In my experience, it works well enough, but with one big caveat: Alarmo’s motion sensors can’t distinguish between multiple people. So if I get out of bed but my partner sleeps in, the alarm won’t shut off.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>To be fair, Nintendo notes this issue right on the box (apparently animals can cause issues as well), but it does make the experience a lot less interesting if you share a bed. For most of the week, I’ve had to resort to getting up and turning the alarm off manually so that I don’t get in trouble for ruining my wife’s sleep with loud <em>Splatoon</em> splatters. Of course, given that a large part of the intended audience is children, this won’t be a problem for many people. Then again, my own children didn’t care much for any of the alarm or sleep tracking features anyway; they just thought it was cool having Mario on a clock. Note: this did not make it any easier to wake them up on school days.</p><p>You can also use Alarmo to help you fall back asleep. If you have a bedtime set, soothing sounds will start playing as soon as you get into bed, based on one of the five supported games (again, no button-pressing required). It has worked flawlessly for me, and I’ve become hooked on the<em> Zelda</em> nighttime theme, with its crackling fire and soft, intermittent piano. It’s like I’m dozing off in Hyrule Field after dark. But again, there’s an annoying caveat. For some inexplicable reason, the sounds only play for less than 10 minutes before going silent, so if you’re looking for Nintendo-themed white noise, you are out of luck. Hyrule is gone almost as soon as I finally get comfortable.</p><p>Those kinds of quirks make the actual sleep features of Alarmo feel like more of an afterthought. It’s first and foremost a $100 Nintendo-branded clock. It looks and sounds the part, which is to say, it’s incredibly charming and nostalgic. But if you’re looking for something to help you wake up better than a run-of-the-mill alarm or track your sleep more efficiently than an app on your phone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23449363/best-android-smartwatches-wear-os">this isn’t it</a>. Turns out, even adorable pikmin and inklings can’t change my mind about alarm clocks.</p><p><small>Alarmo is now </small><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F"><small>available to purchase early</small></a> <small>for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and will be released in early 2025 for everyone else.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of these details were then corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a>. Activision declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p>While 2024’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> is set in the 90s to the backdrop of the Gulf War, 2025’s Black Ops game reportedly shoots forward to the 2030s, picking up where 2012’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii">Black Ops 2</a>, set in 2025, left off.</p><p>It reportedly continues the Black Ops storyline from that point, with David Mason from Black Ops 2 as the protagonist. Mechanics from Black Ops 6 said to return include the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-a-new-feature-fans-are-saying-will-get-people-banned-or-make-them-go-viral-or-both">body shield</a> and Omnimovement, with some tweaks such as human shields with grenades stuck to them that can be thrown at enemies, and wall jumping. Zombies mode, meanwhile, is said to introduce an eight-player mode.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Infinity Ward is reportedly hard at work on the next Modern Warfare game, presumably Modern Warfare 4. Perhaps that’s due out in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Developer Treyarch has had four years to work on Black Ops 6, the longest development period of a mainline Call of Duty game yet. Expectations are high then after 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023"><u>Modern Warfare 3</u></a>, which is perhaps the most poorly received campaign in Call of Duty history. (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-dev-raven-didnt-react-to-modern-warfare-3-campaigns-terrible-reception-we-were-already-pretty-locked-in">Black Ops 6 campaign developer Raven told IGN it didn’t react to the Modern Warfare 3 campaign’s terrible reception</a>.)</p><p>Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022"><u>Modern Warfare 2</u></a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty"><u>Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</u></a></p><p>Assuming the reports of next year’s Call of Duty being another Black Ops game hot on the heels of this year’s Black Ops 6 are true, Activision will once again face tough questions around its value as a fully-fledged sequel.</p><p>In the shorter term, Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 and straight into Game Pass. It’s the first Call of Duty game to do so since Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for $69 billion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, a three-player co-op FPS set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Control</em>. It's due to land on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>
<p>We've known about&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>for some time, although not under that name. Remedy first announced a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-working-on-multiplayer-control-and-bigger-sequel">all the way back in 2021</a>; at that point, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-condor-is-multiplayer-control-spinoff-from-remedy-and-505">known as Project Condor</a>.</p>
<p>The game began as a collaboration between Remedy and 505 Games, but since Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>franchise from 505 earlier this year, it will instead serve as the studio's first self-published project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-2025-control-multiplayer-spinoff-soldier.jpg?itok=tNKY4Im5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-2025-control-multiplayer-spinoff-soldier.jpg?itok=ajXYcuay 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is officially on the way to PC and consoles next year.</figcaption></figure><p>A trademark for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>was first filed by Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">back in January</a>, fueling speculation (which has now proved correct) that this would be the final name for&nbsp;<em>Project Condor</em>.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-entertainment-unveils-fbc-firebreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Remedy</a>,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>will be a "mid-priced" co-op shooter in which you and your buddies play as members of Firebreak, an "adaptable response unit" sent by the Federal Bureau of Control to break a "deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces".</p>
<p>The game will be split into different missions, and before each mission, you'll build a loadout from "specialized tools, grenades, support items, and paranatural augments", customizing them to create an approach that works for you.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, which also shows off some of the game's high-octane first-person shooter gameplay, right here.</p>

<p>Remedy says that you can enjoy&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>whether you've played&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>or not; it serves as a "standalone multiplayer experience" that brings an "entirely new perspective" to the world of&nbsp;<em>Control</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't all that's coming from Remedy on the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>front, either; a full-blown sequel to the game is also in the works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">as a collaboration with Annapurna</a>, alongside TV and movie projects, although it's unclear whether Annapurna's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">game department imploding</a> will affect these plans in any way.</p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. It'll also arrive on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">certain Game Pass tiers</a> and as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium members on day one.</p>

<p>The top youngsters you need to focus on signing in EA FC 25 are <strong>Mustafa Hekimoglu</strong> as a forward, <strong>Franco Mastantuono</strong> as a midfielder, <strong>Finn Jeltsch</strong> as a defender, and <strong>Dennis Seimen</strong> as a goalkeeper. These players are young and affordable—great for all budgets—and become world-beaters in their respective positions.</p>



<p>For an even deeper look at EA FC 25’s Career Mode best wonderkids, we’ve broken down every area of the pitch and rounded up the top talents you need to sign.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-goalkeeper-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best Goalkeeper Wonderkids to Sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>While everyone wants to chase exciting strikers or midfield dominators, never underestimate the importance of a top goalkeeper. After all, it doesn’t matter how many you score, if you keep conceding, you won’t win many matches. An agile goalkeeper with catlike reflexes and immaculate distribution is a recipe for success. So, consider these youngsters for the position between the sticks.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-defender-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best defender wonderkids to sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>The value of a top GK is undeniable, but it helps if you have a rock wall of defense to protect them. Defensive formations come in all shapes and sizes in modern-day football, but each defense usually consists of at least two center-backs, with either full-backs or wing-backs flanking the sides. Some of these defenders may be kids, but a legend in the making lies dormant.</p>

<p>From CDM destroyers to playmaking number tens, midfielders are versatile and are the heartbeat of a football team. Without a good midfield, you have no attack, and your defence is regularly under siege. Unearthing the next Claude Makélélé to wrestle back possession or the new Kevin de Bruyne to orchestrate your play should be a big priority—and our list should help you out.</p>

However, it is also difficult to defeat the Slitterheads with just a single Rarity, so in battle it becomes crucial to strategically possess as many humans who are present. Because ordinary human bodies are frail, they can escape danger by possessing another human when in critical situations. Additionally, each character has their own unique active skills, which ordinary humans also possess (all ordinary humans share the same skills).</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-18-24_058.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Slitterhead_2024_10-18-24_059.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Blood Popper</strong></p><p>Throws a bomb made of coagulated blood.

		<p>The bird &amp; bear are back, with Banjo-Tooie, their second Nintendo 64 adventure, flapping onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 64™ – October 2024 Game Update – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJgHERWE_eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/19/banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-library-20-january/">almost three years after the first game was added</a>, Banjo-Tooie will be available in the N64 app for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers from 25th October. It’s the first time that this has been available through a Nintendo emulation system, which is pretty exciting for those who missed out on the original, or don’t have an Xbox for Rare Replay.</p>
<p>Originally released for N64 in 2000 (and in April 2001 in the EU), Banjo-Tooie was at the tail end of the N64 generation and was in many ways the culmination of Rare’s time with the 3D platformer genre – Conker’s Bad Fur Day was a lewd fever dream that came out the following year, and bizarrely a week before the EU release of Tooie.</p>
<p>Building on the original game’s riff on the Super Mario 64 formula, and filled with a collect-a-thon of Jigglies and musical notes, Banjo-Tooie takes things to the next level in a number of ways. Rare was able to bring back some cut content and ideas from the original, but pushing the N64 even harder by featuring direct connections between its worlds for a more contiguous adventure, where the original had you teleport into each level. That’s featured in some of the game’s puzzles, which span multiple worlds.</p>

<p>The game also features multiplayer for four players, adapting the competition mode from the single-player to give first-person shooting, football and other minigames. It’s not entirely clear that this is included in the Switch Online version, but will be interesting to see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-due-to-hit-early-access-in-2025-co-op-play-confirmed.1013367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and Unknown Worlds have revealed that long-awaited survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is officially due to land in Early Access next year, and that the game will incorporate an oft-requested co-op feature.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, Krafton and Unknown Worlds showed off the first official&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>teaser, and while it didn't give much away about the game, the Steam page and various other listings were also updated to reveal more.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, you'll play as "a pioneer traveling to a distant world", and you'll have to explore a brand new aquatic alien world brimming with resources to gather, biomes to discover, and unique creatures to...well, to swim away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=J-xELovL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=UI9eZEAt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will bring...what the hell is that? It'll bring whatever the hell that is.</figcaption></figure><p>More Leviathans will be lying in wait to ambush you, of course, and you'll also discover "diverse ecosystems", although rather mysteriously, Unknown Worlds says "something isn't right" with this world, asking "what happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you?".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-2024-live-service">previously revealed by Unknown Worlds</a>,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will feature optional co-op play for up to four players, but the developer is keen to emphasize that you can also play alone if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give away much about the game or what its story will be, but it does show off a couple of interesting-looking creatures, and it features a sound effect that will probably trigger some "fond" memories if you've played the first game.</p>

<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be the first "proper" sequel to 2018's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>. That game was followed up by a sort of sequel-come-expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em>, in 2021, but&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2 </em>looks to be&nbsp;more of a full-blooded followup.</p>
<p>Whether the new game will follow the more narrative-led approach of&nbsp;<em>Below Zero&nbsp;</em>or the open-ended exploration of the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in Early Access in 2025.</p>

It has a metascore of 56 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a> and a 'mostly negative' user review rating on Steam. IGN’s own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 single-player campaign review</a> returned a 4/10. We said: “Underbaked, rehashed, and cobbled together from multiplayer parts, Modern Warfare 3’s single-player campaign is everything a Call of Duty story mode shouldn’t be.” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> added: “Clearly rushed to market, Modern Warfare 3's campaign tapes together ill-conceived open areas, underwhelming linear missions, and a meaningless story.” In short, it was all a bit of a disaster.</p><p>A year later and Call of Duty fans are yet again faced with another campaign from the first-person shooter behemoth, this time the Raven Software-developed <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> campaign. IGN has just reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever">how Black Ops 6 is set to offer the most varied Call of Duty campaign ever</a>, but did Raven tweak anything in response to the reaction to Modern Warfare 3, or perhaps learn any lessons from Modern Warfare 3’s campaign?</p><p>Not so, Jon Zuk, associate creative director at Raven Software, told IGN in an interview.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“The campaign… all game development is very fluid and we react to a lot of different things, but in the case of the previous game’s reception, we were already pretty locked in on the story we were telling and the missions we were creating,” Zuk said. “So we didn't react to how that was received.”</p><p>One key point of difference between the developments of Modern Warfare 3, led by Sledgehammer Games, and Black Ops 6, led by Treyarch, is time. Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">Modern Warfare 2</a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty">Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</a></p><p>Black Ops 6, however, has enjoyed a longer development time than any other mainline Call of Duty game. Treyarch has worked on it for four years, ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> came out in 2020. And for the campaign, Raven too has benefited from this extra time.</p><p>“The extra development time certainly gives us time to do a little bit more prototyping and a little bit more trying something out, finding out if it's fun and if it works and throwing some things away,” Zuk explained.</p><p>“When you have the shorter development cycle, sometimes you're stuck with things just for the time crunch that maybe you aren't as happy with as you could be. So I do feel like we had good opportunities to keep crafting and recrafting the missions until we were happy with them.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.</p></div><p>Players can also expect Black Ops 6’s campaign to be longer than Cold War’s, Zuk confirmed, although your mileage may vary depending on how much time you spend back at your safehouse hub.</p><p>“You can go back, you can talk to your team, you can upgrade your weapon and your equipment and things like that,” Zuk said. “And you can do a little bit of searching around the safehouse , but there's players who are going to do all of that, and there's players who are going to do none of that and are just, I want to get to the next mission as quickly as possible.</p><p>“So I think that the game length is going to be variable from player to player, but even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6 is of course the first Call of Duty game to launch straight into Game Pass</a>, Microsoft’s subscription service. It comes after Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for an eye-watering $69 billion, and has sparked a debate about whether the move will cannibalize sales of the game.</p><p>But will launching straight into Game Pass have a meaningful impact on the number of people who play Black Ops 6’s campaign? Unlike with previous Call of Duty games, Activision is not releasing an early access campaign for Black Ops 6, which means everyone jumps in at the same time from October 25.</p><p>Zuk said that from Raven’s perspective, it’s trusting owner and publisher Activision to do what’s best for the game. “I have no input in the business side of that at all,” Zuk replied. “The decision was made to not do early access this year, and I trust that Activision has thought out every bit of this and is very confident in the success of the title.”</p><p>We've also got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-launching-with-170-gam/1100-6482120/" data-ref-id="1100-6482120">launched Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> in 2020 with great fanfare, but the company's stated goal to push cloud gaming even further has run into some technological setbacks as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-apple-sparring-again-over-cloud-gaming-apps/1100-6526265/" data-ref-id="1100-6526265">ongoing conflicts with Google and Apple</a> over multiple issues. But now a new report indicates that Microsoft is making a renewed effort to extend the reach of Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>A report released earlier this month stated that Microsoft will soon be testing its ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-soon-let-players-stream-all-their-games-not-just-those-on-game-pass-report/1100-6527140/" data-ref-id="1100-6527140">let Xbox owners stream any game in their library</a> even if it isn't on Game Pass. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, that's just the beginning of Microsoft's plans. The company is reportedly looking to add even more cloud-gaming features and introduce direct-to-cloud controllers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEulk3Ar00I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NEulk3Ar00I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The report credits the developer of the Better xCloud app for discovering Xbox's direct-to-cloud controller support, which apparently isn't quite ready to be rolled out yet. For now, Microsoft's priority is said to be focused on improving the visual quality of its streams in a bid to make it possible to play Xbox games without a console that can perform at the same level as the Xbox Series X|S. There will supposedly be forward momentum for allowing higher bitrates on Xbox Cloud Gaming "soon." However, fixing and upgrading Xbox Cloud Gaming's ongoing latency issues will reportedly take more time and "require more powerful hardware."</p><p>If Microsoft can deliver on all of those changes and give console-free gamers a comparable or better experience to having an Xbox Series X|S, then it seems likely to further erode the sales of physical consoles. Microsoft and Sony have both released digital-only consoles this generation, but if Microsoft really can remove the need for a physical console altogether then that might shake up the industry even more--although it didn't work so well for Google's Stadia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-banjo-tooie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced another Nintendo 64 addition to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're a fan of classic Rare 3D platformers, then you're going to love this one.</p>
<p>Per Nintendo itself,&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack lineup on October 25th, so between that and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-dlc-character-vikala-revealed">new&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>DLC fighter</a>, you should have plenty to keep you busy next week.</p>
<p><em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>joins the original&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which was added to Switch Online's N64 contingent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/banjo-kazooie-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-today-with-the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask-up-next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in 2022</a>. If you've been waiting all this time to play the sequel, then hey, now's your chance!</p>

<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie</em>, it's a sequel to Rare's 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and it sees the titular bear and bird returning to once again do battle with the evil witch Gruntilda.</p>
<p><em>Banjo-Tooie</em>'s levels are much larger than those of&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and there's a lot more to discover in them as well. Many of the levels are interconnected, so you may not be able to collect everything within one stage until you've visited another.</p>
<p>The game also features several new moves for Banjo and Kazooie to learn, as well as new gameplay styles, including&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>-esque first-person shooter segments and the ability to play as the shaman Mumbo Jumbo.</p>

<p>Nintendo's announcement comes just as the company gears up to begin playtesting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest">mysterious new</a> Switch Online feature, the playtest for which begins the day before&nbsp;<em>Banjo-Tooie&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to land on the subscription service.</p>
<p>It also comes just a couple of days after the fresh reveal of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025">Analogue 3D</a>, a reimagined version of the Nintendo 64 that plays original cartridges with no emulation required.</p>
<p>If you're a 3D platformer fan, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playtonicgames.com/news/announcing-yooka-replaylee/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Yooka-Replaylee</em></a>, a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Banjo&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>that's set to debut sometime in the future.</p>

	<div>
		
<p>A Call of Duty exploit has surfaced online, revealing that the RICOCHET anti-cheat has falsely banned thousands of players. </p>



<p>How the exploit works was uploaded by X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo/status/1847024778600689706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@zebleerpo</a>, which revealed how the RICOCHET anti-cheat was being abused by people who wanted to get others banned. The TL;DR is that the words “Trigger Bot” sent to users as messages or even as a part of an online ID in a Friend Request will activate RICHOCHET and ban innocent players.</p>



<p>Activision apparently learned of the exploit before it was uploaded to X and announced that it had “restored all accounts” to a “small number of legitimate player accounts.” It’s currently unclear how many accounts were legitimately affected. </p>



<p>One such account was that of popular streamer <a href="https://x.com/BobbyPoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BobbyPoff</a>, who has now been unbanned and has been a punching bag of accusations and abuse for the past several weeks. </p>



<p>One issue that the original poster points out is that legitimate cheaters might also be unbanned depending on how RICOCHET is unbanning players. “Real cheaters who were caught by these signatures will get unbanned,” they said. </p>



<p>RICOCHET has said that it will have a new blog up later today on the Road to Launch ‘Progress Report’ of its anti-cheat system, so we’ll update readers later today.</p>

        <p>European court rules Datel did not infringe Sony's copyright.</p>

            <p>Sony has lost its fight to prevent third party add-ons being sold for PlayStation games.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice has dismissed Sony's claim that the Action Replay cheat software sold by UK company Datel infringed its copyright.</p>
<p>PlayStation asserted that as Datel's boosts use its source code, the company was infringing its copyright under EU law. The case was first taken to court back in 2012.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/17/eu-court-upholds-right-to-sell-playstation-add-ons-in-loss-for-sony-datel-game-mods">EuroNews</a>, judges said that Datel's cheats do "not change or reproduce either the object code, the source code, or the internal structure and organisation of Sony's software", but "merely changes the content of the variables temporarily transferred by Sony’s games to the console's RAM, which are used during the running of the game".</p>
<p>"The directive protects only the intellectual creation as it is reflected in the text of the computer program's source code and object code," the court said.</p>
<p>"The Court finds that the content of the variable data transferred by a computer program to the RAM of a computer and used by that program in its running does not fall within the protection specifically conferred by that directive, in so far as that content does not enable such a program to be reproduced or subsequently created."
</p>
<p>In a non-binding opinion prepared for the case earlier this year, Advocate General Maciej Szpunar insisted it was not illegal to use any copyrighted work in a way that may differ from the creator's intentions.</p>
<p>"The author of a detective novel cannot prevent the reader from skipping to the end of the novel to find out who the killer is, even if that would spoil the pleasure of reading and ruin the author's efforts to maintain suspense," Szpunar said.</p><p>Yesterday we reported that former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden - who served as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of Worldwide Studios before leaving the company in 2019 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-exec-says-console-makers-need-to-compete-on-content-instead-of-fighting-over-teraflops">was asked if the console industry's current business model was sustainable</a>, given the increasing development costs associated with the ongoing pursuit of incrementally more powerful hardware.</p>
<p>"We've done these things this way for 30 years," Layden replied, "every generation those costs went up and we realigned with it. We've reached the precipice now, where the centre can't hold, we cannot continue to do things that we have done before."</p></div>

            <p>Sony has released its new customisable Welcome Hub for PlayStation 5 in the UK.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ps5-system-update-adds-customisable-welcome-hub">announced the software update back in September</a>, with a rollout "over the coming weeks" - now it's available here.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub appears on the home screen and provides an at-a-glance look at various elements, all through customisable widgets.</p>

<p>For instance, you can now quickly see who from your friends list is online, how much battery is left in your controller, messages received, how much storage space is left, you current trophies, and more.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar to US users, the Welcome Hub is essentially a reworked version of the Explore tab previously only available in that country.</p>

<p>Users can also select from a number of backgrounds for the tab, including animated options or screenshots, and widgets are easily enabled or disabled.</p>
<p>Sony's original announcement for the Welcome Hub was notable for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-removes-ps-vr2-charging-icon-from-welcome-hub-blog-post-as-wireless-speculation-grows">strange inclusion in an accompanying screenshot of what looked like a charging icon for PS VR</a> - a device that isn't battery operated.</p>
<p>The blog post was swiftly updated to switch the screenshot and no further comment was provided.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-might-finally-get-improved-bitrates-soon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-to-let-you-stream-your-own-games-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft is finally allowing users to stream their own games through Xbox Cloud Gaming next month. Now, Warren has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> additional information on Microsoft's plans for Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>
<p>The cloud streaming service formerly known as Project XCloud has long lagged behind its competitors in terms of latency and quality. Whereas NVIDIA GeForce NOW started offering 4K resolution support <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-brings-4k-to-pc-and-mac-3-new-star-wars-games-120-fps-support-to-more-mobile-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">years ago</a> and Boosteroid has followed suit recently, Xbox Cloud Gaming is still limited to 1080p resolution with low bitrates, resulting in much worse visuals.</p>
<p>According to Warren, Microsoft is taking steps to improve the bitrates soon, which will certainly help with visual clarity. However, he did not mention an actual resolution improvement, so it's possible Xbox Cloud Gaming will remain stuck at 1080p for a while yet. Moreover, he noted that any latency improvement would have to be tied to an upgrade in the server hardware. It didn't sound like that would happen any time soon.</p>
<p>Warren also commented on two work-in-progress features that were sort of leaked by the creator of <a href="https://better-xcloud.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better XCloud</a>, a free and open source application that improves the XCloud experience on various devices. The first feature is <a href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1838509481371799905" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Together</a>, a way to play games and hang out with friends while inside a browser. The second is a <a href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1821329541476053075" target="_blank" rel="noopener">direct-to-cloud controller</a> that could cut on the latency, just like the Google Stadia controller did. According to Warren, while both features were being tested internally, Xbox Together was really just a 'hackathon project' that is unlikely to ever be released to the public. The direct-to-cloud controller thing is still being worked on, though, and might be launched at some point.</p>
<p>Overall, Warren reckons Microsoft is once again working hard on Xbox Cloud Gaming. It was, after all, the key in their plan to reach a much bigger audience than what's otherwise possible just with consoles and PCs. To that end, earlier this week, they proudly <a href="https://wccftech.com/stream-three-call-of-duty-games-with-game-pass-from-25-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Call of Duty: Warzone will all be available for cloud streaming for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>

<p>Vikala will be released on October 25th. She joins the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-new-dlc-character-vanes-release-date-and">Vane</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-first-look-at-beatrix-and-vane-dlc-characters">Beatrix</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-2b-from-nier-automata-dlc-on-top-of-vane-and"><em>Nier: Automata</em>'s 2B</a> as downloadable fighters (although the latter is sadly not likely to be documented on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix">Yoko Taro fansite Accord's Library</a> anytime soon).</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;Vikala, she's one of&nbsp;<em>Granblue</em>'s Twelve Divine Generals, and she's constantly in a battle between two sides of her personality, one of which wants to bring joy to the world while the other wants to be left alone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-vikala-dlc-fight.jpg?itok=M2u7RWTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-vikala-dlc-fight.jpg?itok=Fyy9qxn2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vikala may look cute, but don't be fooled: she's deadly.</figcaption></figure><p>In&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, she fights with a mixture of cutesy items like pillows and mouse projectiles alongside deadly mousetraps and ornate-looking cannons.</p>
<p>As her introductory trailer closes, we see her performing before an adoring crowd, dancing atop a golden mousetrap with sharp jaws and demonstrating the two warring sides of her personality.</p>
<p>Picking up Vikala's DLC pack gets you not only the character, but also a new premium avatar for use within the game, as well as a badge and several Figure Studio poses and expressions.</p>
<p>You can check out Vikala's debut trailer, which gives a sense of how she's going to play when she lands in&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>next week, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em>, it's a sequel-to-slash-rework-of 2020's&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Rising&nbsp;</em>is a fighting game created by&nbsp;<em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>dev Arc System Works.</p>
<p><em>Rising&nbsp;</em>brings new mechanics and new characters to the table, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-input-changes">controversial new control changes</a> that were intended to make the game more palatable to a wider audience.</p>
<p><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising&nbsp;</em>is available right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2157560/Granblue_Fantasy_Versus_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-standard-edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. Vikala arrives as part of the game's lineup of DLC fighters on October 25th.</p>
