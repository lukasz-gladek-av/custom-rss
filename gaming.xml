                <p>This year, everyone's favorite pink blob, Kirby, is turning 30.

The list also included the Splatoon art books, but it's worth noting that these are for the Japanese editions only. The US versions have been out of print for years--and the Splatoon 3 book hasn't been translated into English yet--but even if you can't read Japanese, the illustrations inside are still gorgeous to look at.</p><h3>The Legend of Zelda Art Books</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Expanded/dp/1911015486?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Breath of the Wild - Complete Official Guide, Expanded Edition</a> -- $19.66 (<strike>$40</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Creating-Champion/dp/1506710115?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion - Hero's Edition</a> -- $59.84 (<strike>$110</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Breath-Wild-Creating-Champion/dp/1506710107?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Breath of the Wild - Creating a Champion - Standard Edition</a> -- $20</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom - Complete Official Guide Collector's Edition</a> -- $25 (<strike>$45</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Art-Artifacts/dp/1506703356?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Art &amp;

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-and-marvels-collaboration-remains-strong-after-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-committed-to-making-three-games-based-on-marvel-characters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We learned yesterday that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/">EA had canceled its Black Panther game and shut down the team that was working on it, Cliffhanger Studios</a>. This immediately put into question the status of EA's other Marvel-based projects, like Motive Studios' Iron Man game.</p>
<p>However, according to statements from Marvel and EA that were sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">IGN</a>, the collaboration between the two companies "<em>remains strong,</em>" and EA is still committed to making three games based on Marvel characters, as they <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-marvel-games-partner-3-new-action-adventure-games/">previously agreed to in 2022.</a></p>
<p>Originally, the three games would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">EA Motive's Iron Man game</a>, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game, and a third unannounced title. The Iron Man game is still in development, and, as far as we know right now, is still planned to be released.</p>
<p>"<em>Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues,</em>" said EA Entertainment president Laura Miele in a statement.</p>
<p>For Marvel's part, a spokesperson for the company said, "<em>The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA, a creative collaboration focused on original storytelling with various, beloved Marvel characters, remains strong. Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios</em>."</p>
<p>So after the Iron Man game, it sounds like, at least for now, Motive Studios is on the hook for two more games based on a Marvel character. Whether we actually get those games is another question. If the Iron Man game flops, it wouldn't be surprising if the other projects are canceled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-shutting-down-soon-2023-content-canceled/">Marvel's Avengers</a> definitively proved that putting big-name comic book characters in a video game does not guarantee success in today's MCU-led market.</p>
<p>But that's the less likely scenario, since Motive has an incredibly talented team and there are no signs that it will try to mash a bunch of unwanted live service-focused features into its <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-action-adventure-game-confirmed-by-marvel-and-motive/">single-player</a> Iron Man game.</p>
<p>Which seemingly puts Motive Studios in a similar position to Respawn, with both studios locked into making three games based on Disney-owned franchises. Once the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">third Star Wars Jedi</a> title from Respawn and the third Marvel game from Motive are out, EA might finally move entirely away from making games based on licensed series, as chief executive officer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/">Andrew Wilson talked about</a>. Sorry to all <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/">Star Wars Battlefront III</a> hopefuls.</p>

The revised models include the $149.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision</a> and $199.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/pc-controllers/scuf-envision-pro-steel-grey-he">Envision Pro</a> for PC as well as the $249.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-base-black">Reflex Pro</a> and $279.99 <a href="https://scufgaming.com/playstation5/scuf-reflex-fps-steelgray">Reflex FPS</a> for PlayStation 5 and PC. Those are all starting prices, of course, as the Corsair-owned brand offers a wide variety of customization options that can take each model to even higher prices.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> upgrade brings Scuf’s wireless offerings in line with its wired-only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller">Valor Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price">Nomad</a> mobile controllers, replacing the original Reflex and Envision pads that first debuted in 2021 and 2023, respectively.</p><p>Scuf is getting with the program on Hall effect sticks at a time when the magnetic, drift-resistant sensing option has become commonplace in other brands like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo</a>, Razer, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">GameSir</a>, but hasn’t appeared in controllers from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644457/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controller-hall-effect-joystick-drift">Nintendo</a>, Sony, or Microsoft yet. But some controller makers are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177912/gulikit-hall-effect-dualsense-dualshock-4-xbox-series-switch-joystick">already moving on</a> to a more power-efficient drift-resistant technology: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR sticks</a>.</p><p>Scuf controllers may be even pricier than premium controller options from Microsoft and Sony like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, but in my experience they’re nice for those willing to spend the money. They’re some of the few native wireless options for Xbox Series X / S and PS5, and Scuf’s rear paddles and clicky hair-trigger options are some of the best feeling “pro” upgrades around. The lack of drift resistant sticks has made it a little more challenging to recommend them, though.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> Nightreign</a> is designed as a three-player co-op journey that aims to challenge players' combat abilities, having them work together to bring down tough bosses and explore a shifting map. While you can play Nightreign as a solo player, the game is focused on pairing you with two other players for you all to fight and explore together. Fortunately, both the single-player and multiplayer functions in Elden Ring Nightreign are easy to use, allowing you to minimize your time between expeditions into the Living Lands.</p><p>Below, we'll show you everything you need to know about how to start expeditions and how to set up both single-player and co-op multiplayer runs in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as the lack of proper cross-play support.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_expeditions_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to start expeditions in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, let's go over how to actually get into expeditions once you're past the tutorial of the game that occurs within the first 10 or so minutes.</p><p>After the tutorial, you'll find yourself at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a>, a familiar location for Elden Ring fans. At the Roundtable Hold, you can interact with a variety of NPCs, but the main area you'll spend the majority of your time in is right in the center at the table itself. When you approach the central table, you'll get a prompt to "Commence Expedition," which you want to press.</p><p>When you choose to commence an expedition, the boss menu in Nightreign will appear on your screen. This lists all the current bosses you can hunt down in the game, providing a brief background on each one so you know what you're up against. Before you choose a boss, though, you want to tab over to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-matchmaking-psa-guide/1100-6531878/" data-ref-id="1100-6531878">Matchmaking</a> Settings by using the bumpers on your controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498397"></a><figcaption>Starting an expedition with the first boss in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498397-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.19-21.50.49.38.png"></figure><p>On the Matchmaking Settings menu, you're able to invite members to your party, create a password for your friends to use and join your group, and even change your Expedition Type to switch between single-player and multiplayer.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_solo_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First up, if you want to play solo in Elden Ring Nightreign, all you have to do is change the Expedition Type from the default "multiplayer" to "singleplayer." These are your only two options, so switching the type once will do the trick.</p><p>Once you have switched your Expedition Type, you can head into the boss menu, select your boss, and then commence a solo expedition. As a note, you'll default to the class that you currently have equipped in the Roundtable Hold, as you have no teammates to go through the class selection screen with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498400"></a><figcaption>Going through Nightreign in a party of one</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498400-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.51.25.03.png"></figure><p>Other than that, everything is the exact same as it is in the multiplayer expeditions. You can do the same things, fight the same enemies, and try to defeat all of the bosses to eventually reach the final boss. Of course, as a solo player, this is incredibly hard, and once you die a single time, you're dead for good since you can't be revived.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_multiplayer_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play multiplayer in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now, let's get into playing Elden Ring Nightreign the way the developers intended. By default, your Expedition Type is set to multiplayer, so if you want to play with two random players, all you have to do is commence an expedition, pick your boss, and then the game will take care of the rest. You'll be automatically matched with two other real players, and then the character selection screen will appear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401"></a><figcaption>The tutorial box for setting up team expeditions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png"></figure><p>Only one person can select any particular class, so if a player gets to your favorite class, you need to have a backup or two. Once the characters have been chosen, all three of you will drop onto a map together, and you can start playing from there. There's no limit to staying near your teammates, so feel free to do whatever you think is best. However, you'll eventually wind up with your teammates at the end of the day as the zone encroaches around the map.</p><p>On the flip side, if you want to play with your friends instead of random players, you can do that from the Matchmaking Settings menu as well. All you have to do is select the "Invite Members" option from the menu, which brings up a list of your online friends from your platform. If you invite players, they become members of your party, and you can all hop into an expedition when everyone has readied up. As a note, <strong>if some players haven't progressed to your point in the game, they'll still be able to play, but could experience content they haven't seen yet</strong>.</p><p>To bypass the inviting and joining process, you can also set a multiplayer password. This allows you to matchmake with players using the same password as you, which gives you the chance to play with people that you're not friends with on your platform. You can choose to set the number of players with the password who can join, with a maximum of three players, which fills out the entire party. If you select one or two players, then the remaining spots will be filled with random players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402"></a><figcaption>Setting a multiplayer password for others to join off</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png"></figure><p>Finally, you can also set up to five group passwords. These passwords are so you can more easily see bloodstains, phantoms, and victor records from others who are using the same password. Of course, setting up five passwords takes some coordination if you're planning to use them across a large friend group, so make sure all of your friends are using the exact passwords.</p><h2 id="Does_Elden_Ring_Nightreign_support_cross_play_">Does Elden Ring Nightreign support cross-play?</h2><p>Now that you understand how multiplayer expeditions work, you might be wondering if you're able to party up with your friends or other players who are on a different system. Unfortunately, Elden Ring Nightreign does not support cross-play at launch, meaning that you can only matchmake with players who are on the same system as you.</p><p>However, there is one caveat to that rule. Nightreign does support cross-generation play, which means you can party up with friends and players who are using the same console brand as you. For example, if you're on Xbox Series X|S, a friend on Xbox One can still matchmake with you for an expedition. The same goes for players on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>So, while the game doesn't offer full cross-play, there is a silver lining for those who have a friend group with some mismatched last-generation and current-generation consoles.</p><p>And that just about does it for all of the ways to set up an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

Magic Cocktail is the most important part of the Recluse's skillset, as it restores her FP <em>and</em> gives her access to a broad variety of offensive and support spells, from fiery explosions to auras that raise everyone's maximum HP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_Cocktail_and_Elemental_Defense"><strong>Magic Cocktail and Elemental Defense</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">This is the Recluse's standard art. Use it when an elemental stain is present to absorb that element and recover FP. The Recluse stores three elemental stains, and when she uses Magic Cocktail with three stains, she casts a new spell that changes depending on the stored elements used. Magic Cocktail has no cooldown timer, and you need to use it regularly to restore the Recluse's FP so she can keep casting spells.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Soulblood_Song"><strong>Soulblood Song</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Soulblood Song is the Recluse's ultimate art. She attaches blood sigils to all nearby foes and deals magic damage to them. Allies--including the Recluse--who attack enemies with blood sigils will restore their HP and FP by a small amount with each attack.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_dodge"><strong>Magic dodge</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">This isn't a named ability, but the Recluse's dodge has a slightly longer window of evasion compared to the standard dodge the other Nightfarers get.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The most important thing about Magic Cocktail, aside from learning its combos, is that the Recluse can absorb elemental stains from sources other than her own spells. If, for example, a teammate has a fire bow and attacks an enemy with it, it'll create a fire stain you can absorb.</p><p dir="ltr">The Recluse begins an expedition with a single weapon, the Recluse's Staff. It's a basic sorcery staff that lets her cast Glintstone Pebble, which is good for single targets, and Glintstone Arc, which can hit groups of enemies and potentially knock them backward.

Zamoor Ice Storm is another powerful sorcery, though it's rare, and you can end up with good results from any of the dragon communion Incantations. The drawback with using those is how long they take to cast and how difficult it is to target quick enemies with them. The best time to use a dragon breath Incantation is while a boss is immobile during a critical hit or if their attention is occupied elsewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't find the spells you want, it's worth keeping one or two weapons with elemental affiliations on hand. The Recluse isn't built for using greatswords and hammers, but a twinblade, dagger, whip, or sword with a useful affinity lets you use a wider variety of Magic Cocktail's combos even without magic.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_relics_for_Recluse">Best relics for Recluse</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502326"></a><figcaption>Spells have lengthy cast times, so make sure you have enough space between you and your target to cast them safely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like with weapons, the random nature of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">finding relics</a> makes it challenging to recommend a combination that might be useful to anyone.

If you feel up to it, though, shatter the shield with an ultimate art, such as the Ironeye's or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-class-guide/1100-6531893/" data-ref-id="1100-6531893">Wylder</a>'s.

While we never saw evidence that Libra suffers from the madness affliction like other enemies do--where they suffer extra damage after a period of buildup--it's true that the boss takes extra damage from madness weapons and spells.</p><p dir="ltr">Those are hard to find, though, and you might have more than a few runs without a madness camp showing up on the map. If so, or if the weapons you get from a madness camp don't suit your build, Libra is also prone to frostbite and blood loss. Ice weapons and spells, katanas, daggers with bleed effects, or, if you're lucky, a bow with the bloodloss effect, are all suitable choices.</p><p dir="ltr">By Day 2, if you don't have any weapons that take your fancy, spend time getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-smithing-stones-and-upgrade-weapons-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531840/" data-ref-id="1100-6531840">Smithing Stone 2 in Limveld's mines</a>.

You want at least one ranged character who can maintain pressure while the beast is targeting a teammate or while you're out of their attack range. The other necessary component for this fight is an ultimate art that damages enemies--so, the Wylder, Ironeye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guardian-class-guide/1100-6531894/" data-ref-id="1100-6531894">Guardian</a>, or Raider. At several points during the fight, Libra will start to generate a shell that, if left unbroken, increases the boss's resistance to all attacks for several minutes. The Executor's ultimate is useful, but often not powerful enough to break the shell before it forms.</p><p dir="ltr">Ironeye is the best choice, since they're less reliant on lucky item drops and can still dish out quite a lot of damage just by upgrading their standard bow. One hit from their ultimate is also enough to shatter Libra's shell before it forms. The Recluse is also useful--doubly so if you manage to nab a madness-related spell or Incantation--though their reliance on item drops for stronger Magic Cocktail spells means you might get stuck with just Glintstone Pebble for the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">The Duchess is another worthwhile consideration. Her ultimate deals no damage, but her extra dodge and longer evasion window makes it easier to avoid Libra's staff strikes and escape from madness sigils before they activate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for some extra support, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guides-hub/1100-6531889/" data-ref-id="1100-6531889">Elden Ring Nightreign guides hub</a> which includes the best ways to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-best-ways-to-farm-runes/1100-6531844/" data-ref-id="1100-6531844">farm runes</a>, where to find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-smithing-stones-and-upgrade-weapons-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531840/" data-ref-id="1100-6531840">smithing stones</a> to upgrade weapons, and how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">increase healing flask charges</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> matchmaking isn't as simple as pressing a button and letting the game take care of everything. That's especially true if you're looking to tackle specific fights against the Night Lords, or want to play with people from other regions.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">how to play solo and multiplayer</a>, there are a few matchmaking rules that aren't explained in too much detail. If you're only getting your bearings around the game, the process might lead to some frustrations. Fear not, though, as we'll explain everything you need to know about how matchmaking works in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Elden Ring Nightreign matchmaking works</h2><p dir="ltr">At its core, matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightregin is fairly straightforward. Interacting with the Table of Lost Grace at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a> opens up the Expeditions menu. From there, you can select which boss you want to tackle and immediately start matchmaking, which will search for two other available players who are on the same hunt as you are.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've enabled the cross-region network option, you might be matched with people from, well, other regions. I'm based in Argentina, and I've primarily played with people from the United States, but latency was rarely an issue.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, here's where matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightreign gets tricky: The first available Night Lord is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. You won't gain access to other bosses until you've beaten it at least once. As such, if you want to matchmake with people who have other Night Lords unlocked, you'll first need to tackle that requirement. This <em>can</em> be bypassed if you're matchmaking through specific platforms' party invites, but it won't apply to random matchmaking with players outside your friends list.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502861"></a><figcaption>A party of Nightfarers arrives on day 1 in Limveld.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Shifting Earth events are another condition. These are random instances that affect maps in an array of ways, which also become available after defeating our pal Tricephalos. Now, these are in rotation, and there are a few different conditions to unlock them all. You can matchmake with people who have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-shifting-earth-events-guide/1100-6531879/" data-ref-id="1100-6531879">Shifting Earth event</a> active, even if you don't, but you must have encountered it at least once before.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, there are also Character Remembrances. These lore snippets, which are different for each playable class, lead to unique objectives on your next expedition. If you have one active, you won't be able to matchmake with other players who also have an active objective. Once again, you can bypass this step by inviting folks through your platform's party system. If you do, only the first person to start the matchmaking process will have their objective on the map.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, if you're matchmaking with friends in Elden Ring Nightreign, you'll largely be able to join each other's games without too many hurdles. When trying to find matches with random people, however, it might be tricky. At the very least, the more progress you make, the easier this will become.

While From Software's latest might not be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-battle-royale-games/2900-6531/" data-ref-id="2900-6531">battle royale</a>, it does take a cue from the genre with a circle that gradually closes in on a specific map area.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering about the inner workings of the Night's Tide and how it dictates the flow of every expedition, this guide covers how the Night's Tide works in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as some tips to get around it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How the Night's Tide in Elden Ring Nightreign works</h2><p dir="ltr">The flow of an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign is determined by the ever-increasing presence of the Night's Tide. In short, this is a deadly rain that gradually engulfs the map, closing in on a random area where a boss fight takes place. This happens at the end of Day 1 and Day 2--after the latter, you'll automatically move to a different area outside Limveld, where you'll do your last preparations before confronting the Night Lord chosen for the expedition.</p><p dir="ltr">Each day lasts for around 15 minutes. During that time, you'll notice how the blue circle outside of the map gradually shrinks. You'll get notifications on screen when this starts happening, but opening the map to periodically check its location and whether it's moving or not is a good routine to develop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502948-eldenringnightreign_20250521212124.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502948" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502948-eldenringnightreign_20250521212124.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502948"></a><figcaption>Open your map often while exploring Limveld to check the Night's Tide status.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502948-eldenringnightreign_20250521212124.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you come into contact with the rain, you'll slowly lose health. In the case that it completely drains your HP, you'll lose a level and your current runes to come back to life. There is a short window in which the Nightfarer will crawl on the ground, which is a window of opportunity for your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-revive-teammates-faster-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531891/" data-ref-id="1100-6531891">squadmates to revive you</a>, but it might be hard under the rain.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, bear in mind the respawn site is random and won't automatically move you toward your teammates, which can potentially lead to additional subsequent deaths until you're clear of the Night's Tide. While the rain is an annoying threat and can be difficult to deal with, you can use your flasks to replenish your health. Be mindful of Sites of Grace nearby, especially if you're moving toward a boss encounter, as you might end up with just a few flasks to use for the fight if you don't replenish them in time.</p><p dir="ltr">What happens with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-best-ways-to-farm-runes/1100-6531844/" data-ref-id="1100-6531844">runes</a> and the level you lost? If you were defeated inside the Night's Tide on Day 1, you're free to return to the spot on Day 2 and reclaim your lost runes, including the ones for the lost level. If this happens on day 2, the only way to recover them is if the death happened somewhat close to the boss encounter area. You'll be able to sprint toward the runes and reclaim them. Don't worry about using all of your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">flasks</a>, as you can replenish them before the smackdown against the Night Lord.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all you need to know about the Night's Tide in Elden Ring Nightreign.

                <p>When you first get past the tutorial in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, you'll be able to challenge a single boss: the Tricephalos. This is the only boss that you can select from the Expeditions menu, regardless of whether you decide to run a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">solo or multiplayer expedition</a>. If you manage to make it through your first two nights, you'll get to challenge Tricephalos, which goes by the name "Gladius, Beast of the Night" when you get to the boss arena.</p><p>If you don't want to die to Gladius and make your expedition run all for nothing, then check out our guide below for tips on how to beat the first boss in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><h2>Gladius, Beast of the Night attacks</h2><p>Gladius, Beast of the Night is a three-headed dog--or Tricephalos-- with several primary attacks that you'll always need to be on the lookout for and a couple of major attacks that can decimate your entire party at any moment. It specializes in fire damage, so that's worth keeping in mind for your resistances and counters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503372-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.22.48.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503372" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503372-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.22.48.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503372"></a><figcaption>The opening scene with Gladius, Beast of the Night</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503372-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.22.48.93.png"></figure><p>When your party first heads into the boss arena, Gladius will usually start with its chain attack, where it will uncoil a large whip-like chain from over its head and fire it quickly in a curved line. This attack always targets a single player, but can be initially avoided if you see that the boss is targeting you. However, you need to watch out for the chain's secondary attack, which whips the chain across the arena and damages anyone who's in its way.</p><p>After the chain attack is over, Gladius will recall the chain and often start moving around the arena to find a specific player to target with close-range attacks. If the boss doesn't do that, though, it will likely use its sword attack, which is another medium- to long-range move that targets one player. The sword attack is similar to the chain, but the sword moves in a straighter line and at a faster speed. It's easy to predict which player the boss targets with the sword, but you need to be quick to dodge the sword once Gladius swings it at you if you're the one it's targeting.</p><p>Those are the two set attacks that Gladius performs with the weapons at its disposal. Of course, Gladius also has attacks that involve melee or using one of its three heads. In between the chain and sword attacks, the boss will target one player and move towards them to try and bite them, lift up its paws to do a stomp move, or swing its tail around to damage any nearby players.</p><p>After you have dealt enough damage to Gladius it will unleash its primal form, which involves the boss splitting up into three separate dogs. Each one of these dogs remains large, but only one has a sword that it can use. However, the entire boss arena will be covered in banners that deal area of effect damage throughout this phase, so you want to ensure you're staying far away from the floating orange structures.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503373-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.24.24.91.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503373-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.24.24.91.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503373"></a><figcaption>The primal form of Gladius litters the arena with dangerous banners.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503373-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.24.24.91.png"></figure><p>You need to deal enough damage to each of the three dogs during this phase for Gladius to return to its normal, three-headed self. Every time Gladius returns to its regular form, you can expect the same attacks as when the fight began. So it's crucial you know the timing and predictability of the chain and sword attacks.</p><h2>Strategies for Gladius, Beast of the Night</h2><p>Now that we've gone into the attacks you can expect from Gladius, what are some strategies you and your party can utilize to defeat the boss?</p><p>First off, it's highly recommended not to try this boss solo, as the three dog phase alone will usually be enough to overwhelm a single player. Going in with a full three-person party is the best way to defeat Gladius, and there's really no "perfect" party combination to use. However, if you want to see some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">efficient party combinations in Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, check out our other guide.</p><p>Assuming you are in a full party of three, the best opening strategy for Gladius is to have one dedicated player be the "aggro" target for the boss. This player should ideally be running a tanky melee class like the Raider or Wylder, and their job is to consistently grab the attention of Gladius when it's not performing one of its set attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503374-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.23.08.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503374" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503374-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.23.08.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503374"></a><figcaption>Splitting up your party's three members is a great strategy for Gladius</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503374-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.23.08.77.png"></figure><p>When Gladius is focused on this single player, the other two party members can attack it from range or up close, depending on their chosen classes. The aggro target player can also try to attack, but their primary job is to dodge Gladius' attacks to stay healthy and keep the boss focused on them. Whenever Gladius moves to try to attack another player, the aggro target needs to attack the boss to make it refocus on them.</p><p>To effectively deal damage to Gladius, all players need to use their abilities to their fullest extent. Taking larger chunks away from the boss's bar using abilities and perhaps some equipment is the best way to make this fight go by faster. Of course, abilities aren't always available to use, so the players who Gladius isn't focused on need to try and deal consistent damage using their top weapon(s) while the boss is distracted and not using one of its better attacks.</p><p>The players Gladius isn't targeting can also try to support the aggro target. This can be done using Warming Stones in the aggro target's range, which heal any character standing in its range, or utilizing their own abilities if the player gets into trouble. For example, the Raider class can summon a large pillar as its ultimate ability, and that can be used quite effectively to save a player who is low on HP or needs to be revived faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503375-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.27.31.81.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503375" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503375-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.27.31.81.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503375"></a><figcaption>The first Night Lord Felled screen in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503375-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.27.31.81.png"></figure><p>Unfortunately, a bulk of this strategy goes out the window during Gladius' three dog phase. During this phase, it's best for each player to try to manage one of the three dogs so that the dogs aren't all grouping up on one player, which can lead to a vicious revive cycle. Of course, if one or two players are low on HP, then it might be better to all group up and try to survive the phase together so that one player doesn't take the brunt of the damage.</p><p>All in all, Gladius can be a tricky boss to deal with in Elden Ring Nightreign. It has some powerful attacks, a difficult phase that can be triggered multiple times, and a ton of HP that doesn't go down easily. However, as long as your party members are dealing consistent damage, splitting up when necessary, and helping out different players, you should be able to defeat the boss on your first or second try.</p><p>If you managed to defeat the Tricephalos in Elden Ring Nightreign, why not take a look at our other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-equilibrious-beast-libra-boss-guide/1100-6531874/" data-ref-id="1100-6531874">boss guide for the Equilibrious Beast</a>, which is unlocked after defeating Gladius.

            <p>
Anyone that's ever been on the London underground, no matter their background, can all likely agree on one thing: that place is nasty. I mean, it's all underground, where's the dirt meant to go? And it's not like anyone's putting any money into getting the place cleaned. But, if you've ever fantasized about hosing down a Northern Line train for yourself, one, that's possibly slightly odd, and two, you'll be able to do almost just that in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator's</a> next and last update.

<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/futurlab">FuturLab</a> shared an <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">update earlier today</a> saying that "the time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator." Four years on since the game launch into early access in 2021, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">cleaning sim</a> will be getting an update titled The Muckingham Files 6 where you'll be able to clean up a legally safe version of a London underground train, as well as a nice looking park with a big gnome statue, amongst others.

The update is already available too, and it's completely free, so you'll just need to update your game when you're feeling the need to clean.

<p>
If you're wondering, "wait, last update? Why?", I would like to say that it's okay when things end sometimes, but also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-devs-tell-us-their-tips-for-real-life-house-cleaning">PowerWash Simulator 2 was announced a couple of months ago</a>, so that'll be why the first one is winding down. The sequel is set to arrive sometime in 2025, as long as all goes to plan, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulator-2-has-split-screen-co-op-for-twice-the-wash-power">and it'll even have splitscreen co-op</a>. FuturLab are also self-publishing this one, so unfortunately you probably won't be able to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/powerwash-simulators-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-pack-is-out-now">give Cloud's sword a good polish this time around</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-items-wending-grace-flask-1851782963<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is a new multiplayer-focused spin-off title to 2022's <em>Elden Ring</em>. It’s a combination that feels familiar and entirely new in equal measure. Having more in common with roguelikes and extraction games than with its predecessor’s open-world Soulslike structure, this thrilling new direction may take some getting used to. Don’t worry, though, as you’ll find a handful of worthwhile tips down below that can help acclimate you to this all-new entry in the <em>Elden Ring</em> franchise.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h247796"><a id="1"></a>Pick a character that plays to your strengths</h2><p>Every fan of the Soulslike genre has strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you’re excellent with aggressive melee combat but feel completely out of your element using magic. Maybe you’d rather run with shields and act as a tank for your team. Whatever your vibe is, make sure you pick a character or two that suits your playstyle and master them before stepping too far outside of your comfort zone. This is still a pretty challenging game.</p><h2 id="h247797"><a id="2"></a>Know when to split up and when to stick together</h2><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>’s fast-paced, time-sensitive gameplay loop may sometimes require you to split from your team and tackle something while they’re busy with their own tasks. However, this is a cooperative game designed from the ground up to facilitate teamwork, so <strong>don’t make a habit of setting off on a whole adventure alone while your teammates are trying to take down a boss or fend off an army of foes</strong>. Unless you’re communicating with a group that has a solid gameplan, it’s usually smarter to stay pretty close to one another to be best prepared for what awaits you.</p><h2 id="h247798"><a id="3"></a>Use pins to communicate</h2><p><strong>If you’re not voice chatting with your teammates, consider using pins to share your intentions</strong>. Setting a pin somewhere will deploy a light column that signals to your group that you intend to go to that spot. Moreover, you can set a pin on one of your teammates’ pins to indicate that you agree to follow them to that spot and assist with what you find there.</p><h2 id="h247799"><a id="4"></a>Focus on leveling up early</h2><p>You’re destined to encounter some extremely challenging foes as you explore the map, so make an effort to level up quickly at the beginning of a run. You’ll usually land near an encampment full of low-level foes, so make sure to kill them quickly to get off on the right foot. Afterward, make your way to a site of grace to start pumping up your character’s stats, then prioritize getting your loot grind started.</p><h2 id="h247800"><a id="5"></a>Always stop at churches for flask upgrades</h2><p>With your flask being your primary healing option, <strong>never pass up an opportunity to stop by a church and score a flask upgrade</strong>. These will become less and less prevalent as the ring closes in, so prioritize any you see on the outer rim, assuming they’re close enough to get to without wasting too much precious time. As the ring closes in, try to map out a looting route that passes by another church or two. You’ll be happy you did.</p><h2 id="h247801"><a id="6"></a>Buy a Wending Grace every chance you get</h2><p>If you encounter a merchant selling a Wending Grace, and you have enough runes to purchase it, always do so. <strong>This item will offer you a single revival, giving you an extra chance at success</strong>. You’d be shocked at how quickly things can take a turn for the worse in an expedition, so this may be just the thing that saves your team from failing a run.</p><h2 id="h247802"><a id="7"></a>Don’t be conservative with items</h2><p><strong>Your consumable items don’t carry over between rounds</strong>, so make use of them as often as needed to ensure your survival and improve your character. Got a Gold-Pickled Fowl Foot? Use it to improve how quickly you obtain runes. Facing off against a tough boss? Go ahead and use your Boiled Crab to increase your defense. Need a bit of extra damage? Use those weapon coating items and go to town. Life is short. Life is even shorter in <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>. Live it!</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So, you may be wondering if <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> supports crossplay. Let’s get that answered for you.</p><h2 id="h249274"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> have crossplay support?</h2><p>Let’s rip the band-aid off: <strong>There is no crossplay support in <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em></strong>. This means that <strong>you can only play the game online with other players on your platform</strong>. As an example, if you buy the game on PC, you’ll only be able to play with other PC players. Yeah, it’s a bummer.</p><p>There’s one sliver of good news, though. <strong>The game <em>does</em> provide crossplay support across generations of the same platform, meaning PS4 and PS5 players are able to link up, as well as those on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S</strong>. So, if you have a pal who hasn’t upgraded to the most recent hardware yet, you don’t have to worry about missing an opportunity to tackle the game together. We’ve got to take our wins where we can get them, right?</p><h2 id="h249275"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> have cross-progression?</h2><p>In another unfortunate turn, <strong><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> doesn’t support cross-progression</strong>. This means <strong>you won’t be able to pick up your progress on a different platform</strong>. Cross-save functionality would’ve been a fantastic addition for players who enjoy bouncing around to different hardware based on their situation, but them’s the breaks.</p><p>Without cross-save availability, you should take some time and really consider which platform is the best option for you based on where your friends play and whether or not you think you’ll team up. But since the game can be largely tackled solo if you absolutely want to, you can also opt to just grab it on whichever platform you prefer the most, then kick back and go the lone wolf route. You do you.</p><hr><p><br><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the tabletop community, Manganiello's most high-profile appearance was in the actual play series, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-concludes-campaign-3-with-epic-8-hour-finale-new-godly-exu-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>. Manganiello played the paladin, Arkhen the Cruel, who aided the adventuring party Vox Machina defeat Vecna in the climax of campaign one. A famous victory since it ended with Arkhen walking away from the battle with Vecna's fabled left hand.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Deep Rock Galactic celebrated its 5-year anniversary in May 2025. Below, we look at how it has maintained its identity as one of the best co-op shooters around.</em></p><p>Before any round of Deep Rock Galactic, my friends and I have a little ritual. We'll pile into the bar at HQ and order a drink. Sometimes, it'll be Deep Rock's equivalent of a seasonal draft--complete with buffs that'll carry over into the next few expeditions--but other times it's just a brew with a silly effect, like a drink that'll freeze the player or shrink them. We'll hoist our mugs into the air, shout, "Rock and stone," and then chug our virtual ale of choice. Shortly thereafter, one of us moseys over to the jukebox and drops a coin in. Before I know it, one of us is twirling like a ballerina while the other twerks adjacent to them. Someone else is doing the robot or some move reminiscent of Gangnam Style. Everything's alright.</p><p dir="ltr">For this reason, and countless others, I feel it's about time we talk about Deep Rock Galactic in the same vein as the greats. Since it's 1.0 launch five years ago, the cooperative shooter has proven time and time again that it is more than just another novel (yet niche) take on the formula once perfected by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">titles like Left 4 Dead</a>. It has instead carved out a unique and approachable vision of what this kind of game can be, filling titanic shoes and all the while paving a brighter and more inclusive road forward. That's especially difficult given the obnoxiously dark tunnels under Hoxxes IV in which Deep Rock Galactic takes place. But by sticking to its guns and never kowtowing to the pressure of chasing trends like countless other live-service titles around it, Deep Rock Galactic has succeeded where many have failed, and stands to continue longer than many of its contemporaries.</p><p dir="ltr">Between best-in-class squad-based gameplay with clear and distinct roles, procedural-generation tools and mission types that freshen every run, an appealing low-poly art style, a user-friendly approach to seasonal content, a focus on irreverence, and a community driven by kindness, there's very little that Deep Rock Galactic doesn't knock out of the park.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rock and stone</h2><p dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic is a four-player cooperative shooter that tasks players with plumbing the depths of a hostile planet, Hoxxes IV, in search of materials to bring back to their parent company, the eponymous Deep Rock Galactic corporation. You are a squad of four blue-collar dwarves--complete with rad sci-fi equipment, pickaxes, a penchant for booze, and plump beards--working under the company on increasingly convoluted and dangerous jobs. Get in, get the job done, get the hell out of Dodge; that's the gig.</p><p dir="ltr">To describe it as some of the most fun I've had in a game is still doing it a disservice.</p><p dir="ltr">Every run of Deep Rock Galactic is a deliriously fun romp. Across Hoxxes IV's varied environs, which range from sand-blasted caverns and volcanic cores to fae-like crystalline caves and radioactive wastes, a vast range of mission types occupy the time of the dwarves that fill the ranks of the Deep Rock Galactic corporation. Sometimes, you will just have to harvest a certain kind of ore from a certain biome, like some kind of deep-space prospector, and other times, you are tasked with the assassination of monstrous bugs impeding progress. My favorite of these mission types involves building a pipeline to three pumps randomly distributed across the map. You have to lay it down piece by piece and can even grind on the rails of the pipe like you're some kind of dwarven skater. Once they're all connected and running, bugs will begin to target and break the pipes, prompting players to divide and conquer to defend the pipeline, all the while riding the pipes like an indoor rollercoaster. All in a day's work at Deep Rock Galactic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503617-drg_s05__1.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503617" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503617-drg_s05__1.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503617"></a><figcaption>A gunner repelling an attack in one of Deep Rock Galactic's biomes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503617-drg_s05__1.46.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The varied and numerous jobs, as well as side objectives (like destroying a certain number of bug eggs) and possible encounters, ensure there's never a dull moment. Sometimes a mission will be going swimmingly until a titanic bug nukes you off the map. You'll be making your escape and be within feet of victory when an enemy type known to cling to the darkest part of the cavern ceilings extends a tentacle to pluck you off the ground and isolate you from the team. Deep Rock Galactic missions are rarely as simple as they seem on their face, and I always delight in the mischievous ways in which they twist the knife and provide another wrinkle and another story to tell ourselves and others.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, each level--down to its composition and length--is procedurally generated, and for as long as I've played Deep Rock Galactic, I've rarely, if ever, encountered a level similar to any other, and that's kept me coming back for years. Over that span of time, the developers at Ghost Ship Games have built upon the game's foundation, adding modifiers, seasonal events, and additional mission types that have spiced up the diversity of content on offer. After some time away from the game, I recently revisited it and started a mission that culminated in an encounter that I had, miraculously, never done! Partway through another mission, a swarm of bugs covered in rocks appeared, forcing us to use our pickaxes to do damage to them as opposed to traditional weaponry, and this too was a surprising new addition. Since I first picked it up, the game has never lacked depth, but to see how far it's come after a few years is astounding.</p><h2 dir="ltr">"Teamwork and beer will keep us together"</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you've settled on a mission, you and your party will be dropped onto the planet in pods that burrow deep underground, at which point you're prompted to pick a class and dig like your life depends on it...because it does. The four classes are composed of the gunner, engineer, scout, and driller. The gunner, as is maybe obvious, is the big damage dealer of the bunch, and comes complete with a good ol' six shooter, while the engineer supports the others with turrets and placeable platforms that smooth out maneuverability in the game's often-labyrinthine caverns. The scout is more of a lone wolf who can zip to places on their own with a hookshot, but also touts a flare gun that nails longer-lasting sources of light to walls to improve visibility. And then there's my personal favorite, the driller, who supports the rest of the team by dual-wielding large drill bits and detonating C4 charges that blow bugs and chunks of earth sky high with similar aplomb.</p><p dir="ltr">No one is locked into a role and your party can opt for any permutations of the crew, including all of one class or none of another. Deep Rock Galactic matches are likely best played with all roles equally represented, but tuning the difficulty down (or simply being really experienced with the game) can make up for some absences; otherwise you may as well be playing with an additional handicap. I've lost count of the number of times that I could've desperately used a driller to reach some out-of-reach goal because I'd gotten lost and separated from the rest of my teammates. I can also recount numerous times a well-placed zipline was the key component in my reckless extraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503622-drg_screenshot_012.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503622-drg_screenshot_012.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503622"></a><figcaption>They're just here for the zipline.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503622-drg_screenshot_012.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Every class comes with its own set of unlockable weapons and they rarely step over one another in terms of utility. The driller, for example, mostly uses crowd-control weapons like a flamethrower, cryo gun, or sludge pump that can be charged to fire especially huge and debilitating globs of acid. The scout begins with a fairly standard assault rifle, but can eventually get a marksman rifle that can do massive damage with focus shots and their very own boomstick. Each weapon can be fine-tuned to your preferences via a skill tree and customizations, as well as overclocks that fundamentally change their natures.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, just about every facet of the dwarves can be changed to your liking. Multiple seasons and years later, Deep Rock Galactic has a bevy of free customization options. They are unlocked by collecting resources and in-game money, as well as via progression on the season passes, which are all completely free and which you can swap between at any time. Additionally, there's a wealth of paid customization options that can be picked up too, but these are largely seen as a way to support the team for all of the free content that they manage to squeeze into the game.You can also swap out the pieces of your pickaxe, your helmet, your beard, and just about everything in between them. So yes, if you've been picking up on this game's pseudo-western vibe, you can rock a cowboy hat and live your space-western fantasy. As if that weren't enough, there are challenges that net players upgrade points that can be spent on active and passive perks, which can be slotted into loadouts, further diversifying the possibilities, and endgame activities such as Deep Dives offer rewarding paths of progression for folks looking to make these characters into full-fledged avatars of themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">In brief, there's no shortage of things to do or unlock in Deep Rock Galactic, and while development has slowed recently (mostly to accommodate the development of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactics-vampire-survivors-style-game-excels-by-giving-you-something-new-to-do/1100-6521414/">few</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-to-get-haunted-and-hostile-roguelite-spin-off-check-out-the-debut-trailer/1100-6528035/">spin-offs</a>), it seems primed to continue.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Clocking out</h2><p dir="ltr">But if you were to ask me my favorite part of Deep Rock Galactic, it has very little to do with the action of an intense Hazard 5 mission or the joy of dressing up my dwarven miner. My absolute favorite aspect of Deep Rock Galactic is its emphasis on irreverence, and a community that often makes it feel like a home away from home.</p><p dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic is a blue-collar satire brought to life. This is a game which, upon loading into a lobby, feels like a post-work hang at your local happy hour. If I click in on one of my thumbsticks, my dwarf will often let out a "Rock and stone," a catchphrase the dwarves and workers parrot at one another to get through the hard times. As we plumb the depths of a hazardous cavern, we shout a hearty "Rock and stone" or one of its many humorous derivatives, or bemoan Karl, an unseen but legendary lore figure who seems to have perished before our time. Little did I know at the time that this facsimile of companionship and camaraderie was precisely what I was looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">I found Deep Rock Galactic at one of my lowest points. It was the midst of the early pandemic, and I was lost in more ways than one. Like countless others, my days were spent feeling stranded and alone inside my apartment. Eventually, I reached out to some of my oldest and closest friends, whom I hadn't spoken to for a long while at that point, and by their good graces, we reconciled and checked the game out. And perhaps because of that decision four-some-odd years ago, I find Deep Rock Galactic particularly endearing. It facilitated the rehabilitation of some of the most important relationships in my life. As we faked it as dwarven miners in space, we fell back into old bits, formed new inside jokes, and repaired the damage distance had wrought. We became best buds again. You know those memes where people gesture at deep late-night conversations they have while running in a circle in something like Minecraft? That was this game for me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503623-drg_screenshot_017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503623-drg_screenshot_017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503623"></a><figcaption>A full crew back at HQ, and some of them even have celebratory drinks in hand.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503623-drg_screenshot_017.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I loved just loading into Deep Rock Galactic and throwing back a drink with my closest friends while holding late-night confessionals. I loved slacking off at the Abyss Bar, which is tended by a bowler-hat-wearing robot named Lloyd, only for management to admonish us. I loved pissing away company time by endlessly engaging in a competition of kicking a nearby barrel into a hoop. I loved that there was a tiny dance floor where I could cut a rug (please, Ghost Ship Games, give us some kind of synchronized line dance), or the fact that failing to extract from a mission prompted us to spawn from the med bay in a patient gown with a well-placed slit, through which we could see each other's underwear.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when my friends haven't been available to play, I've rarely run into a crew of players that was ever hostile to me--which may as well be the default in certain other online spaces and games. Veteran players welcome "greenbeards," or new players, with open arms, and I was never booted despite falling short of objectives, getting downed by overwhelming swarms, and failing to revive the rest of the crew to salvage the mission. This level of tolerance and patience for one another is a growing rarity, but the Deep Rock Galactic community has always enjoyed an abundance of it, and it's something I've tried to carry forward as I've become a more-experienced player.</p><p dir="ltr">I think the camaraderie comes from the framing of the game. At the end of the day, we're all at the whims of crappy managers and money men who see us as little more than digits on a spreadsheet, expendable and replaceable. Down in the mines, and in the pockets of time we get to enjoy above-ground before returning to them, we only have each other. So sure, the horrors persist, both in-game and outside of it, but so does the workman-like spirit of Deep Rock Galactic, which we carry with us.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bucking trends</h2><p dir="ltr">In a similar vein to how the players look out for each other, Ghost Ship Games really looks out for its community. I've already mentioned this in bits and pieces, but a lot of noise deserves to be made about Deep Rock Galactic's approach to live-service content.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of its season passes (five and counting) are available to players entirely for free. Additionally, you keep access to those passes beyond the expiration of a season, meaning that years later, I can still access the means to unlock some cosmetics from 2021 if I so desire. Nothing gets ripped out of the game, and no one is ever gated from anything that's been offered, unless it was tied to some event that'll likely cycle back around. And nothing is kept from players who arrived to the game late. Just because I wasn't actively playing during a specific season doesn't mean I can't ever get it. Everything of import, be it a new mission type, piece of equipment, or biome, is added to the game at no cost to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">While this approach is gaining some traction with other games in the live-service sphere (like Marvel Rivals), Deep Rock Galactic has long felt like the pioneer of the philosophy in the modern era, and is still the most generous of the bunch. At a time when huge publishers and developers either rip content out of the game never to return it or push microtransactions and paid season passes on their communities every few months, Deep Rock Galactic and Ghost Ship Games come out looking like saints. By rejecting the modern sensibility to nickel-and-dime its community, Ghost Ship Games has fostered one that actually sticks around and cares for the game and one another, even if it has a smaller audience compared to the Fortnites of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">By comparison, Deep Rock Galactic feels like a thing built to last. It isn't built on trends or a callous model created to siphon your money and your time. Logging on and engaging in shenanigans with friends and randos alike, all the while earning little treats and trinkets like gear and cosmetics, feels intuitive and fun, rather than laborious. Despite its appearance and framing, it couldn't be less like work. And I guess that's what's kept me coming back all these years, and it's sure to keep me around another few as well. Rock and stone forever.</p>

To be a person that looks forward to video games and DLC for video games is to also be a person that must do so knowing that, at this point in time, they are likely to be delayed. It is what it is! Perhaps the dismantling of our current economic system and rebuilding one that doesn't put profits first would mean developers could take their time, but that'll probably also take a while. As a result, we're in a situation where, earlier today, developer TaleWorlds Entertainment announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord's</a> first bit of DLC, War Sails, has been delayed.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"After taking a hard look at where things stand, it became clear we won’t be ready by the originally planned release date of June 17th," TaleWorlds explained in a <a href="https://www.taleworlds.com/en/News/574">post</a> on their website. Now, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game is currently slated for a slightly less specific fall/ autumn release window later this year
</p>
<p>
Further explaining the delay TaleWorlds wrote that they came to this decision because they "need more time to reach the level of quality you rightfully expect. The extra development period will give us more time to apply additional polish, and continue making progress on the improvements to the base game that are already in motion." A new release date should be on the way in "upcoming weeks" at least.
</p>
<p>
War Sails, if you could tell by the name, is all about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mount-blade-2-bannerlords-first-bit-of-dlc-is-all-about-taking-the-lads-out-on-a-not-so-nice-boat-trip">going out on a lovely little sailing trip</a>. Well, maybe not lovely, it's more about doing trade or fighting enemies, but you get what I mean. You'll be able to board enemy ships while out on the open sea, and a Viking-inspired faction is being introduced with this expansion too. All of it sounds pretty good, you just won't be playing it next month.

            <p>
Following EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-black-panther-game-reportedly-cancelled-and-studio-closed-resulting-in-more-layoffs">pull the plug on its Black Panther game and close the studio making it</a>, the publisher has insisted the move doesn't reflect a change to its partnership with Marvel, and confirmed it still has "at least three" additional Marvel games in development.
</p>
<p>
Little had been revealed of EA's Black Panther game since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-single-player-black-panther-game-from-new-studio">announcement in 2023</a>, and word of its cancellation - alongside yet more layoffs at the company - arrived earlier this week. Commenting on the decision to end development in an email to employees, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said the move would help the publisher "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities".
</p>
<p>
Miele also stressed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-iron-man-single-player-game-in-the-works">developer EA Motive's Iron Man game</a> was unaffected, but Black Panther's cancellation - which comes as the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">continues a planned retreat away from "future licensed IP"</a> - had some commentators wondering if the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-iron-man-part-of-three-game-marvel-deal">previously announced three-game deal with Marvel</a> could be wrapping up prematurely. 
</p>
<p>
Now, however, EA has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-still-making-at-least-3-marvel-games-even-after-black-panther-cancellation">confirmed to IGN</a> that not only is the deal alive and well, the company is still working on "at least three" Marvel games following Black Panther's termination. "The multi-title, long-term relationship between Marvel Games and EA... remains strong," an EA spokesperson told the publication. "Development of our console and PC titles, beginning with Marvel's Iron Man, is led by Motive Studios."
</p>
<p>
Black Panther's cancellation and subsequent job cuts follow a string of similar incidents at EA this year. In April, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">laid off more than 300 employees</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and Star Wars Jedi studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> losing around 100 staff. At the same time, EA cancelled a number of in-development projects - reportedly including a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game - as part of what it called a "continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities". Still more layoffs were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">confirmed last month, following EA's decision to end its licensing partnership with the WRC</a>.
</p>
<p>
A second Black Panther project unconnected with EA - Skydance Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, from Uncharted writer Amy Hennig - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into next year</a>.

This week, PC users can add Playdead’s breakout video game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/limbo"><u>Limbo</u></a>, and Gearbox’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Borderlands spinoff, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands"><u>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</u></a>, to their libraries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both titles are available to nab from now to next Thursday, June 5, at 8am PT / 11am ET, at which point they’ll no longer be free to own.

While previous entries in the series see players team up to loot and shoot across twisted sci-fi settings, this spinoff drops fans into a fantasy setting with a few gameplay shakeups, such as new weapon types and fleshed-out character customization, to keep things interesting. Thanks in part to a surprisingly star-studded cast that includes Andy Samberg, Wanda Sykes, Will Arnett, and more, we felt Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands was a fitting addition to the Borderlands universe, giving it an 8/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review-pc-xbox-playstation"><u>our review</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Limbo, meanwhile, is a much more scaled-down adventure that sees players controlling a small child as they trudge through an unforgiving, colorless world. It’s a short story that <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/5304" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>HowLongToBeat</u></a> says takes just over three hours to complete, but it’s been more than enough to leave an impression on gamers for nearly 15 years. We gave it a 9/10 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/02/limbo-review-2"><u>our original review</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and Limbo follow <a href="https://in.ign.com/sifu/231653/news/free-video-games-this-week-epic-games-is-offering-sifu-gigapocalypse-and-deliver-at-all-costs-amazon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>last week’s free Epic Games Store titles</u></a>, which included Deliver At All Costs, Gigapocalypse, and Sifu.
