            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Build A Rocket Boy and IO Partners announced the launch date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MindsEye</a>. The upcoming single-player narrative-driven action/adventure game will be released on June 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders for digital and physical editions are now open at $59.99 / €59.99 / £54.99. Interestingly, there's only one edition for the time being; every pre-order automatically gets a free upgrade to the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Premium Pass, the Deluxe Thorn &amp; Kepler Yellowjacket Weapon, the Future Jacob Vest Skin, the Future DC2 Companion Drone Skin, and the Future Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin.</p>
<p>The Premium Pass includes the following in-game items:</p>
<p>• Pack 1 "Exotic Pack" ("Exotic" Jacob Vest Skin, "Exotic" DC2 Companion Drone Skin, "Exotic" Silva Sedan Vehicle Skin)</p>
<p>• Horde Mode Mission: Face a variety of enemies with distinct tactics and behaviors. Think fast and use your surroundings to outmaneuver your opponents.</p>
<p>• Pack 2: Extra missions and challenges in Q3 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 3: Extra missions and challenges in Q4 2025</p>
<p>• Pack 4: Extra missions and challenges in Q1 2026</p>
<p>MindsEye owners will also get access to bonus missions built in ARCADIA, Build A Rocket Boy’s custom building and distribution tool that enables rapid creation of AAA content. This was previously known as Everywhere; indeed, MindsEye was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> two years ago as a side experience to this project. However, it quickly became its own separate game and took over the spotlight.</p>
<p>Leslie Benzies, Game Director of MindsEye and former producer of every GTA game from III to V, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in our tightly crafted game, MindsEye, with a thought-provoking story where technology and ambition collide, and the inevitable consequences unravel.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Welcome to Redrock - Official Story Trailer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oprmuMXtfAo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The news was accompanied by a new story trailer that provides a glimpse of technology's immersive influence on Redrock, where consumer robots perform most manual tasks, and an algorithm connects all-seeing devices. The city itself is a living experiment in the existential potential of man and machine. We also see a few dialogues between the main characters.</p>
<p>In MindsEye, players take the role of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier fitted with the titular neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Jacob must uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unbridled military power shape every encounter. However, Jacob won't be the only one searching for answers, and the forces operating in the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined. The developers say players should prepare for intense combat - on foot, behind the wheel, and in the air - where every decision can mean the difference between survival and defeat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-drop-brings-cute-food-to-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released another Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a>. In keeping with the drops' erratic, inconsistent style of theme or reason, the Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is about cute-looking Japanese food.</p>



<p>According to its official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/product/1151225/oishii-tokens" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop was inspired by some "unthinkably cool food packaging" the artists saw on their last trip to Japan. For that reason alone, we are getting new food token cards based on those designs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-cards.jpg?itok=qTNReYYV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-cards.jpg?itok=I_aIoR2f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Credit where it is due: The food token cards made for this drop are full of visual pop and appeal. There are four different food tokens in this drop. One features a large juicy hamburger stuffed with onions, pickles, lettuce, bacon, tomatoes, and cheese, complete with a large side of fries. The second one is an elaborate sushi platter, complete with chop sticks, a saucer of soy sauce, and a cup of hot green tea.</p>

<p>The most elaborate of these tokens is an elaborate lunch. Rice balls and tiny sausages given happy faces or turned into cute octopi. Broccoli stalks topped with tiny stars. A dollop of egg-fried rice fashioned in the shape of a tiny chick. All are complimented with energetic manga panels in the background.</p>

<p>Finally, what is a meal without dessert? The fourth food token is for those with a sweet tooth. Sliced fruit. Crunchy wafers. Sliced strawberries. Cherries and whip cream. A fizzling soda with a scoop of ice cream on the top. But at the center is a certain Japanese delicacy: a sweet Purin pudding.</p>

<p>The Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is the fourth drop in Wizards of the Coast's more impetuous series of drops. So far, these drops have featured <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">elaborate signage</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">psychedelic land cards</a>, and a popularity contest between <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-secret-lair-is-for-cats-and-dogs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cats and dogs</a>.</p>

<p>The Chaos Vault Oishii Tokens drop is still available at time of writing in non-foil at an MSRP of $14.99.</p>

<p>The video game industry layoff trend is picking up steam as Cyan Worlds, the developers behind Myst and Firmament, have announced a round of layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://xcancel.com/cyanworlds/status/1905668238899327249/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> post on Friday afternoon, the studio said that 12 people will be let go despite their “best efforts to avoid it”. The layoffs will be effective at the end of March.</p>



<p>“Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025,” the statement reads. </p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft And Tencent Have A Deal, GTA 6 Release Questions, and An Exclusive Game Announcement</a></h6>



<p>“Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us.”</p>



<p>Those part of the layoffs at Cyan Worlds are receiving a severance package. However, the company is also working on helping them find additional work. That includes <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NURnVwfeqolPAVN-Dn44UpXZS3bRVMaCNQczIzhIpdc/edit?gid=1838665401#gid=1838665401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sharing the information</a> of those laid off and now looking for employment elsewhere.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for Cyan Worlds, the studio says its “number one priority is to secure financing for our next project, and to restabilize the studio.”</p>



<p>“We’ve been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before,” they said. “Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver.</p>



<p>“As always, we are grateful for all the love and support from our amazing player community.”</p>



<p>Cyan Worlds was founded in 1987 by brothers Robyn and Rand Miller. Since its establishment 38 years ago, the studio has shipped dozens of games.</p>

<p>A recently-released kids movie has received the greenlight for a new game. As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/podcast-ubisoft-and-tencent-have-a-deal-gta-6-release-questions-and-an-exclusive-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast</a>, Dog Man is set to receive another video game adaptation.</p>



<p>“Hold on to your police hats because Dog Man has been approved for a video game,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson revealed during the show. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It was added that there is a belief that the new game only recently was given the go ahead after the success of the Dog Man movie earlier this year. For context, the Dog Man film had a box office of around $130.5 million against a budget of just $40 million.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the new Dog Man game other than its been approved. Dog Man made its video game debut in October 2024 with Dog Man: Mission Impawsible. </p>

You either <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-a-job-in-inzoi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have to get a job</a> or take out a loan or, if you want to be really devious, start committing crimes. Sometimes, it’s just quicker to cheat your way to getting Money in InZOI.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s an easy way to get all the money you need without having to memorize any cheat code. What a time to be alive, indeed.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>If you really are impatient and want to get money fast, using the InZOI money cheat is as easy as taking candy from a baby. First, open the Psicat guide from the bottom right of your screen. After that, you’ll see a<strong> “Money Cheat” button on the left-hand side of the guide</strong>. <strong>Clicking that button will give you 100,000 Meows</strong>—the game’s currency—every time you click it.</p>



<p>And that’s it. Seriously. </p>



<p>You can <strong>press that button as many times as you’d like</strong> with no issues, and live the life of your dreams. And while it could impact your Zoi’s Karma in the future, there is currently no penalty of any kind for taking advantage of the game’s money cheat. So, if you really don’t want to earn money the same way you have to in real life, go ahead and take advantage of the systems that’s available to you in the game.</p>



<p>In addition to the money cheat, the game’s developers at InZOI Studio say that more cheats for players are coming to the game later on in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early access</a>. </p>

                <p>Netflix's top gaming boss, Alain Tascan, has said he questions whether or not young people these days even care about consoles. Speaking at an event at GDC 2025 recently, Tascan said he personally enjoys console gaming, but he's not sure if it's where gaming is headed in the future. Of course, Tascan would say this, as his company, Netflix Games, does not make consoles and is instead intent on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-gaming-boss-wants-to-lower-friction-and-bypass-expensive-consoles/1100-6530464/" data-ref-id="1100-6530464">pushing people toward streaming and subscription services. </a></p><p>"[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "Look at the younger generation. Are eight-year-olds and 10-year-olds dreaming of owning a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PlayStation 6</a>? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you're thinking about high definition, you're thinking about the controller […] If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us."</p><p>Before this Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-why-microsoft-is-pushing-beyond-co/1100-6479685/" data-ref-id="1100-6479685">said for years</a> that Microsoft is pushing beyond consoles into places like streaming and mobile to help reach a bigger audience. The audience for console gaming is only so large, Spencer and others have said. For what it's worth, Spencer has also said<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028"> consoles will absolutely be a part of Microsoft's future in gaming.</a></p><p>Netflix Games was working on a AAA project with major talent behind it, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">scuttled those plans</a> and is now focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">making party-style games that appeal to children</a> and can be streamed to a TV or played on a mobile device. This is already happening, as Netflix.com allows you to stream games directly from your browser, while the Netflix Games lineup on mobile offers a variety of games to download.</p><p>Tascan also said during the talk that his directive as Netflix's gaming boss is to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-gaming-boss-wants-to-lower-friction-and-bypass-expensive-consoles/1100-6530464/" data-ref-id="1100-6530464">help lower the "friction" that can come with gaming and give people an option to bypass "expensive" consoles.</a></p><p>To be sure, people absolutely still want to buy dedicated gaming consoles. Sales of the PS5 are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie753v2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">up significantly over the PS4 over a similar period of time in the US</a>. The same cannot be said for Xbox, however, as Series X|S sales are lagging behind Xbox One sales in the US. Nintendo is expected to announce more details about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on April 2, and the system is no doubt going to be a major seller when it launches this year.</p><p>Looking further out, Sony is believed to be working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PS6</a>, while Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">already confirmed plans for the next Xbox.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/us-retailer-documents-reveals-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In some new documents and internal emails provided to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a> from a large US retailer, they are anticipating that they will sell out of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day that pre-orders are open due to limited unit allocation from Nintendo. Thus far, information about the Nintendo Switch 2 has been limited, with a Nintendo Direct taking place yesterday to unveil some new games that are coming to its predecessor. However, the Nintendo Switch 2 is due to get its very own direct on April 2, which will give people the highly anticipated look at the new console that they've been waiting for.</p>
<p>According to the documents sent to Insider Gaming, the Nintendo Switch 2 is allegedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/">scheduled to release in June</a>, which has been widely rumored across a span of communities and was spoken about by developers at GDC.</p>
<p>For some there may be a touch of confusion about when pre-orders go live, as there was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-open-april-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Buy Canada leak earlier</a> on in the week that said that pre-orders would be going live on April 2, the day of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. That post has since been removed by Best Buy Canada, but the retailer hasn't issued a response as of yet.</p>
<p>At this moment in time, it's uncertain whether or not the Best Buy Canada "leak" was a mistake or not as the company hasn't commented on the situation. However, as soon as it began to circulate online and feed into rumors, it was promptly removed.</p>
<p>In the documents sent to Insider Gaming, it's reported that pre-orders will actually be going live on April 9, which is one week after the Nintendo Switch 2 direct. The documents also contained information about a marketing strategy to include a Countdown Clock, with Nintendo allegedly confirming the time on April 2. It also says that there will be an exclusive collectible coin for those who pre-order the console.</p>
<p>However, as we have not personally seen these documents, it's uncertain whether this is factual or not, and all of this information is subject to change at any point, with major details being set to release during the Direct.</p>
<p>While we still don't know the date of pre-orders, there is a high chance that it will be shortly after the Direct, most likely within a week of the Direct taking place.</p>

Also the stuff people are making doesn’t even look cool. </p><p>Exhibit A is a trailer for Peter Jackson’s<em> Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy by PJ Ace that’s ben re-rendered using OpenAI’s hallucination of what a Studio Ghibili movie might look like. I organically encountered it earlier today when scrolling through Reels on Instagram. I then saw it spread to LinkedIn and Bluesky. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3llfbkwqqrs2n&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3llfbkwqqrs2n" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some people</a></span> were very impressed by it, or at least pretending to be in order to continue hyping up the next promised revolution in moviemaking and their self-identified role as an important voice in that new creative world order. </p><p>Look, I’m not above looking at random AI slop in my Instagram feed. My favorite two genres are <em>Warhammer 40K</em>-style imaginings of the Roman Empire if it had never fallen and was colonizing the galaxy, and AI-invented slideshows of what life was back in the ‘90s while spooky melancholy music plays. The algorithm knows what I’m a sucker for, and on more than one occasion I’ve been willing to prove it right. </p><p>But Studio Ghibli <em>Lord of the Rings</em> lost me within five seconds. The edits are crude. The animation is stilted. The colors are flat. The compositions are boring. While talking, everyone’s mouth looks like it’s in the middle of a dental exam. Discernable facial expressions are nonexistent. And the Ghibli-fication, such as it exists, is almost exclusively about rounding off corners and turning people’s faces into beige ovals with big anime eyes while the landscapes and backgrounds that are usually what give Ghibli films so much texture, richness, and vitality all look like<em> The Simpsons</em> by way of the Lo-Fi Beats Girl’s color palette. </p><p>PJ Ace wrote that he spent nine hours and $250 on generating the clip.

<p>Call of Duty’s anti-cheat program, RICOCHET, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-anti-cheat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may not be perfect</a>, but it’s the only thing standing between cheaters and both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. With Season 03 about to start, the team that works on RICOCHET provided a progress report today, detailing all the strides made and the impending changes coming this season.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-anti-cheat-updates">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 Anti-Cheat Updates</h2>



<p>Here are the key highlights from the latest RICOCHET Anti-Cheat update ahead of Season 03 of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p>

<p>Since the launch of Black Ops 6, Call of Duty’s anti-cheat efforts have put “over 20 cheat makers and dozens of cheat resellers” out of business. The RICOCHET team has issued over 228,000 bans since the game released and has claimed that 23% of cheaters were removed before even playing their first match. The team has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-anti-cheat-not-good-enough/">admitted in the past that the anti-cheat wasn’t good enough</a> when Ranked Play launched. They plan to improve their numbers with new systems to enhance their aim bot detection and “Machine Learning” system.</p>



<h3 id="h-killcam-improvements">Killcam Improvements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The RICOCHET team says that there are many inaccurate reports of players who are simply have an intel advantage. To help combat this, the killcam in Season 03 will be outfitted with additional information, including a full list of detailed attackers, and new status messages. If you were revealed by the Live Ping perk, by UAV, or by firing an unsuppressed weapon, that information will show up in the killcam.</p>



<h3 id="h-ranked-skill-rating-refunds">Ranked Skill Rating Refunds</h3>



<p>In Season 03, Call of Duty will follow the trend set by other competitive shooters like CS2 and VALORANT, and provide rank rating refunds to players that lost to cheaters. When a cheater in ranked play is banned, anyone who they defeated recently will receive a Skill Rating refund. Initially, this will cover the most recent two weeks prior to the ban. Additionally, players who are playing with cheaters may also have SR taken away.</p>



<p>The SR refund system will go live for Black Ops 6 ranked shortly after the launch of Season 03, with a similar system planned for Warzone when ranked play finally goes live. </p>



<h3 id="h-stop-spamming">Stop Spamming</h3>



<p>Finally, RICOCHET provided the community with a piece of advice: stop spam reporting. The Anti-Cheat team says that spam reporting provides no additional insight, and will also “reduce the trust we have in future reports from an account and may result in punitive measures.”</p>



<p>The full list of announcements from the Call of Duty RICOCHET Anti-Cheat Season 03 update can be found <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Season 03 goes live on April 2nd.</p>

<p>Developer Build A Rocket Boy has announced the release date for MindsEye. The game is currently scheduled to release for PC and current-gen consoles on June 10. IO Interactive Partners will serve as the publisher of the game.</p>



<div><p>One of the main reasons for the hype surrounding the game is the involvement of Leslie Benzies, the former producer of the GTA franchise. Check out the synopsis of the game:</p><p>“<em>Play as Jacob Diaz, a former elite soldier fitted with The MindsEye, a mysterious neural implant that haunts him with fragmented memories of a covert mission that changed his life forever. Fight to uncover the truth in a world where AI, high-tech experimentation, and unchecked military power shape every encounter. Jacob isn’t the only one searching for answers, forces working from the shadows may be more powerful and dangerous than he ever imagined</em>.”</p></div>



<p>Accompanying the release date reveal was a new cinematic trailer, offering a deeper glimpse into Redrock City’s society and its key players. The trailer introduces characters like the visionary tech magnate Marco Silva and the ambitious Mayor Shiva Vega, hinting at the complex power dynamics that will drive the game’s narrative.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/inzoi-hits-1-on-steam-40-minutes-after-early-access-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For those who are fans of the life simulation genre that is predominantly conquered by The Sims, there is a new competitor on the block that is released in Early Access today. inZOI is now available in Early Access and has already reached the top spot on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global Steam Top Sellers</a> just 40 minutes after it was released. If you want to see what it's all about, make sure to check out the Early Access launch video for inZOI below.</p>
<p><iframe title="inZOI: Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SwngGWQWSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition, inZOI was ranked first on Steam's Global Top Wishlists while people were actively waiting for the game to release in Early Access today. There has been a large buzz surrounding the game, as content creators globally have created various videos and written content about the title, showcasing what they can expect from this game. Currently, inZOI is available on Steam for $39.99, with all updates and DLC provided for free until the game's full release.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the Early Access launch, then inZOI demo was also available to players across the globe, which gave them the opportunity to try out inZOI's Character Studio and Build Studio. However, now that the game is officially in Early Access, the demo has been closed down and is no longer available.</p>
<p>inZOI was also incredibly popular on Twitch, where it reached the fifth spot in the Games category on Twitch as of March 27, and is likely to see it spike again with the full release and many able to get their hands on it.</p>
<p>Thus far, inZOI has been well received, with a Very Positive rating on Steam and over 3600 reviews at the time of writing.</p>
<p>"I created and nurtured inZOI with great care as if it were my child, though it still has a lot of room for improvement. As inZOI takes its first steps into the world, I feel both proud and somewhat anxious - hoping it won't stumble or get hurt," says inZOI Studio CEO, Producer, and Director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim. "It would be deeply appreciated if you could watch over the game with warmth and support. As we prepare for inZOI's official launch, we will continue to genuinely engage with creators across the globe to make it better, one step at a time."</p>
<p>inZOI has over 250 customization options and 400 mental elements, with a wide creative suite that is powered by on-device generative AI. The title has been produced utilizing Unreal Engine 5, and requires <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">relatively beefy specifications</a> to be able to run it.</p>

No, it was nothing quite as colossal as <em>God of War </em>or <em>The Last of Us </em>coming to the handheld console, but a remaster of the first two <em>Patapons </em>and the next game in the <em>Everybody’s Golf </em>series will be available on Switch. Both are coming to the system through a partnership with Bandai Namco, which also recently brought the cult Vita RPG <em>Freedom Wars</em> to the system earlier this year, but Sony also brought <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lego-horizon-adventures-review-aloy-ps5-switch-pc-1851696761"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a></span><em> </em>to the system on its own in 2024. At the moment, Sony only seems to be putting “smaller” titles on Nintendo’s platform, but if PlayStation is open to sharing more of its catalog with Switch owners, I can think of a few more that would fit right in.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Ape Escape </em>series got a bit of a spotlight again last year as one of the games featured in <em>Astro Bot</em>. PlayStation fans still have a soft spot for the long-dormant platformers, and their simple loop of chasing and catching apes is much better suited to a handheld like the Switch than a big-box console these days. If Sony were looking to test the waters for bringing the series back, putting something on the Switch, which has a much larger audience of young players than other platforms do, seems like a solid business plan. </p></div><div><p>It’s easy to forget that <em>Gravity Rush </em>started out as a handheld game, but the original open-world action game was a Vita exclusive for three years until Sony remastered it for the PS4 in 2015. <em>Gravity Rush </em>and its sequel are two deeply underappreciated gems in Sony’s catalog that deserved better than they got. The gravity-bending mechanics are an incredibly clever way to handle open-world traversal, letting you “fall” from one side of the map to the other rather than just using straightforward flight. It requires you to pay attention to physics in the environment, and you also use it to collide with your foes. It’s such an interesting spin on how we move through video game worlds that it’s a shame more people haven’t played it. Just port ‘em to Switch, Sony.</p></div><div><p>Sony seems ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/little-big-planet-3-lbp3-all-dlc-delisted-removed-ps4-1851667727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/little-big-planet-3-lbp3-all-dlc-delisted-removed-ps4-1851667727">abandon its platformer/level creation suite</a></span>, so I don’t have much hope that <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>will make an appearance on PlayStation consoles again, much less on Switch. But the entire premise of this list is pie-in-the-sky requests. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>’s platforming is floaty, frustrating and doesn’t hold a candle to better games like the <em>Mario </em>series that are readily available on Switch. However, its level creation tools are still some of the best on the market. <em>LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</em> already demonstrated that the series is well-suited to handhelds, so a Switch version seems like a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p>I wouldn’t have thought there was any hope of <em>LocoRoco</em> making a comeback in 2025, but after seeing <em>Patapon </em>remasters announced for Switch, I can dare to dream. The PlayStation Portable series was built to be on a handheld. As you tilted the world with the shoulder buttons, it felt like you were controlling a world inside the device’s tiny screen. Sure, the same control scheme applies to the PS4 version on your TV, but it still feels most natural on a handheld. If we’re bringing bite-sized cult classics like <em>Patapon </em>to Switch, <em>LocoRoco </em>should be in the running as well.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Medievil </em>series deserves a new entry on PlayStation 5, but I will settle for seeing the existing games brought to the Switch. To this day, there’s no simple way to play <em>Medievil 2 </em>unless you’ve got a spare PlayStation lying around, though the original spooky hack-and-slash game was remade for the PS4 in 2019. Sir Daniel Fortesque’s Tim Burton-esque adventures have gotten more chances than most of Sony’s original PlayStation gems to re-enter the public consciousness after being remade for both the PlayStation Portable and PS4, but I simply don’t think twice is enough. The third time’s the charm. Put our haggard hero on Nintendo’s handheld, Sony.</p></div><div><p>I simply don’t think there is an excuse for <em>Parappa the Rapper </em>not to be on every platform imaginable. The PS1 and 2 rhythm games are hardly demanding for any modern device to run and the original has already been remastered for the PS4. A new generation of players needs to hear Chop Chop Master Onion teach karate by way of hip-hop. Why deny the millions of Switch owners the experience of rapping their way through their driver’s test or rap-battling their teachers in the line for the bathroom? Now I’m pulling up YouTube videos of all these songs, and they’re all bangers. Like <em>Medievil</em>, it’s time <em>Parappa </em>got a new game, but in the meantime, put these tracks on Switch, Sony.</p></div><div><p>Alright, here’s the real reason I made this list. I’m here to put <em>Sly Cooper </em>propaganda on your screen. Fans are still holding out hope that Sony will one day greenlight a fifth game in the heist platformer series that will resolve the cliffhanger ending of <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>, but in the years since, the Vita has still been my go-to place to play Sucker Punch’s PS2 trilogy, and I gotta blow an inch of dust off that thing if I ever want to see the Cooper Gang. That could all be changed if Sony would put the games on the Switch. I still think the <em>Sly Cooper </em>games are some of the most timeless games in PlayStation’s long history, which makes it a real shame that Sucker Punch and Sony stopped investing in them during the PS3 era. Yeah, <em>Thieves in Time </em>was a passion project from Sanzaru Games that was divisive but nailed the smooth and simple stealth mechanics that made them so successful back in the day. Sony, if you ignore everything else I have said here, don’t ignore this. Put <em>Sly Cooper </em>on the Switch. And PC. And hell, put it on Xbox while you’re at it. Have you considered a mobile port? </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-looney-tunes-warner-bros-zaslav<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Despite the best efforts of Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/original-looney-tunes-removed-max-warner-bros-1236327964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">erase the legacy of the <em>Looney Tunes</em></a> entirely, there is a fully animated Looney Tunes movie in theaters, and it's fantastic. Chris Person and Gita Jackson sat down to talk about all the reasons you need to see this movie right now.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Last week I saw <em>The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie</em> with my good friend and laughed harder than I have at any movie in recent memory. It is, shockingly, the first fully animated, theatrically released original movie in the Loony Tunes franchise. Though Loony Tunes has been good recently, I was simply not prepared for how good this movie is. Gita, you also saw it, what's up doc?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> My good friend Chris—what a movie. I saw it with my perfect husband David and I was absolutely overjoyed. There were a lot of kids in the theater with us, which made me so happy. Given the controversy surrounding the way that Warner Bros. has maintained this brand (read: <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/warner-bros-tearing-down-looney-tunes-building-131-1236352601/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they are trying to destroy it</a>), I&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;sure if kids cared about the Looney Tunes at all. But on my way out, I heard a kid tell his dad that this was the most amazing movie&nbsp;he’s&nbsp;ever seen.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Honestly they were not wrong.</p><p>This movie was originally meant to be dumped on streaming and I'm glad it wasn't, because seeing it with an audience was a borderline religious experience. The movie shockingly threads that needle between being just edgy and a little abrasive without ever crossing the line to inappropriate. This is the soul of Looney Tunes, but also it reminded me a lot of what was good about 90s-2000s American cartoons, when we just let freaks put whatever out there.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Let's Get Looney! | The Day The Earth Blew Up | TRAILER | @wbkids​" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtHUWHXfDyU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> All of the kids were laughing so hard during my screening—I was too. What I really appreciated was at that no point was the movie trying to teach a lesson. This was not a didactic movie about the nature of generational trauma.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;sole goal was to make the audience laugh, and it had a <em>Simpsons</em>-esque desire to cram as many jokes into each scene as humanly possible.</p><p>A lot of children’s entertainment is actually for adults nowadays. This was a very funny movie definitely for kids.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right, it's not didactic or moral art. It's a cartoon duck with a mallet and a pig with a speech impediment.&nbsp; It is focused on "the bits" which and there's one that made me ugly laugh out loud way too much once every minute or too. I do not need to go to Loony Tunes for a moral, I go to watch a joke so silly a child can understand it, but crafted so well an adult can appreciate it.</p><p>To the extent that these things need a setup, we should talk about the premise before continuing.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yes!!!! This is simply a movie about Daffy Duck and Porky Pig, two anthropomorphic animals that grew up with their adoptive father, Farmer Jim. After Farmer Jim…. Dies? Becomes God? They are left to take care of the house, which they do a poor job of because Daffy is&nbsp;well, daffy, and Porky is too shy. After a mysterious meteor hits their roof&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;left to find a job to fix it, or else&nbsp;they’ll&nbsp;be kicked out of their ancestral home. In the process they meet Petunia Pig, a flavor scientist at the gum factory, and start to get wrapped up in an alien invasion.</p><p>I gotta say—Petunia Pig, flavor scientist was a great bit. Just a huge weirdo chewing on sponges.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Porky finally has a girlfriend and she's a freak. It rocks.</p><p>That entire sequence of them being raised together rocks partially because they choose to do very limited animation for Farmer Jim, he's painted like he's the background. He basically talks like animated Clutch Cargo, just his mouth is animated but his body is painted like the scenery. At one point there's a shot of him walking that's just the character's body totally rigid moving up and down. And then they have one closeup that looks like it is animated on the 1's, just an overly fluid shot of him looking at them. It's a joke entirely about the form of animation and it is simultaneously both incredibly high effort and also very silly, and that's like the entire movie.</p><p>This movie is also very clearly modeled after Bob Clampett, and I know his daughter Ruth Clampett has a cameo as a waitress.</p><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVjOgFI6YrY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Day The Earth Blew Up</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Oh my god&nbsp;I didn’t&nbsp;know that!</p><p>That’s&nbsp;so cool.</p><p>The whole movie is above letter to specifically the American traditions of animation. They change styles several times within the movie, and make a lot of homages to classic Looney Tunes style bits. The montage of them getting jobs and then getting fired from them is framed as a show within a show Looney Tunes episode.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The beginning has a Fleischer Superman quality to it that's very clearly intentional.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yes!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A big portion of the plot is about how Daffy and Porky are kinda fuckups, like their weird relationship as brothers. Porky is the relatively sensible one and Daffy is constantly fucking things up or sabotaging things because he's a cartoon.</p><p>Including Porky's new relationship with his girlfriend. They get a new job but then the middle act of the plot is an Invasion Of The Body Snatchers/The Faculty bit where the aliens are taking over the minds of everyone with gum. They even do the Donald Sutherland pointing shot.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> This is what I mean about it being <em>Simpsons</em>-esque. There's this one scene that my husband loves to use to demonstrate just how packed full of jokes each scene in the Simpsons is:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bart vs the Street Sweeper" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdz4bc2LGMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Literally every four seconds in this movie, they are trying to keep the energy up in the same way. Each frame has a joke that will land for somebody, hopefully everyone.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> This movie has 11 writers and honestly it works, you need that many for this kind of joke density. I didn't realize Johnny Ryan worked on this!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> What! Oh my god.</p><p>Just an embarrassment of riches on this movie.</p><p>Seeing this movie gave me a level of hope for the future of animation that is matched in intensity by the despair I feel looking at <a href="https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stupid AI art that people keep making</a>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I was not expecting to leave the theater feeling a sense of optimism, particularly given the state of animation generally and the abuse this franchise has suffered by David Zaslav specifically, but there is so much love in every single frame and it was just so affirming to see something that willful on the big screen.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Did you have any favorite jokes? For me, the ten second bit where Daffy attempts to become an influencer and gets canceled had me howling.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> There's a series of gags back to back that involve everyone reacting to Daffy being the deciding factor. Second place is this montage of Porky falling for Petunia after she comes in from the rain and it cuts back and forth between what he thinks she looks like and what she actually looks like and it's edited and animated perfectly.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the best jokes are just line reads and tiny details in the background. It's just a constant barrage I can't keep them straight. Man, I should see this movie again.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I want to see it a million times. I was so happy that I was in the theater for the gag of someone leaving the theater--I have never actually seen a joke of that type in an actual movie theater and it was just perfect.</p><p>You know what I mean—a silhouette of a man stood up on the screen and muttered "Who greenlit this?"</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh yeah that's the bit I was talking about.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> If this movie is screening near you, RUN do not walk to theaters. This is a kind of animated movie we really do not see a lot of anymore, and it's a gem, a special production, and apparently word of mouth is the only thing keeping it in theaters.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I agree: Do not wait. If you haven't seen it already, go out to a theater to see it if you have the means and are able to. Don't wait for it on streaming unless you have to, see it with a group of people from all ages. Laugh your ass off with Daffy and Porky.</p><p>Show them that cartoons like this are not only viable, they're vital.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.

Taken together, the PC games here are regularly valued at $175, but right now they can be purchased at a severe discount as is the Humble Bundle way. For just $10, you get the following:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em><strong>Pillars of Eternity</strong></em></li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em><strong>Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire </strong></em></li><li><strong><em>Disco Elysium</em></strong></li><li><em><strong>Citizen Sleeper</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Roadwarden</strong></em></li></ul></blockquote><p>If you pitch in an extra $3 you can also grab<em> Broken Roads</em>, a post-apocalyptic isometric RPG with mixed reviews on Steam, and a coupon for 20 percent off <em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector </em>which only just came out a few months ago and is certainly one of my 2025 GOTY contenders. But I’d also recommend waiting and playing the first <em>Citizen Sleeper</em>, a gig-economy cyberpunk sim that takes place on a single space station, before dipping into its bigger, more expansive sequel. </p><p>Obsidian Entertainment’s <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> helped kickstart the mid-2010s renaissance in CRPGs and just celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a new patch that finally adds a turn-based combat option. Along with the pirate-themed sequel <em>Deadfire</em>, both games are also necessary context for getting the most out of this year’s first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em> since they’re all set in the same, detailed fantasy world.</p><p>Finally, while <em>Disco Elysium</em> needs no introduction, fewer people are probably familiar with <em>Roadwarden</em>. It’s a text-heavy interactive RPG in which you play as a Witcher-like figure patrolling the country side as mysteries and side-quests unfold. There are light survival elements driving tension and excellent writing and music that deliver on a beautiful, evocative mood throughout, despite the game consisting mostly of words and static images. More people absolutely need to play it. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
