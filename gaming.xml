            <p>The developers of free-to-play monster hunting game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dauntless">Dauntless</a> have laid off "the majority of the studio" less than two months after the game's troubled launch on Steam. "Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," said the company in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL/">a post on LinkedIn</a>, which called the sweeping layoffs "part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations." It's the fourth time in two years that the studio has seen job cuts. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The studio has been owned by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">secretive blockchain company Forte</a> since some time in 2023. Since that year Phoenix Labs have seen three other rounds of layoffs. The studio saw 140 job cuts in May last year, while 34 jobs were axed back in December 2023. Before that, the company cut loose 9 percent of their workers in May 2023.</p>
<p>Over the same period there has been growing player dissatisfaction with Dauntless, which was generally well received when it first arrived. Edwin called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-preview">"Monster Hunter for people who fear grind"</a>. But recent player reviews complain that free-to-play business tactics have been increasingly interfering with basic design of the game. The game has been on PC and other platforms since 2019 but its arrival to Valve's shopfront in December last year came with a big update called "Awakening".</p>
<p>Alongside a bunch of changes, this update included the bizarre decision to essentially wipe every player's character progression and weapon collections to zero. As you might expect, the game quickly attained an "overwhelmingly negative" review average on the store. </p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, this update was criticised by the studio's former associate producer, Jessie Leigh Gagnon, who said it was no longer "free to slay" in complaints spotted by <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/329756/former-dauntless-associate-producer-criticizes-awakening-update-for-gutting-core-mechanics">TechPowerUp</a>.</p>
<p>"They’ve gutted the core gameplay and crafting mechanics," she said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7271577078045540352/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. "The essence of the Slayers (who I named just over ten years ago), has been, in fact, slayed to ribbons. We never would have made decisions that are so blatantly not player focused."   </p><p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/603016424736163000">soon apologised for the way the update was handled</a>, and recognised player distaste for the progress wipe and other changes. They handed out in-game currency and XP as part of this apology, saying that they would work to make things better. "We recognize the need to rebuild trust and improve how we engage with our community," they said. It's hard to see how this might now happen - it's possible even the person who wrote these words is now unemployed.</p>
<p>"We will share more details in the coming weeks," say Phoenix Labs about the future of Dauntless (and the studio's other game, Stardew-like farming simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fae-farm">Fae Farm</a>). But whatever they say it will be hard to take at face value, given that previous statements insisted the studio's games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dauntless-and-fae-farm-devs-lay-off-34-people-but-insist-dlc-plans-and-unannounced-games-unaffected">would be "unaffected" by the periodic layoffs</a>. 

</p><p>On top of these concerns, we also have to remember that behind Phoenix Labs there stands an inscrutable blockchain company in the shadows, smoking the world's forests and typing decisions nobody can see into an iPhone. When Forte bought the studio, they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio">reportedly instructed management</a> at Phoenix Labs not to tell anybody that the blockchain group were the new owners. Which is, uh, I believe the business term is:  fucked up. </p>
<p>Forte's only other game studio during that time were the mobile game developers Rumble Games. They were shut down by the blockchain company in July last year. </p>

<p>The creative director of Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead Games has announced that he is taking a sabbatical before starting work on the studio’s next game.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s CCO, Johan Pilestedt, recently took to <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884015181895983223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to announce that he is taking some time off. Pilestedt explained that while players started enjoying Helldivers 2 last year, he has worked on the game since 2016 and the Helldivers franchise since 2013. As he worked for 11 years “around the clock” on the same IP, Pilestedt had to sacrifice time with his family, friends, wife, and himself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, the Helldivers 2 CCO will take some time off to “redeem what was lost” from those who have been supporting him for more than 10 years. Pilestedt has ensured the community that all the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios will be hard at work to deliver amazing Helldivers 2 content to the players while he’s on sabbatical. And once he returns, work “on the next Arrowhead Game” will begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pilestedt has also posted an <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1884016859676303815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> since beginning his sabbatical, revealing that the first thing he did was start “a game jam with the most senior devs/founders” at Arrowhead Game Studios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Helldivers 2 CEO wants <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-ceo-wants-a-list-to-be-violently-killed-in-the-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A-listers to be violently killed</a> in the upcoming movie, as the director talks about Arrowhead’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-director-talks-about-their-involvement-with-the-upcoming-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involvement with the adaptation</a>.

            <p>It looks like Level 5's forthcoming Fantasy Life RPG is headed to PlayStation as well as Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is set for release on Switch in April this year, following multiple delays.</p>
<p>The series has not been released on PlayStation before but, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:f6jharuhwg5szxe22rfijybf/post/3lgq2tvakj22s">Gematsu</a> spotted, a PlayStation Store page was accidentally published last night and then taken down.</p>

<p>The store listing had both PS4 and PS5 as platforms, with a release date of 23rd April.</p>
<p>Its quick removal certainly seems to back up its legitimacy, though a PlayStation release has not been officially announced.</p>

It's unclear when a firm release date for either platform will be revealed.</p>
<p>The latest in the life sim series was first announced during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. No specific reason was given for its delay last year.</p>
<p>Players will take on multiple roles to rebuild their fantasy island, with a time travelling twist too - as the name suggests.</p>
<p>At the same Direct, Level 5 also announced its next Professor Layton game for the Switch, though this is currently set for a 2025 release without an exact date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>People Can Fly has revealed that they are a co-development partner for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, working alongside series leads The Coalition on the prequel third person shooter.</p>
<p>The Polish studio has historic ties to the franchise, having been a co-development partner to Epic Games through the original Gears of War trilogy, before then becoming lead developer on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review-xbox-360/">Gears of War: Judgment</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: E-Day | Official Announce Trailer (In-Engine)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12m0bw1W_tk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Gears of War: E-Day will be a prequel to the series as a whole, set 14 years before the original and depicting the events of Emergence Day, where the Locust suddenly emerged from below the cities of Sera. Not only that, but it’s an origin story for the series’ most popular protagonist, Marcus Fenix, and his long-standing friendship with Dom, from the Pendulum Wars.</p>
<p>CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said, “Returning to collaborate on the next chapter of this legendary saga is both a privilege and an exciting opportunity to build upon the intense, visceral action and rich storytelling that fans have come to love. We are deeply grateful for our partners’ trust and support on this journey.”</p>

<p>Guillaume Barry, Development Director at PCF added, “Our team at People Can Fly, made up of dedicated Gears of War fans, is pouring everything we have into creating an experience that will exceed expectations. While we can’t share more just yet, we’re eager for the day when we can show all the exciting things we’ve been working on.”</p>
<p>This announcement will be a boost for the studio, which has had a difficult time of late. In December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">they laid off 120 employees</a> from a headcount of around 700, reduced their self-publishing strategy and scaled back on several projects. As a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, being able to announce a steady gig like Gears of War: E-Day will no doubt be a boost to their profile – there was a healthy bump yesterday, though<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PCF:WSE?window=MAX"> the stock’s trend has been downward since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>That said, their partnership with Microsoft was already known, having <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/310133/people-can-fly-selected-to-make-project-maverick-for-microsoft">confirmed work on a game codenamed Project Maverick back in 2023</a>. This was already expected to be a Gears of War project, given those historic ties, but has now been made clear.</p>
<p>The one thing that <em>isn’t</em> clear is what this means for a Gears of War: E-Day release window. The game was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">announced during the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024</a>, but has no release date announced and was absent from the Developer_Direct stream last week.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> community was briefly awash with rumours than publisher NetEase were playing 4D chess with their hero-loving hearts last week, according to a new report by Michael Cripe for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-fear-netease-is-planting-fake-hero-leaks-to-throw-off-dataminers-but-whats-really-going-on">Ian Games</a> The rumours began in a Discord for the team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> named Marvel Rivals Leaks, where user Keone speculated that NetEase were seeding fake information on upcoming heroes for dataminers to find.</p>

<p>"It has come to our attention that the devs have set up fake characters to catch leakers," wrote Keone in the Discord. "Not only the ones in the code - but potentially inside sources too". They then gave a list of previously rumoured heroes they now believed were "very likely fake", including Quicksilver, Professor X, and Paste Pot Pete, who I hadn't heard of until now and suddenly I have a renewed interested in Marvel.</p>
<p>The Discord, says the report, had previously found some success catching heroes before their official announcement, such as the Fantastic Four. The rumour gained some traction before reaching datamining group X0XLeak, who weren't so convinced. "Could they be intended troll by NetEase? I guess,” an X0XLeak spokesninja told IGN. "Would it make sense, in my opinion? No. The way I see it, they could have made it way easier if their goal was to troll us.” They also posted <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227">an X thread</a> as evidence that the rumoured-then-unrumoured heroes existed in the game's code, thoroughly re-rumouring them once again. From IGN's report:</p>
<blockquote><p>X0X’s matfacio told IGN that, if NetEase had truly tucked away bait to trick leakers in this way, it would need to know exactly how dataminers are rummaging through the Marvel Rivals backend, explaining: “I think it would require reverse engineering a reverse engineer.”</p>
<p>The existence of new, hidden hero names in Marvel Rivals doesn’t totally poor cold water on the idea that the developers are attempting to mislead, but some believe the studio would have to go through a lot of trouble — likely more trouble than it’s worth — just to keep the more dedicated fans on their toes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That "trouble" includes things like datamined voice line events and gameplay tags, which some community members reckoned represented <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1882535375387697271">far too much work</a> to be part of an elaborate hoax. Keone did end up amending their initial stance, saying that their post spread beyond their control before they could make edits.</p><p>"The primary assumption from the main leakers (separate from me, the ones who have most info) now is that the ‘plants’ are in fact still real. And the developers did not intend for us to find them," Keone says. "That's why I edited the original post and since deleted it, and have worked to help clear up confusion surrounding it."</p>
<p>Please do have a read of the report in full for all the details and context. I don't play Marvel Rivals myself, but I found this one interesting since - while it's somewhat of a well-seasoned nothing burger - it's fundamentally just a group of passionate players wanting to share the excitement of getting new toys to play with. Hell, <em>I'm </em>excited about Paste Pot Pete and I haven't watched a Marvel film since X-Men 2, nor played a videogame in 15 years.</p>
<p>"A server that started small to spread information has now become a cornerstone of information across the entire community, and sometimes we can misinterpret things or make mistakes," Keone told IGN. "We're a group of people working hard to find and share information, and there's never malice behind what we post. We'll work hard to make sure things don't spread like wildfire again unless it's been verified first, and are grateful for everything we've been able to share thus far."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-propaganda-posters-locations-guide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Many secrets lurk throughout Sniper Elite Resistance, including Propaganda Posters to track down. Although optional, they serve a great benefit if you find each one in Resistance, and I’ve pinpointed the location of each Poster in the main Campaign.</p>



<p>The sheer scale of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s levels means there’s a lot to do. On top of main objectives and optional side tasks, you can do specific actions related to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophies and Achievements</a> list and also track down the countless Collectibles most levels contain.</p>



<p>One of the most important though—other than Workbenches—are Propaganda Posters. This guide has the location of each Propaganda Poster, where to find them, and what they do in Sniper Elite Resistance.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-propaganda-posters-do-in-sniper-elite-resistance">What Do Propaganda Posters Do in Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fresh gameplay awaits. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Obtaining Propaganda Posters unlocks special Propaganda Challenges in Sniper Elite Resistance.</strong></p>



<p>You can see different gameplay options on <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>‘s main menu. You’ve got the Campaign, Invasion, and Multiplayer, and it also mentions Propaganda Challenges. When you start Resistance, the Propaganda Challenge sub-menu looks uninviting and unreceptive.</p>



<p>This is because all seven challenges are locked from the get-go. <strong>You must find a Poster hidden in seven of the nine levels</strong> in the entire <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-sniper-elite-resistance-mission-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resistance Mission List</a>. Each one unlocks a brand-new challenge, but they can be serious time sappers to locate. This is where I step in to save your day.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-propaganda-poster-location-in-sniper-elite-resistance">Every Propaganda Poster Location in Sniper Elite Resistance</h2>



<p><strong>I’ve provided my location on each mission’s map below, and this is where the Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Poster is.</strong></p>



<p>Each Poster has a <strong>distinct gloss and shine</strong> which makes it obvious it’s the Collectible. Posters are scattered throughout the levels, but only a specific one is needed. If you want to skip the text, head to my player marker on the map screenshot to quickly and easily find the Posters.</p>



<h3 id="h-dead-drop-propaganda-poster-location">Dead Drop Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Dead Drop Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Start the level, carry on forward, follow the natural path to the castle, and get to the broken stone bridge. Take the wooden bridge to the left of it that takes you to the river, and <strong>break the planks covering the underground doorway</strong>. Head inside, move ahead, and lockpick the door ahead. Climb the ladder, lock pick the door directly in front of you once you get to the top, and the Poster is on the right on some stairs.</p>



<h3 id="h-sonderzuge-sabotage-propaganda-poster-location">Sonderzüge Sabotage Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Sonderzüge Sabotage Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The Poster is on the building right next to the “<strong>Find the missing Resistance Cell” Optional Objective</strong>. Simply, head to this location, and go to my marker on the Map Location screenshot above. You can’t miss the Propaganda Poster.</p>



<h3 id="h-collision-course-propaganda-poster-location">Collision Course Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Collision Course Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Make your way through Collision Course until you reach the train tracks—you can’t miss them. I’m giving you the fastest route to the Poster, <strong>but it is a dangerous one</strong>. If you follow the tracks across the bridge, you <strong>unfortunately come face-on with a tank</strong>. Either take it out or run past it. Follow the tracks around the curved track, and the Poster is on a tunnel’s wall on the right-hand side.</p>



<h3 id="h-devil-s-cauldron-propaganda-poster-location">Devil’s Cauldron Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Devil’s Cauldron Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>Another simple Poster to find in Devil’s Cauldron. Go to my map marker indicated above. It’s a relatively easy path to get there, and the Propaganda Poster is on the <strong>side of a church with a big watch tower at the top</strong>—fixed with a zip line.</p>



<h3 id="h-assault-on-fort-rouge-propaganda-poster-location">Assault On Fort Rouge Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Assault On Fort Rouge Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This is probably the furthest Poster when it comes to travel distance from the start point. Cross the starting bridge, turn left, and go to the area I’ve highlighted. The Assault On Fort Rouge Poster is tucked away in alleys deep in the bottom-left corner of the level.</p>



<h3 id="h-lock-stock-and-barrels-propaganda-poster-location">Lock, Stock And Barrels Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Lock, Stock And Barrels Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>When Harry spawns, go forward, and immediately take the left path taking you <strong>down a hill and toward a wooden bridge crossing water</strong>. You can either go left or right, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong>, as either one has Germans to get past. I went right, demonstrated my expert-killing skills (raising the alarm in the process), and went through an open wooden gate to the house the Poster is on. Use my reference point, as the <strong>Poster is hidden behind a decent amount of foliage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-end-of-the-line-propaganda-poster-location">End Of The Line Propaganda Poster Location</h3>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>End of the Line Poster. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Map Location. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>This Poster gave the most trouble of all, despite the fact all Posters are found near the beginning of the level. I searched everywhere, but it was <strong>sneakily hidden at the top of a ladder!</strong> From the default starting location, head down the ladder on the left taking you to the East side of the level. You should be in the train yard now, and there’s a big, open hangar. Either climb the ladder on the side of the building, or head inside and go up a flight of stairs, and head to the platform that takes you outside. The seventh and final Poster is on the side of the wall.  </p>



<hr>



<p>You should now have all seven Sniper Elite Resistance Propaganda Posters and access to every Propaganda Challenge. Good luck trying to get Gold on every mini-mission, it’s not easy! Let me know how you get on and if you’re chasing all Collectibles.</p>



<p>Plan your time with Sniper Elite Resistance carefully as I’ve also whipped up a handy explainer on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-is-sniper-elite-resistance-game-length/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how long Resistance is, and the game’s length</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>Attendees are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-hands-on-registration-now-open-in-europe-and-youll-get-up-to-four-hours-play-time">expected to get around four hours with Switch 2</a> - and presumably will be able to try the new Mario Kart.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-patch-1-1-4-fixes-performance-degradation-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-patch-1-1-4-fixes-performance-degradation-and-more.1093488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-patch-1-1-4-fixes-performance-degradation-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, GSC Game World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/533214336538117150" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first new patch of 2025 for STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, updating the game to version 1.1.4. This patch aims to fix existing issues, such as the performance degradation that occurred when shooting and/or aiming while on a save with long playtime.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog shared by the developer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crashes and freeze on shaders compilation</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak occurred at Rostok location</li>
<li>Fixed performance degradation when shooting/aiming on saves with long playtime</li>
<li>Implemented fixes that should solve the problem causing saves to be lost on Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed a random crash related to UI animations.</li>
</ul>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launched in late November after a long and problematic development process that was interrupted by war, hacks, and an office fire, among other things. While still rough around the edges, the game managed to be a proper follow-up to the first game, as I outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the review</a>:</p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>
<p>Since then, the team has been hard at work at ironing out some of those issues, like with today's patch. There's undoubtedly more work to do, but GSC Game World is willing to go for it. Their post-launch roadmap also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">includes</a> the release of official modding tools, the addition of multiplayer, the support for hardware ray tracing, not to mention at least two expansions promised to owners of the Ultimate Edition/Season Pass.</p>

This is good news! People Can Fly have a pedigree for serving chunky gun chutney with a smile. They've also worked extensively on the series before, notably Judgement Day. E-Day itself is aiming to have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games">pronounced horror slant</a>, with the 'Emergence Day' of the title referring to the insectoid Locust's first visit above ground.  </p>

<p>This is good news, also, because last year was a fraught one for People Can Fly. Back in January, we learned from an email obtained by Kotaku that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-can-fly-and-black-forest-games-hit-by-layoffs-according-to-sources-and-leaked-emails">Polish studio were laying off 30 people</a>, alongside 20 people being moved from an unannounced Square Enix project named Gemini. They cancelled another project - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-outriders-studio-have-cancelled-development-on-a-co-op-action-rpg">a co-op action RPG named Project Dagger</a> - in April. Last December, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bulletstorm-and-painkiller-devs-people-can-fly-let-over-120-people-go-and-suspend-or-downsize-projects">parted wallets with a further 120 workers</a>, shelved one project, and downsized another. "We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game," said chief executive officer Sebastian Wojciechowski at the time.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed every People Can Fly game I've played, including Outriders - an excellent shooter, albeit one buried under a clumpy mountain of pre-peed live service cat litter. As for E-Day, it's primed to be a soft series reboot of sorts. "Gears of War: E-Day is not just our next major game; it’s a return to what makes Gears of War games special and authentic," said The Coalition studio head Mike Crump in a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/partnership-announcement/">press release</a>. "We’re pleased to be partnering with the talented folks at People Can Fly who have been a part of our franchise’s legacy for so long.”</p><p>Gears Of War has always been an interesting series to me because it initially got my - and I imagine a lot of other people's - attention <a href="https://youtu.be/wy8LRlS1SCc">through an emotional beat in a trailer</a> that never really found its analogue in the actual games themselves. I sort of get the sense that's what E-Day is aiming for, especially if the strains of Mad World in the above teaser are any indication. I haven't kept up with the series all that closely over the years though, so I'm not sure how often they milk that song in marketing. I imagine it's probably a lot now I think about it. Either way, It's been long enough that I could absolutely go for some big man chainsaw misery. Perhaps in 2025, though no confirmation on that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director Johan Pilestedt is taking a sabbatical after 11 years on the series, and will start developer Arrowhead's next game on his return.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 released early last year, but as Pilestedt noted in a social media post, he's been "living it since early 2016", while development of the first game began in 2013.</p>
<p>"11 years of working 'around the clock' on the same IP has made me set aside family, friends and my lovely wife... and myself," he wrote.</p>
<p>"I am going to take some time now to redeem what was lost from all of those that supported me for over a decade."</p>

<p>Of course, support on Helldivers 2 will continue while he's away, considering it's proven such a success - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-performed-well-ahead-of-expectations-and-topped-more-than-8m-sales">topped 8m sales in March</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-now-playstations-biggest-steam-launch-ever">PlayStation's biggest ever launch on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Arrowhead did recently come under fire, however, for the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost"> high cost of its Killzone 2 collaboration</a>, which the studio then gifted to players for free.</p>
<p>"When I'm back - I will start working on the next Arrowhead game," Pilestedt added. That will likely be a long way off, but it's exciting to consider what could be next for the studio.</p>

			<p>It’s hard out here for a <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia </em>fan, guys. Every year for what’s felt like a decade, a new game comes out that is tangentially related to this franchise, but never actually a proper sequel or continuation. There’s a lot to love about these anime girl proxies for video game consoles, but they’ve been stuck in a non-canonical limbo for far too long. At some points, this has produced gold – like when one of these spin-offs introduced an anime girl based on the <em>idea </em>of Touhou, or when another was secretly a tightly-crafted character-action crossover with my other favorite niche Japanese game series <em>Senran Kagura. </em>Unfortunately, far more often these <em>Neptunia </em>diversions end up being poorly polished and instantly forgettable. <em>Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos </em>falls hard into that category.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos | Announcement Trailer | Steam®" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6K3hDTtHNX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First of all, don’t even look in the direction of this game if you aren’t already familiar with the <em>Hyperdimension Neptunia </em>series. The game throws you into Uzume and the Gamindustri Goddesses’ latest dilemma so swiftly that it feels more like a side-quest from a different game than its own standalone product.</p>


<p>Due to hastily explained shenanigans, hordes of jelly-shaped pup creatures called Dogoos are invading the realm, so our heroes hop onto some anime-as-hell motorcycles to round ’em all up before it’s too late. Every character, as usual, is incredibly silly and funny and charming. I’m sure if you hop into this blind you’ll get some joy out of Izumi’s straight-man act or Nep-nep’s almost Deadpool-level meta shenanigans. If the game were really fun, the context for these characters and their quest wouldn’t even matter.</p>


<p>That fun, however, is few and far between. <em>Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos </em>consists of five stages, each containing three levels that repeatedly task you with collecting every Dogoo you see – a mission that will take you barely two minutes to complete. In between the missions and the cutscene chatter, you can buy costume accessories and motorcycle upgrades, but it all feels so tepid when the actual gameplay is so short, so basic, and so repetitive.</p>
<p>There’s almost an arena car action angle to this game, but the lack of any mechanical depth or lengthier stages makes everything feel like the tutorial for a bigger game, or a mini-game you’d play in the latest Hoyoverse gacha game to earn some extra gems. The Dogoo collecting is just <em>okay. </em>Your motorcycle handles fine, and the game tries to spice things up by tossing different stage layouts at you and sprinkling a few Mario Kart-style debuff items in your way. Those short levels make it impossible for you to spend enough time in a stage for any of this to click or matter, though.</p>

<p>What hurts is that I don’t hate the idea of a motorcycle-focused Neptunia spinoff at all. If this had been more of a racing game, or a proper car-combat game, or even <em>Rocket League </em>with the cars swapped for motorcycles and the soccer balls swapped for Dogoos, I feel like it’d be golden. What’s here now is so barebones and basic, though, and you’ll have it all wrapped up in barely a couple of hours.</p>
<p>These <em>Neptunia side games</em> have established a pattern of moving on and re-doing everything from scratch in a whole new genre instead of ever building on what the previous game did. If they bucked that trend now, a follow-up to this game could be something special. There’s something here that die-hard fans might appreciate as it is now, but it’s so brief and half-baked. Plus, with how long it’s been since a meaningful entry in this series, I have a hard time believing there are very many die-hard fans left.</p>

		Neptunia Riders VS Dogoos is not the follow-up that Hyperdimension Neptunia fans want or deserve. There are specks of charm and fun to be had here, but you'll have to dig deep, and after just two or three hours of digging, it'll all be over.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/split-fictions-new-trailer-showcases-its-fantastical-co-op-action-and-some-spectacular-side-content/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Josef Fares’ Hazelight Studios are arguably the masters of co-op action, and their latest, Split Fiction, is looking like something pretty special. Excitingly, we’re now barely six weeks away from its launch, and just to make sure we keep up that level of excitement, the team have dropped a brand new trailer, showing off more of the co-op action, and some of the extremely varied gameplay styles we’re going to get to enjoy together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Co-op Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game centres on Mio and Zoe – named for Fares’ daughters – each of which are authors of different genres of fiction. Drawn into their own works, the levels and overarching story are half science fiction and half fantasy, making this an exciting amalgam of the two.</p>
<p>This latest trailer shows off more of the levels, with the first centring on gravity, set within a futuristic cyberpunk city. There’s giant mechs to fight, and some cool gravity tethering action here, as well as some Ghostrunner-esque motorbike sections that look absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>Next up, we get to see a fantasy level, with the two characters gaining the ability to shapeshift into different creatures, becoming a huge ape-like monster, or a fast-moving water-dweller, while you collaborate to make it to the end of the level. If you’ve played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a> you’ll have an understanding of the wild and varied types of gameplay we’re likely to come across, and this only cements our excitement. It’s little surprise that the game made it into the top ten of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-10-to-6/">Most Wanted for 2025</a>.</p>

<p>As the trailer closes out, Fares shows off some of the additional content that’s going to be available here, with side quest portals opening up at various points to take you into a new world, with another new gameplay style. While you won’t have to play these to advance the story, it looks like you won’t want to miss out on it.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will launch on March 6, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app. Players can also invite a friend to play with them for free on any platform (Crossplay on PS, Xbox &amp; PC) with the Friend’s Pass.</p>

<p>The next God of War game could be making its way to Egypt. According to a report from DanielRPK (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/120905575?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywall</a>), Sony is casting currently casting for Middle Eastern Actors for a new game.</p>



<p>“Sony is casting Middle Eastern actors for an unknown AAA game, which is likely to be the next God of War that explores Egyptian mythology,” the report says.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that this information hasn’t been confirmed or independently verified by Insider Gaming. Until that happens, please take this news with a grain of salt.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast">PODCAST<strong>:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developers-direct-us-insider-gaming-weekly-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developers Direct Us: Insider Gaming Weekly Podcast</a></h6>



<p>Moving to Egyptian mythology wouldn’t be surprising should it happen. The God of War saga began in Greek mythology before shifting to Norse for the modern games. Moving to a new pantheon would make sense for next era of the franchise. </p>



<p>As far as Egyptian specifically, it’s been mentioned in the past (h/t <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-new-god-of-war-game-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>) that Sony Santa Monica originally considered centering the game around Egyptian mythology for the 2018 revival before settling on Norse.</p>



<p>“I think the first pitch I gave was that we wouldn’t even know what was happening,” creative director <a href="https://youtu.be/ra_R-K_IoUc?si=Exzp3X0DfFld-6pZ&amp;t=1192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cory Barlog said</a>. “So i t was Kratos walking through the desert—because we were, in my mind, still doing Egypt initially—wind, sand blowing all over the place as he’s kind of crawling through and then kind of stands up over a dune and checks out this really fantastic ancient city.”</p>

If you've followed the teases, you may have already figured it out, but now it's official: Roman Reigns will be featured on the cover of WWE 2K25.</p><p dir="ltr">Reigns had one of the biggest years of his career in 2024. After 1,316 days as WWE Champion, he finally dropped the title to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40. For months, he was off-screen, as his cousin Solo Sikoa had disowned him post-defeat from their familial faction, The Bloodline, and claimed the role of leader for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Reigns returned at SummerSlam to reclaim his spot as the "Tribal Chief" to a chorus of massive cheers from the crowd. Turning face but still keeping a harder edge to his character than Rhodes' purer Face That Runs The Place role, Reigns has re-emerged as the fan-favorite good guy the company once spent years failing to create.</p><p dir="ltr">For now, the cover star news is all we have to go on regarding WWE 2K25, but stick around, as we expect to share more soon on this year's wrestling sim. If the WWE 2K24 schedule is any sort of indication, we can expect to see this year's game launch a few weeks ahead of WrestleMania, which would slot it into a March launch some time.</p><p dir="ltr">In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k24-review-long-term-booking/1900-6418191/">WWE 2K24 review</a>, I wrote, "As both WWE and the wider format of pro wrestling live through a new golden age, it's fortuitous timing for fans that this year's game is so great. While the MTX-heavy mode feels tacked on like a publisher mandate, there are thankfully several other modes that each feel like they deserve to be played for many months ahead, making them the true centerpieces of your personal WWE universe."</p>

<p>The WWE 2K25 cover has been officially revealed. As expected from the first tease earlier this month, Roman Reigns will grace the cover of the Standard edition of the game.</p>



<p>The Undertaker will feature on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-deadman-edition-undertaker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadman Edition</a> while the entire Bloodline will be included on the Bloodline edition of the game.</p>

<p>This is the second time Reigns will be featured on the game’s base cover, and the first time as the only wrestler. Both he and Becky Lynch were on the cover of WWE 2K20 back in 2019. This time around, however, he’s joined by his “Wiseman” Paul Heyman just outside of the ring.</p>



<p>You can check out the Standard Edition covers and the first trailer for the game, below.</p>

<p>With the cover finally shown, all that’s left is for the full reveal of the game. Luckily, fans won’t have to wait long as full details on the game will be announced on Tuesday, January 28.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the reveal, including modes, features, and more.</p>

            <p>
Dauntless and Fae Farm developer Phoenix Labs has announced another round of layoffs - its fourth since May 2023 - this time affecting the "majority" of staff at the studio.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix Labs enjoyed early success with its first game, free-to-play Monster-Hunter-like Dauntless, and the studio released its second title, Fae Farm, in 2023. However, the developer has faced multiple rounds of layoffs since its acquisition by blockchain company Forte Labs in 2023, starting with job cuts impacting 9 percent of its workforce in May that year. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-34-staff">further 34 layoffs followed seven months later</a>, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">additional 140 jobs being cut</a> last May. And, unfortunately for employees, layoffs have continued into 2025.
</p>
<p>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," the developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL">wrote in a message posted to LinkedIn</a> on Monday. "We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations."

<p>
We recognise and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted," it continued. "Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games... To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals - they are some of the best in the business."
</p>
<p>
As for Dauntless and Fae Farm, the studio says it'll share more on their fate "in the coming weeks", but notes its current focus is on "supporting those affected through this transition."
</p>
<p>
Phoenix Labs' announcement follows a devastating 2024 for the games industry - in which around 13000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs - and continues a January dogged by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">further layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">studio closures</a>. Ubisoft, for instance, announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">cutting 185 jobs</a> this week, while Jar of Sparks - the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook - confirmed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">laid off "all" its team</a> earlier this month. Last year, Chris Dring shared his thoughts with Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why these layoffs are happening</a>.

Today Ubisoft let nearly 200 workers go, closing yet another studio in the process, and <em>Dauntless </em>developer Phoenix Labs functionally turned to ash.</p><p>Ubisoft continued its valiant quest to “enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation,” whatever that means, by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off 185 workers</a>, including the team at Ubisoft Leamington, which assisted on games like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>The Division</em>, and <em>Far Cry 5</em>. The company has also begun “targeted restructurings” at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections. This follows two other studio closures in Osaka and San Francisco<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> just last month</a> on the back of <em>XDefiant</em>'s shutdown, as well as the decision to “ramp down” production in Sydney – all of which resulted in nearly 300 layoffs.</p><p>Since late last year, rumors have swirled of a potential buyout from Tencent, which currently owns nine percent of Ubisoft. However, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Reuters</a>, Ubisoft has its sights set on a deal that would see the Guillemot family, which founded the company, retain control. Amid all of this, Ubisoft has faced “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">softer than expected</a>” sales of blockbusters like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and multiple employee walkouts over issues like <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-strike-france-pay-yves-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fair pay</a> and <a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/news/ubisoft-workers-strike-france/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return-to-office mandates</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Phoenix Labs is against the ropes and a punch or two from going down, with the studio saying that the lion’s share of its workers are on the chopping block.</p><p>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs,” the company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on LinkedIn</a>. “We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations. We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games."</p><p>In 2023, Phoenix Labs was acquired by Forte Labs, a blockchain company. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Developer</a> reported that Forte cracked down on communication inside and outside of Phoenix Labs, going so far as to keep potential employees in the dark as to who actually owned the studio. That really smart and normal plan is evidently going well.</p><p>In <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">January alone</a>, we’ve seen layoffs at additional studios like <em>Godfall </em>developer <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/counterplay-games-godfall-hit-with-layoffs.832239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counterplay</a> – which may or may not still be open – <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-jobs-at-risk-following-transformers-reactivate-cancellation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splash Damage</a>, and <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/eg7-undertakes-business-optimization-at-one-of-its-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piranha</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tiktok-ban-trump-bytedance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myriad concerns</a> with which you’re likely familiar, January has felt like it’s lasted a year, which if nothing else is less than two or three years. February, by virtue of having fewer days in it than January, can’t possibly feel longer. So that’s something, unless February somehow turns out to be even more grueling than January, in which case it isn’t.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/escape-room-first-time"><h3>My First Escape Room Was Pretty Cool</h3></a><p>Please tell me everything about how you design them</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-fpga-powered-retro-console-re-creates-the-playstation-one-cd-rom-drive-optional/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-fpga-powered-retro-console-re-creates-the-playstation-one-cd-rom-drive-optional/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          


<p>The console won't play original game discs natively, but Retro Remake offers an optional tray-loading CD drive in a separate "<a href="https://retroremake.co/products/superdock-preorder-deposit">SuperDock</a>" accessory; it also includes an internal M.2 drive for an SSD and four additional USB-A ports. Buyers will have to put $5 down on the SuperDock now and pay whatever the final cost ends up being when the console ships (Retro Remake claims to be targeting a price of roughly $40).</p>
<p>Like most Analogue consoles, the SuperStation uses an FPGA chip to emulate the original PlayStation's hardware rather than trying to emulate the console in software as most PC-based or Raspberry Pi-based retro consoles do. This has the benefit of reproducing all the quirks and oddities of the old hardware, making games run more accurately (and with lower input latency) than they do in software-based emulators.</p>
<p>But unlike most of Analogue's consoles, the SuperStation supports installing and running other FPGA "cores" to re-create other consoles (think of FPGA cores like you'd think of software emulators—generally, you're going to need a separate one for every console you want to emulate). The SuperStation is based on the established MiSTer platform, which already has <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/cores/what/">a huge library of console and PC cores available</a>, including but not limited to the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn. Retro Remake also says that being based on the MiSTer platform makes the console "open source from day 1."</p>
<p>Analogue has its own competing open source library of FPGA cores, called <a href="https://www.analogue.co/developer">OpenFPGA</a>. But so far, the handheld Analogue Pocket is the only one of the company's consoles to support the initiative.</p>

            <p>
In just eight days time, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> turns 25 - and EA is reportedly poised to re-release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims">The Sims 1</a> &amp; 2 this week as part of the series' quarter-century celebrations. 
</p>
<p>
The Sims 1 &amp; 2 have, of course, long been unavailable in an official capacity, with the 25-year-old original never getting a digital release and its sequel's short-lived Ultimate Collection being yanked from Origin in 2018. That could be about to change, however. Kotaku, citing a "source familiar" with EA's plans, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658">reports</a> re-releases of The Sims 1 &amp; 2 will launch on PC later this week, with all their original expansions included. It's "unclear" if a console release is also coming.
</p>
<p>
Lending further credence to Kotaku's report are the handful of conspicuous teases EA has been sharing to coincide with the start of The Sims' Nostalgia Now week, which runs from 27th-31st January. The series' official website, for instance, now <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims">features</a> a character from the original The Sims surrounded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>'s radial menu.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the publisher has <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1879218365430182064">posted</a> a short animation - accompanied by the phrase "BRB" - on social media. It features The Sims' iconic spinning Plumbob - initially surrounded by The Sims 2's radial menu, then superimposed on coloured squares reminiscent of The Sims 1's box art. 
</p><p>
Interestingly, the video then transitions to a scene resembling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s loading screen. Kotaku's report doesn't mention the series' third outing, but fans were slightly stunned earlier this month when, with zero explanation or fanfare, it received its first (still mysterious) update in 15 years. If this means EA has been quietly tinkering under the hood to implement some much-needed stability and compatibility fixes, there'll be a lot of happy Sims players.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say it could be an  exciting few days for The Sims fans, and that's before EA's big birthday blowout next week. Things kick off with a 25-hour livestream celebration of the series next Tuesday, 4th February, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">release a "huge" free 25th anniversary update for The Sims 4</a>, adding 70+ new items, a new limited-time event, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24353227/sony-m10s-inzone-oled-burn-in-warranty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is upping the limited warranty on some InZone gaming monitors to three years and is <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-monitors/sdm-27q10s/articles/00350326">tossing in OLED burn-in coverage</a> for the 27-inch M10S. The company announced the additional coverage today after launching both the InZone M10S OLED and M9 II LED in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">September</a> with only one-year limited warranties out of the box. Sony says other than that, the limited warranties remain as they were.</p><p>Manufacturers have long been averse to talking about burn-in or have outright categorized the phenomenon as “normal use,” denying warranty claims to fix it on various panel types. However, OLEDs have historically been more susceptible to burn-in, especially when used with many static images like those from a PC. In recent years, OLED has improved to be less sensitive to burn-ins.</p><div><p>Sony is the latest in a trend of manufacturers adding burn-in coverage. Alienware was one of the first to specifically include OLED burn-in within its three-year coverage on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22966303/alienware-curved-aw3423dw-qd-oled-34-inch-quantum-dot-pc-gaming-monitor-hands-on">QD-OLED monitor launched in 2022</a>, and for its latest 27-inch 4K model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">coming this year</a>. And in 2023, The Verge’s Sean Hollister asked LG to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22336413/lg-27gr95qe-b-oled-gaming-monitor-review#:~:text=Originally%2C%20LG%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20confirm%20that%20to%20me.%20In%20fact%2C%20the%20company%20had%20originally%20reserved%20the%20right%20to%20reject%20warranty%20claims%20if%20this%20monitor%20experiences%20burn%2Din">explicitly warrant the company’s OLED monitors</a> against burn-in and they agreed and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23827701/lg-oled-burn-in-warranty-two-desktop-monitor-windows">changed their verbiage</a>.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>A Samsung representative on this Best Buy product listing says the three-year warranty on the 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 covers burn-in.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Since then, companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24064465/asus-rog-msi-oled-monitor-warranty-burn-in-cover-expanded">MSI and Asus</a> have also pledged to cover OLED burn-in on some models, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors">their latest ones</a> (in some countries). It’s important to research the warranty included in the model you’re buying to determine whether burn-in coverage is included. For instance, Samsung’s website shows a general policy for its warranty that <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/legal/LGL10000300/#standard-limited-warranty">excludes burn-ins</a>, however, an online rep <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/questions/samsung-32-odyssey-oled-g8-g80sd-4k-uhd-240hz-0-03ms-smart-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-silver/6573686/question/2a8f4805-d47e-3416-9cec-dad034fbce5b#:~:text=OLED%20Safeguard%2B%20helps%20prevent%20burn,year%20warranty%20for%20this%20model">confirmed it does cover it on a 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8</a>. However, the company still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors#:~:text=Samsung%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20confirmed%20its%20warranty%20situation%20for%20its%20latest%20G8%20model">hasn’t clarified</a> if burn-ins are covered for its latest 27-inch Odyssey OLED G8 gaming monitor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As Aftermath’s resident hardware freak, my goal is to tell you about tools that I have bought and thoroughly enjoy. Sometimes, this process requires weeks of in depth testing and modification. Other times, it’s a pretty simple suggestion. Today is the latter: I love my NT Cutter cutting tool. It costs just over six dollars, is incredibly versatile, and I use it basically every single day. You should get one.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tokyu Hands (Flagship store), Shibuya | Virtual Shopping Tokyo" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbpreAPHkio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Here is an hour long tour of my favorite big chain in Japan. It's like I'm there. Skip to 10:49 for some pocket knives.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of all the chain stores in Japan, the one I miss the most outside of combinis like Family Mart and Lawson is the DIY chain <a href="https://info.hands.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hands</a>, formerly known as Tokyu Hands. For Americans, imagine if Michaels, The Container Store and the now defunct Bed Bath and Beyond fused and was seven stories tall.&nbsp; Imagine a building full of all the tiny, beautiful tools needed to make hyper detailed Gunpla and model trains, do woodworking, and cook. The one in Shibuya has a map that looks like it came out of <em>Metroid</em>. I daydream about it sometimes.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>An NT Cutter Premium Evolution PMG series. I got this because I can't find my other knife and it costs slightly more. </figcaption></figure><p>I did not buy my NT Cutter at Hands, but going there does impress upon you how alienating and boring the experience of going into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_killer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">category killer</a> craft or hardware store can be in America. It also shows you, in case you could not guess, that Japan takes its knives and craft tools very seriously. This extends beyond kitchen knives&nbsp; to small pocket knives like kiridashi and razor blades. Japan takes this stuff so seriously that every time I look for a new tool I often add “Japanese” to the end the way people affix “reddit” to searches.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>These things come apart easily. They're simple, convenient and made in Osaka.</figcaption></figure><p>This is how I came across the much beloved NT Cutter and Olfa brands, the latter of which actually invented the iconic snap-off razor blade. Both OLFA and NT Cutter’s entry level items are quite cheap online, at around six dollars as of this writing. Both brands offer knives in a variety of colors and shapes. They both feature a notch at the end for snapping off the blade when it gets dull and a clip for fitting into a pocket. OLFA is well loved and you can’t go wrong either way, but I find the NT Cutter PRO AD-2P to be quite handsome with its distinctive red dot. I use mine every single day of my life and just ordered more because I lost mine somewhere; backups are so cheap that it’s basically a rounding error for me.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Japanese Cutting Tools 🇯🇵 OLFA • NT Cutter" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mSQUv3d4HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison between various OLFA and NT Cutter tools. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This does not take anything away from American utility knives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phoenix-labs-fae-farm-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced that Phoenix Labs, a small indie developer that created Fae Farm and Dauntless have now laid off the majority of the studio in an announcement made on LinkedIn. It's uncertain how many staff were still working at Phoenix Labs during this time, as they also had layoffs in May 2024, where over 100 staff were laid off, and all projects were canceled. This was so they could focus solely on Dauntless and Fae Farm. Below is the message left by the company on LinkedIn today.</p>
<p><em>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</em></p>
<p><em>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals - they are some of the best in the business."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>At the moment, the full number of layoffs hasn't been announced, and as the statement says, details regarding Dauntless and Fae Farm will be released in the coming weeks. However, the mention of them in the announcement gives a sense of foreboding and that the games are likely to lose support or Dauntless will be taken offline due to lack of resources or revenue. Of course, this is all speculation, and it could be that those games will continue to be worked on, with updates released in the future.</p>
<p>These layoffs come just two years after being acquired by the blockchain firm Forte Labs. The dealings that came with being acquired by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/garena-acquired-phoenix-labs-dauntless-now-eyeing-mobile-release/">blockchain firm</a> led to a lot of questions and tense environments within the company, such as the fact that they were told to keep the purchase a secret, with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former employees having to sign NDAs</a>.</p>
<p>After this happened, Dauntless launched on Steam but was immediately criticized by those who played it due to the in-app monetization and erasing any previous progress made by players thanks to the Awakening update. As a result of this update, Dauntless currently sits at "Overwhelmingly Negative" on Steam.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dauntless-hands-on-at-e3-2017/">Dauntless was fairly successful</a> when it was first released in 2019, with the game initially launching on the Epic Game Store, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. It was a title funded and published by Epic Games. For the time, cross-platform functionality was a selling point of Dauntless. However, that is increasingly more common nowadays and is no longer a special feature for players to look out for.</p>
<p>Already, this month has seen a significant amount of layoffs, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Ubisoft also laying off staff today</a> and closing one of their studios. It doesn't look like it'll be slowing down any time soon.</p>

The games are about killing thousands of orcs using traps, swords, and bows.

And while it’s not as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/orcs-must-die-3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/orcs-must-die-3">good previous games</a></span>, like a double cheeseburger missing ketchup, it still gets the job done and I still enjoy it.</p><p><em>Orcs Must Die!

And once again these orcs come in massive waves and funnel through maze-like maps that you can fill with deadly traps and barricades to create spots that kill all of them while you stand by and watch. In past games you completed levels in a set order and reached the end of the game that way.</p><p>However, this time around, the game is more like a roguelike and you end up replaying maps with randomly generated modifiers activated. You might have to deal with bigger enemies or you might be unable to revive co-op team members. Between waves of enemies you pick a randomly offered bonus or ability, like extra damage, which stays with you for the rest of that run. Runs are made up of two or more randomly generated missions and a harder boss fight featuring even more orcs and more places to put traps. Finishing runs earns you skulls that can be used to upgrade your traps or unlock new skills.</p><p>In theory, the random features should add to the replayablity of <em>Deathtrap</em>. But the problem is that, while in past games each new level led to a new map, here you end up playing on the same maps a lot. In fact, you’ll likely play on the same maps a few times during a co-op session. And that, coupled with the fact that you now have a limited number of barriers to place (which can change where orcs travel), means you’ll likely “solve” a map once and just more or less do that every time you play it again.</p><p>Sure, the modifiers can change that up a bit, but it does start to feel like a grind. And to actually to beat the game, you’ll need to do a lot of grinding to get all your traps boosted up and your skills maxed out. </p><p>Don’t get me wrong, <em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</em> is still a good time with a friend, and building a giant kill-box filled with a dozen traps all firing at once to massacre a horde of orcs in seconds is still very satisfying. But I do hope that a future <em>Orcs Must Die!</em> sequel returns to the level-based formula while sprinkling some of the roguelike elements from this one on top. Like a good, cheap burger that’s not missing the ketchup and is also improved with some bacon or better cheese. </p><p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap </em>is out January 28 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. It’s also available day one on Game Pass. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
