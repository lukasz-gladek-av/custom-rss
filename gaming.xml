            <p>
A mod putting a playable approximation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has been pulled after Rockstar owner Take-Two issued a copyright removal request on its creator's YouTube channel.
</p>
<p>
The mod, created by Youtuber Dark Space, was an attempt to bring GTA 6's map to life in GTA 5 by building on the work of the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/985670-mapping-vice-city-map-discussion-thread-no-leak-footage-allowed/">Mapping Vice City project</a> - a community led attempt to piece together GTA 6's map by scrutinising all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">currently released official media</a> and combining any discoveries with previously leaked map coordinates.
</p>
<p>
Dark Space began <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1882980876201685289">detailing their progress on social media</a> in January and a version 1.0 release of the mod - built from GTA 5 assets - launched last week. However, the project has proven to be a short-lived one, with Dark Space having already opted to rein things in after Take-Two's legal team hit his YouTube channel with a copyright removal request.

<figcaption>Here's what Grand Theft Auto 6 will actually look like when it turns up.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvqP6ziEQ3Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5 — something purely made out of passion, not profit," Dark Space wrote in an introduction to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U">new video detailing the week's events</a>. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."
</p>
<p>
"I've also removed the download link even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space continued in the video itself. "But I think it's smarter to get out in front of them rather than waiting for their email that will never come... So why did they remove my video?... Well, my guess is that the map is probably a little too accurate.""
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">follow-up interview with IGN</a>, Dark Space admitted he'd anticipated Take-Two might respond the way it did based on previous mod takedowns. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility," explained, "and the fact that it happened does not surprise me."
</p>
<p>
"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he continued. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has long been at loggerheads with the GTA modding community, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shutting down the Liberty City Preservation Project</a> - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of GTA 4's map to GTA5. In 2023, however, it hired CFx.re, the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">RDR2</a> RedM multiplayer mods (and another group of modders who've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-bans-gta5-modders-who-made-their-own-multiplayer">previously faced Rockstar's wrath</a>) - and the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-enhanced-official-modding-utility-is-on-its-way">currently working on an official "conversion tool"</a> to bring GTA 5 mods into the recently released PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced.
</p>
<p>
As for GTA 6, that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">still targeting the autumn 2025 release window Take-Two previously announced</a> despite persistent reports of a delay - although a third-party accessories company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recently claimed the PC version wouldn't arrive until early next year</a>.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It was rare for developers in Japan to leave their companies, Yoshida noted, making Hasebe a rare find. The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"The prospect of a game you can actually complete is a really, really positive argument [for small games]," Doucet said. "That meant being okay with the game being 12 hours, but if it had been eight hours--and the eight hours were fantastic--we would have settled for that to reach consistent quality."</p><div

For instance, Doucet reportedly told audience members that the game's narrative has fewer than 5,000 words and cinematics top out at roughly 12-and-a-half minutes. This means players are in control over 98% of the time in Astro Bot.</p><p dir="ltr">Making smaller games could also help rein in budgets for developers.

This has led to people like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/">former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden saying AAA game development is unsustainable</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-ps5-pro-support-and-new-levels-starting-today/1100-6529484/">Astro Bot got PS5 Pro support and five new levels</a> that have rolled out weekly through this month, ending with Armored Hardcore on March 13.

Prison is a point-of-interest highlighted as an example where the ambiance of the map stays the same, but the lighting has improved to create better visibility.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's the iconic Verdansk map you remember, brought to life with more detail, higher definition, and with the best technology available today to ensure it's better than ever," the developer says.</p><p>Verdansk returns on April 3 with the launch of Call of Duty Season 3.

                <p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows development team at Ubisoft has released a heartfelt statement following the launch of the game.

The sheer amount of love and positivity we've received has been incredibly heartwarming," Ubisoft said. "Seeing your excitement, your thoughtful reactions, and your joy has meant the world to us. After years of hard work, there's nothing more rewarding than watching the community connect with what we've created."</p><p>Also in the post, Ubisoft said its staffers won't be able to reply directly to every message, but assured fans that "we're listening."</p><p>"The entire development team has been reading your posts--the celebrations, the feedback, the theories--and it's been inspiring. It fuels us. And it helps us keep improving," Ubisoft said. "Thank you for being part of this journey with us. This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="836274051" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will reportedly feature in Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake</a>, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster - supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself.
</p>
<p>
Margera made his series debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> back in 2001 and has appeared in all subsequent instalments. However, fans quickly noticed his absence when 3 + 4's skater line-up was unveiled earlier this month, with many speculating his omission may be related to the legal issues Margera has faced as a result of his struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, it's been claimed Margera will appear in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> remake after all - albeit as a last-minute addition at Tony Hawk's insistence. That's according to skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-will-be-in-tony-hawk-34-after-all-after-hawk-intervened-its-claimed/">spotted by VGC</a>.

"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a recent livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."
</p>
<p>
Activision hasn't yet commented on the claims, but its currently confirmed skater roster - which includes classic skaters and new additions - is as follows: Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 launches for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store) on 11th July. It's also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-kendrick-lamar-and-drake%E2%80%99s-rap-beef-reignited-the-anime-big-three-discourse.1143579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A year and some change ago, Atlanta rapper Future and producer Metro Boomin released their collaborative studio album "We Don’t Trust You." As is customary for rap album releases on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, the features on the album were not disclosed until a few days after its release to encourage listeners to experience the entire album rather than skip to an artist they fancy, like Travis Scott, The Weeknd, Playboi Carti, and Rick Ross (for his four die-hard fans). Today, it is difficult to recall the other featured artists on the album due to Kendrick Lamar’s "<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/future-metro-boomin-kendrick-lamar-like-that-number-one-hot-100-1234996590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like That</a>" verse, which stole the spotlight and ignited a generational rap feud between him and Drake.</p><p>We all know what followed: the world rubbernecked from their day jobs to witness the pair drop eight diss tracks against each other between April and May. Many of the tracks dropped so suddenly that only the most unemployed of the music-listening public could rise to the occasion of playing the role of Paul Revere by posting "Kendrick dropped" whenever a new track released. Their hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby feud culminated with Lamar out-rapping the <em>Degrassi </em>star by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/kendrick-lamar-dominated-grammys-not-like-us-1236125989/#:~:text=With%20his%202024%20anthem%20%E2%80%9CNot,video%20and%20best%20rap%20performance." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning multiple Grammys</a> for his final diss track "Not Like Us," <a href="https://www.nfl.com/videos/kendrick-lamar-s-full-apple-music-super-bowl-halftime-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlining the Super Bowl</a>, and getting a packed stadium to sing along to the Canadian rapper being a "<a href="https://x.com/hiphop_communit/status/1803618488696611110?t=t-m1idxOWP7fVqJ6B2Gw8w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified pedophile</a>" (<a href="https://x.com/cinesquetv/status/1888766681159283091?t=9VoZnH4MIsELJSMozIpNhQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twice</a>). It was, and forever will be, a good time to be a K Dot fan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one unacknowledged aspect of Kendrick, Drake, and J. Cole's feud (until <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/j-cole-7-minute-drill-removed-streaming-kendrick-lamar-diss-1235969657/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-diss clarity hit him</a>, leading him to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/arts/music/jcole-kendrick-lamar-diss-apology.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apologize to Lamar</a> and duck out of the beef to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6818Dx0N9k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live a peaceful life</a>) is how one line in Lamar's "Like That" verse breathed life into a long-quelled feud in the anime community over which shonen series is the best of all time: <em>Naruto</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, or <em>One Piece</em>.</p><p>The bar in question was a response to J. Cole’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Xty2gi5cMa8?t=116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“First Person Shooter” verse</a> calling himself, Drake, and K Dot the big three in rap — a claim that’s pretty easy to accept in most rap circles. Lamar, ever the competitive rapper, took playful offense to that, saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9bKBAA22Go?t=110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Fuck the big three, it’s just big me.”</a> While the phrase is in reference to the trio, it also carries weight in anime circles as the term dedicated to <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Naruto</em>, and <em>Bleach</em> as the <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big three shonen series</a>. While greener anime fans often mistakenly treat the term as something that can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vl0rof/the_new_big_three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">usurped by newer series</a> like <em>Jujutsu </em>Kaisen or <em>Demon Slayer</em>, old heads have gatekept the adulation as a distinction that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can never be duplicated</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as anime fans heard K Dot’s big three bar, they knew <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBKQdJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peace among fandoms would be disrupted</a> once again with the resurgence of old internet forum debates. But this time, these debates happened on the new stage of the brainrot social media site TikTok, whose video editors took K Dot’s bar as a sleeper agent activation phrase and went wild making stylish AMVs centering either of the three anime as the one that was “really like that” while their contemporaries' best work was “a light pack.”&nbsp;</p><p>While the rap trio's beef was settled through their ability to craft scathing disses at each other's character, the anime big three TikTok beef was resolved by determining which fandom excelled in creating AMVs with their show as the superior series. The discourse evolved into the rappers being aptly personified as the three anime shows. Kendrick's anime persona was <em>One Piece</em>, as he has garnered an almost religious following of listeners who dedicate their lives to converting others to his fanbase despite the breadth of his discography being more politically charged and intimidatingly dense than his peers. (It also doesn't hurt that <a href="https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luffy reps Lamar's Los Angeles Lakers</a>.) Drake's anime persona was <em>Naruto </em>because he is the most popular of the three, garnering an all-encompassing reach thanks to the mass appeal of his songs servicing beginner rap listeners. This left <em>Bleach </em>as J. Cole’s anime persona, which was so uncannily appropriate one could almost call it fate. Like <em>Bleach</em>, J. Cole suffers from middle-child syndrome, often being left out of the conversation as the forerunner of the big three despite having a stylish flow of his own, even if he has not delivered a new flow or cadence in his rap performances since the trio broke into the rap scene over a decade ago.</p><p>Aside from stray anime AMVs, such as those featuring <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBtjSK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>JJK </em></a>and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2n5HYVT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Ball Super</em></a>, TikTok video editors engaged in widespread friendly competition. My favorite AMVs had its heroes quip catchphrases after K Dot's “big three” bar, such as Naruto saying “baka,” Ichigo saying “bankai,” and Luffy giggling while hitting his Gear 5 pose. Like the Kendrick-Drake rivalry, TikTok AMVs quickly escalated, with <em>Naruto</em> fans readily admitting they were <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBsmwc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting their generous ramen-eating asses beaten</a> by the video editors behind <em>Bleach </em>and <em>One Piece</em>’s “Like That” edits outperforming their creative efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering who won the Anime Big Three contest of 2024, it was definitively <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBq82p/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a>. Not only did the anime’s supporters work harder on the video editing front, but they also provided empirical data, such as <em>One Piece</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling more volumes worldwide</a> than the other series, as further proof of its superiority. They also cleverly utilized K Dot’s “Prince outlived Mike Jack” bar — comparing his influence to Drake’s comparing himself to Michael Jackson — to emphasize the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBWdFV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing series outliving <em>Bleach </em>and <em>Naruto</em></a>.</p><p>Did Kendrick Lamar know his <a href="https://youtu.be/NPqDIwWMtxg?t=85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“throw away”</a> big three bar would reignite an age-old anime beef through dueling AMVs at the same time as he was systematically dismantling his lesser? Probably not.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's upcoming survival MMO set in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-mmo-will-let-players-team-up-with-characters-who-are-dead-in-the-book/1100-6511909/" data-ref-id="1100-6511909">alternate version of author Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi universe</a>, will buck the trend of many survival games by not launching in an early-access state when it arrives for PC on May 20. Nor will it have any kind of subscription fee, as some MMOs do.</p><p dir="ltr">Creative director Joel Bylos delivered the news in a recent video, diving into Funcom's post-launch plans for the sci-fi survival game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1B7G2SXBDc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q1B7G2SXBDc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The key things that you need to know about Dune: Awakening's launch are that it will not launch in early access and it will not have a monthly subscription," Bylos said. "It will receive regular free updates, including new content, new features, and quality-of-life improvements."</p><p dir="ltr">Bylos went on to say that the game would also sell optional DLC, which will accompany each major free update and will be able to be bought piecemeal. A season pass that will include four post-launch DLCs will also be available.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening launching in 1.0 is somewhat of a rarity for the survival game genre, which more often than not sees games launch in an early-access state. Releasing in early access lets developers gather more player feedback and slowly add more content to the game over time before eventually launching in full, oftentimes with a price increase.</p><p dir="ltr">That won't be the case with Dune: Awakening, which was first announced to be in the works six years ago and has had multiple closed beta periods over the last year. While Dune: Awakening will launch in a complete state for $50, those willing to pay more will be able to play early as part of what Steam calls "advanced access." Players who buy the $70 or $90 editions of the game will be able to play Dune: Awakening starting five days early on May 15. Both of the game's more expensive additions come with the aforementioned season pass, as well as additional cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure, this allows people to get into the game early," Bylos said. "But it also helps us to make sure we can balance the server load as people come into the game through launch for the best possible experience. Players who want the fresh start experience will still be able to play on new servers that will launch when the game launches on the 20th of May."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-designed-with-controller-in-mind-despite-launching-on-pc-first/1100-6529238/" data-ref-id="1100-6529238">actually designed with controllers in mind</a>, but will launch on PC first. A Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 version will come at a later date, which has yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced that Stellaris Season 9 launches today with the Stargazer<br>
Species Portrait pack out right now. Following on from this release there will be a lot more coming along over the year including two expansions and another pack. That includes the BioGenesis Expansion on May 5th, the Shadows of the Shroud Expansion in Q3 2025, and and the Infernal Species pack in Q4 2025. The Stellaris Season 9 expansion pass is priced at $44.99/€44.99/£37.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellaris: Season 09 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mrj29R5Orw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The full details of the Stellaris Season 9 expansion are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>BioGenesis Expansion (May 5, 2025): Take command of the forces of life itself in BioGenesis. Engineer living ships, terraform entire ecosystems, and wield advanced genetic tools to shape the destiny of your empire. Will you create a utopia of adaptation and growth or weaponize biology to dominate the stars?</em></li>
<li><em>Shadows of the Shroud Expansion (Q3 2025): The psionic plane holds untold power—but at what cost? Shadows of the Shroud is a complete overhaul of the Psionic Ascension path, introducing new moral dilemmas, patron allegiances, and the ever- present temptation of ultimate destruction.</em></li>
<li><em>Infernals Species Pack (Q4 2025): Forge your destiny in the Infernals Species Pack. Adapted to relentless heat and volatile landscapes, you wield the power of extreme environments to reshape the galaxy. Will your empire thrive in the heat, or be consumed by the very forces it seeks to command</em></li>
<li><em>Stargazer Species Portrait (available now): Dream of the stars with this exclusive portrait, available immediately upon purchasing the Season 09 Expansion Pass. Featuring three phenotypes and unique animations, the Stargazer Species Portrait is perfect for players who seek to embody the spirit of cosmic curiosity.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside the release of the BioGenesis Expansion will be the free Stellaris 4.0 “Phoenix update, and this will rework the Trade experience as well as adding new population and workforce groups. There has been some controversy around the development of recent Stellaris content, when Paradox Interactive confirmed it was using generative AI for in game assets, including the voice of an AI character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/634773/alienware-aw2725df-oled-gaming-monitor-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m still getting accustomed to seeing 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitors for less than $700 — after all, it wasn’t long ago that they were retailing for around $1,000. So imagine the feeling of sticker shock (complimentary) to spot one of Alienware’s models with a fast 360Hz refresh rate for hundreds of dollars off, which is the case <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/apd/210-bljd" rel="sponsored">right now at Dell’s website</a>.</p><p>Originally $899.99, this monitor’s final price plunges to $599.99 when you use promo code <strong>AW27300 </strong>at checkout. With tax, my checkout total rang up to a cool $653.24. An OLED gaming monitor that costs less than a mid-range GPU? Hell yeah. At this price, there’s no need to wait for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date">Alienware’s forthcoming AW2725D</a>, which the company hopes (but isn’t promising) to launch for $549. It’ll have 1440p resolution with a 280Hz refresh rate, so it’s actually slower than Alienware’s discounted AW2725DF.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><p>The AW2725DF has a 360Hz refresh rate, 1440p resolution, and a decent PPI to ensure that text looks clear.</p></div></div><p>In terms of the specs, Alienware’s 27-inch AW2725DF sports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, plus support for VRR via either its HDMI 2.1 port or through either of its DisplayPort 1.4 ports. That’ll ensure that the screen looks smooth and tear-free, even during moments when the frame rate fluctuates wildly. While the panel can achieve up to a 360Hz refresh rate — equating to 360 visible frames per second, if your GPU can keep up — it’s only supported via the DisplayPort. Through HDMI 2.1, the monitor’s refresh rate tops out at a respectable 144Hz.</p><p>The AW2725DF has an anti-reflective coating, but since I haven’t used this exact display, I can’t vouch as to whether it’s fully matte or slightly on the glossy side (the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date"> newer AW2725Q</a> is more glossy than matte, in turn letting more contrast through). It has 111 pixels per inch (PPI), which should be enough clarity to avoid seeing pixelated text. A low PPI dampened my enthusiasm for other OLED monitors, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23509955/corsair-xeneon-flex-oled-gaming-monitor-features-price-hands-on">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a> that I reviewed in late 2022.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While we wait for season three, fans are left to ruminate on the end of season two and they’re very divided, particularly on the finale’s unforgettable last five minutes. The moral conundrum Mark S.

In this show, people who work at a company called Lumon have their brains bisected so that they have two distinct memory banks. Their “innie” only has memories of their time within their office on the severed floor, while their “outie” doesn’t remember anything from their work day and goes about their life without a care in the world. The show sometimes explores questions about whether or not certain parts of one’s personality or inclinations are innate, but as far as the world of <em>Severance </em>is concerned, these are two individuals who share a body. Innies are only allowed to see or know about the outside world in controlled environments, and the show’s biggest mysteries are born out of this division. When those walls come down and Mark’s innie and outie are able to communicate in “Cold Harbor,” it becomes clear that the two share a body and little else.</p><p>Outie Mark asks his innie to save his wife from the depths of the severed floor’s testing facility, likely leading to the exposure of Lumon’s corruption, the dissolution of the company, and the “deaths” of every innie who works there. Mark tries to soothe his innie self into a sense of security by explaining that he’s in the process of “reintegrating” and combining both their memories, but not only does this sound like a half-measure to someone who wants to be more than a tagalong on someone else’s life, he doesn’t even know if he can trust his outie to finish the process. Throughout their conversation, it’s clear Mark views his innie as a means to an end, rather than as a complete person with his own hopes, dreams, and desires. So when it comes to carrying out the plan, which requires cooperation from both Marks as they move across floors, the innie is conflicted as he weighs whether or not he’s willing to essentially commit suicide, along with killing the rest of the innies, in order to save his outie’s wife and give them a happily ever after.</p><figure id="" data-id="8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-recommend-id="image://8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-recommend-id="image://8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of this builds up to the final moment, in which Gemma has been successfully escorted outside of Lumon and all innie Mark has to do is leave with her and give control back to his outie. But then he hears Helly (Britt Lower) call his name. This is the woman he loves, the one whose name his outie couldn’t even be bothered to get right in their conversation. Why should he give up even a few more moments with her so his outie can have the life he wants? His decision made, Innie Mark goes to Helly and takes her by the hand, and together they run into the depths of the severed floor with no plan beyond fighting for every second they have left with each other. Meanwhile, Gemma cries out to her husband, seemingly unaware that he’s been severed, and begs him to join her on the other side. It is a brutal, tragic, and romantic declaration of the innies’ personhood, separate from their outside world selves.</p><p>It is a tough scenario, and it’s got <em>Severance </em>fans split down the middle. Did Mark S. do the right thing? It’s certainly not the most satisfying conclusion for those who wanted Mark and Gemma to live happily ever after, but it is the most thematically appropriate conclusion for a season focusing on innie autonomy and how outies view their workplace selves as second-class citizens.</p><p>Debating the morality of everyone involved is worthwhile, but what’s surprising is that discussing Mark’s decision has somehow boiled down to a shipping war, with some <em>Severance </em>fans putting on their Team Helly or Team Gemma t-shirts and pitting two women against each other. Friends, it feels like we’ve lost the plot once more. <em>Severance </em>has spent two seasons establishing that innies and outies are different people with separate identities, goals, and lived experiences. The Mark we see make this decision isn’t picking Helly over Gemma, he’s choosing himself over his outie. Gemma is collateral damage, but the Mark who exists inside Lumon isn’t her husband, and she is not his wife. Mark’s inner turmoil is illustrated by these two women on the opposite ends of an office hall, but he’s not literally deciding between them. That hasn’t stopped the debates from becoming ship war fodder, filled with fans who are missing the forest for the trees.</p><p>Yes, Gemma will likely have some more trauma to work through, having watched her long-lost husband walk away with another woman, but boiling down Mark’s decision to “picking one woman over the other” or “abandoning his wife” is both missing the point and shows that some viewers don’t see innies as individuals, but merely parts of someone else. The whole season finale shows innies declaring their autonomy over Lumon and their outies’ wishes. It’s not even subtext. Helly stands on a table and rallies a group of severed workers by saying that they’re only given half a life but it’s one worth fighting for. The notion that Mark is choosing Helly over Gemma is a frustrating reading both because it’s deeply unsympathetic to the plight of an oppressed class, and because it dilutes the season’s complex thesis into a petty love triangle.</p><p><em>Severance</em>’s season finale is not the satisfying conclusion some fans were likely hoping for, one that ended with Mark and Gemma reunited and his outie making a noble sacrifice to ensure it happened. But it was one consistent with everything <em>Severance</em> has ever said about how innies have only ever been tools in the eyes of their outies. You can only be treated as an afterthought by those who brought you into the world for so long before you fight back. And sometimes fighting back is choosing yourself, even for a few moments. That’s a much more interesting lens through which to debate the ending than one that erases all the nuance of the show just to pit two women against each other.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s second-biggest launch to date, just behind Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.</p>



<p>That’s according to Insider Gaming sources, who have provided data for the last three mainline Assassin’s Creed titles. The information was <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted public on my ow</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1904177799419634137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> X</a> (formerly Twitter) account a few hours ago. </p>



<p>According to our sources, who have obtained the information via Ubisoft’s own tracking tools (and have provided such data on past titles), it shows that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is behind that of Valhalla, but ahead of Odyssey.</p>



<p>Last week, Ubisoft announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-surpasses-odyssey-and-origins-launch-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past two million players just two days after launch</a> and one million players one day after launch.</p>



<p>According to the data, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla achieved 2.55 million players on its first day, whereas Odyssey achieved just shy of 1M (roughly 430,00 during early access).</p>



<p>At the time of writing (March 24), Shadows is tracking to hit three million players in the coming days. According to its trajectory, Shadows could hit roughly six million players within its first month, but its worth pointing out that the game has released in Q1, compared to other successful Assassin’s Creed games that release in the holiday season.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla did 8M in its first month, whereas Odyssey did 3.4 million. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Odyssey currently has the most unique players of any Assassin’s Creed title sitting at over 40 million.</p>



<p>As always pointed out online, these are <strong>player numbers and not sales</strong>, but we should here more on the games performance from Ubisoft themselves in the coming months. </p>



<p>Have you played Assassin’s Creed Shadows? What do you think of the game so far? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Paradox have announced that 4X space strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>'s next major overhaul will launch on 5th May, alongside the game's BioGenesis DLC pack.

<p>It doesn't sound nearly as exciting on the surface as living spaceships, I'll grant you, but this is a 4X game, don't forget - the mythological firebird is in the detail.</p><!--more-->

<p>Stellaris 4.0 was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365">announced back in January</a>. Let's start by talking about the promised performance boosts, which are the result of copious rewiring of various empire systems.</p>
<p>"Stellaris has many moving parts, and an incredible number of calculations are performed every month," reads the announcement post. "Many of those calculations rely on others, forcing them to be performed sequentially rather than in parallel. This causes the game to slow down as the number of calculations increases throughout the game and is especially noticeable in large galaxies - more planets and empires means more pops filling more jobs, producing more resources, with more pathfinding for the fleets, and so on."</p>
<p>Paradox are trying to lessen the load of the pop and job systems by, essentially, grouping pops later in the game rather than handling them individually. Trade is another system "that has a disproportionately high impact on performance compared to the benefit" so they're "simplifying that one significantly and making Trade act as a standard resource." The devs are also looking to streamline how Fleets work, though this'll likely happen after the release of the 4.0 update.</p>
<p>As for the new player guidance and game pacing element, the Steam post continues that "much of the feedback we've received from newer players indicates that Stellaris has become overwhelming in the early stages of the game, providing a flood of decisions and a seemingly endless barrage of notifications." </p>
<p>They're addressing this by "reviewing events and notifications to ensure that any interruptions are meaningful" - that's to say, that they present you with a choice of some kind rather than being "purely informational". A number of events that are "purely informational", including Anomalies discovered by Science Ships, have been demoted to smaller "toast" notifications down the righthand side of the interface. Empire Leaders will also be less "needy", as they're planning to merge the first two tiers of leader traits and reduce the number of levels at which you're asked to pick traits.</p>
<p>The game's galaxy generation, meanwhile, will be tweaked to reduce the odds of encountering solar systems with pre-scripted elements that bump up the number of habitable worlds past the maximum you choose in the settings. There are, of course, a lot of these pre-scripted systems nowadays, because Stellaris has become a quintessentially Paradoxical cauldron of downloadable add-ons, free or paid.</p>
<p>Paradox are also trying to give the average game of Stellaris more backbone by means of "suggested tasks" that are filed under Conquest, Exploration, or Development categories. These reflect a player-chosen "focused aspiration" for your empire, and might involve building a Dyson sphere or, at the top level, becoming Galactic Custodian. Veteran players can probably ignore them, as "they're primarily intended to teach new players how to play like you and guarantee that you'll be able to force access to those important technologies." You'll be able to trace completed tasks and other endeavours on a new empire timeline, found within the situation log. </p>
<p>As for more general quality of life improvements, they've gone through the genetic modification process during species modification and assimilation "to remove many pain points and make the overall flow much smoother". Truly, a dystopian sentence.</p>
<p>They're also changing the "Colony" designation to a temporary modifier, and letting players pick a colony designation and "even" turn on automation when giving the colonization order, so that mid-to-late game players don't have to choose between using automation and losing the amenity and stability bonuses of the default designation. Oh, and they've given the ship designer screen a haircut as well.</p>
<p>Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/577123891031310365">Steam</a>. This is the tip of the iceberg, of course, with later posts adding many pounds of flesh to the details sketched out here. The eventual full changelog is going to be an abyssal monster indeed, or my name isn't Locutus of Borg.</p>
<p>I realise all this probably sounds quite dry to the new players the "phoenix update" is designed to woo. If you're among them, congrats on making it to the last paragraph of this article - that's a Dyson Sphere-sized accomplishment right there. Still, I'm always fascinated by attempts to trim and tighten the workings of games as unavoidably baggy and exhausting as this. It reminds me of Civilization 7's efforts to get around the problem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-civilization-players-dont-finish-a-single-game-going-by-civ-6-data-and-perhaps-thats-the-best-way-to-play">most players not completing a single game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-rebuilt-ground-up-technology-when-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has revealed the evolution of Verdansk, which was first released in March 2020 as the first Call of Duty: Warzone map. It’s coming back in just a few days, and fans are excited… Mostly.</p>



<p>In a new video published online, Activision’s teams uncovered everything that went into creating Verdansk all over again, breaking down the technical upgrades made to make it feel like an all-new game while retaining the classic feel of Warzone. Of course, the game will use the new movement engine, so that won’t feel the same as it did five years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-about-verdansk-2025">What’s New About Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>Verdansk has been rebuilt for 2025, five years after it first surfaced.</p>



<p>The team has upgraded the technology powering Verdansk in Warzone. It has better quality overall and better rendering, and things like grass, foliage, mud, and water are more accurate, realistic, and have better physics.</p>



<div><article><p><span>The map that started it all, rebuilt from the ground up 💥

Take a deep dive with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BeenoxTeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@BeenoxTeam</a><span> at this first look at Verdansk – returning April 3 🪂 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Lighting has had a boost as well, with the global lighting ambience undergoing several changes. The team has added a new high-resolution sky box, upgraded bounces, light-map quality, and better transitions between interiors and exteriors. Shadows, backlighting, and indoor lighting have all undergone substantial enhancements.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-studio-is-making-verdansk-2025">Which Studio Is Making Verdansk 2025?</h2>



<p>It was noted that Beenox, Raven, and High Moon Studios all worked collaboratively on Verdansk 2025, bringing together the ‘best technology available today’ to ensure the map is ‘better than ever’. At the same time, it was stressed that it remains ‘faithful’ to Infinity Ward’s 2020 creation which changed the face of the battle royale genre forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-verdansk-come-back-to-warzone">When Does Verdansk Come Back to Warzone?</h2>



<p>The Verdansk release date will arrive with Season 03 on April 3, 2025. It’s almost five years to the day since Warzone first launched, when COVID-19 was driving millions of people into their homes and onto Call of Duty.</p>



<p>It was a different world back then, and Warzone would come to make content creators overnight sensations and turn average gamers into battle royale beasts with the hottest meta weapons on the block. I have fond memories of Verdansk, but it helps that I had a great crew to play with and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-vibes-warzone/">the vibes were immense</a>.</p>



<p>All that’s left now is to kick off your Verdansk countdown and start deciding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-tac-map-reveal-pois/">where you’ll land</a> when the map comes back to Warzone on April 3.</p>
