            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saturnalia">Saturnalia</a> and Wheels of Aurelia developers Santa Ragione have announced that they will "wind down operations and face a high risk of closing the studio", following Valve's refusal to allow their upcoming horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horses">Horses</a> on Steam, PC gaming's largest digital storefront by some distance. They say they have the funds to support and update Horses after launch for around six months, but claim they "will not be able to start new projects unless Horses somehow recoups its development costs without access to more than 75% of the PC gaming market".
</p>
<p>
The studio have published <a href="https://horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/">a FAQ on their official website</a> explaining the situation in depth. They claim that Valve rejected Horses based on an unfinished build from 2023, at which time Steam's approval teams commented that "this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute", with the specific addition that "we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor".
</p>
<p>
We'll return to that last line. Firstly, some context. Horses, if you've yet to have the displeasure, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horses-is-an-absolutely-cursed-horror-game-from-the-creators-of-saturnalia">an unholy cauldron of surreal body horror and silent cinema techniques</a>, now due to release via Epic, GOG, the Humble Store and Itch on 2nd December. It casts you as a young man who must spend two weeks working on an isolated farm. After meeting the Farmer - a lumpen gargoyle whose lips and teeth get far too much screentime - you're introduced to the titular Horses, who turn out to be naked human slaves in horse masks, their private parts blurred out.
</p>
<p>
Around two years ago, Santa Ragione submitted a "rough, incomplete" version of Horses for Steam approval. "We were only about halfway through development and had scrambled together a build that could be played start to finish, solely to satisfy Steam's request for a playable version to open a Coming Soon page, something we had never been asked for before," the developers comment. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say they received an "automated" review statement from Valve in June 2023, rejecting the game on the grounds that it infringed Steam's content policies. Find it in full below.
</p>
<blockquote>After review, we will not be able to ship your game HORSES on Steam. While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we found that this title features themes, imagery, or descriptions that we won't distribute. Regardless of a developer's intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor. While every product submitted is unique, if your product features this representation--even in a subtle way that could be defined as a 'grey area'--it will be rejected by Steam. For instance, setting your game in a high school but declaring your characters are of legal age would fall into that category and be banned. This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted.</blockquote>

<p>
The developers spent the following months asking for more details about the ban, while offering to change anything Valve deemed unfit for publication - something that would have been relatively straightforward, given that Horses was still being made at the time of Steam review submission. They say that Valve have yet to reply, but they believe Steam's content reviewers may have had misgivings about one particular scene when another man and his daughter visit the farm. 
</p><p>
"The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the "horses" are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one," the developers explain. "What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. 
</p>
<p>
"The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag," they continue. "We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of HORSES, works much better when delivered by an older character." 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
The developers note that all characters in the game "are clearly older than 20 years old, as communicated by their appearance and through dialogue and documents that you will encounter in the game." They also comment that while Horses "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse. It uses challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion." Valve have, of course, already rejected the argument from intent in their alleged statement above.
</p><p>
I've now played through Horses myself - look out for a review next week - and as regards the final version of the game, at least, nothing about the scene with the young woman strikes me as some kind of child pornography. It's disturbing material, but it's also very clearly a commentary on abuse and exploitation rather than an endorsement, with appropriate dialogue, and yes, the characters are depicted as adults (the young man protagonist is elsewhere described as 19 or 20 in a letter from his parents). Still, it's not clear that this is the scene that has triggered Valve's ire. We've mailed them to ask for comment on Santa Ragione's claims.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say they have invested around $100,000 making Horses. The developers invested $50,000 initially after signing the game with its primary developer, Andrea Lucco Borlera, and had hoped to cover the remaining costs based on sales of their previous, very good horror game Saturnalia. The latter has not sold as well as hoped, however, something Santa Ragione attribute partly to Valve's refusal to give them Steam keys for a "great bundle opportunity" - this came around the time they were told that Horses had been banned from Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione say that the ban has "completely erased our ability to find an external supporting publisher or partner to fund the rest of the game, as no one in the industry considers an indie game that cannot be released on Steam to be viable". They have raised the remaining $50,000 via private funding from friends, "which puts us in a completely unsustainable financial situation unless the game somehow recoups its development costs". 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione perhaps merit some criticism on this last count - if you know that your videogame project is not "viable", isn't it more responsible to hedge your bets rather than continuing to raise funds? Still, I'm sympathetic to the developers' predicament otherwise.
</p><p>
Given that it dates back to 2023, the Horses ban pre-dates the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">swathe of "adult" game delistings</a> on Steam and Itch.io precipitated by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">a payment processor crackdown</a>. In their FAQ, Santa Ragione are careful to draw lines between the situation and wider efforts to restrict access to sexual material online.
</p>
<p>
"It's important to note that HORSES' ban has nothing to do with the recent restriction on adult content pushed by payment processors," they write. "This decision was solely in the hands of Steam's curatorial team." In other words, they're putting the blame for all this squarely on Valve. 
</p>
<p>
"Alongside ultraviolent titles, Steam distributes explicit pornographic games," the developers comment. "[S]ome of these listings acknowledge the legal grey area Steam mentioned in the HORSES ban message, by stating 'All characters depicted are over the age of 18' in their store descriptions, and yet non-pornographic works like HORSES can be banned without context. 
</p>
<p>
"By contrast, mature works with comparable or stronger themes routinely appear on mainstream streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, where controversial directors are an accepted part of the catalog," the developers go on. "This double standard suggests Steam does not treat games as art on par with film, and intervenes with censorship when an artistic vision does not align with what the platform owner considers acceptable art."
</p>
<p>
Again, we'll ask Valve for a comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>USB-C is now the universal norm for charging</strong> and data on everything from smartphones to tablets to laptops, ending the cable chaos that had plagued tech users for decades. Even Apple gave up its <em>Lightning</em> connectors in favor of USB-C across all devices so now <strong>everyone needs quality USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> for charging and syncing.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5930/">$6, down from $8, this Anker 2-pack works out to just $3 per cable for Apple-approved accessories</a> from a brand trusted by millions. This r<strong>ecord-low Black Friday price</strong> on Amazon makes stocking up on essential charging cables affordable enough to place them everywhere you need power.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5930/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>60W Fast Charging That Powers Real Devices</h2>
<p>The capability for <strong>60W power delivery manages fast charging for iPhones, iPads, MacBook Air</strong>&nbsp;and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocols without bottlenecking charging speeds. This wattage proves enough to charge most phones at maximum speed and also supports tablet and laptop charging at respectable rates that keep most devices powered during use.</p>
<p>An<strong> iPhone 16 or 17 will charge from empty to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> when paired with an appropriate 20W or higher charger, while an iPad will charge comfortably sans the frustratingly slow speeds that plague inadequate cables. The 60W rating provides headroom beyond what most phones require and ensures the cable never becomes the limiting factor in your charging setup even as devices demand more power in future generations.</p>



<p>The <strong>3.3-foot length strikes the practical balance</strong> between reach and portability that makes these cables work across multiple usage scenarios. This length extends comfortably from wall outlets to nightstands or desks without excess cable creating tangled messes, while remaining short enough to pack neatly in bags without bulky coils. Bedside charging reaches from floor outlets to mattress height with ease, office setups connect from desktop power strips to devices on desks, and car charging extends from dashboard ports to passenger seats.</p>
<p><strong>Apple’s approval from Anker</strong> offers the assurance of strict quality and safety standards that come inherently with the official compatibility certification process. What that means in real life is these cables will work seamlessly on your iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks without triggering any compatibility warnings or experiencing those frustrating connection issues like other, lesser, non-certified cables do. The extensive testing for electrical safety, data integrity, and durability makes sure such cables will not damage your expensive devices due to voltage irregularities or poor construction.</p>



<p>The two-pack quantity provides immediate redundancy by placing cables in several locations, rather than continually moving a single cable from room to room and risking loss or damage. Leave one cable at the side of your bed for overnight charging, using the second at the desk for daytime top-ups, or designate one for home and another for your work bag.</p>
<p>The fact that Anker is an Apple-approved accessory maker gives them a level of quality you just can’t get from some no-name cheap cables. If you want reliable USB-C cables without paying Apple’s premium pricing, this record-low deal makes essential charging infrastructure absurdly affordable.</p>

<h2 data-start="520" data-end="557">Powerful Performance for Any Task</h2>
<p data-start="559" data-end="1248">The Microsoft Surface Laptop is built with performance in mind. It features a choice between two processors: the Snapdragon X Elite 10-core or 12-core CPU.

<p data-start="1250" data-end="1923">As expected with pretty much any tech product to release in the last couple years, the marketing for this laptop is leading with it’s support for AI features. Microsoft markets this Surface Laptop as built for the AI era, offering integration with Copilot+, which is their new AI assistant. Copilot+ can generate art from text prompts and help you easily access documents or websites. In addition to this, Copilot+ promises to improve video call quality by enhancing lighting, reducing background noise, and blurring distractions, though these features have been around for a while—just now labeled as AI.</p>


<h2 data-start="1925" data-end="1964">Stunning Display &amp; Versatile Design</h2>
<p data-start="1966" data-end="2748">The Surface Laptop boasts a large and vibrant display, available in 13.8-inch or 15-inch sizes. With HD resolution and support for HDR and DolbyVision IQ, the screen offers sharp visuals that bring all your content to life. Whether you’re watching videos, working on projects, or browsing, you can expect vibrant colors and clear details. The laptop also features a touchscreen, allowing you to easily switch between tablet mode for a more interactive experience or use it like a traditional laptop with the keyboard and mouse. The minimal bezel design maximizes the screen space.. Plus, it’s incredibly thin and lightweight, making it easy to carry between classes, work meetings, or perhaps your local coffee shop.</p>
<h2 data-start="2750" data-end="2805">Convenient Port Selection &amp; Impressive Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="2807" data-end="3264">In terms of connectivity, the Microsoft Surface Laptop comes equipped with all the necessary ports, including two USB-C 4 ports for fast data transfer and charging. The laptop is also designed to be highly portable, with long-lasting battery life that can keep you going for up to 20 hours before needing to plug it back in.</p>
<p data-start="3266" data-end="3608" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5923/">Whether you need a reliable laptop for work, school, or personal use, the 2024 Microsoft Surface Laptop is an excellent choice.</a> Get it now for as low as $750 ahead of Black Friday.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has come up with an entirely new way to promote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-live-event-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zero-hour/1100-6536400/" data-ref-id="1100-6536400">Chapter 6 finale event</a> and launch of Chapter 7 this weekend: by briefly turning the storm circle into a "storm seven" for an hour on Tuesday morning. Look at this:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612047" data-ratio="0.562423500612" data-width="1634" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612047"></a><figcaption>Fortnite Battle Royale's storm circle took on a new shape for a bit.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg"></figure><p>The change occurred at 6 AM PT and was reverted at 7 AM, with all games that started during that one-hour window having this odd new storm circle. The change was a promotional stunt to build hype for the Chapter 7 launch on Saturday, November 29--the chapter finale live event, which will only play one time ever, is Fortnite's biggest event every year, as it usually draws player counts in the tens of millions for whatever spectacle Epic has in store.</p><p>But the emphasis on the number 7 isn't just because we're about to start Chapter 7. During the finale live event we're also expecting the return of the Seven--Fortnite's Avengers-esque team of superheroes that had been led by Dwayne "The Foundation" Johnson until the end of Chapter 3, when they were eaten by evil liquid chrome. No members of the Seven have been seen since the start of Chapter 4, and the game pretty much stopped referencing them completely in Chapter 5, so their return would be a big deal.</p><p>The Chapter 6 finale is going down on November 29 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET, with virtual doors opening 40 minutes before. You can read more about what to expect from the event <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-live-event-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zero-hour/1100-6536400/" data-ref-id="1100-6536400">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Ex-GTA boss Dan Houser has an explanation for why he believes the Grand Theft Auto franchise has been so successful for Rockstar Games, and it might not surprise you, but it's fascinating hearing him recall some history.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a brief conversation with Channel 4's Sunday Brunch</a> on November 23, the English producer and writer was asked if what led to GTA's mega-success had anything to do with the fact that the game is this sort of simulation for the version of ourselves that we can't actually live out.</p>

<p>"I think partly," Houser said. "I think it's partly that, partly it put you in this exaggerated cinematic world, and mostly I would argue because it was this sense of freedom. Before that, games were either a shooting game or a driving game or a simulation game, and [GTA] was all three smashed together in a way that felt very free. And just, also, you know, when people talk about the metaverse or this digital world, those were the first games that showed you this idea of living in this fake place."</p><p>Houser went on to say that it was really GTA 3 that skyrocketed the franchise's popularity. Although the game came out two months after the devastating attack against the Twin Towers in New York, Houser noted that the team (formerly DMA Designs, now Rockstar North) was still excited about the project because there was something "magical" about what GTA 3 was doing.</p><p>"I think all of the team felt, with GTA 3, which was the kind of big breakthrough one in 2001 and we were very much running out of money at the time as a company--I think all of the team thought, 'This could be amazing. There's something really magical about this,'" Houser continued. "It was very raw and put together, but as it began to come together, it had these sort of moments of real innovation and real, kind of--it felt like the future in a way. But then, until it came out, no one outside of our company was very excited by it. That came out just after 9/11 in late 2001, and as it came out, people started to get more excited about it."</p><p>While Houser reminisced about the GTA series during the chat, he also talked about the controversial technology everyone loves to talk about: AI. He's currently "dabbling" with it but believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">it's overrated</a> and "not as useful" as some would have you believe.</p><p>In other Grand Theft Auto news, Rockstar Games announced earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">GTA VI has been delayed</a> to November 2026.

<p>New gameplay is more than Peppy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Chuhai Labs has shared the first gameplay trailer of its stunning-looking on-rails shooter, <strong>Wild Blue Skies</strong> (formerly known as <strong>Wild Blue</strong>), featuring some anthropomorphic animals piloting flying vehicles through the skies to fight evil. Sound a little familiar?</p>
<p>Okay, so the game still isn't confirmed for Switch (or Switch 2) yet — just PC and Xbox — but just watch the gameplay up top. Trust us. This is <em>basically</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a> with lovely cel-shaded-inspired visuals and all the barrel rolls, shooting and banter you'll ever need.</p>
<p>Here's a run-down if you need a <em>little</em> more detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features Ready for Takeoff:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Modern Take on 90s On-Rails Shooters:</strong> Experience the thrill of classic aerial combat reimagined with modern design, smooth controls, and updated visuals.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>From an Aerial Legend:</strong> Developed by Chuhai Labs, the indie studio founded by Giles Goddard, the legendary programmer behind <em>Star Fox</em>, <em>Stunt Race FX</em>, <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and <em>1080° Snowboarding</em>.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>High-Flying Adventures:</strong> Take control of Bowie Stray and soar through vast environments from scorching deserts to frozen tundras and beyond.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Cinematic On-Rails Combat:</strong> Engage in thrilling dogfights and take down waves of enemies as you navigate intense, cinematic levels.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Environments:</strong> Each mission offers unique hazards and landscapes that challenge your reflexes and reward skillful flying.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Stylish Visuals &amp; Smooth Performance:</strong> A polished, modern aesthetic that channels the spirit of classic 3D shooters with crisp effects and fluid motion.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Streamlined Systems:</strong> Slick controls and intuitive gameplay make it easy to jump in while offering depth for veterans of the genre.<br>
<strong>-</strong> <strong>Rewarding Progression:</strong> Rack up high scores, complete optional tasks, and discover hidden collectibles as you battle against Grimclaw’s forces.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And look, if you need more convincing, one of the programmers of the original Star Fox — Giles Goddard — is working on this game' he's also worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/stunt_race_fx">Stunt Race FX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/1080d_snowboarding">1080° Snowboarding</a>. of course, his most important work is in helping bring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/doshin_the_giant">Doshin The Giant</a> to GameCube.</p>
<p>Oh, and this is the same studio that worked on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cursed_to_golf">Cursed to Golf</a>. Basically, Wild Blue Skies looks absolutely lovely, and we would really like to see this on Switch.</p>
<p>Let's hope we get some news on other platforms soon!</p>

Rosalina's Storybook is now available from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/rosalinas-storybook-127537/?srsltid=AfmBOorjBh-pADv0QYnniN05v02d6vsG-TfDFVi9uokLBXpP6ZTRWJ8e">My Nintendo Store</a> for $24.99 (or your regional equivalent), or from a bunch of other storefronts, including <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rosalinas-Storybook-Nintendo/dp/1506754902/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3GT8eJ_Pq9l9H4bUowCmpP16_qC-bT9pYu4wza_QqzoxwyQ0C7siKCKdrk2RyL2M409SBi0Ot_XpZuCfgtC3_7URhBjBtcV4rRQCXCh_olm8TVOfno18L3Azm_s0R0gStkNb6uXGdq2p0lHJPmQQWoO97Gu5wHwwKygEqna50Sw7xI9FHzMHEvyunDYHH0WGozV_8Xo9oCnmcfp7FwuR8ePcqnKcUVmLsB2B5bV503c.tfK6Je2N0XPqluVRHGK2bSnu9Y-TsyLjIQXo6eXZDgM&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;qid=1764086601&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANintendo&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-3&amp;text=Nintendo" rel="sponsored noopener">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/rosalinas-storybook/nintendo/9781506754901">Waterstones</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytws0BZJ-l_eg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890ikhuxl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Much as you might expect, the book contains all the pages from the <em>original</em> game, retelling the story of a young girl and her relationship to the Lumas. Weirdly, it does not contain the new pages which were added for the Switch re-release, which feels like a bit of an oversight.</p>
<p>Either way, here's the book's official description from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the tale of that young girl and that star child going on a great journey together, searching for one thing and finding something else altogether. This is the tale of Rosalina and the Lumas and the secret of their special bond.<br>
Featuring the actual art and story from Super Mario Galaxy, this book will be treasured by fans whether they’ve spent many hours with the game or are brand new to the world of Rosalina and the Lumas. Arriving November 25, 2025, Dark Horse Books and Nintendo present <em>Rosalina’s Storybook</em> —now displayed in a beautiful hardcover volume.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that the book, or some variation of it, will cameo in the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, with <strong>Captain Marvel</strong>'s Brie Larson taking on the all-important role of reading it as Rosalina.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Spellcasters Chronicles is the latest debut multiplayer game from a studio that is known for its single-player games, with Quantic Dream stepping up to try its hand in the genre. Ahead of the game's first closed beta, which will take place from December 4-7, I got the chance to play the game and ask game director Gregorie Diaconu a few questions about the coming title.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://wccftech.com/spellcasters-chronicles-hands-on-preview-quantic-dream/">check out my hands-on preview with the game here</a> if you want to see how I got on with the time I had checking it out. In short, I'm not exactly convinced that Quantic Dream will be the first single-player-turned-multiplayer-studio that'll make both sides work. But there's still plenty of time for Quantic Dream to prove me wrong.</p>



<p>And, considering Diaconu's answers, the studio is ready to prove itself to me and to every other player currently looking at Spellcasters Chronicles with a doubtful eye.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Spellcasters Chronicles - Official Fire Elementalist Beta Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/47UB8IVATOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>What was the driving force behind making a multiplayer game? What drew Quantic Dream towards this kind of project?</strong></p>



<p><em>Spellcasters Chronicles was born very organically inside the studio. Right after wrapping Detroit: Become Human, a small team started experimenting with a prototype that mixed action, strategy, and summoning, starting for the universal fantasy of being a powerful sorcerer who can summon armies of creatures of all shapes and sizes, and the simple joy of being able to fly without any limitation. It was fresh, energetic, and unlike anything we had done before, yet it still carried the things that define us: strong identity, systemic depth, and a desire to let players express themselves. </em></p>



<p><em>The prototype quickly caught everyone’s attention at the studio. What started as a side experiment became a fully-fledged production, and we built a dedicated team around it in 2020. In a way, Spellcasters Chronicles is a very natural extension of nearly three decades of Quantic Dream exploring new forms of interactivity. Since Omikron, we’ve constantly reinvented our grammar, whether through narrative branching, animation or technology through our custom engines and tools. We’ve never repeated ourselves, and we’ve always created original IPs. Adding multiplayer, competitive tension, and social interactions was simply the next step of that evolution.</em></p>



<p><em>And of course, as with all our projects, it’s an original IP conceived by David Cage, whose long-time desire to explore multiplayer gameplay and a high-fantasy universe naturally shaped the creative direction of the project. Spellcasters Chronicles allowed us to finally dive into those themes in a bold, stylized setting.</em></p>



<p><strong>Was it always going to be a free-to-play game? How did the studio fall on that choice, and is it a point of concern with how difficult it is for any game, F2P or not, to garner player attention?</strong></p>



<p><em>Yes, from very early on, we felt that Spellcasters Chronicles needed to be free-to-play. The genre thrives on accessibility: we want players to be able to jump in without barriers, to try different Spellcasters, to experiment with strategies, and to enjoy the competitive ecosystem from day one. But being free-to-play doesn’t mean compromising our values. We’re dedicated to having fair monetization and, above all, to avoiding any pay-to-win elements.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re fully aware of how tough the multiplayer landscape is today, whether you’re free-to-play or premium. But we believe in this project because it comes from our studio’s own DNA. It’s bold, it’s different, and we think players will appreciate that. We also feel the market still rewards originality and sincerity, even in crowded genres. Our job now is to prove ourselves, one update at a time</em>.</p>



<p><strong>What will be the cadence of updates? Are new Spellcasters going to be added</strong> <strong>with each major update? How often will new maps be released?</strong></p>



<p><em>We’re not ready to share a full roadmap yet. But I can say that players can expect a very active update cycle. Major updates and seasonal drops will introduce new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, and even new Titans.</em></p>



<p><em>The goal is to keep the game feeling fresh and reactive to our community. We want players to always have something new to explore, master, and influence!</em></p>



<p><strong>What does it mean for Spellcasters Chronicles to have a "<em>community-driven narrative</em>"?</strong></p>



<p><em>This is one of the aspects we’re most excited about, and one we’ll reveal more about after the early beta phases. Right now, our priority is to let players focus on the core gameplay experience, because we’re not known for multiplayer games and we have a lot to prove. We want the gameplay foundations to speak for themselves first.</em></p>



<p><em>But at a high level: community-driven narrative is about giving players collective influence over the evolution of the universe. Each season, the community will face meaningful choices that can impact the lore, the world, and even gameplay elements. It’s a way of extending something that has always defined Quantic Dream: empowering players to shape stories. Except for this time, instead of individual branching paths, it becomes something shared, a story built by a community.</em></p>



<p><em>This closed beta is just the beginning. As we expand into the macro loop over the coming months, we’ll unveil how players can steer the fate of the world.</em></p>



<p><strong>How long does Quantic Dream expect to support Spellcasters Chronicles?</strong></p>



<p><em>Our intention is to support Spellcasters Chronicles for the long term. This isn’t a short experiment for us, it’s a major new IP and a project we’ve been building passionately for years. We’ve designed the systems, the narrative framework, and the seasonal structure with longevity in mind. Ultimately, the game’s lifespan will also be shaped by the community, and our commitment is simple: as long as players are there and engaged, we will continue to grow the world, expand the roster, and make the experience evolve.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will the game's first year look like?</strong></p>



<p><em>Again, the full roadmap will come later, but the first year is built around seasonal beats. Players can expect new Spellcasters, new maps, new summons, new incantations, Titans, seasonal events, and narrative updates tied to the community’s collective choices. The goal is to make Year One feel full of surprises, setting the tone for everything that will follow.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia Might Be Headed For Its Own Embracer Moment]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saudi-arabia-ea-funds-jared-kushner-trump-2000647246</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/saudi-arabia-might-be-headed-for-its-own-embracer-moment.1364383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is Saudi Arabia’s takeover of EA <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">another big-brain play</a> or a sign of desperation? Can a more generous <em>Black Ops 7</em> battle pass convince players to keep playing? What does James Cameron&nbsp;<em>really</em> think about Netflix? It’s another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, our daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>As we skid into the long holiday weekend, I’m trying to decide exactly how many <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday</a> discounted game controllers I should buy to replace the ones my kids keep breaking. Or maybe I should just stop paying my electricity bill and force them all to take up knitting instead.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia is having an Embracer moment</h2> <p>The country’s Public Investment Fund has made a bunch of bad bets, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/business/pif-saudi-arabia-fund-problems.html">according to <em>The New York Times</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-savvy-games-group-s-saudi-owned-parent-fund-is-running-low-on-investable-cash"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). It reports that the sovereign wealth fund is running low on cash for new investments. You might remember one of them being a&nbsp;<a href="https://ig.ft.com/saudi-neom-line/">concept for a futuristic city</a> in the desert in the shape of one long line.</p>

 <p>This makes the fund’s massive bid to take EA private seem somewhat more desperate and precarious, given that much of it will be debt-financed at high interest rates. Embracer itself <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-saudi-arabia-dead-island-2-borderlands-deal-1850475619">once looked to the PIF to save it</a>, rapidly unraveling once a multi-billion dollar deal failed to materialize. It never recovered. We’ll see how long Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman can continue flooding the zone with oil money to whitewash the country’s human rights record.</p>

 <p>Notably, the EA Saudi deal was reportedly facilitated by Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law. MBS recently visited the White House <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/middleeast/jets-chips-clean-slate-mbs-trump-saudi-intl">in exchange for</a> fighter jets, advanced AI chips, and god knows what else. Trump brushed off MBS’s alleged role in having a Washington Post journalist murdered a few years back as “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/watch-asked-about-khashoggi-murder-trump-says-things-happen-and-mbs-knew-nothing-about-it">things happen</a>” and claimed his family has done “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5613866/fact-checking-trumps-claim-his-family-has-done-little-business-with-saudi-arabia">little</a>” business with the Kingdom. I guess the largest leveraged buyout of an American firm by a foreign entity is just table stakes these days.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Black Ops 7</em> battle pass will be more generous than the <em>Black Ops 6</em> one</h2> <p>You’ll still have to battle FOMO, but unlocks will come more easily. “The team has taken learnings from <i>Black Ops 6</i>’s Battle Pass completion times and made tuning adjustments for a more satisfying journey,” the devs <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-zombies-season-01#Battle-Pass">wrote in a new blog post</a>. “The result: each season’s Battle Pass in <i>Black Ops 7</i> will be more rewarding for your time spent in-game, no matter where you’re playing across all parts of the game.”</p>

 <p>Initial pages will be shorter, and players can earn Battle Pass Tokens from Daily Challenges including in the co-op campaign, in case you’re a <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">glutton for punishment</a>.</p> <h2>Palmer Luckey’s N64 clone is getting revealed soon</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The ModRetro M64 hardware is getting a full reveal on Black Friday – features, colors, our incredible new controller, cutting-edge <a href="https://twitter.com/AMD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AMD</a> hardware, etc.</p> <p>Much has changed since we launched early bird pricing at $199 earlier this year, things like inflation, component shortages,… <a href="https://t.co/T8MLilyweh">pic.twitter.com/T8MLilyweh</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The ModRetro M64 is the arms dealer’s latest side project: an FPGA machine that plays old N64 cartridges on modern displays. Despite things like “inflation, component shortages, tariffs, and more,” the price will remain $200, which is 20 percent less than the recently launched Analogue 3D. The devil will be in the details, however. Luckey says all will be revealed on Black Friday, though a holiday 2025 release seems like a long-shot at this point.</p>

 <h2><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> gets a free update this week</h2> <p>The November 27 patch will <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1993318901262823923">add more</a> weapons, enemies, and other small features, like some fresh team-up attacks for the musou fighter’s characters.</p> <h2>Helldivers 2 is getting jungle armor and giant chainsaws</h2> <p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/">Python Commandos Warbond</a> will go live for players on December 2. In addition to the new Contra-style kits, players will get the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool which looks like a long buzz-saw that will slice through enemies and trees alike.</p> <h2>Big Jim hates Netflix</h2> <p>The <em>Avatar 3</em> director and box office giant James Cameron had some harsh words for the streamer’s Oscar strategy <a href="https://t.co/U5tk94vdNU">in a recent interview</a>. “We’ll put the movie out for a week, we’ll put it out for 10 days; we’ll qualify for Academy Awards consideration,” he said, critiquing the company’s free-loading strategy. “See, I think that’s fundamentally rotten at the core. The Academy Awards, to me, mean nothing if they don’t mean theatrical.”</p> <p>Basically, he’s accusing Netflix of trying to draft off of the prestige of awards nominations without actually investing in theaters, all while its platform is directly undercutting the broader movie-going experience. Personally, I think Cameron could do a lot more to help theaters by releasing good movies instead of more <em>Avatar </em>sequels, but his underlying logic is unimpeachable.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-gta-5-roleplay-ice-raid-new-save-collective-2000646967">People are training for ICE raids inside <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-multiplayer-metagross-xerneas-garchomp-2000646988"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> online battles are already super boring</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/dan-houser-ai-rockstar-gtav-rdr2-absurd-ventures-2000646935">Dan Houser is not buying all of the AI hype</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/early-black-friday-deal-drops-the-seagate-4tb-external-hard-drive-by-20-but-not-for-long-2000645507</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s that time of the year again. Early Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals are rolling in hot, which means you don’t really have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of top-rated items across all categories (TVs, laptops, smartphones, kitchen appliances, games) have already dropped to their lowest prices ever. Finding the right discounts that are worth your hard-earned money, however, can be a little overwhelming during such times, but that’s where we come in to help. Our shopping team is keeping an eye on the best deals around, so you don’t have to!</p>
<p>Those looking for a reliable storage solution — we have good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">Seagate just dropped its massive 4TB external hard drive by 20%, which means you can bring it home for just $100 today.</a> The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase, too. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. The deal, however, wraps up soon. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for it, but we’re not expecting it to last more than a couple of days. If you have been wanting to expand the storage of your computer or gaming console without spending a ton, now is the time to act. Grab it before the price shoots back up to $125.</p>

<h2>Stores All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>Running out of storage is never fun, and this drive is sure to take care of that issue for years to come. The storage capacity it offers is truly massive. 4TB storage means you will have space to house all your old and new data, which can include thousands of photos, hundreds of movies, years of backup, tons of research papers, an unusual number of work documents, plus all your favorite titles. And even after all of this, you will still have plenty of space left for future downloads. If you have ever been in a situation where you had to delete some of your old files to make room for new ones (like all of us), you’re going to greatly appreciate the peace of mind this brings.</p>
<p>It’s designed to work with Windows or Mac computers and select gaming consoles, with the setup being fairly straightforward. If you’re planning to use it with a Windows-based computer, you just need to plug in the power and then plug in the included USB cable. The drive should now appear in the (My) Computer/This PC and Windows Explorer/File Explorer. Using it with a Mac requires you to reformat the drive. Once that’s done, the system will detect the drive, and you can start using it.</p>



<p>This drive, despite the massive capacity it packs, is quite minimal and lightweight. It easily slides into a laptop bag without bulking things up, which makes it easier to take with you on the go when working remotely. You also don’t have to worry about losing your important data, as your purchase will include a year-long access to Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services. The service connects you to a team of world-class data recovery experts, offers one in-lab data recovery attempt, and gets you an encrypted storage device containing your recovered data if recovery is successful.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5922/">In short, if you’ve been after a reliable storage solution for your important files, the Seagate 4TB external hard drive is a great option to consider, especially now that it’s available for just $100.</a> It not only offers a massive capacity, but is compatible with a range of devices and is easy to use, as well.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2’s next Premium Warbond, Python Commandos, drops on December 2, 2025; introducing a minigun, new weapons, stratagems, and more. </p>



<p>Premium Warbonds is the paid battle pass system in Helldivers 2, which provides players with exclusive content, including cosmetics, weapons, and more. A few months ago, we received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-legendary-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo ODST</a> Legendary Warbond, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-price-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dust Devils</a> followed it next. Now, the next Premium Warbond has been announced, adding a highly requested weapon to the game: a minigun. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-weapons-and-stratagems">Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond Weapons and Stratagems </h2>



<p>Revealed through the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Helldivers 2 is getting one new weapon and three new stratagems thanks to the Python Commandos Premium Warbond. First up is the M-1000 Maxigun, a new minigun that has an ultra-high ammo capacity. Next up is the AX/FLAM-75 “Guard Dog” Hot Dog, which is a drone equipped with a flamethrower. It follows the player and coats their enemies with the fires of freedom. </p>



<p>Next up is another stratagem: the CQC-9 Defoliation Tool, essentially a chainsaw that can cut through trees and enemies. Last, we have the AR/GL-21 One-Two, which is a combination assault rifle and grenade launcher. It is a heavy weapon, but it deals heavy damage too, and basically puts two weapons in your primary slot. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-armors-and-capes">New Armors and Capes</h2>



<p>Let’s look at Helldivers 2: Python Commandos’ armors and capes; there are two new items in each category. The first armour is the RS-20 Constrictor light armor set, “the official uniform for the League of Patriotic Arm Wrestlers.” Next is RS-40 Best of Prey: “a heavy armor set patterned after legendary Helldiver, Ronald Mambo and his famously powerful and burly physique.” Both armours come equipped with Rock Solid passive, which makes the player more resistant to staggering and ragdolling attacks. </p>



<p>There are two new capes and coordinating player cards: Foe Rent Asunder, which is pre-tattered to give a battle-worn appearance, and Mark of the Constrictor, for Helldivers who strangle out any anti-democratic behavior they encounter.</p>



<h2 id="h-emotes-and-patterns">Emotes and Patterns</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2 Python Commandos Premium Warbond will add the Front-Leaning Rest Position emote, allowing players to “drop and give ‘em 20 anytime.” A new Chameleon Camo Pattern will also be included for FRV, Exosuit, Hellpod, and Shuttle.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Valve changed its rules to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-is-no-longer-allowing-adult-games-in-early-access/1100-6534685/" data-ref-id="1100-6534685">prevent adult games from having early-access releases</a> on Steam. That came in the aftermath of a broader push against adult titles on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">Itch.io</a>, largely at the behest of banks and payment processors. The upcoming indie horror game Horses is rated M for Mature, but it's not an adult title. Regardless, Steam informed the developer, Santa Ragione, that Horses was banned from the platform in 2023. The developer claims Valve has never explained its reasons for the ban in the two years since the ruling.</p><p>Horses is a first-person title that casts players as a ranch hand who spends two weeks at an increasingly bizarre and unsettling farm. The horses in this game aren't horses at all. They're naked humans wearing horse masks who are forced to act like beasts of burden.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkQSQnF_0Z8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vkQSQnF_0Z8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Santa Ragione insists that Horses is not pornographic, and the publisher jokingly added that it apologizes if it "got your hopes up for horse porn." Instead, Santa Ragione says it's using "challenging, unconventional material to encourage discussion. It invites players to examine why something feels the way it does, what it says about the characters and systems at work, and where their limits lie. It is about tension, not erotic content."</p><p>According to the publisher, Valve never offered any guidance about what it found objectionable or what could have been changed to avoid a ban. Santa Ragione did share its belief that the ban may have been triggered by a scene in the game that originally featured a young girl riding on the shoulders of a naked adult woman in a horse mask. However, the publisher added that the scene in question has since replaced the girl with "a twenty-something woman" because the dialogue and the dynamic of that sequence was better served by using an older character.</p><p>Without a Steam release, Santa Ragione admits that the studio may be at risk of shutting down. To recoup at least some of the $100,000 spent on development, Horses will get a PC release on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a> on December 4. It will be priced at $5.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Marvel Snap will pay homage to classic comic team-ups with its next limited-time mode, Team Clash. The mode will reimagine dozens of existing cards as "Team Clash" versions with team-based synergies, and each team will have a passive ability to boost their strengths. The event will begin in late December.</p><p dir="ltr">The six teams run the gamut of Marvel characters and classic team-ups: Avengers, X-Men, Brotherhood of Mutants, Thunderbolts, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Spider-Verse. You'll be able to try out a pre-built deck with any of the six teams, or build your own custom Team Clash deck to try your own strategies. Your custom decks just need to have the six core cards for that team.</p><p dir="ltr">Some cards have been subtly tweaked for the Team Clash mode, while others are completely different. For example, in the Avengers team, each time you play an Avenger, you give the others at that location +1 power. Team Clash Captain America has an ongoing ability similar to his regular one: Other Avengers at his location get +2 power. But Hulk has a bigger shift--a slight reduction in power, but an On Reveal that gains +2 power for each other Avenger at his location.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4611952-captainamerica.png" data-ref-id="1300-4611952" data-ratio="1.25" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4611952-captainamerica.png" data-ref-id="1300-4611952"></a><figcaption>Team Clash Captain America for use in the Team Clash mode</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4611952-captainamerica.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can check out all the teams with their abilities below to start planning your decks.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/">Splitgate 2</a> is finally getting out of its long beta phase. The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2918300/view/590662508143970096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed that the beta will end on December 4</a>, when the servers will shut down so they can prepare everything for the full launch later that month. When this happens, the Beta Season, all active battle passes, and everyone's seasonal ranks will come to an end.</p><p>"Since launching the beta in May, this game has majorly transformed," the team said about how much the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/our-final-beta-playtest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game has changed</a>. "We started with factions and abilities, and we've rebuilt the entire foundation about what makes Splitgate special: portals, movement, and pure gameplay."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob8fNw6a8O0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Splitgate's world is basically a futuristic sport where combat arenas are set up for high-tech portal battles. Players are dropped into zones with weapons scattered around, and the whole point is to outplay people using smart portal tricks, quick movement, and good aim. The gameplay feels like a mix of classic arena shooters and mind-bending portal tactics, where you can surprise enemies from almost any angle.</p><p>Splitgate 2 returned to beta because its rushed June 6 launch exposed major problems that the game simply wasn't ready to handle. There was also the colossal issue of aggressive monetization--highlighted by an $80 bundle quickly cut in half--and an apology in which the studio head blamed a former monetization lead, which only made matters worse. Since the studio had publicly criticized its competition before release, these flaws were judged even more harshly. 1047 Games acknowledged that Splitgate 2 needed far more work and pushed it back into beta to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-is-reverting-to-beta-og-servers-shutting-down/1100-6533350/" data-ref-id="1100-6533350">fix its systems and rebuild trust</a>.</p><p>The team also said that going back to beta gave it the chance to rebuild the game from the ground up. Factions are gone, abilities are now power-ups, and classic modes like King of the Hill, Domination, and Team Deathmatch are back. With the beta, the developers also added new maps and weapons, reworked the menus, and refined numerous systems based on player feedback.</p>

The studio feels Valve—which it said "informally expressed concern" about some of the game's live action intermissions before the automated Steam review had concluded—may have flagged the title because of an unfinished scene in an early build.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We think the ban may have been triggered during the initial Steam submission by an incomplete scene on day six, in which a man and his young daughter visit the farm. The daughter wants to ride one of the horses (in the game the 'horses' are humans wearing a horse mask) and gets to pick which one," said the studio.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What followed was an interactive dialogue sequence where the player is leading, by a lead as if they were a horse, a naked adult woman with a young girl on her shoulders. The scene is not sexual in any way, but it is possible that the juxtaposition is what triggered the flag. We have since changed the character in the scene to be a twenty-something woman, both to avoid the juxtaposition and more importantly because the dialogue delivered in that scene, which deals with the societal structure in the world of Horses, works much better when delivered by an older character."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, that remains speculation on the studio's part, because Valve has purportedly failed to explain precisely which elements of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it deemed inappropriate. That, for Santa Ragione, is the core of the issue.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We believe Steam intentionally keeps its policy opaque so it does not have to stand by clear rules and can adjust decisions to whatever best serves the platform at a given moment," added the studio. "That might be acceptable in a truly competitive market, but Steam is a de facto monopoly, and arbitrary, unpredictable decisions can jeopardize the survival of developers and studios. We also believe they chose this particularly loaded and generic accusation because it is difficult to contest publicly."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;We were treated without the professional respect the situation required&quot;">"We were treated without the professional respect the situation required"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Santa Ragione invested around $100,000 into the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horses</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, roughly half of which was donated by friends of the studio. It now feels that, without access to Steam, recouping that investment will be impossible—leaving it facing the very real risk of closure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing how the situation has impacted the team, Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva told Game Developer the past two years have been "profoundly disheartening."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team and I have been extremely frustrated, knowing not only that we did our best to revert this decision, but also that we offered to comply with any request or regulation, and still we were treated without the professional respect the situation required," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is scary, humiliating, and patronizing to be told 'no, just because' by entities that hold absolute power over your financial stability. I think I personally feel what we described in the press release when we say this kind of approach pushes creators toward self censorship. Not having clear boundaries about what I am allowed to create and publish is depressing, and the opposite of an environment that enables and encourages creativity."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva added that he feels "tricked and betrayed" by Valve, which he said has received a substantial portion of Santa Ragione's earnings over the 14 years it has been conducting business on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I mistakenly thought that had bought us a certain level of professional courtesy that would allow us to solve any kind of issue. That belief gave me a false sense of security, a sense that the publishing process was at least somewhat predictable. It is hard not to see malice when rules are kept purposely obscure while at the same time there is insistence that their curation is automatic and 'democratic' because humans are not allowed in the process," he continued.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I [also] feel very bad for the author, Andrea Lucco Borlera, because he is obviously the one with the deepest emotional connection to the work. I was very worried about him when I first had to break the news that the game would not release on Steam. Imagine being told that the work you have spent years of your life on is not going to be published, without a reason, and there is nothing you can do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Riva said the entire team has been under "immense stress" after repeatedly trying and failing to appeal the ban. He is also worried that openly criticising Valve could place the development team in the firing line.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think it is very important that we have this conversation, but I know this opens up the team to additional scrutiny and criticism, both in general for openly criticising Valve, and specifically because Steam’s allegations are so broad and severe. It is something that has literally kept me up at night on many occasions," he continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the end I think [the team is] relieved that we managed to complete and release the game. Had we canceled it when we got banned, it would have been much worse. Of course everyone is sad that this is very likely going to be our last game together as Santa Ragione, but it is at least a consolation that it's going to be such a strange and hopefully memorable title."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer has reached out to Valve for comment.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been 18 months since developer Santa Ragione - the hugely acclaimed studio behind the likes of Saturnalia and Mediterranea Inferno - unveiled its unnerving first-person narrative horror Horses. And after a bit of a delay, it finally has a release date, and is launching via the Epic Games Store, Humble Store, GOG, and Itch.io on 2nd December. One storefront is conspicuously absent from that list, however, with Santa Ragione today confirming Horses has effectively been banned from Steam.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Horses, which is being developed in collaboration with director Andrea Lucco Borlera, unfolds across 14 days on a rural farm where players - working as a summer farmhand - must perform "increasingly surreal" tasks. "As the sun sets and the facade of tranquility crumbles," Santa Ragione teases, "you decide whether to keep to the safe path or venture into the farm's hidden depths." The ensuing three-hour adventure blends "interactive scenes, live-action intermissions, monochrome visuals, and silent-cinema title cards" into a tale about "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility." It's a game Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">called</a> "deeply unsettling" when he played it last year, in no small part thanks to its naked, human "horses".</p>

<p>But it turns out that even before Horses' announcement in June 2023, Santa Ragione was grappling with Valve behind-the-scenes. The full tale is a long one, and we've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">spoken with studio co-founder Pietro Righi Riva elsewhere to get paint a clearer picture</a>. The gist, however, is that while Horses has sailed through the review process on all other PC storefronts, it can't be sold on Steam - effectively denying it access to 75 percent of the PC gaming audience, as Santa Ragione puts it  - and leaving the acclaimed studio in a financially precarious position and it now faces closure.</p><p>You can read the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">full, much longer interview</a> with Pietro - about Santa Ragione's struggles with Valve and his hopes for change at Valve - elsewhere on Eurogamer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Elvis Merzlikins has worn plenty of goalie masks in his time with the National Hockey League. He's spent the entirety of his career with the Columbus Blue Jackets, which means he's run through all sorts of ideas using the team's blue and red color scheme. He’s even asked his four-year-old son Knox to choose. The first new mask for this season is Spider-Man—specifically, Spidey from the Disney Jr. show <em>Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends</em>. He debuted a second new mask, even more striking than the first, during warmups at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio earlier in November: Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p>A mixture of new school Sonic from the movies and imagery from the classic games, Merzlikins’ mask is colorful, bold, and immediately recognizable. Both Sonic and Knuckles feature heavily—matching the Blue Jackets' color scheme—and are powered up with lightning. Smaller versions of other characters are rendered in 16-bit pixels around the mask, including the Blue Jackets mascot Stinger. Artwork on the chin is a reimaging of the classic Sonic logo: "Elvis the Goalie," with his number, 90.</p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@jboairbrush/video/7573029017184488725" data-video-id="7573029017184488725" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@jboairbrush" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jboairbrush?refer=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@jboairbrush</a> <p>HERE IT IS!!

"Sonic is so cute and Knox just fell in love with it. All summer he was running around the house in Sonic costumes, thinking he's super fast. Sonic and Knuckles are red and blue, Columbus colors, so it was perfect."</p><p>Merzlikins said his son "gave him shit" that Knuckles isn't featured more prominently on the mask.</p>

<p>He entrusted the mask to Jordon Bourgeault, an airbrush artist from Calgary who is known for his highly detailed, vivid artstyle. Bourgeault started painting goalie masks as a hobbyist, decorating the gear of local beer league goalies or kids.&nbsp; But he broke into the NHL when Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price messaged him on Instagram around 2020 asking for a biomechanical skull mask. "It blew up," Bourgeault said. Now, he paints goalie masks for the likes of the Carolina Hurricanes' Frederik Andersen, the Canadiens' Samuel Montembeault, the New Jersey Devils' Jacob Markström, and, yes, Merzlikins.</p><p>Merzlikins said it was Bourgeault's idea to mix the movie with the 16-bit style of the classic video games. It was a huge challenge to render both styles in airbrush, Bourgeault said. (Merzlikins said he didn't play the classic Sonic video games. "I remember my brother playing it, but obviously he never let me play—I couldn't even touch the thing," he said.) The process of painting goalie masks in this way requires a ton of preplanning; Bourgeault begins by designing a mask on an iPad before making stencils that are used to mask off the mask. Painting happens in layers, then the stencils are pulled back, and more layers are painted. "It was a lot of stenciling and using a vinyl cutter to do all those little squares," Bourgeault said, noting that he had help from his assistant, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ink.x.air/?hl=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chris Moniz</u></a>. "For the little characters, like Robotnic and the little Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails on there, I did those with a brush because it was so small."</p><p>It took about a month, he said, and he usually charges around $7,500 for a painted mask.</p><p>"Looking at the details, how he painted it, I would lose my mind," Merzlikins said. "I would have thrown the helmet against the wall. I wouldn't have the patience—all the little squares. It's amazing. He has unbelievable talent in his work. It's my favorite. I've really fallen in love with it. Now when I get [a] puck in the head, I feel bad for it."</p><p>Beyond the tape jobs on skaters' sticks, goalies are unique in that they're allowed a variation in their uniforms with their goalie masks. It's long been a way for goalies to express themselves on the ice—to both share a bit of themselves with fans and to hold important imagery close to themselves during a game. Merzlikins said the art he chooses for his goalie masks is very important to him: "I've always been into the art," he said. "Hockey masks are really important—I collect them. It's always been something personal. As a goalie, I always wear it, and on the backplate, I have all my family and people closest to me with me, so they're always there with me on the ice."</p><p>Featured prominently on the backplate of his mask, Merzlikins also has a tribute to his late teammates and friends Johnny Gaudreau, who was struck and killed in 2024 by a drunk driver while cycling, and Matiss Kivlenieks, who died in a fireworks accident in 2021. "I think it's a cool tribute to have them with me on the ice always," Merzlikins said.</p><p>Merzlikins also has the names of his two children, and a rendition of Bubbles from <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> for his wife. There's the Latvian flag, too.</p><p>In past years, Merzlikins donned a mask with a <em>Minecraft</em> version of Elvis Presley, but like Sonic, he doesn't play the game. But he described himself as a big gamer. "I bring PlayStation with me on the road," he said. "I had a suitcase where inside was a screen and a PlayStation." Now with two kids, one of whom is just over a year old, Merzlikins doesn't have as much time to play video games, but he said he likes to play both <em>Call of Duty</em> and the NHL games. (But he doesn't play as himself: "Not Columbus, because you want to have a different taste in the video game," he laughed.)</p><p>As a father, Merzlikins said he's been eager for his son to be old enough to play video games with him. Speaking from Detroit on a team roadtrip, Merzlikins said his wife had his son play <em>Mario Kart</em>—and he loved it. "When I get home, that's going to be the very first thing," he said. "I was always waiting for the moment where I can play video games with my son, and I hope that moment is now, because she said he loved <em>Mario Kart</em>."</p><p>That, and presenting his son with some gifts that the Sega team and Sonic actor Ben Schwartz reached out with. Someone from the official Sonic the Hedgehog Instagram account messaged Merzlikins, he said, and offered to send some gifts over. Schwartz, too, reached out after seeing the mask and said he's going to send a voice recording for Knox. He told his son about the gifts over a Facetime message: "He was like, 'Daddy, Sonic is watching you! Sonic is going to your hockey games. He's going to come to my house and I'll show him my room.'" Unfortunately, Merzlikins had to tell him Sonic was too busy doing Sonic the Hedgehog things—but that he'd still say hi.</p>

		<p>PIONER is going to be launching into Steam Early Access on December 16th, GFAGames has confirmed following the game’s open beta. Those who purchase the PIONER Deluxe Edition will get three weapon skins, a creepy keychain accessory, a Founder title, the Renegade outfit, and the Katana watch accessory. Those who took part in the open beta will also get the “Combat Classic” weapon skin and 200 Efritan Crystals.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Together" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ZDY7I4VS70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When the PIONER open beta ended, GFAGames did state that there would be a further stress test to address the issues and bugs that players experienced. In a statement at the time, the team said, <em>“The test build contained several critical issues, and we acknowledge that more thorough pre-testing would have resulted in a smoother experience. It is undoubtedly our responsibility to ensure player comfort.&nbsp;<wbr>We will not promise quick fixes, nor will we announce new content until these fundamental issues are resolved. Our top priority is to use the data gathered during testing to ensure the game runs stably at release.&nbsp;<wbr>Work on fixes continues with doubled effort. Thank you for staying with us and helping us make PIONER better.”</em></p>
<p>PIONER is an MMO FPS that has both PvE and PvP gameplay, with players free to spend as much time in either. On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. However, to survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand.</p>

		<p>StarRupture will be having a co-op playtest running from December 3rd to December 8th, Creepy Jar has announced. The co-op playtest will run continuously through these dates so players can try out what is on offer as much as they want. There is also no NDA so everything can be shared, and joining the StarRupture playtest is as simple as heading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/">StarRupture Steam page</a> and clicking the request access button.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture Co-op Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZDfmyjbHKWw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Creepy Jar has stated that the those who choose to play the StarRupture playtest will give acces to an early part of the game, the single player tutorial, and a free play option which will give limited access to StarRupture’s map. Bugs have been addressed since the July single player playtest, and performance has also been improved. Creepy Jar also wants players to not worry about spoilers as plenty of content is being held back for its Early Access release.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>

<p>StarRupture will launch on January 6th, 2026 into Steam Early Access.</p>

Default game profiles also apply to titles like <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>,<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-z-flip-7-makes-zero-profit-play-samsung-sells-foldable-cheaper-than-its-own-galaxy-s25-2000647217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-z-flip-7-makes-zero-profit-play-samsung-sells-foldable-cheaper-than-its-own-galaxy-s25.1364320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 has become the phone that style enthusiasts actively desire and creates excitement in ways that standard flagship phones simply cannot match. The <strong>compact clamshell form factor</strong> when folded delivers visual impact that surpasses even iPhone’s polished design language, and transforms phones from utilitarian tools into fashion statements.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/">$899 for the 256GB model, down from $1,099</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/">$1,019 for the 512GB version, down from $1,219</a>, both configurations have hit record-low prices on Amazon for Black Friday that undercut traditional premium flagships. This seventh-generation foldable now costs less than many conventional flagship phones and delivers Samsung’s most refined folding experience yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5928/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual Display System</h2>
<p>The<strong> large 6.9-inch internal Dynamic AMOLED 2X display</strong> unfolds to reveal a proper smartphone screen running at 2520 x 1080 resolution with 120Hz adaptive refresh that shifts smoothly between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the content. This primary display boasts HDR10+ for vibrant colors, going up to a peak brightness of 2600 nits that ensures perfect readability even in direct sunlight when its competitors all wash out completely. The<strong> external 4.1-inch Super AMOLED cover screen</strong> is a significant evolution from earlier tiny external screens, offering real utility for notification checking, music control, taking selfies, and running widgets without opening the phone. This cover display <strong>boasts a 1048 x 948 resolution and a matching 120Hz refresh</strong> for smooth interactions that make quick tasks possible without the unfolding ritual that earlier Flips required for everything.</p>



<p>The<strong> Samsung Exynos 2500 processor is built on an advanced 3nm manufacturing process</strong> and brings flagship performance with 10 cores that include high-performance Cortex-X5 cores reaching 3.3GHz. In practice, this processing power takes on-demand games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without experiencing the thermal throttling or battery drain seen by earlier foldables that tried to pack flagship specs into severely constrained thermal envelopes.</p>
<p>This <strong>includes a dual-camera system with a 50MP main sensor featuring optical stabilization and 12MP ultra-wide</strong> captures for stunning photos that easily rival traditional flagship cameras, notwithstanding the engineering constraints of fitting quality optics into a folding form factor. Meanwhile, the f/1.8 aperture lets in substantial light for excellent performance in low light, while optical stabilization ensures sharp handheld shots even in challenging conditions. The ultra-wide lens captures expansive landscapes and group photos without the distortion that ruins cheaper implementations. <strong>Video recording tops out at 4K at 60fps</strong>, with enhanced stabilization for smooth footage when walking or shooting actively.</p>



<p>A <strong>4300mAh battery capacity represents an upgrade over past generations</strong> while an efficient 3nm processor and adaptive display refresh come together to deliver all-day battery life through typical usage patterns. The 25W wired charging replenishes the battery relatively fast, though it lags some competitors that offer 65W or faster. The 15W wireless charging offers cable-free convenience, and the reverse wireless charging lets you top up the Galaxy Buds or another Qi-compatible device just by placing it on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>For less than the traditional premium phone price, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 manages to deliver unique folding design, dual 120Hz displays, flagship Exynos 2500 performance, capable cameras and all-day battery life at this record Black Friday price on Amazon. Samsung’s seventh-generation refinement eliminates the compromises that made earlier foldables feel experimental rather than practical daily drivers.</p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="692">Ultra-fast Scrolling</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="692" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The Logitech MX Master 3S gaming mouse makes use of MagSpeed scrolling. It’s fast, precise, and near silent. You can scroll up to 1,000 lines in one second, easily.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="692" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Do note that this is a Bluetooth Edition of the gaming mouse.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally X Is Good, But Has Issues</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Other improvements as part of the Xbox-branded handheld update are faster loading for your games library and "improved gamepad response after login." In addition, Microsoft and Asus have teased future tweaks for the devices. They want to enhance "sleep and wake reliability" as well as add AI-powered automatic super resolution, for instance. Additionally, next week the plan is to introduce a game-save-sync indicator so you know when your progress is properly stored in the cloud to use on another system.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Asus stated that it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-to-ramp-up-rog-xbox-ally-production-after-initial-sales-exceed-expectations/1100-6536270/">ramping up production on ROG Xbox Ally handhelds</a> after the devices exceeded expectations.
