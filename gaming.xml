            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-is-a-massive-leap-forward-delivering-better-image-quality-than-fsr-3-dlss-with-cnn-model.1126026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4 is a big leap forward for the upscaling tech, delivering better image quality than its previous iteration despite not reaching the same quality as NVIDIA DLSS 4 with the new Transformer model, according to a new comparison shared today.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared their first look at the new iteration of AMD's upscaling technology, the first to be powered by machine learning and exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs. In terms of performance, AMD FSR 4 is heavier than FSR 3, as seen in the Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart opening sequence, where FSR 4 is around 8% slower than average using the settings at the Performance preset. The performance cost, however, is well worth it, according to Digital Foundry, as the new version of the tech addresses every major image quality issue of its predecessor, such as particle effects, which no longer sport massive ghosting, transparent surfaces, which show detail that was lost with FSR 3, quality of objects of low relative motion, which now sport improved surface detail. The biggest leap, however, is with complex motions, where AMD FSR 4 blows the previous iterations of the upscaler out of the water.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 isn't just a massive leap forward from previous iterations of the upscaler but also delivers better image quality than NVIDIA DLSS with the older CNN model in certain scenarios, such as with objects at rest or low velocity, where AMD's tech resolves more detail. Compared to DLSS with the new Transformer model, however, AMD FSR 4 falls short, as NVIDIA's tech clearly does a better job at resolving detail. With objects in motion, however, AMD FSR 4 is comparable to the CNN model, which is an amazing result considering how much FSR 3 lagged behind DLSS in terms of visual quality, providing RX 9000 series GPUs owners with a solid upscaling solution.</p>
<p><iframe title="AMD FSR 4 Upscaling Tested vs DLSS 3/4 &amp; - A Big Leap Forward - RDNA 4 Delivers!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzomNQaPFSk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As mentioned above, AMD FSR 4 is exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs, which include the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. You can learn how the two GPUs bring value back to the 4K and 1440p segments by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-rdna-4-gpu-rasterization-raytracing-performance-preview/">performance preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/construction-simulator-studio-astragon-reveals-seafarer-the-ship-sim.1126020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>studio Astragon has announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, and as the title suggests, it'll put you in command of your very own ship.</p>

<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5,&nbsp;<em>Seafarer&nbsp;</em>promises to do for maritime simulation what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-to-work-in-construction-simulator-this-september" rel="nofollow"><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>did for, well, construction</a>. Astragon describes the game as a "fully interactive ship experience" with a variety of missions and two different game modes to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Story Mode, you'll take on "unique missions" and receive rewards from different factions. You might be transporting cargo one minute, then fighting fires on open waters the next. Astragon is even promising treasure retrieval missions, which...well, who hasn't dreamt of that at some point?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=4dkITpVZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=aauKboA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>promises "breathtaking visuals" and a variety of missions.</figcaption></figure><p>If you don't fancy taking on missions, though, you can always hop into&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>'s Quick Play mode, in which you can simply sail around to your heart's content without anyone telling you what to do.</p>

<p>You won't just be piloting one type of ship, either. Astragon is promising a variety of different ships, "from small tugboats to gigantic freighters", so you'll be able to get a sense of what it's like to sail ships big and small.</p>

<p>The game will offer a variety of different tasks to complete, as well. You won't just be sailing your ship; you'll also have to operate machinery and even use water cannons to put out fires.</p>

<p>If you're expecting ship combat from&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, though, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very much not a pirate sim, nor is it an arcade-style ship battler; it's an Astragon simulation through and through, by the looks of things.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582140/Seafarer_The_Ship_Sim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/seafarer-the-ship-sim-bbbc39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this summer. It'll set you back $24.99 and will be an Early Access release to begin with.</p>

Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p><p>While there’s no new release date for the console versions (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497">PC comes out March 6</a></span>), players on those platforms will get some free rewards for the inconvenience. All would-be PS5 and Xbox players will get all in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience points, and more that they would have earned during season 1 if they’d played at launch. No grinding involved! Those who pre-ordered the game on those platforms, meanwhile, will get an extra $10 in in-game currency when the game goes live there. Hopefully the game’s not dead by that point. </p><p>If you’re sitting here asking yourself what the hell is <em>FragPunk</em>, well, it’s a very colorful, very pretty-looking multiplayer PvP FPS <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786">announced back at Microsoft’s summer showcase last year</a></span>. Players collect cards that change how they play every round. “Cards can amplify your jump height, reverse the roles of attackers and defenders, engulf your bullets in flame or turn them into chain lightning, and even may resurrect you and your team,” reads the Steam page description. </p><p>It sounds neat, but also looks very much like “another one of those.” Weirdly, this potential also-ran is another NetEase game, which means that in addition to going up against an already crowded multiplayer field consisting of everything from <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Valorant</em> and <em>The Finals</em>, <em>FragPunk</em> is also going up against NetEase’s own <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, another free-to-play hero shooter that’s just three months old. Maybe <em>FragPunk</em> was the Chinese publisher’s backup plan if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> didn’t hit. </p><p>But it did, so hopefully <em>FragPunk</em> can still find some room to breathe at launch, at least so it can survive long enough for console players to give it a shot while its potential community is still thriving. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

up their Guardian in Bungie's other live-service title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon was first announced via a teaser trailer released during the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase, but players haven't caught many glimpses of the upcoming shooter since its initial announcement. No official release date has been announced, and many players expect that it will launch sometime in 2026. But the discovery of the preorder bonuses has some players beginning to wonder if the game might launch sooner than that.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know for sure is that Marathon is a multiplayer-only first-person PvP extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. Player-characters are known as Runners--which makes sense when you consider the name of the game itself--but overall, details about the game are currently sparse. However, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" rel="nofollow ">Marathon's Steam page</a> does give players a slightly clearer picture of what it means to be a Runner.</p><p dir="ltr">"You are a cybernetic mercenary venturing into the unknown in a fight for survival and fortune where any run can lead to greatness," the game's Steam description reads.</p><p>For more information on Bungie's next live-service title--which is currently available to wishlist on Steam--check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">everything we know about Marathon</a>.</p>

                <p>PlayStation has conducted another round of layoffs, this time impacting the Visual Arts team as well its Malaysian studios.</p><p>Several now-former employees of PlayStation have taken to LinkedIn to share that they've been let go. The roles include lighting, material, environmental, and animation artists.

He said, "It was a tough start of the week for us at PlayStation Studios - Visual Arts. There was a wave of workforce reduction and unfortunately I'm no longer part of the brand."</p><p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, those impacted were working on recently canceled projects such as the one from Days Gone developer Bend Studio. However, the cuts reportedly reached further than that and affected those who also worked on internal art and technical support for PlayStation's first-party studios.</p><p>PlayStation cut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/" data-ref-id="1100-6521383">900 jobs last year, as well as closed its London Studio.</a> Over the last several years, PlayStation greenlit a live-service initiative that seemingly hasn't gone as well as planned.

When the clock strikes midnight on 20th March here in the UK, the console version of the game will become available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The PC version unlocks two hours earlier on PC via Ubisoft Connect (that's 10pm on the 19th March) or slightly later at 4am on the 20th if you're on Steam.

<p>
Xbox fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j43ro9/assassins_creed_shadows_global_release_timings/">discussing the launch timings over on reddit</a> have spotted that the game - as with many - will be available first to those in New Zealand. Do with that information what you will. 
</p>
<p>
And finally today, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">comments made by Ubisoft</a> surrounding the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows for Steam Deck have been doing the rounds. The publisher noted last month that the game won't initially be compatible with Valve's handheld due it being below the game's minimum specs - although did not rule out this changing in future.
</p>
<p>
"At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck," Ubisoft said, "due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC."
</p>
<p>Our Katharine recently went hands-on with the game for six hours, and said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Over the years, Sony have had many beta programs for the various services and games but now they have decided to streamline the process and have one beta program for everything: games, system updates, even the PlayStation App.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to introduce the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative, ” said Sid Shurman on the<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/"> PlayStation Blog</a>. “It’s an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up to participate in future PlayStation betas across a wide range of PlayStation experiences. “</p>


<p>“The Beta Program at PlayStation will create an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas. A single registration for Beta Program at PlayStation will allow you to express interest in gaining beta access to test participating games for the PS5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on PlayStation.com. You only need to sign up once to express interest in these various betas, and if you receive an invitation to a specific beta, it’s up to you to decide whether you’d like to participate or not.”</p>
<p>There are a few requirements before you sign up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid account for PlayStation Network in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible for participation.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where Beta Program at PlayStation is available.</li>
<li>Players must meet the legal age requirement for their region.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get a pass for all of those you can head to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/">playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/&nbsp;</a>and sign up. Please note that the beta program may not be available in all countries.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/humble-games-showcase-announced-for-next-week-new-game-reveals-confirmed.1125969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-showcase-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie publisher Humble Games has announced that it's hosting a new Humble Games Showcase next week, and it'll feature updates on some of the publisher's upcoming games, plus two brand new titles.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/humble-games-showcase-2025-set-for-march-12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the 2025 Humble Games Showcase will air on March 12th, which is exactly one week today. It'll be available at 12pm Eastern, which works out as 9am Pacific and 5pm GMT.</p>

<p>The showcase will be hosted by content creator and streaming personality <a href="https://www.ashsaidhi.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AshSaidHi</a>, and it's set to feature reveals for a number of games being published by the Humble Games label in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fNsCYaeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=lj5-2SMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>is one of the games that will be featured during next week's Humble Games Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you'll be getting some new info about the Bossa Studios game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>. The developer, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs earlier this month</a>, recently announced it would focus on launching&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>before pivoting towards smaller projects that could be released sooner.</p>

<p>Developer Pocketwatch Games will also unveil new information about stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>, and since both games are yet to get a concrete release date, I wouldn't be surprised if just such a thing were to be announced next week.</p>

<p>We'll also get some more information about the heavily&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>-inspired&nbsp;<em>Threads of Time</em>, as well as a new look at musical 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Billie Bust Up</em>. Updates on recently-released games&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>are also expected.</p>

<p>Lastly, Humble Games says it will reveal two "never-before-seen world premieres", so we'll be getting a look at two brand new Humble Games titles as well. Of course, we'll have to wait for the show to find out what they are.</p>

At that time, it was believed that Humble Games was to shut down, but that demonstrably turned out not to be the case.</p>

<p>The Humble Games Showcase airs on March 12th at 9am Pacific/12am Eastern/5pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>The first Battlefield Labs test, which gives players a chance to try the next Battlefield game, kicks off this week. That's according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-playtest-this-week/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, which said this playtest will let players try out "concepts and mechanics" when it begins on March 7.</p><p>This is an extremely limited test, it seems, as only a small selection of players will get to take part and the test itself reportedly runs for only two hours. The test is taking place on PC, the report said.</p><p>The Battlefield Labs tests are available by invitation only. Additionally, members are prohibited from recording or sharing footage, or even discussing the test at all. Of course, it's always possible some people choose to disregard these rules--time will tell.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="105913775" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>Marvel Rivals has announced a new, limited-time game mode, Clone Rumble, which will launch on March 7, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble is a new game mode where players must rely on strategy, teamwork and ‘controlled chaos’. Each team will be allowed to select one Hero, and the remaining players must choose between these two. The battlefield will become an “ultimate mirror showdown”, where players will find clones of the same Hero battling each other across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble, players will have to adapt to survive. They need to coordinate with team members using the same Hero to bolster their strength and figure out how to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing Hero. Everyone on the map will use the same Hero and abilities, so efficiency and tactical movements will be key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1896953790915391788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> for Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble provides us with a glimpse of all the chaos that awaits us on March 7. The video starts with a row of 6 Mr. Fantastics marching around the map before they clash with a group of another 6 Reed Richards. We also see a swarm of Punishers wreaking absolute destruction across the map, with turrets popping up in every nook and corner.&nbsp;A new Black Widow skin will also be introduced, called Widow of Timely. It can be claimed through Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure. </p>

                <p>Developer Bad Guitar Studio has announced that it has delayed the PS5 and Xbox releases of Fragpunk due to technical difficulties, though the PC version will still launch tomorrow, March 6. A new release date for the console versions has not been revealed.</p><p>"During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaption," the team said in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>

<p>As consolation, players will receive all rewards gained through engagement from the start of Season 1 until the console versions go live. These include in-game currency, cosmetics, and experience.</p><p>As a result of the delay, the studio has to cancel and refund all preorders on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S due to their platform policies. Those who've already preorder will also receive $10 worth of in-game currency when the console versions launch.</p><p>There are also no longer any preorder bonuses for the console versions either, but the bundle will be available in a limited-time capacity when they're released.</p><p>Fragpunk is a free-to-play new hero shooter that utilizes a card system with various abilities. The card selection changes every round and can be mixed and matched to create some wild combinations. For example, there are cards that can increase your jump height, engulf your bullets in flame, and resurrect your allies.</p><p>Bad Guitar Studio is also a subsidiary of NetEase, which has been mired in controversy lately.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nvidia’s dominance over the latest generation of graphics cards ends today. AMD might have surrendered the high end of the GPU market, but its new $549 Radeon RX 9070 and $599 RX 9070 XT look set to bring Nvidia back to reality, at least in the midrange. </p><p>After a disappointing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/623441/nvidia-rtx-5070-review-test-benchmark">$549 RTX 5070</a>, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/posts/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-review-a-cheaper-rtx-4080/1022046466451493/">$749 RTX 5070 Ti</a> that’s near impossible to buy for anything less than $899, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">$1,999 RTX 5090</a> whose only competition is other Nvidia cards, AMD’s next-gen GPUs look perfectly timed and deliver on performance and price. </p><p>The RX 9070 is around 17 percent faster than Nvidia’s RTX 5070 in 4K without upscaling enabled, cruising past Nvidia’s card for the same price. The RX 9070 XT is as fast as the RTX 5070 Ti for $150 less.</p><p>Pricing is key with these cards, particularly as <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/q324-pc-graphics-add-in-board-shipments-decreased-14-5-from-last-quarter/">only 10 percent</a> of GPU sales right now are from AMD. The company needs a big win with its latest generation of cards if it wants to regain ground from Nvidia, and the RX 9070 series might be just what the GPU market needs.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->549</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>16GB of VRAM</li><li>FSR 4 image quality improvements</li><li>Lower power draw than previous Radeon cards</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No AMD reference design</li><li>Big and bulky card</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->598</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>The $599 price tag</li><li>FSR 4 image quality improvements</li><li>Lower power draw than previous Radeon cards</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>I wish it had a little more VRAM</li><li>No AMD reference design</li><li>Big and bulky card</li></ul></div></div></div><div><p id="hardware"><h2>Hardware</h2></p></div><p>AMD hasn’t created reference cards for the RX 9070 series, so the end result is designs from add-in board partners that look very similar to the ones used for previous generations of Radeon GPUs. The Gigabyte RX 9070 I’ve been testing is longer and bulkier than the RTX 5070.</p><p>The XFX 9070 XT I’ve been testing is also a 3.5-slot card, so it takes up far more space in a case than the two-slot RTX 5080 or 5090 Founders Edition or even the 2.5-slot RTX 5070 Ti card I reviewed. I far prefer the reference designs AMD has used in the past, and the RX 9070-series cards are big and bulky in comparison. AMD has also stuck to using two 8-pin PCIe power connectors with the RX 9070 series, instead of switching to 12VHPWR. It does mean you’ll need to run two PCIe connectors to both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT, but you won’t need to worry about PSU compatibility or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609207/nvidia-rtx-5090-power-connector-melting-burning-issues">risk of a 12VHPWR connector melting</a>.</p><p>Both the RX 9070 and 9070 XT ship with 16GB of VRAM, which is a good amount at these prices. Nvidia only has 12GB of VRAM on its $549 RTX 5070, so you’re certainly getting more value from a $549 RX 9070 here — especially if you’re looking at 4K gaming where VRAM demands are higher.</p><div><p id="1440p-and-4k-benchmarks"><h2><strong>1440p and 4K benchmarks</strong></h2></p></div><div><div><p id="test-machine"><h2>Test machine:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D</span></li><li><span><strong>CPU cooler:</strong> Corsair H150i Elite LCD</span></li><li><span><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Gigabyte Aorus Master</span></li><li><span><strong>RAM:</strong> 32GB G.Skill DDR5-6000</span></li><li><span><strong>Storage:</strong> Samsung 970 Evo Plus 2TB</span></li><li><span><strong>PSU: </strong>Corsair HX1000W</span></li><li><span><strong>Case: </strong>Streacom BC1 V2 open benchtable</span></li></ul></div></div><p>I’ve been testing AMD’s RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards with an AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP. I’ve put the RX 9070 and 9070 XT up against Nvidia’s RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti as well as its existing RX 7900 XT and XTX GPUs. </p><p>I’ve tested a variety of games at both 1440p and 4K, including more demanding titles like <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> and benchmarking favorites like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>. All games have been tested at very high or ultra settings, and I enabled ray tracing in some titles like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em> to see what AMD’s latest GPUs can deliver there.</p><p>The RX 9070 comfortably beats Nvidia’s RTX 5070 at both 4K and 1440p. It’s 17 percent faster at 4K and nearly 20 percent faster at 1440p. It’s not even close. In some games, like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, the RX 9070 is more than 30 percent faster, with or without FSR enabled.</p><p>The $599 RX 9070 XT competes with Nvidia’s $749 RTX 5070 Ti, with an average frame rate difference of less than 1 percent without upscaling across the nine games we tested. The differences between these two cards really come down to the individual games, with the RX 9070 XT less than 5 percent behind the RTX 5070 Ti in titles like <em>Returnal </em>and <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em>.</p><div><p>The RX 9070 comfortably beats Nvidia’s RTX 5070 at both 4K and 1440p</p></div><p>The RX 9070 XT isn’t that far behind AMD’s previous flagship, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499697/amd-radeon-rx-7900-xt-xtx-review-benchmarks-price">$999 RX 7900 XTX</a>, either. I found the XTX was less than 2 percent faster at 4K and 1440p tests without upscaling enabled. That’s a small performance gap, considering the price differences between these cards.</p><p>I think the RX 9070 makes the most sense at 1440p, and the RX 9070 XT is definitely worth the extra $50 if you want to move to 4K gaming. Considering the small price gap, it’s worth paying the extra $50 for better 1440p performance, too. </p><div><p id="fsr-4-and-rdna-4"><h2><strong>FSR 4 and RDNA 4</strong></h2></p></div><p>AMD’s 9000-series GPUs are built on top of the company’s RDNA 4 architecture, which AMD says offers twice the rasterization graphics performance per compute unit as RDNA 2. This new architecture also includes improvements to boost ray-tracing performance.</p><p>In <em>Metro Exodus Enhanced</em> with ultra ray tracing enabled, the RX 9070 XT is nearly 7 percent faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but it’s 4 percent behind the RTX 5070 Ti. Nvidia still reigns supreme in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at 4K with ray tracing and upscaling enabled, though, with the RTX 5070 Ti 16 percent ahead of the RX 9070 XT.</p><p>The RDNA 4 architecture also includes a new version of AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) upscaling, which now uses dedicated AI accelerator hardware to improve frame rates and image quality — much like Nvidia’s DLSS. FSR 4 is exclusive to these new RX 9070 graphics cards, and it works in all games that have FSR 3.1 integrated. All you have to do is flick a switch in the AMD software, and FSR 4 will be enabled automatically in supported games.</p><p>With FSR 4, AMD hasn’t followed Nvidia with Multi Frame Generation, instead focusing on improving image quality in upscaled games. I tested FSR 4 in both <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>The FSR 4 changes are more obvious in </em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, the advances are immediately obvious. The current FSR 3.1 implementation often results in a more soft or blurry image, which is especially noticeable in text on walls or objects that are slightly further away. FSR 4 makes the overall image look a lot sharper and, in some cases, even better than the native 4K output. A police car has a blurry numberplate and logo in FSR 3.1 quality mode. But in FSR 4 quality, it’s upscaled correctly, and the entire car looks a lot sharper as a result. Details on buildings are also more clear, and even enemies look more detailed in motion with FSR 4. And this all comes without a noticeable performance hit, which is great. </p><p>The FSR 4 improvements are less obvious in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and I struggled to notice any difference between FSR 3.1 quality and FSR 4 quality modes. While this might suggest your mileage may vary with FSR 4 quality, I was able to use ultra performance FSR 4 and get surprisingly good visual quality and higher frame rates from the game.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You have to look really closely at rocks to notice FSR 4 improvements in </em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Beyond gaming, the RX 9070 cards are both a lot more capable for AI workloads. In Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test, the RX 9070 XT is more than 40 percent faster than the RX 7900 XTX, but it’s around 20 percent behind the AI performance of the RTX 5070. The RX 9070 is also more than 40 percent faster in the AI XL test over the RX 7900 XT, but the RTX 5070 is nearly 40 percent faster in this AI workload test.</p><p>I normally test video editing capabilities with PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve benchmark, but it gets around 20 percent into the test and crashes on AMD’s GPUs.</p><div><p id="power-draw-and-heat"><h2><strong>Power draw and heat</strong></h2></p></div><p>It’s great to see AMD lower power supply requirements and power draw on its latest Radeon GPUs. AMD recommends a 750-watt power supply for the RX 9070 XT, for its 304 watts of total board power. I’ve found it delivers performance close to the RX 7900 XTX while using 40 watts less power at 4K. The 9070 XT averaged at 303 watts during my tests, while the 7900 XTX averaged 346 watts.</p><p>It’s the same story for the RX 9070. AMD recommends a 650-watt power supply for this card, 100 watts less than the 750-watt recommendation for the 7900 XT. In my tests, the RX 9070 averaged 244 watts, while the 7900 XT averaged more than 25 percent more power draw at 307 watts. That’s a big efficiency improvement, and it’s only 34 more watts of power draw than the RTX 5070 for a noticeable performance gap between these two $549 cards.</p><p>The RX 9070 also hit a maximum temperature of 60 degrees Celsius in my open testbench, compared to 70C for the RX 7900 XT. The RX 9070 XT reached just 55C in my testing, compared to 71C for the RX 7900 XTX. Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Founders Edition card reached 77C in the same tests, with MSI’s Ventus 3 RTX 5070 Ti reaching 68C. </p><p>AMD’s latest generation of Radeon GPUs are more efficient and run cooler than its previous generation, and they also run cooler than Nvidia’s direct competitors. That’s a clear win for AMD.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Nvidia’s new GPUs are big and bulky compared to Nvidia’s sleek Founders Edition cards.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>AMD has priced its RX 9070-series cards really aggressively, particularly with the $599 RX 9070 XT being $150 cheaper than the RTX 5070 Ti. The $549 RX 9070 is the same price as Nvidia’s RTX 5070, but it beats the 5070 in every game I’ve tested, sometimes by a big margin.</p><p>If AMD manages to have these cards in stock at these prices, then it’s going to shake up the important midrange of the GPU market.</p><p>The question is whether it can chip away at Nvidia’s dominance. In addition to (or because of) its 90 percent market share, Nvidia also has an advantage in how many more games support DLSS than FSR. And DLSS is so popular that 80 percent of RTX owners <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344212/nvidias-dlss-is-surprisingly-popular">activate it in games</a>. FSR 4 improves image quality to compete more closely with DLSS, but AMD still needs game developers to implement it. Nvidia lets you simply force DLSS 4 in games, so you don’t need to wait on developers at all.</p><p>The stickiness of DLSS could tempt PC gamers to spend a little more to stay with Nvidia, and I haven’t seen enough from FSR 4 yet to know whether it can compete with the upscaling improvements Nvidia made with DLSS 4.</p><p>Nvidia’s Game Ready Drivers are also an advantage; the company works with developers to optimize drivers for games before they launch, whereas AMD has long had driver issues with a variety of games. I haven’t run into any issues while testing the RX 9070 series, but I can’t promise that will be the case when new games are released. While AMD says it has been working hard on improving its drivers, only time will tell.</p><p>Either way, AMD’s RX 9070-series cards are a clear indication that it’s not giving the entire GPU market to Nvidia. It’s willing to compete on performance and price, and that’s a winning formula if AMD manages to keep those prices under control.</p><p><em>Photography by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This can be done at the glowing Adra stones scattered about the game world, usually within a circle of dirt. Once you place your Camp, there’s a Workbench off to one side that looks more like a small storage tent, complete with a few crates and a small table, where you can spend resources to upgrade the level and stats of most weapons and armor pieces in the game. These levels are:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Common (Green)</strong></li><li><strong>Fine (Blue)</strong></li><li><strong>Exceptional (Purple)</strong></li><li><strong>Superb (Red)</strong></li><li><strong>Legendary (Yellow)</strong></li></ul><figure id="" data-id="54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-recommend-id="image://54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-recommend-id="image://54294ac73da8e863a9fb9203924ecb57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The upgrade screen for a Common Axe in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You click on the weapon in the list, and if it’s lit up white, it means it can be upgraded. In the middle of the screen, you’ll see its stats right now and the stats it’ll reach if you upgrade. Select it, agree to upgrade, and ta-da, it’s now more powerful!</p><p>There’s a catch, however. You can’t upgrade any old weapon you pick up off the ground and expect to walk away with a legendary or unique piece. It doesn’t quite work that way. For all common weapons and armor pieces, the max level is Superb Quality +3, which increases most of the item’s stats by a significant amount. In some cases, you’ll receive an item with over +100 additional damage, so it’s still good! However, if you find a unique weapon, you can upgrade it to Legendary. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-how-to-find-adra-upgrade-equipment-rpg-1851767566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-how-to-find-adra-upgrade-equipment-rpg-1851767566">You’ll require Adra</a></span>, which you can acquire via gold chests, Strangled Adra, and Merchants.</p><figure id="" data-id="2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-recommend-id="image://2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-recommend-id="image://2cbeb23c97096d89bd965c32d9630866" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chest containing upgrade materials loot in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h1513456"><a id=""></a><strong>How to get upgrade materials</strong></h2><p>You have a few options regarding acquiring the necessary upgrade materials in Avowed to keep you fighting toe-to-toe with any of the game’s enemies.

<p>The first Battlefield Labs playtest will start this week, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Battlefield Labs will have its first playtest to test “concepts and mechanics” on Friday March 7th. The playtest will be the first in EA’s new Battlefield Labs program, which was announced earlier this year. The first test is scheduled to take place for approximately two hours on the PC.</p>



<p>According to the email sent to participants, the test is in a “closed test environment” and recording, streaming, and discussions about the game are strictly prohibited. But whether participants stick to such a confidentiality agreement remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Players can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still sign up to the Battlefield Labs</a> in order to try and gain access to future Battlefield playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is said to be EA’s “most ambitious community development collaboration ever, where a select number of fans will step inside the war room.”</p>



<p>Its announcement saw hundreds of thousands of people sign up, with EA assuring players that no matter when you register, you’ll still be as equally eligible to be accepted as those who registered first.</p>



<p>The playtest comes as DICE and EA want to work more closely with the community after Battlefield 2042’s fumbled launch, which was poorly received by the community.</p>



<p>The next Battlefield title is scheduled to release later this year on the Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>Have you already signed up to the Battlefield Labs playtests? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

<p>The release window for Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has seemingly been confirmed by one of the game’s voice actors. </p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, voice actor Khary Payton said that the current plan for the game’s launch is around Christmas time this year.</p>



<p>“We’re still working,” the Black Panther voice actor said. “We’re planning on 2025… We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I’m so excited.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-media-s-fault">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wonder-woman-canceled-and-is-it-the-games-medias-fault/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman Canceled And Is It The Games Media’s Fault?</a></h6>



<p>A Christmas 2025 release is the most definitive information regarding the game that fans have gotten in some time. The game was first revealed during GDC 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-revealed-along-with-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its name and first trailer</a> shown. Since then, however, it’s been quiet on all fronts as the game’s development continues.</p>



<p>Set in occupied Paris during World War II, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is based on the 2010 limited series comic Captain America / Black Panther: Flags of Our Fathers. The story follows an alliance between Black Panther and Captain America as they work to prevent Hydra from coming into power. The game will allow players to control one of four main protagonists throughout, including Captain America Steve Rogers, Azzuri (Black Panther), the leader of the Wakandan Spy Network Nanali, and Howling Commandos member Gabriel Jones.</p>



<p>Neither developer Skydance New Media nor publisher Plaion have commented officially on the game’s release date. Should the Christmas 2025 window be confirmed, it’s likely to happen sometime in the next few months as more gaming events such as Game Developers Conference 2025 and Summer Games Fest 2025 take place.</p>

While that description is especially vague, it's possible the patch relates to renewing the Blu-ray player encryption key for the home console.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/askplaystation/status/1897200775819862327?s=46" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the Ask PlayStation account announced the new PS3 update and pointed players to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">the PlayStation website</a>. Sony says 200MB must be available on the system's hard drive to download version 4.92. The company also then writes in bold about the Blu-ray player encryption key renewal to continue playing discs. The last console patch occurred just over a year ago on February 27, 2024, for version 4.91.</p><p dir="ltr">PS3 launched in Japan and North America in November 2006, followed by a European release in March 2007. Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-3-announced-for-2006/1100-6124681/">unveiled the PS3 at E3 in May 2006</a>, showcasing titles like Metal Gear Solid 4 and Devil May Cry 4 at the event. That means the Sony system will turn 19 years old later this year. In 2012, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-unveils-new-ps3-model/1100-6396730/">redesigned PS3 was released</a>, and ultimately, Sony sold over 87 million units of the home console.</p><p dir="ltr">Just yesterday, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celebrate-the-ps2s-25th-anniversary-with-these-pictures-from-launch-day/1100-6529850/">PS2 celebrated its 25th anniversary</a>, as a Redditor shared photos of traveling to Japan to buy the system.

            <p>The Humble bundle building team has detailed its March Choice collection of games, which includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau and Wild Hearts, to name three.</p>
<p>The Humble Choice subscription offering provides a monthly set of PC games which members claim to own forever. This month, members can get their hands on the following titles as part of their Humble subscription:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pacific Drive</li>
<li>Homeworld 3</li>
<li>Wild Hearts</li>
<li>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</li>
<li>Gravity Circuit</li>
<li>Sir Whoopass: Immortal Death</li>
<li>Racine</li>
<li>Cavern of Dreams</li>

<p>As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month, the company's cause of choice is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndhXaZ17iXY">Care.org</a>, a leading humanitarian organisation fighting global poverty.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>
<p>So, what of the games themselves? Well, if you are yet to give Pacific Drive a go, I fully recommend you try out the driving survival game, which invites players to explore the Olympic Exclusion Zone in a station wagon. This wagon is more than just your car, however. It is your companion on a bumpy and rather extraordinary road, complete with strange phenomena and surreal events all thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>Our Chris called the whole experience an "exhausting, oddly lovable nightmare" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">Eurogamer's Pacific Drive review</a>, awarding it four out of five stars. "A punishing, exhasperating slog, or an off-beat love story between driver and car, human and the Zone? Pacific Drive is both and then some," he wrote.</p>

<p>Another highlight included in this month's Choice bundle is Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which Eurogamer also awarded four stars. "What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," our Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you have seen all the chatter about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> recently but aren't ready to purchase it for yourself, Wild Hearts is worth checking out. Our Matt gave the game his recommendation in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wild-hearts-review-monster-hunters-formula-taken-to-fantastic-new-heights">Eurogamer's Wild Hearts review</a>, writing: "Far more than just a Monster Hunter clone, Wild Hearts exceeds expectations and then some, mixing streamlined action with inventive new toys."</p>
