			<p>Open world racing games of the last decade have become inextricably linked with slot machines, making it feel like each race, level-up and achievement gleefully spits out a new car for you to deposit at the back of your garage and ignore once that fleeting dopamine high has disappeared. If other open-world racers have players sat on stools amidst rows of one-arm bandits, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> wants to take you back to the more refined and exclusive blackjack tables where you have to earn what you win.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9zL-tKG2Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s the key defining factor between Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown and a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew</a>. Your car collection is intentionally constrained, you’re pushed to spend more time with your starter car and slowly upgrade it to be more and more competitive in the early races, working your way up to be able to afford something in the next category. Hypercars are aspirational prizes here that you won’t have until much, much later in the game.</p>


<p>Built around the impossible invitational road racing competition of the Solar Crown – so powerful and lucrative that it can clear the Hong Kong streets for its sanctioned races, and can hand you an AI-powered contact lens as you step out of the quadcopter – you aim to gradually build up your car collection, and to work your way up through the ranks of one of the two racing clans: the Streets and the Sharps.</p>
<p>It’s an appealing conceit for those who pine for games of yesteryear, though the actual gameplay loop will still feel very familiar. The fundamentals are still to head out into the open world and take on the limited selection of races and time trials that have been doled out to you, blaze through high-speed traps, and that’s pretty much it. There is a race variant called Domination, which is all about earning points for your positioning as you pass each checkpoint, but it doesn’t really lead to more topsy turvy races.</p>


<p>Racing is generally fun, and some events can be really rather challenging and rewarding if you’re in the car performance sweet spot – cars do feel nicely distinct too, even if we’re a good bit short of a simcade experience. However, things do suffer when you’re low on grip. The AI drivers don’t handle tight turns and wet or gravel racing particularly well, and honestly, given how it feels to turn on gravel, I don’t blame them too much for that. Strange, given <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/wrc-generations-review/">KT Racing’s rally game lineage</a>.</p>
<p>The world is broken up into multiple regions, and the opening hours will take you to the three main chunks of city on the northern side of the island, each giving you one batch of events at a time, before you eventually unlock off-road vehicles and can explore the middle. It’s deliberately slow, and there’s a bit of grind and repetition as you need to hit Reputation milestones before a new region is unlocked, and even to unlock better car upgrades. There is a further sprinkling of events as you join a clan, can challenge its leaders after meeting their Rep requirements, and more, but it’s another area that the game keeps things reigned in.</p>

<p>Having a 1:1 recreation of Hong Kong Island is quite simply fantastic, though. Comparing it to maps, certain tweaks and changes have been made to accommodate certain game landmarks, and most likely with turning hiking trails into car-worthy tracks, but it’s a largely faithful recreation, and there’s a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> about real roads compared to fictionalised and more heavily adapted ones. There’s a mundanity in places, some congested sprawl and single-way passages, and the general size of the city along the top of the island feels true to reality.</p>
<p>However, it also doesn’t feel like a real city in other ways. Traffic is obviously never going to hit the same level as in reality – honestly, we don’t want traffic jam simulator – but I feel like Burnout Paradise and PS3/360 era Need for Speed games have more cars clogging up traffic lights and road. Maybe my memory is wrong on that comparison, but more traffic, more life in Solar Crown would have been great to see. That also extends to the actual buildings as well. There’s a lot of recreated landmarks and features sprinkled across the island, but there’s also&nbsp;generic shop fronts and tower block fascias that don’t have quite the same diversity that you can see in Street View.</p>
<p>A lot of that homogeneity is masked when driving at night, the world coming to life under artificial light and the reflections in the cars really popping.</p>

<p>Regardless of the game’s merits, the experience is being let down on the technical side of things. The launch for premium edition early access was heavily disrupted by server issues, and while KT Racing and Nacon have sought to shore up their servers for the full launch, that’s a risk to occur again this weekend. Is always online play truly necessary? It certainly speaks to the game’s ethos, but I can’t say I’ve really missed out only playing against CPU drivers and occasionally one other player. It is bizarre that there’s no cross-play, though.</p>
<p>More disappointing is the visual and performance quality. Performance mode on PS5 struggles to hold onto 60FPS, and while it’s sometimes down to lots of activity with a bunch of cars on screen, it seems to also be triggered by things like clattering through scenery, turning lampposts into physics objects. This could be a CPU bottleneck, which is potentially more difficult to fix.</p>

<p>There’s also some image quality oddities and clear compromises to get things performing well enough on console. There’s a persistent shimmering white reflection (for want of a better term) from the rear bumper of your car and tyres in third person view, and in the cockpit view the edges around your windows are distractingly untinted. World lighting seemingly comes from below, as your car and character have the undersides of limbs and edges illuminated in pre and post-race scenes, and the artificial glow makes brighter car colours just look a bit odd. Then there’s things like the awfully half-rate and smeared rear view mirror.</p>
<p>It’s far from a technical powerhouse, and we hope that KT Racing can improve this showing, though the issues depend on your platform. On PC, it seems to hang together that bit better, though it is overly demanding of my Ryzen 5900X and Radeon RX 6800 rig. Meanwhile, the Xbox version, even outside of server issues for last week’s Early Access launch, has presented us with several game crashes halting any desire to continue with that platform before it’s been patched. Factor this in with your buying decision.</p>

<p>There is something to Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, though. Again, the overall structure remains appealing, and there’s moments at night where it looks rather good. It just needs time and effort to continue to grown and improve. KT Racing has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-year-1-roadmap-has-a-surprise-trip-to-ibiza/">an Ibiza map for later this year</a>, and some returning features through 2025. There’s also plenty of fan requests for things like buying real estate, broader missions outside of races and time trials&nbsp;–&nbsp;in other words, some more distinct thematic events and features from previous games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/altered-tcg-review-world-of-potential<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the stellar release of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, the&nbsp;<em>One Piece TCG</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a>&nbsp;over the past few years - it feels like we're in something of a modern Renaissance for trading card games. So it's into a semi-crowded market that newcomer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.altered.gg/"><em>Altered</em></a>&nbsp;emerges - promising to shake up the genre through what they call a "Phygital" gaming experience combining a tabletop game with digital card collecting.&nbsp;Asmodee Games sent me a copy of two of the game's starter decks to review, so let's jump head-first into the wild world of&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;and see what it's all about!</p>
<h2>What Is the <em>Altered</em> TCG?</h2>
<p>Produced by <a href="https://www.equinox.fr/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Equinox</a>&nbsp;games out of France, and distributed by Asmodee, <i>Altered&nbsp;</i>is a trading card game with a digital collection aspect to it. <em>Altered</em>&nbsp;initially turned heads by being the highest grossing Kickstarter ever for a Trading Card Game, and is just now hitting store shelves after getting into the hands of some (if not all) backers. Perhaps inspired partly by the now-on-it's-way-out idea of NFT ownership, each card in&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;has a QR code on it, which you can scan to log your ownership of that specific card on the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Trading Card Game,&nbsp;<em>Altered&nbsp;</em>is comprised of a set of cards which all fall into six different factions (each color coded like most other popular TCG's). Along with Starter Sets (which I used in the creation of this review), players can also obtain cards of varying rarity by opening booster packs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-cards.jpg?itok=LENFUPbl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-cards.jpg?itok=zyiTV71z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yzmir, one of the six factions of the game, are all about magic and mysticism.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>?</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>, two (or more - there are alternate play modes for 3 or 4 players) players face off against each other in a race of exploration. In an attempt to move away from the combat and conflict of most other modern Trading Card Games (even in&nbsp;<em>Lorcana</em>, Winnie the Pooh can deal significant damage to Aladdin),&nbsp;<em>Altered</em> is all about discovering new and magical lands.</p>
<p>To play the game, each player builds a deck (or uses a pre-built Starter Deck like I did for this review) of 40 cards, including one Hero card. Each player then takes a Hero marker and a Companion marker, and puts them on either end of an adventure track. To win the game, one player has to be the first to make their two markers meet.</p>
<p>You'll do this by playing cards from your deck that feature characters, and each character is played into an Expedition field either on the side of your hero or the side of your companion. If at the end of the phase, the players check the power of their characters in relation to where there marker is, and if they outpace their opponent, then advance their marker accordingly. So as not to get too lost in the details of the game here, I highly recommend curios gamers <a href="https://www.altered.gg/en-us/the-game/how-to-play" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out their How To Play page</a>.</p>

<p>To test out the game, I was sent a batch of booster packs and two Starter Decks belonging to the Yzmir and Lyra factions. I've saved the boosters for future coverage, because I think focusing on just these Starters will be more useful and instructive. But what do I mean when I say Yzmir and Lyra starter decks?</p>
<p>There are six different factions in the game, and players must build a deck around one singular faction. Those factions include: Axiom, who are the mechanics and engineers of this world. They create machines and devices that help them achieve victory. Bravos are the athletic adventurers, who prioritize speed and gusto to win. Muna are the naturalistic promoters of balance and harmony, relying on nature to plants to acheive their goals. Ordis, the embodiment of the state, using diplomacy and rhetoric.</p>
<p>And then there are the two factions of which I received Starter Decks, Lyra and Yzmir.&nbsp; Lyra are the wandering artists and creators, and they rely on chance and creativity to explore their world. They are full of painters, artists, gamblers, and risk takers, and their Starter Deck involves a lot of dice rolling and risk taking. The Lyra Hero Ability (each deck needs to have a hero card and a special ability you can use once per round) allows you to roll a die, with most rolls giving you some advantage, but a 1 effectively eliminating your card for the turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-hero.jpg?itok=44Hqu9s9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-hero.jpg?itok=XedGOlRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Yzmir Hero's ability allows her to pass the turn to gain more information.</figcaption></figure><p>Yzmir, the mystical and magical faction, focuses on trickery and manipulation, with spells that can remove your opponent's cards. The Yzmir hero ability also allows you to pass priority to your opponent to wait and have as much information as possible. I'll speak to why this matters in a moment, but suffice it to say of the two Starter Decks this was certainly the more complicated (though nothing in this game is overly complicated, which makes it such a delight to play).</p>
<h2>How Does&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;Gameplay Feel?</h2>
<p>The gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;feels unlike any other Trading Card Game I've ever played before. A game runs extremely fast, with each player racing to make their character and companion tokens meet in the middle of an adventure track. The game also has a "Do one thing, then your opponent does one thing, then you do one thing, etc." turn order in a phase, just like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em>, which adds to a sense of fun, light tension as you wait to see what your opponent is going to do.</p>
<p>Also like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em>'s Space and Ground theaters of battle, the game takes place in two different expedition zones. Knowing when and where to play a card is essential to progressing your markers, because your opponent will quickly outrace you if you focus on just one section.</p>
<p>Also, as alluded to above, this is why Yzmir's special Hero ability (and cards that replicate it) is so potent, because you're essentially passing a turn to force your opponent to make a move (normally when you pass your turn, you end your turns for the entire phase).</p>
<h2><em>Altered&nbsp;</em>Artwork and World Building</h2>
<p>The world and story of&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;seems to still be in the process of being fleshed out, but it is a world that - most exciting of all the game's aspects - is all about adventure and positivity. There's nothing violent in the game, and no one's fighting one another. You're simply out exploring both your world and the magical realm that's bleeding into it, and the gameplay feels like a friendly footrace between two explorers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-multiple-cards-in-factions.jpg?itok=4N4JR9nq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-multiple-cards-in-factions.jpg?itok=xrKd5s_Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some cards in the Altered TCG have multiple versions for play in different factions!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a joy that's felt throughout the cards and gameplay that I haven't seen in many other games, and hopefully that will translate to a pleasant, good-natured player base! With bright and evocative artwork throughout, and cards pulling in characters from mythology, history, and storytelling, this is a family friendly world of creativity and adventure.</p>
<h2><em>Altered&nbsp;</em>Digital Elements</h2>
<p>The one area where I feel the game's currently lacking is in the digital aspect, but that's to be expected of a brand new game. They're billing this game as a "Phygital" card game (what a term, haha) where digital and physical cards and trading blend. And the ideas and promises they're making on that front are truly outside the box.</p>
<p>There's going to be a print-on-demand service, where you can use Foiler cards to turn cards in your collection into foils (and get them printed and sent to you). There's also going to be a marketplace, where you can trade cards with other players. Each card has a QR code on it, which you'll scan to mark yourself as the owner of the card. And you can currently try the game on Board Game Arena - I believe the idea is to eventually be able to import your collection into this or another online service, and play with your collection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-digital-marketplace.jpg?itok=g_SJEA4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-digital-marketplace.jpg?itok=WQvNDMgd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Altered</em> TCG digital marketplace is currently still in the works at the time of this writing</figcaption></figure><p>While I'm so excited to see where the tech progresses for&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>, right now it feels a little clunky. It can also take a long time to scan in each card, but I can't think of an easier way that they could do bulk imports. There's a ton of elements of the app marked as "Coming Soon," and I can't fairly judge the entire Digital element of the game until everything's up and running. So for now, mark me down as cautiously optimistic that this could be a really engaging aspect of the game, but right now it's not running at full capacity.</p>
<h2><em>Altered TCG&nbsp;</em>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Even though the digital aspects of the game aren't yet functioning at the level the designers have promised, this is a&nbsp;<em>brand new&nbsp;</em>game. Maybe I'll follow up with an additional review of the digital elements when I feel enough time has passed for them to be working properly (though one would hope they'd be good to go at launch).</p>
<p>But let's talk about what really matters to me: the gameplay.&nbsp;<em>Altered&nbsp;</em>is, hands-down, one of the most unique and engaging Trading Card Game experiences I've had in a long time. Gameplay is super simple to understand but rewards strategy, timing, and tactics. The artwork is bright, bold, and evocative. The setting is charming and non-violent. It's all like a breath of fresh air, and I hope it gains traction and excitement among TCG players.</p>
<p>This is something special, and definitely worth your time. If you're interested in trying out a new approach to TCG's, I highly recommend you pick up a few Starter Sets to see what it's all about.</p>

            <p>
If you're looking for something to sink your teeth into this weekend (apologies), you could do far worse than take a look at developer Stunlock Studios' acclaimed vampire survival adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> - which is free to play on Steam for the next few days.
</p>
<p>
V Rising launched back in May after two years of Steam early access development, presenting players (and their equally elegant friends) with a rich, more-ish game of isometric survival, where the goal is to assert your vampiric superiority across a gloomy, gothic open-world.
</p>
<p>
It's got a bunch of neats twists on the survival formula, all playing into the whole vampire <em>thing</em> - including a blood-sucking mechanic that gives you specific abilities depending on the creatures you drain, and progress that involves sticking to the shadows during daylight hours (lest you sizzle to ash). Its most exciting feature, though, is that you get to building your own looming gothic castle - and who hasn't ever wished they had one of those?

<p>
"V Rising is one of the most generous survival crafting games I have played," Eurogamer's Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/v-rising-review-a-wickedly-deep-generous-and-satisfying-vampire-fantasy">his 4 out of 5 star review</a> back in May, "and at every turn, it finds a way to realise the vampire fantasy I came to it for. There's no escaping the inherent crafting and Gear Score grind present in it, of course, but there are ways to mitigate it - and there's enough imagination and depth throughout to sustain your interest in it."
</p>
<p>
And if any of the above has got you curious, V Rising is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/">free to download and play on Steam</a> right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm in the UK/10am PST - after which, it gracefully sinks back into its  coffin and you'll need to pay to continue playing. If you do find yourself sufficiently impressed, though, there's currently 30 percent off V Rising and 20 percent off its cosmetic DLC (including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-castlevania-collaboration-coming-to-vampire-survival-game-v-rising-in-may">Castelvania-themed Premium Pack</a>) until 24th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-2-arrives-september-25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Zenless Zone Zero is miHoYo's latest gacha game, which is very different from<a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-codes-for-september-2024-how-to-redeem/"> the games</a> that came before. Zenless Zone Zero is now getting its version 1.2 update, which will be released on September 25, 2024. The update will be known as "Tour de Inferno," where Proxies will begin to travel to new locations within New Eridu. This update takes players to a specific area called the Outer Ring and they will get to join in with some motorcycle riding with Caesar and Burnice, characters from the Sons of Calydon faction.</p>
<p>Caesar and Burnice will also be available in the 1.2 banners if you want to get your hands on the fearsome Sons of Calydon characters. They are both S ranks, so it may be challenging to get your hands on them and may take a couple of attempts. However, they may be worth pulling for if you want a powerful team composition.</p>
<p>In addition to this new storyline, a brand-new mini-game is appearing in Zenless Zone Zero called Bizarre Brigade. To play it, you have to make your way over to Goldfinger, where you'll also experience new events, such as the Overlord's Feast. There will also be the Phantom Hunt, led by Rain who has a bunch of difficult commissions for Phaethon to complete. Additionally, there is the Shiyu Defense: Ambush Node, which will only be available for a limited time, with everyone being given permission to participate.</p>
<p>There will also be bounties for players to participate in, including advanced bounties, in which players will receive double the rewards for participating in the events.</p>
<p>While the Zenless Zone Zero website doesn't offer much information about what to expect other than some cool graphics, plenty of content is being added to the game. This includes new W-engines to get your hands on to make your team members more powerful, as well as new Drive Discs to obtain and new enemies to fight.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/125865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> on the Zenless Zone Zero website shows the art of all the new content coming to the game. It also showcases some of the fixes and optimizations being made to make the game a more enjoyable experience for players.</p>
<p>There is plenty more for players to dive into in Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.2, with new Bangboos to collect, new storylines to complete, and the introduction of the new faction, as listed above.</p>

                <p>Later this month, Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-plays-like-a-mini-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6526268/" data-ref-id="1100-6526268">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> is finally giving Zelda a leading role in her own franchise. However, someone has apparently leaked the Echoes of Wisdom ROM weeks before the game's scheduled release, which means spoilers for the game may already be circulating online.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-rom-reportedly-out-in-the-kingdom" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoF0C0YsC8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> has reported that the Echoes of Wisdom ROM leak is real. But the channel is also refusing to share any footage from the Echoes of Wisdom ROM while citing the potential ramifications if they had chosen to do so. The Zelda Lore account on X has also confirmed that the leak is real while noting that it's playable on emulators.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZeldaLoreYT/status/1834264204020162902" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">WARNING! Echoes of Wisdom has LEAKED. people already have it on emulators. Be careful if you want to remain spoiler free.</p>  — Zelda Lore (@ZeldaLoreYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeldaLoreYT/status/1834264204020162902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The vast majority of Switch owners are far more likely to buy the game than to play the leaked ROM. But as alluded to by Zelda Lore, the real fear among Zelda fans is that the story will be spoiled before the dedicated players are able to get their hands on the game. Just because Nintendo Prime has shown restraint about running clips and footage from the leak doesn't mean that every YouTube channel is going to follow their example. It's almost inevitably going to show up on YouTube no matter how many takedown notices Nintendo files.</p><p>Similarly, it's likely that videos and spoilers will be posted on X, TikTok, Instagram, Threads, and other social media platforms. The only way to get ahead of that is to start muting all keywords related to the Zelda franchise. That's not a foolproof solution, as some spoilers may still slip through. But that's the best available option for any gamers who intend to stay on their chosen social media platforms ahead of the game's release.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be released on Switch on September 26. It will throw another wrench in the ever-changing official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-timeline-has-seemingly-become-more-baffling/1100-6526274/" data-ref-id="1100-6526274">Zelda timeline</a>, which seems to now place both Switch games in their own continuity.</p>

			<p>The Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Code Zero remakes may not be as ambitious as the Resident Evil 4 remake was, according to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>Talking on The Snitch's Discord server, well-known insider Dusk Golem talked about what's next for the series, saying that the two remakes are the only remakes of the series in active development, alongside the yet-to-be-revealed ninth entry in the franchise. The insider also highlighted how CAPCOM doesn't plan for any of its remakes to be as ambitious as the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was an exception to the rule due to its scale, scope, and expectations.</p>
<p>As for why Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero were chosen to be remade, the insider believes one of the reasons is that the improvements that can be made to the original versions allow for a more horror-focused design in the vein of the remake of the second entry in the series, which was a big success for the Japanese publisher. Other reasons include fan demand and, for Zero, the excellent timing. Many of the people who worked on it are still at CAPCOM or M-Two, and it is set to receive a live-action adaptation, which would definitely help the remake's popularity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE-Code-Veronica-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Closing their overview, Dusk Golem also commented on why Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero may have been picked over the fifth entry in the series. The game has undoubtedly aged better than most of its predecessors, and it still feels great to play, reducing the need for a remake.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Resident Evil 4&nbsp;<span>remake, which is now available on PC, consoles, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ios-devices-require-internet-to-play-resident-evil-4-remake-and-resident-evil-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS devices</a>.&nbsp;</span>The remake does a great job improving one of the best games ever made without revolutionizing what made it great, although CAPCOM may have played it a little too safe, as highlighted in our&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror.980298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you long for the days when <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/resident-evil"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> had fixed camera angles and low polygon counts, <em>Heartworm</em> is just the game for you. <em>Heartworm</em> is authentic to the era it takes inspiration from and creates a nostalgic blast to the past with this survival horror title.</p>
<p>We checked out<em> </em>the PAX West 2024 demo of <em>Heartworm</em>, the upcoming game from developer Vincent Adinolfi and published by the horror fanatics at <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp">DreadXP</a>. As they say, imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so read on for our thoughts on what could be a strong spiritual successor to early <em>Resident Evil</em> games.</p>

<h2><em>Heartworm - </em>is it Picture Perfect?</h2>
<p>I've made it clear thus far <em>Heartworm</em> takes inspiration from games like <em>Resident Evil</em>, so let's also emphasize the fact that it's a game with fixed camera angels, tank controls, puzzles, and door animations all. If you love that kind of stuff, <em>Heartworm</em> will no doubt strike a chord with you.</p>
<p>Though, it does enough to distinguish itself from its clear inspirations. Instead of guns, you have a camera. Back when cameras had film, y'know. So clearly, <em>Heartworm</em> takes place within or around the 90s and it's a great setting when combined with the dark and dreary horror this game portrays. This brings home that nostalgic feel.</p>
<p>Enemies are not zombies in <em>Heartworm</em>, insofar as I can tell; rather, they're these specters akin to static on an old CRT TV. They do bumble around like lethargic zombies before combat, but become a bit more tricky when they teleport around trying to take advantage of the player character, Sam.</p>

<p>One notable difference between this and other survival horror games, it feels like these ghosts require a lot more ammunition (or rather, film). The camera's almost assured to hit the target if you point in its general direction, but the trade-off is less damage. As a result, <em>Heartworm</em> emphasizes even more caution over which enemies you should kill, and which you should skip.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic with this concept. An old-school camera as a weapon is neat, but I worry it'll feel flat over time. Will there be other weapons, for instance? Or is the camera your sole tool in this spooky adventure? Regardless, my patience was put to the test when I fought a spider boss, which took far too many hits from the camera and felt too repetitive in terms of attack patterns.</p>
<p>But if it's environmental puzzles you're after, <em>Heartworm</em> does provide. Finding which key opens which door and exploring the entirety of a map is half the fun of survival horror, and that's apparent here. I started out in a dark neighborhood with these ghosts wandering around, but the horror takes a turn for the surreal.</p>

<p>I enter an apartment and the hallway is filled with snow. Opening a door in the apartment's hallway leads to an entirely new neighborhood, now filled with mounds of snow and new buildings. <em>Heartworm</em>'s level design looks to defy logic (in a good way) and surprise players rather than have it grounded in reality. Even <em>Resident Evil</em>, for all its body horror and zombies, was a bit more grounded.</p>
<p>All of this takes place within what is an absolutely stunning game. From an artistic standpoint, the old-school, 90s aesthetic of the graphics is replicated to damn near perfection. Every scene is like its own painting. I'm biased since I'm an absolute sucker for retro graphics in modern games, but this does not disappoint in the least.</p>
<p><em>Heartworm</em> is one of the most intriguing indie horror games in development right now, if anything for how true it feels to other old-school survival horror titles. It only needs to refine the combat a bit and make it a tad more exciting, chomping at the bit to play it when it comes out next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243763/astro-bot-sound-design-dualsense-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is a game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">I cannot help but to evangelize</a>, raving about its cute characters, its bright and varied level design, and its short but dense 8–10 hour runtime. But perhaps the biggest element contributing to the game’s joyousness is its sound design, which makes <em>Astro Bot</em> something that engages and delights more than just your mind but your body as well.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> had me hooked before the game even started. I left my PS5 running on the game’s preload screen and was simultaneously soothed by calming bell tones and thrilled because the song conveyed a sense of imminent wonder. It sounded like something that would play in the opening sequence of a children’s movie, letting you know that an adventure was on the way. Music has a tendency to distract me as I’m working, but I let it play for hours because listening to it felt that good.</p><p>The music in the game itself is also banger after banger. I cannot get enough of hearing Astro sing in his little robot voice, “<a href="https://youtu.be/MoJ-WFZ_aig?si=xXbVnnsmrO1-CFKz&amp;t=1">I am Astro Bot!</a>” His theme song is bouncy and happy and seems immune to the pitfalls typical of music geared toward a younger audience. “Baby Shark” is only cute the first couple of times you hear it, but I could listen to “I Am Astro Bot” on a loop and it would never get old. “<a href="https://youtu.be/MoJ-WFZ_aig?si=ZW7PhA35WkkPHrTw&amp;t=158">Astro</a>,” with its funky beat, is another song on my endless repeat playlist. Each level has its own song appropriate to its theme, but every so often, “Astro” will play, and I giggle longer and louder in those levels than anywhere else. I need this soundtrack on Spotify yesterday.</p><div><p>I could listen to “I Am Astro Bot” on a loop and it would never get old</p></div><p><em>Astro Bot</em>’s incredible soundtrack is only half of the equation. The game also makes phenomenal use of the DualSense controller. As Astro moved about, I could hear the soft swish of grass or the hard clang of metal underfoot. The ability to hear environmental sounds emanating from the controller is not particularly new for the PS5, but what astonished me about <em>Astro Bot </em>was the sheer depth, detail, and quality of those sounds that made me feel like I could perceive <em>texture.</em> In one level, the sound and feedback from bouncing on a regular trampoline was so subtly different from what I felt bouncing on a hot air balloon that I could almost feel the texture of the nylon. In another, I could feel the rain pelting Astro’s metal body with a hard clink. But suddenly that sound softened and muffled with a light <em>whumpf</em> when Astro automatically deployed his umbrella. It felt like I was the one who hit the button on a real umbrella to do it.</p><div><p>[The] quality of those sounds that made me feel like I could perceive <em>texture</em></p></div><p>Perhaps the most magical thing about<em> Astro Bot</em> is the depth with which sound and the controller enhanced my perception of the game. <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537067/astros-playroom-ps5-dualsense-hands-on-preview">incorporated a lot of these same elements</a> and developer Team Asobi enhanced them greatly for the sequel. The controller acts as a bridge between the game world and the real one. I was delighted when I’d fiddle with the sticks or the buttons and those actions were mirrored on the controller in the game. When Astro rescues another bot, they get stored for safekeeping within the onscreen controller. But when I put my ear to my DualSense, I can hear their muffled little squeals, and when I shake it, the controller subtlely rumbles as though those little suckers <em>are actually in your hand.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worlds in <em>Astro Bot</em> are colorful and fantastical places but, through the player’s suspension of disbelief, are nevertheless entirely real. As I played, absorbing the sounds coming out of my controller, I had a revelation. Of course, there are logs of wood in the gardening world, but when I hit them, they made the distinct hollow noise that comes from striking two Lincoln Logs together. It made me realize that there are two games going on in <em>Astro Bot</em>. In one, I’m a little robot rescuing my friends. But in the other, I’m actually just playing with toys.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I feel this way not because I think the plushies themselves are that practical—they’re not—but because the photoshoots the company uses to show them off are always incredible meme fodder.

Like Lucario before it, Porygon has also gotten a photo shoot that makes it look like the roughly $400 plush could be a substitute for actual human companionship.</p><p>The plush is currently available through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?p_cd=4521329407517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?p_cd=4521329407517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese Pokémon Center store</a></span>, as reported by outlets like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Pokeshopper/status/1834457217090670826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Pokeshopper/status/1834457217090670826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PokéShopper</em></a></span>.

However, it’s also showing up on some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://meccha-japan.com/en/plush/145345-plush-porygon-life-size-pokemon.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://meccha-japan.com/en/plush/145345-plush-porygon-life-size-pokemon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third-party sellers</a></span> which are listing it at a slightly inflated price. The accompanying photos on the official site show the blocky bird-like Pokémon sitting with its owner on the floor as well as listening intently as its human tells it all their problems.</p><p>Notably, Porygon’s size has been inconsistent throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> series. The creature is composed of code that’s made its way into the real world, so it’s not bound to the usual rules of nature. It was seen transforming into different shapes and sizes in the anime before it was essentially banned from the show after an episode starring it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caused epileptic seizures in hundreds of Japanese viewers in 1997</a></span>.

        <p>"What's important to us is putting the games out that we want to put out."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda says game companies are too hung up on how their games perform on Metacritic.</p>
<p>Talking to our sister site, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suda51-everyone-cares-too-much-about-metacritic-scores">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Suda said that whilst he will check scores when a game releases - "Sometimes a media outlet has given us zero. That makes me feel shitty - why go that far and give us zero?" - but apart from that, he "tries to avoid Metacritic".</p>

<p>"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda said.</p>
<p>"If you've got a game that doesn't fit into that formula, that marketability scope, it loses points on Metacritic. The bigger companies might not want to deal with that kind of thing. That might not be the main reason, but that's certainly one reason why. Everyone cares too much about the numbers.</p>
<p>"Personally, I don't care too much about the Metacritic numbers," he added. "I'm not really conscious of them. What's important to us is putting the games out that we want to put out and having people playing the games we want them to be able to play."</p>
<p>Ed sat down with Suda and fellow titan of Japanese development Shinji Mikami at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> to talk about their work together, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-suda-on-shadows-of-the-damned-remastered-killer-7-and-a-sweet-home-remake">the importance of remasters as part of game preservation</a>, and if there are any games from their past they'd be keen to remake.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda-51-and-shinji-mikamis-shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-out-this-halloween">remaster of 2011 action-adventure Shadows of the Damned is set to release this Halloween</a> on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. It's a cult-classic demon-shooting game written by Suda 51 and produced by Mikami.

            <title><![CDATA[CCP Games Announce New Title EVE Frontier, Same Universe as EVE Online]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CCP has announced its <a href="https://www.evefrontier.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new project</a> in the same universe as the well-revered <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-online-equinox-expansion-launches-on-june-11-eve-vanguard-gets-major-feature-update/">EVE Online</a>. This title, EVE Frontier, is being developed and published by CCP Games and is shaping to be a Sci-Fi Space Survival game. In this game, players explore a player-driven sandbox after waking up from stasis in the cosmos. To survive, players must explore the Frontier, which is chock full of resources to help advance in the game.</p>
<p>The Frontier is far from closed off. It's a shattered space region with dangerous supermassive black holes and Exotic wormholes scattered throughout. There will be other people to interact with, such as opportunists, speculators, and those desperate for power. Due to the Exotic wormholes bleeding Crude Matter, pilots are attracted to these wormholes as they can lead to significant wealth, prolonged survival, and technology enhancements.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier | Official Teaser Trailer | 'Awake Eternally'" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fgw44m1AdKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>EVE Frontier has been designed to be an open environment. With "a complete unlock of third-party development, the game world will evolve with the community." Players will be able to influence the world with their in-game actions, and the worlds can also be edited server-wide by players in real time.</p>
<p>Using Smart Assemblies (blockchain technology) in-game, players can make their infrastructure offensive or defensively functional by using turrets, trading posts, and storage facilities. The sandbox features aren't the only thing players have to look forward to in EVE Frontiers, as there will also be intense Ship combat, which relies on skill and great tactician movements.&nbsp; Smart Assemblies utilizes <a href="https://redstone.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redstone</a>, which is an L2 blockchain which is designed for permissionless and open software, as well as <a href="https://mud.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MUD</a>, which is a framework for building on-chain open applications.</p>
<p>It will become your mission to explore the Frontier, as well as gather supplies and resources to help you upgrade your infrastructure and technology so that you can continue to survive in the harsh atmosphere of the Frontier. It's described as "danger incarnate," filled with aggressive swarms of AI as well as other players who are willing to fight to the death. You have to try and beat them at their own game to harvest Crude matter to obtain fuel so that you can continue to expand.</p>
<p>At the moment, EVE Frontier doesn't have a set release date or price, and both are waiting to be announced in the future. However, what we do know is that it will be available on Windows PC and Mac. Whether it will come to other platforms in the future post-release remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/eve-online-developer-ccp-sparks-backlash-with-crypto-blockchain-spin-off-eve-frontier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"None of us want this crypto slop…"</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> developer CCP has announced Eve Frontier, a spin-off of the much-loved MMO that adds controversial blockchain and cryptocurrency elements.</p><p>CCP describes Eve Frontier as an online space survival game with an open and persistent sandbox that focuses on “self-reliance, tactical and emergent gameplay, and third-party development.” Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Eve Frontier, CCP Games is creating a deep player-driven sandbox for a new era. Cast into a cruel and brutal cosmos, you have been lost to time and lost to light. To survive, you will need to explore, exploit and expand in the face of perpetual annihilation. The Frontier is a shattered region of space, warped by the presence of supermassive black holes gravitationally bound in a macabre dance. Rogue AI infests its depths; corrupting and consuming the remnants of what still stands.</blockquote><blockquote>With all players on one single-shard server, death and opportunity lurk in equal measure. Awareness is power: your skill as a pilot and strategic choices determine the outcome of every encounter, whether you favor hit-and-run tactics, stealth, or all-out warfare. Exploit the Frontier’s natural resources to upgrade your ship with vital technology and acquire new capabilities. Obtain fuel, the lifeblood of your journey, to power your travel as you overcome its dangers. A community-driven and dynamic economy allows you to create custom currencies, establish markets, and trade assets, services, and reputation in a truly open environment.</blockquote><blockquote>Rebuild civilization from its ashes by using Smart Assemblies, an open-ended platform, to construct and program infrastructure within space. Expand your influence through defenses, trading posts and multiple types of functionality, each imbued with a programmable layer that links the world of the Frontier to the real world outside of it. Develop your own ideas or address the needs of others: from mission systems to private economies, Smart Assemblies unlocks third-party development with a toolkit for creators to build beyond a virtual world.</blockquote><p>On the face of it, Eve Frontier sounds like an exciting alternative to Eve Online that could scratch a hardcore space survival itch, but the inclusion of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that has sparked a backlash from Eve Online players, some of whom have let CCP know how they feel across social media and subreddits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>CCP explains its use of crypto as supporting player ownership of items, with all transactions between players permitted outside and inside the game. Blockchain tech, CCP says, lets players edit aspects of the game world and server in real-time. CCP insists all this tech is environmentally friendly: “all technology used to develop and operate Eve Frontier has the same energy consumption as Eve Online’s infrastructure.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Blockchain and crypto has its time, and it is passed. Please. I beg of you. Don't destroy this amazing game you have created.</p></div><p>Despite these explanations, Eve Online players have reacted in horror at the announcement of Eve Frontier. Its subreddit is packed with complaints, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1ffq63u/eve_frontier_why_tarnish_eves_name_more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player accusing CCP of tarnishing Eve Online</a>.</p><p>Another<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1ff7ye9/dear_ccp_dont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Eve Online player called on CCP to cancel Eve Frontier</a>. “None of us want this crypto slop, this desperate cash grab, this attempt at ‘creating something great,’ WOLFWOLF68 said. “This game where buzzwords seem more important than gameplay.</p><p>“We love Eve. That’s why we still play it. None of us, through the memes and the laughs, want Eve to die. This ‘New Frontier’ is not Eve. It's everything bad about Eve, with even worse elements in it.</p><p>“It won't work. People wont play this. Blockchain and crypto has its time, and it is passed. Please. I beg of you. Don't destroy this amazing game you have created.”</p><p>CCP's X/Twitter post announcing Eve Frontier has sparked similarly vociferous responses from Eve Online fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>releasing a blockchain game a year after the weird hype about that technology died<br>so now you got a shitty concept and don't even get a pay-off for it</p><p>let's see how this is going to turn out :)</p></div>— Hannah / Nimos (@nim0s) <a href="https://twitter.com/nim0s/status/1834236985252130926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I initially liked this cos I like Eve, but just wanted to say I retract my Like because of the Blockchain nonsense, thanks</p>— Rob McLachlan (@robmclac) <a href="https://twitter.com/robmclac/status/1834273638825996713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Despite being over 20 years old, Eve Online retains a loyal fanbase and is still capable of housing incredible, community-driven stories. Eve Online is infamous for player heists, large-scale sci-fi battles, and for being so complex some of its players maintain multiple spreadsheets just to keep on top of things. Through all the ups and downs, CCP has struggled to create an Eve spin-off that has hit the same heights as its veteran MMO, with first-person shooter Dust 514 and VR game Eve: Valkyrie both falling by the wayside. Another Eve FPS, called Vanguard, is in the works.</p><p>As for Eve Frontier, CCP said it will reveal more later this year.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It has VR spin-off <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/metro-awakening-vr">Metro Awakening</a> due out later this year on PSVR2, PC VR, and Meta Quest, as well as the next mainline Metro game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-developer-makes-clear-playstation-vr2-game-awakening-isnt-next-mainline-metro-game">confirmed to be in the works but yet to be revealed</a>. There’s another unannounced triple-A game in development at 4A Games, too, Wingefors teased.</p><p>As for Embracer, it’s coming out of a period of devastating cuts and studio closures that has seen thousands of staff lose their jobs. It also sold various parts of its business in a bid to improve its cash flow, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-buys-gearbox-from-embracer-confirms-development-on-new-borderlands-game">Borderlands maker Gearbox joining Take-Two</a>, and the aforementioned Saber Interactive going it alone.</p><p>Despite this, Embracer retains control of over 900 franchises, and owns the likes of THQ Nordic, Plaion, Coffee Stain, and Tomb Raider developer Crystal Dynamics. Embracer, which also owns the rights to The Lord of the rings, has an incredible 103 internal game development studios, with more than 10,000 employees in more than 40 countries.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
