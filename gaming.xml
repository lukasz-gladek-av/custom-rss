            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Virtuos, the studio behind this year's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster and the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, is reportedly about to lay off hundreds of its employees.</p>

<p>According to a report by journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gauthier Andres</a>, around 300 employees' jobs are at risk at Virtuos, constituting around 7% of the studio's overall workforce. These layoffs will mostly be concentrated in the Chinese branch of Virtuos, but employees in "many other areas" are at risk too, Andres says.</p>

<p>Supposedly, these employees are being laid off in the name of "competitiveness", or so Andres says a memo sent to employees a few weeks ago reads. These layoffs reportedly follow payrise freezes and bonus reductions at Virtuos in February.</p>

<p>According to Andres, Virtuos is "losing the trust" of many of its staff members, and while he doesn't directly tie that loss of morale to the threat of AI, it's hard not to draw a link between the two, especially when that's reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-ai-replacement-morale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">exactly what's happening at other studios</a>.</p>

<p>Virtuos' layoffs come as part of a wider industry layoff wave that has been going on for the past few years, with tens of thousands of industry employees losing their jobs, as well as major studios being closed down and huge projects being canceled.</p>

<p>This month alone, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">reportedly laid off around 9,000 of its employees</a>, and Xbox canceled projects in development at its subsidiary studios; both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were shut down, and the latter studio closed its doors as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The dramatic dismissal of three senior developers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds gets messier by the day. In a publicly filed lawsuit, the three fired heads of the studio have accused publishers Krafton of all sorts of dirty tactics, ploys, and shenanigans to purposefully delay the game until 2026, all in an intentional effort to avoid paying a maximum $250 million earnout bonus to the studio. </p>
<p>In one bizarre episode alleged in the lawsuit, Unknown Worlds co-founder Charlie Cleveland went to lunch with Krafton CEO, Kim Chang-han, who told him via translator that having to pay such an earnout would be "disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing" for the publisher. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"On May 20, 2025, Cleveland joined Kim (Krafton’s CEO) and some colleagues for lunch," a section of the lawsuit reads. "Kim said that if Unknown Worlds released the game on its planned timeline (meaning Krafton would have to pay the earnout), it could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton.</p>
<p>"Krafton later asserted that Kim never made those statements," the lawsuit continues. "Instead, Krafton claimed Kim’s words had been incorrectly interpreted by the translators..." We have asked Krafton to clarify what Kim really said, if that is the case, but judging by all our other ignored questions I doubt we'll get a satisfactory answer.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lunch took place at the height of an incredibly tense standoff between studio and publisher, just weeks before Cleveland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">was sacked</a> along with fellow co-founder Max MacGuire and CEO Ted Gill. </p>
<p>Krafton accused the trio of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">abandoning their duties on the game</a>, giving this as the reason for their dismissal. But the lawsuit filed by Cleveland and co alleges that the publisher really shitcanned them to avoid paying the substantial earnout.</p>
<p>To give you some background, this bonus would only be gained if Unknown Worlds hit certain targets by the end of 2025. Most of it would have been paid to the three men, with 10% set aside for 40 other employees at the studio. "Beyond this guarantee," the lawsuit says, "the Founders planned to share even more of the earnout with their dedicated team".</p>
<p>With that much money on the line, a disagreement emerged between the leadership trio at Unknown Worlds, and the suits at Krafton. Cleveland and co wanted the game released - it would earn the studio (and themselves) that chunky bonus. Krafton wanted the game delayed - it would save them millions of dollars and (according to Cleveland at least) some embarrassment. From this point on, the trio allege, Krafton engaged in "desperate efforts" to delay the game and therefore avoid paying the earnout.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Krafton engaged in a months-long campaign to delay Subnautica 2’s release," says the legal doc, posted <a href="https://x.com/Flayra/status/1945573686611743127">on social media by Cleveland</a> and reported by <a href="https://aftermath.site/unknown-worlds-lawsuit-subnautica-2">Aftermath</a>. "It pulled key marketing materials, refused to follow through with crucial partnerships, and reneged on long-standing commitments to handle important pre-launch tasks. Multiple Krafton employees themselves suggested that these moves were for the purpose of frustrating the earnout, despite the earnout agreement’s prohibition on taking actions for that purpose."</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses Krafton of turning to all sorts of dirty tactics in an attempt to frustrate the game's impending release in that unspecified month of 2025. For example, Krafton allegedly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assigned an entirely new publishing team to the game, headed by an employee who didn't speak English. That team "delayed decisions and delivered incomplete work"</li>
<li>Issued an "internal stop work order" and "told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to Subnautica 2"</li>
<li>Ordered all US employees of Krafton previously in touch with Unknown Worlds to stop communicating with the studio</li>
<li>Cancelled work on trailers, advertising, and even a front page plan for PC Gamer magazine.</li>
<li>Cancelled localisation plans to translate the game to nine languages</li>
<li>Neglected to write up the terms of service agreements necessary for the game</li>
<li>Held a milestone meeting in May, and demanded that the game be delayed (this is possibly the meeting in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">this "leaked" document</a> was shown)</li>
</ul>

<p>In another wild story, the lawsuit says that Krafton's own US-based team in El Segundo, California, warned one of the three ill-fated managers about Krafton's plans, saying the publisher had people "combing" through agreements looking for a loophole which would allow them to fire the three key managers. </p>
<p>"Upon their return [from a business trip to Korea], the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to [Ted] Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.</p>
<p>"The El Segundo colleagues informed Gill that Krafton’s legal team was combing through the agreements looking for any opening to terminate the Founders if they proceeded with the planned release. The El Segundo colleagues told Gill it was clear that Krafton was aiming to avoid paying the earnout."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As these obstruction efforts intensified, the trio allege that publishing chiefs at Krafton met with them and offered a lower earnout. But the trio declined, claiming the amount was not "anything close to what they deserved, and did not allow them to share the earnout with the full team."</p>
<p>Soon after, the three men received letters telling them they were fired. Steve Papoutsis, who was installed by Krafton to replace the three chiefs, allegedly said they were fired for their "intention to proceed with a premature release of Subnautica 2."</p>
<p>"The letters make clear that the Founders were terminated without cause," says the lawsuit, and this will likely be a key contention if the case does go to court without a settlement. Krafton have already said they terminated the three developers because those men were absent in their duties. Cleveland, for example, was accused of spending more time working on his nascent movie company than working on the subaquatic sequel. Although the trio are making counterarguments to this too.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit Cleveland suggests that Krafton's own CEO Kim Chang-han (the same man who would later allegedly talk of "embarrassing" circumstances over lunch) personally encouraged Cleveland to "develop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>’s 'franchise IP' with cross-media expansion beyond the game, into television or movies". The lawsuit claims that all parties agreed this "would become Cleveland’s focus". </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Unknown Worlds</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The lawsuit also claims that Krafton gave the other two leadership members the go-ahead to take on broader roles that might, presumably, see them working a little less closely on the game and more on this "franchise IP" stuff.  </p>
<p>As for other employees, the lawsuit claims that in the runup to Subnautica 2's eventual release, "Gill was negotiating incentive bonuses for the many employees who were not guaranteed to receive earnout pay because they joined Unknown Worlds after Krafton’s acquisition."</p>
<p>The entire lawsuit is quite an angry blast of accusations. It is worth noting that key parts of the lawsuit are redacted. Important figures, such as the exact projected sales numbers of Subnautica 2, and the number of sales of previous games, are blacked out. So are some terms of the employment contracts between Krafton and Cleveland, MacGuire, and Gill. The exact formula that would calculate their earnout is redacted too. It's likely more of these details would come out if it reaches court without a settlement. </p>
<p>As part of the lawsuit's demands, the trio want to be restored to their roles at Unknown Worlds, and to be paid "damages in the amount [they] would have received in earnout payments" had Krafton not fired them all, plus "out-of-pocket loss, damages, and expenses in an amount to be determined at trial."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Krafton do not seem to be backing down. </p>
<p>"While we are disappointed that Charlie, Max, and Ted have filed a lawsuit seeking a huge payout, we look forward to defending ourselves in court," they told Aftermath in a statement. "[D]ecisions were made to ensure Subnautica 2 is the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations. Releasing the game prematurely with insufficient content, falling short of what fans expect in a sequel, would have both disappointed the players — who are at the heart of everything Krafton does — and damaged the reputations of both the Subnautica and Unknown Worlds brands."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paying-the-subnautica-2-team-their-promised-bonus-would-be-embarrassing-kraftons-ceo-allegedly-told-the-games-chief-over-lunch]]></content:encoded>

It’s hard to imagine a more dreadful mutilation of a wonderful story than all three laugh-out-loud terrible seasons of <em>Under The Dome. </em>Or the stupefying awfulness of 2017's small-screen version of <em>The Mist</em>, a show so bad you were always on the fog cloud’s side. And that’s before we even start thinking about all those 90s TV movies and miniseries—<em>The Stand</em>, anyone? But there’s always potential, as proven by the 2010-2015 run of Syfy’s <em>Haven</em>—a delightful and breezy mystery procedural barely based on novella <em>The Colorado Kid—</em>and 2021's <em>Chapelwaite</em>, in which Adrien Brody brooded his way through a melancholic horror based on <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em>. And I’ll give any of them a fair chance, given all will be based on the deeply developed characters of King’s literary works.</p><p>Well, almost all. Because of all of King’s recent books, <em>The Institute—</em>the story of a hidden facility that kidnaps psychic kids and puts them through awful procedures—felt the most insubstantial. The author, now in his late 70s, is still capable of writing fresh, compelling, heart-capturing stories—as he keeps proving over and over with his recent muse, recurring character Holly Gibney. But <em>The Institute</em> was so slight, feeling like a compilation of Kingly tropes: the disillusioned cop, the magic child, the evil matriach. Part <em>Firestarter</em>, part <em>The Dead Zone</em>, it read to me <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stephen-king-the-institute-mgm-tv-series-trailer-1851784311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stephen-king-the-institute-mgm-tv-series-trailer-1851784311">like the pilot episode of a TV series</a></span>. Whereas I normally come away from a Stephen King novel feeling a deep attachment to its cast, I finished that book without any great fondness for main characters Luke Ellis and Tim Jamieson.</p><figure id="" data-id="10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-recommend-id="image://10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1828" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-recommend-id="image://10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1828" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which brings us to the new TV series. From MGM+ (previously Epix), the show has an eight-episode run, of which the first two are currently available to stream. MGM+ may not have even been on your radar as a subscription service worthy of your monthly tithe, unless you’ve already discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337">one of the best things on TV, <em>From</em></a></span>. But one show does not a streaming service make, and this year’s atrocious <em>Earth Abides</em> didn’t help. Clearly <em>The Institute </em>is partly an attempt to build on <em>From</em>’s foundations, given directorial duty has been given to Jack Bender, the <em>Lost</em> alumnus who has given that other horror series such a distinct and compelling aesthetic. Bender is one of the best directors in television, and his distinctive style is immediately present here.</p><p>And thank god, given it followed the most extraordinarily terrible opening credits. I realize this is a weird thing to get stuck on, but in this era of prestige TV where two-minute-long opening sequences contain some of the most extraordinary art and animation, <em>The Institute</em>’s look like they were made in the ‘90s, rendered even worse by the accompaniment of a plaintiff rendition of Tears For Fears’ “Shout,” whiningly sung by The Lumineers—clearly a desperate attempt to match <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg0QBuXU_TM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg0QBuXU_TM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>From</em>’s opening number</a></span>, The Pixies’ incredible cover of “Que Sera Sera.” (The only acceptable whining version of “Shout” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_7LoLbFzs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_7LoLbFzs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was on <em>Psych</em></a></span>.) The dissonance between <em>The Institute</em>’s amateurish opening sequence and the familiarly glossy Jack Bender zooming crane shot of a perfectly lit school gymnasium that immediately follows was jarring.</p><p>The program then follows the format of the novel, in which alternating chapters tell two completely disconnected stories for a surprisingly long time. We have the kidnapping of Luke Ellis (Joe Freeman), a teenage boy with burgeoning telekinetic powers, taken to the titular Institute where he meets the handful of other child captives and the mercenary adult staff. Then there’s Tim Jamieson (Ben Barnes), a middle-aged former cop who’s “retired” after he shot and killed an armed teenager while off-duty and not sober. Hitching a ride after giving up his seat on a plane to New York City, he finds himself in a small town, DuPray, South Carolina, where he takes on the anachronistic (and entirely fictional) role of a “night knocker,” a police-adjacent patrolman, walking the town at night to check for crime. It’s only by the second episode that we even learn they might be in the same vicinity.</p><figure id="" data-id="1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-recommend-id="image://1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1874" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-recommend-id="image://1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1874" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If anything, <em>The Institute</em>’s loyalty to the source material is its biggest weakness. The novel always felt strange given the sparsity of its population. The Institute itself has just four kids in its huge rooms and lengthy corridors, outnumbered by the still tiny staff. The kids who are already there when Luke arrives talk like veterans of the place, having gotten so used to their incarceration, separation from their parents, and the experiments being performed on them, that you imagine their stay must have been years—except it quickly becomes clear it’s only been a matter of a couple of weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamieson’s calm and unhurried arrival in DuPray is constantly undermined by these deeply awkward exposition dumps, just in time for something to happen to the relevant character. This grows to the point of farce in the second episode, in which a gas station employee we’ve never met before suddenly delivers an entirely unrequested history of his entire life (he’s a very well-educated immigrant who escaped from being tortured overseas, now working minimum wage in the U.S. but delighted by his freedom...), literally seconds before a gunman runs in and shoots him. It’s so hackneyed and rushed that it feels like a spoof, one of those “Don’t worry darling, I’ll be back from the war before our baby’s born and just in time to deliver the vital medicine to our daughter!” scenes.</p><p>This is all such a shame, because the cast and the direction is working so very hard. Joe Freeman delivers a subtly complex performance as a genius child who’s clearly on the spectrum, and Ben Barnes is...well, he’s outrageously rugged and charming, his eye twinkling alone deserving of all the Emmys. Julian Richings is always a reliably sinister actor, with his gaunt, skeletal face doing half the work of establishing his malevolent character, and Jason Diaz immediately captures the terrifying mood-flipping nature of Institute tough guy Tony. Best of all is Mary-Louise Parker (<em>Weeds</em>) as Ms. Sigsby, the apparent boss of the facility (although the power structure is immediately made unclear), her character constantly walking the line of sanity. (Fun fact: Mary-Louise Parker and Ally Sheedy are two entirely different people.)</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Jack Bender has clearly brought in a few favorites, too. Robert Joy plays the Institute’s main scientist, fresh from his role as Henry in <em>From </em>(although I cannot get over how much, with his pencil moustache, he looks like a Kevin McDonald character from <em>Kids in the Hall</em>), while <em>Lost</em>’s Frank Lapidus, Jeff Fahey, appears in a very mysterious role.</p><figure id="" data-id="3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-recommend-id="image://3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1835" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-recommend-id="image://3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1835" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The problem is, there’s so little that actually matters. Not in that, “Oh god this show’s so slow” way that is a little too prevalent in streaming right now—things move along at a fair clip, Bender never one for long, brooding quietness—but rather that what everyone says and does feels so rote, so formulaic, and rarely progresses the story. You’ll never guess, but the kids with psychic powers want to escape the facility! So they’re going to discuss that. And that handsome ex-cop? Well, he just wants to be left to be lovely and perfect all the time, but there are all these people and incidents. A bunch of stuff happens, but none of it propels the plot. And, having read the novel, I’m all too aware how little propulsion is ever going to be on offer—not least because the book ends on what feels like should be the opening of a much more interesting tale.</p><p>I hope that what’s coming across is my frustration that <em>The Institute</em> isn’t <em>better</em>, rather than that it’s bad. A lot of extremely competent people have made this show, and that’s apparent throughout—but given the thinness of the book, it feels like this could have been an opportunity to develop those ideas, to let the novel actually be the pilot, and see this series progress things much further. More characters, more momentum, more <em>everything</em>.</p><p>On the other hand, weirdly, the show has entirely abandoned the core metaphor the book was allegedly about. It never <em>really</em> comes across from the page, but King said at the time (2019) that he was responding to America’s anti-immigration policies that saw kids locked in cages, separated from their families, treated inhumanely. If the novel ever resonated with this, it was in exploring how the adults in the Institute could ever be able to behave as they do, to treat children so callously, but certainly in the first two episodes of the adaptation this isn’t a factor at all. We see moments of Ms. Sigsby’s bizarre private life, and that will get deeper as things progress, but the rest of the adult cast just feel like cartoon villains. The kids are far more interesting, but horribly under-developed, reduced to “The One Who...” roles. </p><figure id="" data-id="d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-recommend-id="image://d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1632" data-height="918" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-recommend-id="image://d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1632" data-height="918" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m going to keep watching. But don’t take that as a reflection of the show’s quality; I watched every single episode of <em>Under the Dome</em>, after all. <em>The Institute</em> is a vastly better show than that, but it’s so far entirely without menace. Like the book it’s based on, it’s slight, undercooked, and fails to convey a real sense of threat. Also, given it’s attempts to ride <em>From</em>’s coattails, it’s also woefully lacking in mystery. Sure, they keep referencing “keyholes,” but they might as well be saying “Care Bears” for all the intrigue it’s establishing.</p><p>I really hope things can speed up in the next six episodes, that it can find some meat to chew on, but I think to do so it’s going to have to step away from the book it feels too beholden to—and that doesn’t seem particularly likely.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-institute-stephen-king-tv-series-mgm-from-lost-1851786460]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s the very first movie in James Gunn’s revamped DC Universe! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Superman has hit theaters, James Gunn’s DC Universe is fully underway… Or is it? While Gunn has now released a movie, a TV show (Peacemaker), and an animated series (Creature Commandos) under his stewardship, there’s still a missing piece of the DC Universe puzzle: video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunn told fans back in 2022 that his master plan for an interconnected DC Universe includes video games. But unlike on the movies and TV side of things, there have been no official announcements regarding what the first DC Universe video game will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An absence of reveals doesn’t mean we don’t have a reasonably clear picture of what to expect, though. Across multiple interviews and press events, Gunn and co-studio head Peter Safran have explained their plans, including the fact that while they don’t technically oversee Warner Bros.’ gaming division, there’s now a much deeper collaboration between WB Games and DC Studios that could dramatically alter the way future DC video games are made. With that in mind, let’s analyze what the future of games will look like in the new DCU era.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Gunn Takes Over DC</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first time we learned that video games factored into Gunn’s DC plans was shortly after he and producer Peter Safran were announced as co-heads of DC Studios on October 25, 2022. While answering fan questions on X, Gunn responded to one user who asked if games would be connected to the DCU alongside films and TV. To this, he <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1596921811374964736" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>simply replied, “Yes.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be until a few months later that <a href="https://www.dc.com/blog/2023/01/31/the-next-generation-of-dc-movies-and-tv-has-arrived" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gunn revealed</u></a> what movies and shows were in development as part of Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters, which is the DCU’s equivalent of the MCU’s Phase 1. And while video games were conspicuously missing from the Chapter 1 roadmap, Gunn told members of the press, “Television, movies, and games all intertwine within the same universe. We’re going to cast actors who are going to be able to play the characters in [animation and TV], as well as in other things.” This was the first clear indication from Gunn that video games were indeed a part of his plans for the DCU.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Confirmed DCU Projects</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One important thing to know is that Gunn’s job as head of DC Studios doesn’t include control over any of Warner Bros’ video game studios, which include developers like Avalanche Software (Hogwarts Legacy), NetherRealm Studios (Mortal Kombat), Rocksteady Studios (Batman Arkham), and TT Games (Lego). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Under the current Warner Bros. Discovery corporate structure, Warner Bros. Games exists separately from DC Studios and is overseen by Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO of global streaming and gaming, JB Perrette. But after Gunn and Safran were named DC co-heads in 2022, Perrette appears to be deferring to the new DC bosses when it comes to matters of comic book video games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Walls Break Down Between WB Games and DC Studios</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/warner-bros-video-games-live-services-dc-game-of-thrones-1235888944/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Variety</u></a> in 2024, Perrette revealed, “Frankly, there hasn’t been as close a relationship between the studio and the games business as there should have been. And James [Gunn] is actually a gamer, so having someone who’s passionate about it is super helpful.” Perrette added that the games departments are now “actively working with [Gunn and Safran] on the core franchises within the DC Universe.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on this interview, it appears there was once a wall that divided WB’s gaming division from the movie and TV studios. And according to Perrette, it was only after Gunn and Safran took over DC Studios that a newfound sense of collaboration was achieved.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Whether it’s NetherRealm or whether it’s Rocksteady, [we] sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we’re interested in and that they’re interested in.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This dividing wall was confirmed a year later during a DC Studios Presentation held on February 24, 2025. During the event, James Gunn and Peter Safran confirmed Perrette’s statements regarding the separation between the two WB divisions and how that relationship has changed since they took over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette, who runs that division, and it’s really the first time ever it’s been this way at Warner Bros,” Safran confirmed. “It’s been great, and we’ve enjoyed it enormously. Everything had been so siloed, and now that’s completely broken down, and it’s been great. Because it also applies to consumer products and experiences, and everything that DC touches runs up through us now, which is awesome.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“James [Gunn] and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios underneath JB,” Safran added. “Whether it’s NetherRealm or whether it’s Rocksteady, [we] sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we’re interested in and that they’re interested in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s funny that Safran mentions Rocksteady, as it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-working-on-single-player-batman-game-monolith-productions-wonder-woman-in-trouble"><u>reported earlier this year</u></a> that the studio is developing a new single-player Batman game. While it may be too soon to tell, at least according to Gunn and Safran, there will likely be some input from their side of things at DC Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages,” Gunn said at the event. “When they’re talking about what the story might be, we say, ‘Well, maybe you want to go this way because we’re planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,’ and help deal with that.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/16/screenshot-2025-07-14-at-12-01-37-pm-1752682573383.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gunn replies to fans on X. Credit: X.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Does this mean Gunn will be fully in charge of the next Rocksteady Batman game? Not quite. Gunn confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/JamesGunn/status/1597360208824569856" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“not all”</u></a> games will be connected to the DCU’s overarching story when another fan on X shared their concern about losing standalone experiences like Rocksteady’s Arkham series. So, depending on where Rocksteady wants to take its next single-player Batman game, there’s a chance it could be incorporated into the DCU, or treated as a separate universe like Matt Reeves’ The Batman movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Perrette said in the aforementioned Variety interview that WB’s game studios will still be making projects based on what’s best for the studios and gamers, saying, “We’re not going to launch a Superman game purely because we feel obligated. We have to do something that makes sense for the gaming strategy and for fans and for the consumer.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How James Gunn’s DCU Is Already Shaping Games</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if DC’s full gaming plans remain a mystery, we’re already seeing Gunn’s unified vision for DC play out in several games right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our characters can move in and out of animation or jump into a game or onto the big screen, but they will remain consistent throughout: same character, same history, same actor,” Gunn said during the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-gunn-creature-commandos-dc-studios-annecy-1235922754/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press tour for Creature Commandos</u></a> last year — a couple months after Peacemaker was added to Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC character on February 28, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as Gunn said, NetherRealm enlisted John Cena to reprise his TV and movie role as Peacemaker in Mortal Kombat 1. Not only is his likeness and design identical to the version of the character that appears in the HBO series and The Suicide Squad movie, but even his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO_skSl0MDI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Victory Pose </u></a>in Mortal Kombat 1 is a direct reference to Peacemaker’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mrr3UNALww" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>glam rock-themed opening credits</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, this month’s Superman-themed content for Fortnite features skins for Superman, Mr. Terrific, and The Engineer, which are all based on the likenesses of their movie counterparts. So, rather than a comic-book version of these characters, you’re playing as David Corenswet’s Superman, Edi Gathegi’s Mr. Terrific, and Maria Gabriela de Faria’s Engineer. Like Peacemaker, it seems that any appearance by a DCU character in a video game will be identical to their movie and TV counterpart, just as Gunn promised (with the exception of those standalone projects Gunn also promised, of course.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since taking the reins, our true north has been to bring DC film, TV, animation, and gaming into alignment under a single banner and bring a sense of unity and consistency into the DCU as a whole,” Gunn said ahead of the premiere of Creature Commandos. “This frees us to create a range of products that are diverse and compelling, and deliver great stand-alone entertainment experiences on every medium, while also being part of a larger story that we’re telling within our unified DCU.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a rough couple of years for DC games under Warner Bros.. Between the closing of Monolith Software and the cancellation of a Wonder Woman video game, to Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s lackluster release, the future of DC video games appeared to be in major flux. Warner Bros. even considered<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-wb-discovery-looking-to-sell-off-games-other-divisions-to-prevent-total-breakup" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> selling off its gaming business entirely.</u></a> </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while WB Games’ fortunes have changed with the massive success of games like Hogwarts Legacy, there’s still no official word yet on the future of DC video games. But it’s clear based on statements from Gunn, Safran, and Perrette that Warner Bros. Games and DC Studios are collaborating deeply when it comes to any upcoming video game starring DC’s caped heroes. Although the basic expectation is that if a character from DC’s movies and shows appears in a game, it will feature the same actor, the full plans for DC video games, especially from developers like Rocksteady, remain to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out our full list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-dc-movies-and-tv-shows-2025-release-dates-and-beyond">upcoming DC movies and TV shows</a>, as well as our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult">Superman review</a> for our full DC coverage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-know-about-james-gunn-dcu-video-games-rocksteady-batman-superman]]></content:encoded>

That means there’s no actual game data on the card you insert into your Switch 2, and you’ll instead need to download the full game once the card is inserted. Every Game-Key Card case should be appropriately labeled on the front of the box, but the practice <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-a-little-disheartening-the-thing-remastered-dev-says"><u>has been troubling some gamers</u></a>, especially those who prefer to physically own their games, not just license them digitally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is particularly good news for Sonic fans because there had been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lmsid4/sonic_racing_crossworlds_might_be_a_game_key_card/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confusion and conflicting reports about CrossWorlds in particular</u></a>.

At the core of the announcement are new features specifically for teens ages 13-17, giving them more freedom on the platform than younger children but still less than adults. Teens will be able to designate "trusted connections" on Roblox, with whom they will be able to chat on the platform without filters. Per Roblox, the goal is to better monitor conversations teens are having on Roblox rather than having them lured to third-party platforms where unmonitored conversations could become inappropriate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trusted connections are intended to be set between users who know one another well, and if a teen intends to set someone 18+ as a trusted connection, they can only do so using a QR code scanner or a contact importer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the past, Roblox has relied on the submission of a government ID verifying that users are 13+ or 18+ to unlock certain platform chat features. However, it is now implementing an alternative verification method. Individuals can submit a "video selfie" to Roblox, and an AI will determine if it believes the person in question is 13+ by analyzing it against "a large, diverse dataset." Google began <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/12/google-to-test-using-ai-to-determine-users-ages.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing a similar feature earlier this year</a>, as did <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/instagram-teen-accounts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meta the year prior</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, Roblox is also adding new tools such as online status controls, a do not disturb mode, and parental controls for parents who have linked their accounts to a teenage's account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox has long been in an uncomfortable spotlight regarding its handling of children's safety. In 2018, it made headlines when <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-bans-players-who-gang-raped-a-seven-year-olds-avatar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a mother reported her seven-year-old daughter's Roblox character was violently sexually assaulted</a> by other players in-game, and separately a six-year-old girl playing Roblox was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/05/girl-6-invited-sex-room-playing-childrens-video-game-roblox-7605376/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly invited into a "sex room"</a>. In 2021, People Make Games published a report on the ways in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox's business model allegedly exploits child labor</a>. In 2022, Roblox faced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lawsuit-accuses-roblox-of-enabling-sexual-exploitation" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a San Francisco lawsuit accusing it</a> of enabling the financial and sexual exploitation of a 10-year-old girl.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s that time of the year again and EA has revealed the cover stars of its next soccer game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">FC 26</a>. But this go around there’s concern that the infamous 'Madden curse' has spread to EA’s soccer series, after joint cover stars Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala suffered significant injuries that left them facing lengthy spells on the sidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s really nice to share this moment with Jamal, as a reflection of how far we’ve come,” said Real Madrid and England midfield star Bellingham in a comment accompanying the announcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember our times rooming together in the England Youth team, we’d play the game all the time. Where I’m from, everyone knows the game, everyone plays it and talks about it so much. I’m grateful to be given the opportunity to be on the cover again.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a comment from Bayern Munich and Germany forward Musiala: “When I found out I’d be on the cover of FC, it was such a crazy feeling. I thought, how could I tell my little brother? He’s a big fan of the game, so this will be a nice surprise for him. It’s something I always wanted growing up and it’s such a big part of football culture. Who knows, maybe I can still beat Jude at FC.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, both players are injured and are set to miss a significant chunk of the next season. Let’s start with Bellingham. The 22-year-old just had surgery on a long-standing shoulder injury that’s set to keep him out of the game for up to four months. That means he’s going to miss the start of next season and may not return until November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worse for Musiala, though. He suffered a horrible injury playing at the Club World Cup that rules him out for between four and five months. After breaking his leg and dislocating his ankle in the same incident, the 22-year-old is set for a long absence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this means FC 26 launches in September with both its cover stars unable to play the game. One potentially won’t play again until 2026. Hardly ideal for the marketers at EA Sports, who must be wondering whether they are now cursed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/17/image001-1752748823131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Jude Bellingham and Jamal Musiala both face lengthy spells on the sidelines. Image credit: EA Sports.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Madden curse fan theory suggests any athlete who appears on the cover of Madden NFL suffers a downturn in their career, either from an injury or generally underperforming. The long-standing Madden curse most recently afflicted Madden NFL 25 cover star Christian McCaffrey of the San Francisco 49ers, who was shifted to the injured reserve list due to calf tightness and achilles tendinitis one month after he graced the cover of the latest American football entry from EA Sports, which arrived August 13, 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/does-madden-nfl-cover-curse-still-exist-a-look-back-at-25-years-of-covers-after-christian-mccaffrey-nod/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CBS Sports</u></a> analyzed the history of the Madden curse upon McCaffrey's announcement as 2024's cover star, deeming that, between 2000 and 2024, 58% of players struggled after appearing on the cover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s FIFA series — now FC — has a long way to go before a ‘FIFA curse’ spreads online, but perhaps FC 26 has started something new. FC 26 launches across PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PC, Amazon Luna, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 26, 2025, with early access through the Ultimate Edition beginning September 19, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

		<p>You will soon be able to sheath your Fortnite character in a Fantastic Four skin. These delightful creations are to tie in with the Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which can be seen in UK cinemas from July 25th 2025.</p>
<p>The Fantastic Four skins have not been detailed, but it is assumed that you will be able to purchase all four members of the team: Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and the Thing. Data miners have porked around in the code and found the details below, but nothing official has been posted.</p>


<ul>
<li>Reed Richards: – Skin, has a beard – Emote (With Prop &amp; Hologram) – Glider – Bundle</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Skin – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: – Skin (Normal &amp; Fire Style) – Emote – Emoji – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>The Thing: – Skin – Spray – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>Epic have not posted a release date but it is assumed it will be somewhere near the launch date of the film. Galactus is the main villain in the movie, but it is rumoured that many lesser-known characters may make an appearance so they may get a Fantastic Four skin as well.</p>
<p>Data miners have also found reference to four pairs of Nike shoes that are linked to the characters, all of which are based on existing real world kicks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Reed Richards:- Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: -Red and orange Air Max 95s</li>
<li>The Thing: – Orange Dunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four skins are the latest Superheroes to be added to the game,&nbsp; on July 10th a version of Superman based on the new DC movie starring David Corenswet was added to the game. Previous additions included Dead Pool, Black Panther, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Blade, Harley Quinn, Batman and Spider-Man.</p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed the next entry into the Sudden Strike series with the announcement of Sudden Strike 5, which is due to come out in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To mark this announcement, Kalypso Media has put Sudden Strike 4 on sale until Sunday 20th July, with the base game and all the DLC available for $16. An announcement trailer for Sudden Strike 5 has also been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sudden Strike 5 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlNfzXuifFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Much like the previous games in the series, Sudden Strike 5 will be set during World War 2 and maintain the real time strategy gameplay. This entry will have 25 missions in the main campaign, and give players access to 300 units, with this split between 190 vehicles and 110 infantry units. Players can also select a commander that is best suited to their strategic thinking. During play, you will be able to see the whole battlefield from above allowing for better tactical planning as you look to capture and defend key resources including headquarters and supply depots. Sudden Strike 5 will feature online PvP multiplayer too, so you can face off against other commanders to determine who has the best tactical ability.</p>
<p>For those that are interested in Sudden Strike 5, a closed beta will be taking place through which players can test the game and provide feedback to the developers ahead of the full release next year. To sign up for the Sudden Strike 5 closed beta you need to visit the official <a href="https://www.kalypsomedia.com/sudden-strike-5">Sudden Strike 5</a> website.</p>

<p>"HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT is a 3-on-3 fighting game based on the iconic anime and manga series HUNTERxHUNTER, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. In this game, players create a team of 3 characters and battle against the opposing team with a tag system: calling out their allies for an assisting attack, or for swapping characters on the fly!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those not in the loop, Hunter x Hunter is one of those incredibly long-running anime comics that's got a legion of hardcore fans, although it's not quite in the same league as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/naruto_x_boruto_ultimate_ninja_storm_connections">Naruto</a> - which also get much flashier, big-budget games to boot. First printed in Weekly Shonen Jump all the way back in 1998, the manga, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, now missing, is a world-renowned Hunter.</p>
<p>This 2D fighter uses the universe of the comics to bring some beefy-looking scraps to life. We're always down for some tag-team action, and whilst it's not going to be winning any awards for sharpest graphics, there's an interesting core combat experience here that could provide ample cover for any presentation shortcomings. Indeed, any fighters we've played from Eighting in the past have been right bangers in the mechanics department.</p>

<p>Alongside the digital edition, which is priced at £49.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are!) there's also a physical edition that comes in standard and limited edition flavours, with the limited containing the following extras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Game</li>
<li>Special Box</li>
<li>Artbook</li>
<li>Acrylic Stand</li>
<li>Season 1 Pass</li>
<li>Alternate Costume Pack Hisoka &amp; Kurapika</li>
</ul>

<p>This limited edition, which comes in a very nice box, will set you back £84.99.</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter has made the news a few time already in this game form, having been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/hunter-x-hunters-fighting-game-delayed-until-2025-now-adding-rollback-netcode">delayed to add rollback net code,</a> as well as finding itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/new-switch-anime-fighter-due-out-in-2025-refused-classification-down-under">banned in Australia for including material deemed "inappropriate"</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game at the top of this very article and, whilst it's definitely not a particular looker in comparison to some other Switch fighters, if it's got it where it counts — in the actual fighting dept. — and you're a fan of the anime already, this one could well be worth a shout.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-lawsuit-revealed-as-krafton-reportedly-extends-bonus-period.1245990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founders have released the public text of their&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, and it comes just as publisher Krafton reportedly extends its employee bonus period to cover 2026.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, Krafton, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">the parent company</a> of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica </em>studio Unknown Worlds,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release&nbsp;into 2026. The announcement of the game's delay was made shortly after original Unknown Worlds founders Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill were ousted from the company.</p>

<p>In response to their ousting and&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay, Cleveland and his fellow co-founders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">pledged to sue Krafton</a>, claiming not only that the game was ready for Early Access but also that Krafton delayed it in order to avoid paying out a potentially large bonus to employees if a 2025 revenue target was met.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=CP0P78d8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=kN4gRjKy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Charlie Cleveland and company's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit (or, at least, the public version of it) has been released to the public.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, Cleveland has once again taken to social media in order to release a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">redacted public version</a> of the lawsuit against Krafton. It's a lengthy legal document, but in essence, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are suing Krafton for breach of contract with specific reference to the payout.</p>

<p>The three are alleging that Krafton deliberately delayed&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>in order to avoid paying $25 million of a $250 million bonus to Unknown Worlds employees, and that this is also why the three were dismissed from their positions at Unknown Worlds.</p>

<p>In a move that might muddy the waters somewhat, however, Krafton is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> extending the bonus payout window to cover 2026, and it's also apparently planning to advance part of the 2026 bonus pool to employees by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>If this move goes ahead, it sounds to me like it might invalidate a large part of Cleveland's claim, although I'm not a legal expert. We'll just have to wait and see what happens next, but as many lawsuits do, this process may well drag on for a while yet.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently due for launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime next year. Of course, there's every chance it could be delayed until 2027, in which case the aforementioned bonus extension would cease to matter, but that's too far in the future for us to meaningfully speculate on.</p>

We’ve seen the reintroduction of ex cards, the return of Trainer Pokémon, and even a new invasion from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">Team Rocket</a></span>. At the same time, we’ve also seen a <em>lot</em> of drab sets with pull-rates that ensure you’ll get <em>something</em>, while making the most desirable full-art cards near impossible to collect. Then, during fall 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">everything got out of control</a></span>. The hobby saw a new surge of interest, driven by skyrocketing prices made vastly worse by scarcity caused by scalpers, and ever since it’s been close to impossible to buy a new pack of Pokémon cards from the store without waiting in line, or engaging in a fist fight. Multiple attempts to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">thwart scalpers have failed</a></span>, and even pre-ordering a new set months in advance is now a lottery. Unless you want a pack of the entirely unloved Twilight Masquerade. Everywhere has that poor set.</p><p>It’s into this furore that the English-language’s first ever split set is launched. Black Bolt and White Flare are two overlapping sets of cards, each with their own unique Pokémon and cards, released as a so-called “special set” to finish off the <em>SV</em> generation. Except, “special set” actually means, “harder to buy for some reason,” where packs are only sold as part of collection boxes, or in Elite Trainer Boxes, with no single packs available (unless you go to a canny specialist store, that’ll strip the collection boxes down for their packs), and certainly no 36-pack booster boxes. Then, released as a split set, it’s twice as hard to collect all the cards you might want, given you not only need to be able to find any at all to buy, but you also need to be sure to get the right half of the collection. Yay?</p><h2 id="h700876"><a id=""></a>All 156 Pokémon from...Unova?</h2><p>Black Bolt and White Flare feature all 156 Pokémon from the Unova region, as featured in the 2010 <em>Pokémon Black</em> and <em>White</em> video games. Why? Gosh that’s a good question.</p><p>Obviously, if you’re a fan, you’ll know the set features fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon Zekrom and Reshiram. And then, um, oh dear. Look, if 2010 was your entry into the hobby, then I imagine the Pokémon within have a special place in your heart. But looking back across all the new monsters, it’s surely by far the worst. Filled with deeply unimaginative creatures, like three different evolutions based on flipping ice cream and a second pigeon-based pocket monster, I struggle to muster passion for such a derivative set. Oh, and it also forced Pansear, Pansage and Panpour on us, three creepy-faced monkey-things in a game that was already just fine with Aipom. (Simisear, the evolution of Pansear, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was once voted the least popular Pokémon</a></span>, ever.)</p><p>This means it’s not easy to get worked up about seeing the set get celebrated here, especially when—and italicized all-caps is really the only option here—<em>THIS IS THE LAST SET FROM SCARLET &amp; VIOLET</em>. Maybe celebrate that set? Just perhaps?</p><figure id="" data-id="cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-recommend-id="image://cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-recommend-id="image://cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202">some absolutely gorgeous art</a></span> to be found in the packs, along with the brand new all-black and all-white Zekrom and Reshiram cards, but based on my experience of opening 35 packs, you’ll be lucky to see the rarer ones. Pull rates are tricky to convey at this point, because  Black Bolt and White Flare are packed with so many twiddly extras that you’ll inevitably get <em>something</em> out of a couple of packs. Because, oh my, there are so many variants here.</p><p>There are new holo Energy cards that show up pretty frequently, and then the most egregious array of reverse holo versions of every card. So, for every Basic Pokémon (the ones with the small window art on the top half), there are <em>four</em> different versions. The regular, the standard reverse holo, then a Poké Ball holo pattern, and <em>then</em> a Master Ball holo pattern. This means to complete a master set, you’ll need to collect a ridiculous 800 cards, and also be a billionaire scalper who lives in a Pokémon card factory.</p><h2 id="h700877"><a id=""></a>What about pull rates?</h2><p>To give you an idea from my unscientifically small sample of 35 packs (very kindly supplied by The Pokémon Company, and roughly half Black and half White) I pulled a gratifying seven full-art cards (six Illustration Rares, one Ultra Rare full-art Trainer), four standard ex cards, eight holo Energies, 14 Poké Ball holos, and one Master Ball holo. And written down, that might sound like a really impressive haul. But given just how common Poké Ball variants clearly are, they immediately didn’t feel special, and the Energies are much the same, while ex cards have been bland throughout the last three years. So, it’s really only those seven full-arts and the Master Ball that felt like special pulls. Still, eight out 35 is vastly better than we’ve seen from other sets, and not to be sniffed at.</p><p>The other side, however, is that this meant I didn’t see a single Special Illustration Rare at all, from either Black Bolt or White Flare, meaning those 18 valuable cards must be incredibly tough to find. Obviously I could have just gotten unlucky, but if they’re really fewer than one in 30 or so, that’s going to be grim.</p><p>The collection sets themselves are pretty nice. The poster collection’s poster is just <em>enormous</em>, while the binder collections come with a top-quality 3x3 side-loading binder, featuring either Reshiram or Zekrom. ETBs have nine packs of either Black or White, depending on the box, while the two-pack mini tins have one of each. As ever with Pokémon, everything is super-good quality, none of the extras feeling like tat.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, you know, I’m left feeling a lot of anticlimax.

I do hope so. But if not, then Black Bolt and White Flare is a pretty naff way to end things. If you can find it, you’ll likely pull something glittery out of it, but given it’ll be a Unovan Pokémon, won’t add anything radical to the table-top game, and is extremely unlikely to be rare, it’s hard to get all that excited. The sets are available from Friday, July 18.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-1851786465]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/promo-off-the-grid-is-now-available-on-steam.1245981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The battlefield just got a whole lot bigger. <em>Off The Grid</em> officially launched on Steam today, meaning players of the cyberpunk battle royale game can now compete across devices to be the last avatar standing.</p><p>Set in a dystopian universe crafted by Hollywood filmmaker Neill Blomkamp—who directed <em>District 9</em>, <em>Elysium</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, and more—<em>Off The Grid</em> was initially released for early access back in October of last year. The free-to-play title has steadily gained popularity since that time, thanks to its fluid third-person shooter gameplay, vast array of looting possibilities, and consistent, thoughtfully crafted updates that keep the in-game experience fresh. Players are especially drawn to <em>Off The Grid</em>’s unique mechanic of switchable cyberlimbs, which grant special abilities and make each session feel completely different from the last. These cyberlimbs can be looted from the map, stolen from other players, or purchased through the player-to-player marketplace, offering a wide range of distinctive abilities and customization options.</p><p>“Every major step forward has been shaped by player feedback,” stated Vlad Korolov, the CEO and Co-Founder of Gunzilla Games. “This launch is a celebration of that collaboration, and it’s only the beginning.”</p><p>Founded in 2020, Gunzilla Games is an independent AAA video game developer that has continued to emphasize innovation and a “gamer-first ecosystem” that “pushes the limits of the games” industry. With <em>Off The Grid, </em>their first and primary title, Gunzilla seeks to bend and reshape the battle royale genre in bold, unexpected ways.</p><p>Unlike traditional battle royales, <em>Off The Grid</em> leans deeply into narrative depth. Players complete PvE missions within a PvP environment, so they might find themselves competing with—or against—others while pursuing their own objectives. This adds unpredictability and strategy beyond what’s offered with the standard shrinking-map formula. The result is a living, breathing world where actions have consequences for other online players, and no two sessions feel quite the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, the community “strands” that constitute the game’s DNA are reflected in frequent enhancements centered around performance, expanded maps, new swappable cybernetic limbs and weapons, and all-new game modes. Deathmatch and Solo Mode, for example, are designed to challenge different playstyles and encourage experimentation and creativity.</p><p>On Steam, <em>Off The Grid</em> is now available to the platform’s more than 130 million active users from every corner of the gaming universe, as it enables seamless cross-play among PC, Xbox, and PS5 gamers.</p><p>“Bringing <em>Off The Grid</em> to Steam is a major milestone for us,” said Korolov. “Not just because of the platform’s reach, but because it allows us to welcome an entirely new wave of players into [the] game.”</p><p>Steam’s powerful community integration tools align with Gunzilla’s aims for <em>Off The Grid</em>.

            <p>
Ousted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio founder Charlie Cleveland has hit back at claims made by former employer Krafton in a newly unsealed court document, accusing the publisher of deliberately hindering the Subnautica 2 project in order to avoid paying out a $250m bonus.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Krafton announced Cleveland - alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire - had all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">departed Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds</a>, but insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game's development". Shortly after, though, it was claimed the team had been "pushed out", and that the move was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">part of a plan by Krafton to avoid paying out a $250m bonus</a> for the development team.
</p>
<p>
The report was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">delay for Subnautica 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Krafton's own statement</a>, insisting Unknown Worlds' leadership team had "abandoned" their responsibilities. Specifically, the publisher said it had "asked [Cleveland] to devote himself to... Subnautica 2" but, "instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project".

<p>
However, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout">reported by Bloomberg</a>, a lawsuit against Krafton, filed for breach of contract by Unknown Worlds' former leadership team, claims that Cleveland was, in fact, working on a Subnautica movie the publisher is said to have specifically asked the studio to develop. Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lu4as2noxc2b">noted on social media</a> that "Cleveland was also working on some sort of AI Christmas film, which Krafton was likely referring to. They just didn't mention the Subnautica film part of it."
</p>
<p>
As for the $250m bonus that increasingly appears to be at the centre of Krafton's fallout with the former leadership team, the lawsuit alleges things began to turn sour in early 2025, when Gill started negotiating bonuses for employees who weren't eligible under the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquisition</a> terms. In one part of the complaint reviewed by Bloomberg, it's claimed: "After Krafton's leaders reviewed Gill's projections and evaluated the anticipated revenue and earnout numbers, everything changed."
</p>
<p>
It's alleged the combination of Subnautica's release on mobile and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, alongside the impending early access launch of Subnautica 2, meant the studio was now presenting Krafton with revenue projections significantly higher than Unknown Worlds' initial conservative estimates. It's claimed this is the point Krafton began pushing to delay Subnautica 2 into 2026, halted its publishing duties - including marketing and localisation - and refused to support Subnautica 2's planned summer release.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit also alleges a senior Krafton executive told Gill "pulling these resources was a permissible way for [the company] to avoid supporting the earnout", and that Krafton later asked Unknown Worlds' leadership to accept a lower sum. It's around this time Krafton head Changhan Kim is alleged to have written to Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire describing Subnautica 2's progress as "slow and underwhelming", and accusing them of "failing to fulfil [their] responsibilities". This is despite the complaint's claim that pre-release tests for Subnautica 2 "drew high marks and confirmed that the game was ready to meet... lofty expectations."
</p>
<p>
According to Bloomberg, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are now seeking damages "in an amount to be determined at trial" following their termination.
</p>
<p>
All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> this weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would 'minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players'. It seems likely we'll hear again from Krafton soon.

It hovers at a 30-40 FPS status, which isn’t too bad, but the odd visuals, I think, actually make me play worse (I’m also used to playing this game on mouse and keyboard, not the gamepad layout of the Steam Deck, to be clear).</p><p>Yes, it will sorta settle down at times when rendering and FSR3 catch up, but it’s still not great. And the second you move, distant options look all crunchy and shitty again.</p><h2 id="h710456"><a id=""></a>What about the new class options and other features?</h2><p>I’ve been playing on the hardest difficulty in <em>Avowed</em> with a ranger-ish build that primarily uses rifles. Surprisingly, it feels like playing a first-person shooter more than something like <em>Fallout 4</em> did. My brain is sorta in <em>Doom</em> mode when I’m playing. While the game put up a tough fight early on, I eventually reached a certain level of power where I was annihilating everything. I’m also doing every quest and finding everything on every map, so my character has a lot of experience invested in her stats.</p><p>The fighter and ranger got new active and passive abilities. And the update refunded everyone’s skill points, so you can already get to trying out new builds. From the looks of things, this is only going to make me more unstoppable than I already am. The “Sharpshooter” ranger passive looks like it will make my pretty sweet rifle even deadlier. That said, abilities like “Shadow Step,” a previously NPC-exclusive ability that lets you vanish and appear behind your target, feel a little redundant since I can already go invisible. </p><p>I’m going to need to mix and match these new abilities for a while to judge just how transformative they are for a game I didn’t find that challenging anyway. So maybe I’m not the best judge of how helpful the new build options are. I’ll get back to you if something really blows my mind.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The credits for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have shined a light on the game's voice cast, including one actor who is reprising his role from the Japanese dub of Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of cast spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza below.</strong></p>

<p>Donkey Kong's emotive grunts and the like in Donkey Kong Bananza are all voiced by Kouji Takeda, who is credited as the game's main character in all of its various language options (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-dks-new-voice-actor-and-theres-a-fresh-voice-for-pauline-too">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>If you think that name sounds familiar, that's because Takeda has also provided the voice of Donkey Kong in the Japanese dub of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, as well as the Japanese voice of Daruk in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, to name just two.</p>
<p>Takeda also voiced Nintendo's leading ape in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, replacing Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for over two decades. And, DK isn't the only character with a new voice for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">Samantha Kelly confirmed she'd been recast as the voice of Princess Peach and Toad after 18 years</a>.</p>
<p>As for Bananza's other lead, Pauline, she is voiced by Jenny Kidd for the English version. The character in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> is voiced by Kate Higgins, however in the Switch platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wont-confirm-donkey-kongs-age-in-new-game-as-its-good-fodder-for-player-theories">Pauline is significantly older than in Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete&nbsp;<em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire…</em>).</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mini-review-tomtoc-fancycase-g05-for-switch-2-a-slim-case-that-nails-the-fundamentals</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-tomtoc-fancycase-g05-for-switch-2-a-slim-case-that-nails-the-fundamentals.1245927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Sometimes simplicity is key, and when such simplicity is available for a decent price (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT46HMRB?th=1&amp;tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">$36.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment), that’s an even sweeter peach to sink your teeth into. Don’t bite the tomtoc FancyCase G05, mind you, although in all likelihood you wouldn’t do any damage to the console inside.</p>
<p>Yes, it might look simple from the outside (and it is), but this little case is well worth a look if you want to keep your Switch 2 console safe. The first thing you’ll notice is that this is a <em>slim</em> case. There’s very little wasted space at all, and when a gap is present, it’s for a good reason. There are even raised areas in the top in which your Joy-Con sticks can safely nestle themselves.</p>
<p>The exterior of the case is <em>reasonably</em> hard. I mean, it’s got a little bit of give to it, but in all honesty that’s not a bad thing, as it should help absorb any impact force from when you inevitably drop your console whilst waiting at the bus stop. Butterfingers.</p>
<p>There’s a handle at the top as well, which can double as a wrist strap should you want to use it. We’re not entirely sure why you would, but I suppose if it’s strapped to you directly you’re less likely to drop it whilst waiting at the bus stop.</p>

<p>Inside, the plush, velvet-like lining provides a nice little bit of cushioning for your device, including an extra bit of padding to make sure your shoulder buttons have adequate clearance, and the classic flap that folds over the screen also homes some elasticated slots in which you can store your games.</p>
<p>As a small bonus, mine even came with a few little dummy cards made of… well, card, that say ‘Name’ and ‘Contact’ on each side. Keep one of these in your case and should you lose it, whoever finds it should be able to get in touch with you. Assuming they’re honest, naturally.</p>
<p>All things considered, there’s not much to say about this case, but that’s a <em>good</em> thing. There’s nothing exceptional about it, but it gets the fundamentals absolutely bang-on. It’s the functional option, and that is no bad thing.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 6 is expected to feature more RAM than the 16 GB RAM of the PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Pro, but the tech experts at Digital Foundry don't think the next-generation system will have much more RAM than the current systems for several reasons.</p>



<p>Replying to a supporter's question during their weekly podcast, the known tech-experts commented on how much RAM the next-generation systems should be expected to have, starting with the PlayStation 6. Given what already can be achieved with 16 GB and how we are already hitting limits in regards to textures and art assets, 24 GB of RAM sounds reasonable, as the extra RAM over the current systems will be needed for machine learning and the more advanced ray tracing that's already been teased as part of the future of PlayStation. Additionally, the cost of DRAM is high and hasn't seen any significant drop in the past few years, so this will undoubtedly be a limiting factor. Also, if the rumored PlayStation handheld is real, it will likely come with 16 GB of RAM, making 24 GB RAM a more sensible choice for the home system if developers are supposed to target both systems with their games.</p>



<p>With the next Xbox, however, predictions are a little harder to make, as Microsoft may decide to go in a different direction and not compete directly with the PlayStation 6 with their next-gen system, but with pre-built PCs. As such, a premium system could easily have a bigger APU and more RAM than Sony's system. According to Digital Foundry, studies were done at Microsoft some time ago looking into the possibility of launching a "PC-in-a-box" rather than a lead console, highlighting how costs escalated dramatically, making such a system not an enticing option in the console space. In the pre-built PCs space, however, there's a price gap between the cheapest systems and consoles that such a system could fill, so the possibility is definitely there to launch a "PC-in-a-box" with better specs than Sony's next-gen system.</p>

<p>Though Sony is expected to launch a PlayStation 6 in the next few years, it will be much more interesting to see if the rumored PlayStation handheld is launching alongside the traditional home console. This system is said to be able to run<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/"> PlayStation 5 games natively</a> and will be more powerful than the<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> Xbox Series S.</a></p>

		<p>EA has taken a slightly different approach this year for its EA Sports FC 26 reveal trailer. Instead of just having footballers running around and playing the beautiful game, this reveal trailer addresses player complaints about the previous entries to the series and how FC 26 is looking to improve them. Of course, there are still the big name stars present in the trailer including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Jude Bellingham, and Jamal Musiala.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,”</em> said John Shepherd, VP &amp; GM, EA SPORTS FC. <em>“We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let’s dive into some of these changes coming to EA Sports FC 26 a bit more, beginning with the Archetypes system. The Archetypes system will be part of Clubs and Player Career, with it being a class system. As part of Archetypes you will be able to unlock and develop different attributes, along with Archetype perks that provide additional bonuses. These perks are based on some of the best players in football. The gameplay is getting overhauled again to make things more fluid and responsive, with examples being better dribbling, improved goalkeeper reactions, better ball behaviour, more fluid passing, and better off the ball player movement and interactions. As part of the overhaul Competitive Gameplay and Authentic Gameplay presets will be available to choose from. Competitive Gameplay is aimed for the multiplayer parts of FC 26 including Clubs and Ultimate Team, while the Authentic preset is more for single player modes like career.</p>
<p>Manager Career is being changed for this release too with the introduction of Manager Live. Manager Live will introduce various challenges into the manager career mode, and there will be new scenarios introduced that are based upon real world football events. In Ultimate Team, there will be new live events and tournaments to take part in. Rivals and Champs will also be given updates too. Finally, EA has confirmed FC 26 will include over 35 leagues, over 750 teams across clubs and international, 120 stadiums, and over 20,000 footballers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review, I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

Teens will only be able to add someone older than 18 as a Trusted Connection if they know them in real life, Kaufman says, and they can do that by scanning a QR code in person or using <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/7416652004884-Letting-Friends-Find-You-on-Roblox-with-Contact-Importer">Roblox’s Contact Importer feature</a>.</p><p>Although chats with Trusted Connections can be unfiltered, Roblox will monitor the conversations for “critical harm.”</p><p>“This includes, but isn’t limited to, any predatory behavior aimed at manipulating or harming minors, the sexualization of minors, engaging in inappropriate sexual conversations with or requesting sexual content, and any involvement with child sexual abuse material,” Chaitin-Lefcourt says.</p><p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> highlighted issues with predators on the platform, and the company introduced safety tools like letting parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">block and report</a> people on their child’s friend list and has banned kids under 13 from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">accessing “social hangout” spaces</a>. Age verification has growing momentum behind it — platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety">Reddit</a> also recently rolled out age verification tools in the UK to comply with the Online Safety Act, and the EU is testing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699151/eu-age-verification-app-dsa-enforcement">a prototype age verification app</a>.</p><p>Roblox is also introducing new features intended to support users’ well-being. A new option will let people control who sees whether they’re online. (Before, they could only hide which experience they were in.) Users can also set a Do Not Disturb timeframe to silence Roblox’s push notifications, and teens will be able to set their own screentime limits (a feature previously limited to parents).</p><p><em><strong>Update, July 17th</strong>: Roblox confirmed what isn’t filtered with Trusted Connections.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708670/roblox-trusted-connections-age-estimation-privacy]]></content:encoded>
