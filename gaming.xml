			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/">VGC</a> alleges that Square Enix is laying off staff in "<em>nearly all areas</em>" of its Western offices, with staff in its Europe and US offices hit. There's currently no word from Square Enix on how many have been impacted by this layoff, but sources told VGC that just from Square's London office, 140 employees are at risk of redundancy.</p>



<p>The news was delivered to staff through an internal video call as part of a restructuring that Square had mentioned <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in the progress report it published today</a>, the same report where it boldly claimed that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-is-pushing-hard-for-ai-in-game-development-planning-to-let-it-handle-70-of-qa-by-2027/">wanted 70% of its QA work to be done by AI by 2027</a>.</p>



<p>In the progress report, Square writes, "<em>a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency</em>."</p>



<p>This aligns with VGC's report, which includes the same wording from Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu, who also added that this layoff is intended to make Square more "<em>lean</em>" and <em>"agile</em>." The cuts will save Square 3 billion yen annually, according to the company's projections.</p>



<p>Along with the cost savings, the cuts are meant to bring work that developers are doing at Square Enix closer to home, so to speak. In the progress report, Square says the decision came by intending "<em>To strengthen development capabilities from a Group-wide perspective and to optimize resource allocation for maximizing the value generated by IPs, a further review of the development pipeline was conducted. As a result, a decision was made to close overseas development studios and shift toward consolidating development functions in Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>Square is not the only Asia-based developer moving away from branching studios in other parts of the world. Shortly after a successful launch for Marvel Rivals, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-releases-statement-on-western-marvel-rivals-team-layoffs/">NetEase cut its California-based team</a> as part a restructuring to keep work on the game closer to its home studio. NetEase also shut down two of its subsidiaries, one yesterday, and one today, as part of its continuing restructuring to limit the number of branching studios it has in the Western world.</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/">Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down with the loss of NetEase's support</a>, and today, NetEase closed Toronto-based studio, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-has-closed-yet-another-game-studio-funded-just-two-years-ago/">Bad Brain Game Studios</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-too-many-apps.1346170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814054/nintendo-store-app-ios-android-games-shop">a new store app</a> on Android and iOS giving users the ability to purchase hardware, accessories, and games for the Switch and Switch 2. When I open my phone and scroll down to the N’s, I get a neat, full row dedicated entirely to Nintendo. That’s four apps: the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15995098/nintendo-switch-online-app-out-now-ios-android">Switch app</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">the music app</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637319/nintendo-today-news-app">the Nintendo Today news app</a>, and now the store. (The tally increases to five if you’re a parent using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676982/nintendo-switch-2-parental-controls-app-gamechat-restrictions">Switch Parental Controls app</a>.) And it is entirely too much.</p><p>Nintendo has always been the one company of the big three publishers that does its own thing, and that’s worked both for and against it. The company hasn’t chased development trends with the same zeal as Microsoft and Sony. That insulates Nintendo when those trends don’t pan out, like exorbitant spending on live-service games that fail. But also hurts it when it comes to performance and user experience. Console-native voice chat, for example, has been a standard on other platforms for a long time, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">but was only offered on a Nintendo console with the Switch 2 this year</a>.</p><p>With the deployment of these apps, Nintendo is both trying to innovate and playing catch-up with results that feel confusing and overwhelming. Do we really need four distinct apps? That’s not to say these apps shouldn’t exist; they serve valuable and necessary purposes. But when I look at all the programs I have to manage in my Nintendo life, it just feels like it’s too much.</p><p>You need the Switch app for screen captures and social features. You need the store to buy things. While one doesn’t <em>need</em> the Nintendo Today app, it does have useful features, like release date reminders, and it has been used to share announcements <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/638133/legend-of-zelda-movie-premiere-date-2027">before they come down other official channels</a>. The music app also isn’t a hard need, but Nintendo doesn’t make its music available on streaming services, and searching YouTube for music can be hit or miss.</p><p>It’s also strange that the apps cannibalize features. I can see my play activity in both the store and the console app. The store also has a news page that’s more robust than what’s on offer in Nintendo Today. Could we not just combine all these into one central location? PlayStation and Xbox do in their apps, and it’s a seamless experience to jump from my PS5 screenshots to the PS Store.</p><p>I will grant that the music app should be kept separate, as it seems a bit unwieldy to throw a music player on top of what should be a singular administrative app. But even that feels like it’s an overcomplicated solution to a simple problem. Nintendo is precious about its IP, sure, but why does that have to mean that instead of listening to official tracks on Spotify I have to download a bespoke app just for one company’s library? Since using the music app requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, I wonder if siloing its music like this is a way to enhance the appeal of its subscription. I also wonder if it has anything to do with a reticence to pay royalties. In the music app, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">Nintendo doesn’t credit composers</a>, something it’d be required to do if it offered its music up to streaming services.</p><p>As the gaming industry continues to mature, companies are realizing that not only are they in competition with other game makers for people’s time and attention, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21123956/microsoft-xbox-competitors-phil-spencer-cloud-gaming-amazon-google">but with social media too</a>. And while other companies try strategies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809053/halo-playstation-xbox-multiplatform-strategy">bringing their exclusives to other platforms</a>, Nintendo seems to be going in a much more ambitious direction.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/management/message.html">in a statement posted on Nintendo’s investor relations website</a>, president Shuntaro Furukawa wrote, “We hope for Nintendo to be a name that people naturally turn to, part of everyday life and there for families as they grow.” You can see that strategy in products like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Alarmo</a>, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fjp%2Fmy-mario%2Fgoods%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">the My Mario children’s line</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/797623/pikmin-close-to-you-nintendo-pictures">its animation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/analysis/706610/donkey-kong-movie-copyright-notice-nintendo-strategy">movie projects</a>, theme parks, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/756718/nintendo-super-mario-kids-hello-mario-free-app">Hello, Mario</a>, yet another app designed specifically for kids. That’s a lot to have going on, and it’s clear that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23695720/nintendo-mario-movie-billion-box-office">some strategies seem to be working</a>. But if Nintendo isn’t more careful about how (and how much) it’s deploying these apps, people are gonna start clearing up space — if not in their lives, then at least in their phones.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/815741/nintendo-apps-nintendo-store-nintendo-music]]></content:encoded>

In particular, Battlefield 6 fans have been requesting bigger maps in Conquest, and they didn't wait around for Battlefield Studios to do it. Instead, a handful of fans have created their own big maps with Battlefield Portal and REDSEC.</p><p>Reddit users andy_6170 and kurtinthegrind have joined forces to create Club House, a Conquest play area that has plenty of space for large scale battles to break out. There are options for bots or botless versions of Club House, as well as servers that can support 64 real players. The Conquest and Tech Center options open up most of the map, while Operation Tech Center offers a smaller-scale experience in and around a single building. As described by the creators, Conquest mode features "vehicles, semi-urban areas ideal for infantry fights, and hills perfect for snipers. It's also a great map for helicopter combat!"</p><p>Separately, Battlefield lead producer David Sirland wrote on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1985980359436083539" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> that the game needs "more of the large sandbox types for sure though!"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In 1995, a 14-year-old teen in Australia, Eduards Nits, went to McDonald’s with friends. They bought some food, including a Quarter Pounder hamburger. But one friend, seemingly full of other food, couldn’t eat the burger. He asked Nits to hold on to it until he returned. He never came back. Weeks passed. Then years. Then decades. And now Nits and his longtime friend Casey Dean are the owners of <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/04/lifestyle/worlds-oldest-mcdonalds-quarter-pounder-turns-30-years-old/">a 30-year-old burger</a> from McDonald’s.</p> <p><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/strange-debate-worlds-oldest-mcdonalds-burgers-21114479.php">As explained in a recent interview with <em>SFGate</em>,</a> the decades-old burger, now commonly referred to as Senior Burger, has not grown moldy or stinky in the last 30 years. The burger has instead shrunken up and turned into a hard, brick-like object. The two friends still have the original wrapper and container the burger came in, including a thin piece of brown wax paper that wrapped around the burger when they bought it back in the 1990s. This is one of the pieces of evidence they use to prove their claims that the burger is indeed from 1995. Sadly, the receipt was lost to time as the duo never planned on keeping the burger for decades.</p>

 <p>“It no longer looks like a hamburger,” Nits told the outlet. “It’s no longer food. It just looks like artwork.” According to the duo, who consider themselves the keepers of what they claim to be the oldest McDonald’s burger on the planet, Senior Burger was never put in a fridge and instead was stored in old boxes, cupboards, and closets. It’s toured Australia, with Nits’ mother, a teacher, even taking it to school to show her class.</p>

  <p>Sadly, because the duo lacks a receipt, the burger can’t be officially verified as 30 years old by The Guinness Book of World Records. But that doesn’t matter to the friends as they see Senior Burger as a piece of history that will be passed on to future generations. As for McDonald’s, they don’t seem to be fans of the old hamburger, likely because it makes their food look rather unnatural. 30 years and no mold, fungus, or stink? Is that even beef? McDonald’s says so and claims old burgers like this stay well preserved thanks to being kept in dry locations.</p> <p>Regardless of all that, I want to take a bite of this thing. Would it kill me? Maybe. Would it taste horrible? Definitely. But damn, I’d love to be able to write a review on <em>Kotaku</em> about eating the world’s oldest burger.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Square Enix has released a statement to the media regarding the layoffs. However, they didn’t clarify the number of people being let go, and Insider Gaming has asked for more clarification. </p>



<p>The full statement is as follows:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are reorganizing our operations in North America and Europe to strengthen our development structure and to drive a globally integrated marketing strategy. This was an extremely difficult decision, made following careful consideration and analysis by our leadership, in order to best position the Group’s long-term growth.</p>



<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the talented team members who will be departing the company for their significant contributions to Square Enix. During this period of transition, we remain committed to treating each individual with the utmost respect and providing extensive support throughout this process.</p>
</blockquote>



<hr>



<p><strong><em>Original Story:</em></strong> Square Enix is letting go more than 100 employees in a global mass layoff.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Square Enix is letting go up to 137 people in the United Kingdom (UK) along with an unknown number of people in the United States (US).</p>



<p>The layoffs were announced in a video call with staff located outside of Japan. These cuts will impact those working in marketing, publishing, business planning, QA, IT, and more. Staff being let go will start being notified on Thursday. Full details on what Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu called a <strong>“fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization” </strong>will be given in the future.</p>



<p><strong>“In the current fiscal year, a fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization is being implemented with the aim of further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">presentation shown</a> first to staff before being made public said.</p>



<p>It has also been reported that those not let go from the company will be required to work more often in office. </p>



<p>They also come the same day the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/square-enix-wants-ai-to-handle-70-of-qa-within-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said it wants to have 70%</a> of its QA and debugging handled by AI by the end of 2027. It’s unclear, however, if this plan attributed to the current round of job cuts.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Square Enix for comment on the layoffs. Should a response be received or a statement be made public, it will be added to this story.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s collaboration with KPop Demon Hunters is not done yet, if new leaks are to be believed. The first wave of the collab saw a bundle of skins based on the HUNTR/X trio hit the item shop, while the seasonal Horde Rush mode got a KPop Demon Hunters-themed makeover. Now, <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1986484452563034475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">word is</a> that KPop Demon Hunters will return to Fortnite with a jam track for the song "Golden."</p><p>The KPop Demon Hunters collab was noticeably missing any jam tracks or dance emotes with music from the Netflix film. That absence was likely the result of how quickly the collab was put together. Since the movie wasn't expected to be such a massive hit, the deal might have gone from conception to fruition in just a couple months--that's lightning speed for something like this.</p><p>Right now, the only leak about further KPop Demon Hunters content in Fortnite is about the jam track for "Golden." It's possible that other HUNTR/X jam tracks could be added, or that a new wave of skins could come with the tracks, but there's no info about that just yet. The members of HUNTR/X are also prime candidates for the next music pass in December, but there haven't been any leaks about future Festival-season headliners.</p><p>Fortnite has followed up the packed Halloween event that introduced the KPop Demon Hunters to Epic's metaverse with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">Simpsons takeover over of the main Battle Royale mode</a>, which has boosted Battle Royale and Zero Build to their highest player counts of the year so far.</p>

                <p>Square Enix is enacting a round of mass layoffs, according to multiple reports. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN </a>and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reported that Square Enix informed affected staff today that cuts are being made as part of a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization," referring to the company's Western business.</p><p>Cuts are beng made in Europe and America to help Square Enix become more "lean" and "agile," president Takashi Kiryu told staff. The extent of the cuts was not confirmed, but VGC reported that at almost 140 people at the London office alone were "at risk" of being laid off. </p><p>The cuts are affecting various departments, including IT, marketing, publishing, sales, QA, and business planning, the report said.</p><p>In 2024, Square Enix also made cuts to its Western teams. Square Enix also sold assets as part of its reorganization effort, selling developers like Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montreal, and Square Enix Montreal to Embracer. </p><p>Square Enix's latest earnings briefing included <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a slide</a> detailing how the company would conduct a "fundamental restructuring of the overseas publishing organization" with the aim of "further strengthening global publishing capabilities and improving operational efficiency."</p><p>Square Enix is projecting an annual cost savings of more than 3 billion yen ($19.6 million) as part of the restructuring.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a035113dba7af"><a title="Third-Party Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a035113dba7af/third-party-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has gotten off to a bit of a weird start.</p>
<p>Although there’s no denying that the console has been a massive commercial success since its launch on 5th June 2025 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">officially selling over 10 million units</a> — there’s a niggling, underlying sense of dissatisfaction amongst some fans regarding Nintendo’s first-party lineup (and let's just save Game-Key Cards for another time, hm?).</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to see why. Disregarding ‘Switch 2 Editions’, we’ve had a total of five first-party exclusives for the system so far: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, and now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Certainly not a bad start, but I'd argue that out of these, only Bananza has received (almost) universal acclaim. Even Mario Kart World, widely regarded as Switch 2's 'killer app' before launch, has been criticised for its structure and open world.</p>
<p>And although Bananza has been praised far and wide for its satisfying, chaotic gameplay, there’s nevertheless a feeling that this isn’t <em>quite</em> what fans want in the system's first year. Donkey Kong, as beloved as he is, isn’t Mario.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7d7b0ae6e6c7"><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7d7b0ae6e6c7/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that’s the issue, right? Although on the surface, a brand-new Mario Kart game and a 3D Donkey Kong platformer <em>should</em> be slam dunks for Nintendo, they both kind of fall short for some. Compare this to 2017 when the original Switch saw the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_2">Splatoon 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> all in the first year, and I can understand the frustration. <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, too!... - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>I, however, have not felt any of this, and it’s down to one simple reason: third-party games. I can distinctly remember those first few months after the Switch’s launch; outside of Breath of the Wild and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, I spent the majority of my time playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thumper">Thumper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These were great games and I don’t for one moment regret my time with them, but goodness, they were pretty much my only options for a while.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, it's the polar opposite. Third-party support has been absolutely <em>phenomenal</em> right out of the gate, and I’ve already sunk hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and more. I frankly can’t keep up.</p>
<figure data-uuid="47dc14a77a03e"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47dc14a77a03e/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus / Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch got good third-party support too, of course, particularly as its sales exploded. But hardware limitations proved to be a significant barrier over time, and for years I’ve been gazing longingly at games on other platforms and thinking, <em>'Cool, but I wish this was on Switch.'</em></p>
<p>We've been dreaming of a time when third-party publishers would go above and beyond to support a Nintendo system — the dark days of the Wii U still loom in my mind — and the Switch 2 already feels like a realisation of that dream. No longer does it feel like we’ve been left behind, and we already have publishers planning launches for flagship games day-and-date with other platforms.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. For years, Capcom has leaned almost exclusively on PlayStation for its marketing, but the company appears to have shifted that focus over to Switch 2 for its upcoming release. The original Switch, as capable as it was, couldn’t handle Capcom’s more recent RE games natively, and so they were relegated to ‘Cloud Version’ status. They felt like an afterthought, with Capcom razor-focused on advertising its flagship titles on Sony's consoles - no real surprise when you consider RE started on PS1.</p>

<p>Not anymore. Now that Switch 2 can fight the other platforms' fire with fire, Capcom clearly sees enormous potential. Cue the announcement of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">special edition themed Pro Controller and a Requiem amiibo</a>, and it’s looking more and more obvious that the Switch 2 is a high priority to accelerate Capcom's growth.</p>
<p>And let’s be fair, the PlayStation audience know Resident Evil very well at this point; it seems unlikely that this shift will greatly affect Requiem’s performance on Sony's console.</p>
<p>Has every third-party effort been perfect? No. A few games, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, prove — at least at launch — that performance can still hit a few snags on Switch 2, while we've still yet to receive a firm release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> after a last-minute delay.</p>
<p>There are some teething issues, then, but by and large, I think we can expect great things from third parties. Even when the PS6 and whatever the heck Microsoft is cooking up launch, it's likely that games will remain scalable enough to run on Switch 2 without looking and performing like crap.</p>
<p>We're very much in an era of diminishing returns regarding raw power, so I feel like pretty much any game launching on Switch 2 will at least look good, if not great. And publishers who perhaps weren't as invested in the Switch certainly won't want to make the same mistake twice with the Switch 2. So if they can scale a high-end game down just enough so that it impresses visually yet still performs well, you can bet they'll be doing it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="60d1aca42bb2f"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60d1aca42bb2f/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So if you're someone who generally sticks with first-party software, I'd urge you to branch out and see what else is out there. I understand the frustration if you feel these first months have been a bit lacking. As for me? If this level of third-party support holds for the years ahead, I can honestly see Switch 2 becoming my primary console for almost <em>everything</em> bar PS5 exclusives.</p>
<p>It's just that good.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/">Relic Entertainment</a> has announced that a new DLC for Company of Heroes 3 is set to arrive later this month on November 27, 2025. The Company of Heroes 3: Endure and Defy Battlegroup DLC expansion will add four new battlegroups, each with its own play styles, new powerful units, and more when it arrives on PC later this month.</p>



<p>Each of the new battlegroups has been designed for both multiplayer and co-op/skirmish AI modes, with US Forces getting the Italian Partisan Battlegroup, the Wehrmacht getting the Last Stand Battlegroup, the British Forces getting the Polish Cavalry Battlegroup, and the Deutsches Afrikakorps getting the Kriegsmarine Battlegroup.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Company of Heroes 3 - Endure &amp; Defy Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The teaser trailer shows a bit of the new battle groups in action, though Relic Entertainment said in a press release that it will be putting out more information about the coming expansion as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>The Italian Partisan battlegroup is a class of resistance fighters and saboteurs to help enhance your ground forces in battle. They can sabotage your enemy with tunnel networks to plant underground explosives, steal resources, and wreak havoc behind enemy lines. The Last Stand Battlegroup is all about defending the line with new vehicles to bolster your defences, while the Polish Calvary battlegroup add strong lancer sections to the front line. They especially thrive against veteran enemies.</p>



<p>When the DLC arrives, it'll be available at a 10% launch discount for its first two weeks. For those who've not yet even jumped into the base game for Company of Heroes 3, it'll be 60% off for a limited time as part of a Black Friday sale.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has acknowledged a mistake with its new Simpsons update in Fortnite pertaining to the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.</p><p>After the new season began, people quickly noticed that an image of Apu shows the character with the <a href="https://x.com/MemeManTweets/status/1985126383396274588" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same yellow skin tone</a> as his fellow <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Be_Sharps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Be Sharps</a> quartet members Homer, Barney, and Principal Skinner.</p><p>This was a mistake and Epic will fix it. "This wasn't intentional. It's being adjusted in our next release," <a href="https://x.com/fortnitestatus/status/1986245741820743979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic said</a>.</p><p>The picture can be found in Moe's Tavern, and the venue also hosts a picture of Homer, Moe, Otto, and Apu, and in that photo, Apu has the <a href="https://x.com/nescartridges/status/1985572143141126357" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">screen-accurate skin tone from the TV show</a>. Given that, many assumed this was an oversight on Epic's part, and that does indeed seem to be true.</p><p>Apu has been sidelined in some ways on The Simpsons TV series, as the character has not spoken a word on the show for years after actor Hank Azaria announced that he would stop voicing him. This came after the documentary The Problem with Apu brought up a discussion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-responds-to-apu-controversy-and-some-/1100-6458105/" data-ref-id="1100-6458105">negative racial stereotypes.</a></p><p>The Fortnite x Simpsons season has been a big hit, propelling Fortnite to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-simpsons-update-led-to-a-huge-surge-in-players-the-most-in-a-long-time/1100-6535919/" data-ref-id="1100-6535919">biggest player numbers since 2024.</a></p><p>The new Fortnite season, which runs through November 29, brings a new Springfield map to Fortnite featuring locations like Moe's Tavern, the Kwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield nuclear plant. There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/" data-ref-id="2900-7205">new Simpsons battle pass</a>, which includes skins for characters like Homer and Marge, along with variants like Stupid Sexy Flanders. Epic is also offering up a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-fortnite-glider-how-to-unlock-the-simpsons-dlc-right-now-before-it-costs-money/1100-6535889/" data-ref-id="1100-6535889">free Kang and Kodos glider for people who link their Epic and MyDisney accounts.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Fortnite dataminers believe they've found evidence pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dataminers-suggest-harry-potter-and-spongebob-collabs-could-be-next/1100-6535870/">future collaborations with SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter</a>.</p>

Even Scrappy, everyone's favorite rooster, is getting in on the fun.</p><p>Alongside a new patch, Arc Raiders has some new looks for the fashion-forward players by way of the new Wilderness Scout and Leviathan sets. The former is the more affordable of the two and will cost players 1,150 raider tokens, which translates to $10. The latter, which is a bit more extravagant, will run folks 1,600 tokens, or roughly $15.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1986478734539452567" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📡Store update<br>Whether you're cutting new paths topside or wading through the muck for buried treasure, gear up like a true survivor.<br>The Leviathan Set and Wilderness Scout Set are out now; built for those who know the world still has wonders left to find. <a href="https://t.co/ZsCIe8H3A2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/ZsCIe8H3A2</a></p>  — ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1986478734539452567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The Wilderness Scout set is more toned-down than its companion and most resembles common hiking gear. The player is outfitted in a long coat (whose colorways can be changed), tights and ice cleats, as well as a sort of aviation helmet. The helmet's visor can be kept up or down, and the whole headpiece can be toggled off, revealing the set's soot-covered skin, recalling the defining look of Furiosa from George Miller's recent Mad Max movies.</p><p>The Leviathan set, as the name might suggest, is far more nautical. The whole thing resembles a kind of old-fashioned diving suit, complete with a lavish fishbowl helmet that'll definitely raise an eyebrow or two in the heat of battle. I'm burning up just thinking of wearing that thing in the desert.</p><p>The Leviathan skin comes with an oxygen tank, and a backpack covered in netting, as well as what appears to be some barnacles. I wouldn't loot that thing with a 10-foot (and deeply sterilized) pole.</p><p>Additionally, Scrappy, the rooster who frequents players' home base and scavenges for materials, can be equipped with a miniaturized version of the Leviathan diving helmet as part of the Deep Sea Bird set, which is going for another $10.</p><p>That isn't all players should expect though. A new update that just released will be rolling out new map conditions for folks to experience, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-reveals-new-map-in-november-quests-and-more-in-the-months-ahead/1100-6535859/" data-ref-id="1100-6535859">pair of exciting updates</a> are coming to Arc Raiders over the next few months, introducing new quests, gear, maps, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's not often that a developer comes out to publicly criticize another's work, and yet that is precisely what Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Game Director Daniel Vávra did yesterday <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1985848222707765440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via his X account</a>. The game he targeted was Obsidian's latest roleplaying game, The Outer Worlds 2, which he scored 7 out of 10. Arguably, the most scathing bit was that, even with 'Microsoft's money' (<a href="https://wccftech.com/inxile-entertainment-acquired-microsoft/">Obsidian was acquired in November 2018 by Microsoft</a>, alongside inXile), they haven't managed to innovate in the last fifteen years following the release of Fallout: New Vegas, which Vávra ranks among his favorite games.</p>



<p>Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Finished. 7/10. But what I find sad is that the company and the people who gave us one of my favorite games ever (Fallout: New Vegas) have been unable, even after 15 years and with all of Microsoft's money and latest technological advances, to come up with a single new game mechanic that could take this proven but ancient formula somewhere new. Can any of you think of a single new game mechanic in The Outer Worlds that wasn't already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago? Unfortunately, I can't. Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens, and level grinding in a static, scripted world.</em></p>



<p>When a follower pointed out that even Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn't really add any new mechanics, Vávra protested that it does feature the simulation of thousands of NPCs and their daily routines. </p>



<p>It is indeed true that KCD2 is a much more detailed simulation than The Outer Worlds 2. The latter does inflict bounties when you're caught stealing stuff, but the NPCs do not have true routines, and they do not really object much to your character being inside their homes, just as an example.</p>



<p>While I do generally prefer a simulated world, it's not really an innovative feature, either. Bethesda has had it in their games since The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), at the very least. All that is to say that this is hardly an innovative badge Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 can grab for itself.</p>



<p>As for The Outer Worlds 2, I've also recently completed the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">I had my fair share of criticism to levy at the first one</a>, but I much agree <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with our reviewer David Carcasole</a> that the sequel exhibits many improvements. Although there may not be brand-new RPG mechanics, the developers certainly pushed for a lot more player choice in various ways, thus subtly boosting its roleplaying potential (and even the replayability factor). </p>



<p>Besides, it's not exactly easy to innovate at this point in videogames. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 managed it with its turn-based combat mixed with real-time elements, but did Baldur's Gate 3 truly bring new mechanics, or was it just an incredible execution and never-before-seen presentation for a gargantuan cRPG? I rather lean toward the latter. </p>



<p>There's also the fact that badmouthing a fellow developer like that isn't likely to win a lot of fans. Regardless, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a great roleplaying game</a>, and it's getting its final DLC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a>, next Tuesday. The game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for free this weekend</a> on PC and Xbox, for those who are still on the fence about it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak released an onslaught of new information about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> this morning, and between new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span>, returning characters, and a new storyline, one major change has fans scared. No, not in the “Game Freak is changing something we love and we don’t like it” way, but in the “oh, shit, this DLC might be one of the hardest challenges </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s ever had” way.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>will take players to a “Hyperspace” version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span> with new Pokémon and Mega Evolutions not typically found in the main game. The wild Pokémon in this bizarre place will have “Hyperspace Levels” that exceed the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series’ typical level-100 cap. And not by just a few levels, either. Some of the Pokémon shown in the trailers are dozens of levels higher than 100. There’s a level 164 Galarian Marowak, and I don’t think my level 100 Starmie’s Surf is going to cut it. So what is a trainer to do against these superpowered monsters? It seems like Ansha, a new character who debuts in the DLC, is your secret weapon. She and Hoopa create donuts that give your team temporary level boosts so they can venture into Hyperspace and go toe-to-toe with these “hyper strong” Pokémon, but it looks like you’ll have to gather berries and other ingredients for them to bake with. It sounds like a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>roguelike of sorts, with you making multiple runs into Hyperspace with different donut loadouts.</span></p>

  <p><span>While there will be a system enabling players to overcome these fights, it’s still kind of terrifying to see wild Pokémon with levels that are astronomically higher than the series typically allows. For decades, level 100 has been the peak of the mountain, and even that was often reserved for online battles against real players. Now, we can just stumble across random Pokémon who are nearly twice that, and fans are reeling.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My reaction when I witnessed a number beyond 100 in Pokemon <a href="https://t.co/tlQxPMAgsj">pic.twitter.com/tlQxPMAgsj</a></p> <p>— KGP (@KGPrestige) <a href="https://twitter.com/KGPrestige/status/1986446541356474438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’re telling me we got level 200 pokemon before Mega Flygon</p> <p>— Agency Seven Star General blunder (@Thunderblunder7) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thunderblunder7/status/1986439900921553397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In order to encounter Pokémon above level 100 first you have to fast travel to the Pokémon center closest to the train station and talk to the old man.

              <p>The Most Magical Place on Earth has seen an increase in death. Four people have died at <a href="https://kotaku.com/disneyland-world-cheapest-price-time-ticket-prices-fast-1849733205">Disney World in Orlando, Florida</a>, in the last 20 days.</p> <p>On November 2, <a href="https://ew.com/fourth-disney-world-guest-dies-in-1-month-11844355">as reported by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a>, a woman in her 40s visiting Disney World was taken to a local hospital, where she died. The news was confirmed by a representative from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office via a statement shared with the outlet. No cause of death was shared, but authorities denied “foul play.” Disney World didn’t provide a comment when asked by <em>EW</em>.</p> <p>This is the fourth parkgoer to die in the last few weeks. On October 16,&nbsp; Summer Equitz reportedly committed suicide while staying at Disney World’s Contemporary Resort hotel located near Magic Kingdom. Five days later, a man in his 60s was found unresponsive in his bed located at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground. His wife called 911, and medical personnel arrived and took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Two days later, on October 23, another guest at the Contemporary Resort died after a reported “medical emergency.” And then the previously mentioned death on November 2 occurred, less than two weeks later. <a href="https://ew.com/disneyland-guest-dies-haunted-mansion-11826288">Also, on October 7</a>, a woman in her 60s died after riding the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland in California. She was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead.</p> <p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">While none of these deaths occurred inside the actual theme parks or on a ride, they did happen in and around Disney property, which includes many hotels, restaurants, highways, and more. At the moment, these deaths have not been directly connected to Disney World or Disneyland personnel, food, or infrastructure.</p> <p>Still, for a place that markets itself as the happiest and most magical place on Earth, the body count is getting shockingly high. Of course, <a href="https://www.damfirm.com/disney-deaths/">deaths have happened at Disney World before</a>, but the frequency of these recent events has put the park in the spotlight in a way I imagine Disney execs aren’t excited about.</p>

<p>And you can upgrade from Switch 1, too</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>At last, <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1986478837384028422">Sega has confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> launches on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> for <strong>$69.99</strong>, right in time for the holidays (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-launches-december-4">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>Note that a physical release, where the game is fully on the cart, will be following in early 2026.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already bought the game on Switch 1, you'll be able to purchase an upgrade pack for <strong>$10</strong> (or your regional equivalent) — <em>plus</em> if you grab that pack before 10th December, you'll get a 50% discount. $5 it is, then.</p>
<p>Those of you who'll be grabbing the game on Switch 2 before 17th December will also get the Werehog Pack DLC as a free bonus.</p>
<p>Originally launching on the Switch back in September, Sonic Racing CrossWorld has already sold over 1 million units and has been receiving frequent guest character updates. Just today, Like A Dragon's own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">Ichiban Kasuga has joined the roster</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-racing-crossworlds">review of the Switch 1 version</a>, penned by our very own Mitch Vogel, was full of praise for the karting and racing, but said the performance on the older console was "disappointing". The Switch 2 version <em>should</em> fix those issues, then...</p>
<p>And hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-sonic-racing-crossworlds-mario-kart-world-and-its-not-even-close-for-me">someone here at Nintendo Life</a> think it's better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby</a>, watch out, the hedgehog is back.</p>

			<p>Research and analysis firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">Alinea Analytics reports</a> that ARC Raiders, the new third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has reached 2.5 million copies sold across all platforms in its debut week, with the vast majority of those sales coming from PC players.</p>



<p>According to Alinea Analytics, across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, 69% of ARC Raiders sales came from PC players on Steam, with 17.3% coming from PlayStation players and the remaining 13% coming from Xbox players.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was already clear that ARC Raiders was having a strong commercial start <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">when it surpassed 200K concurrent players on Steam on its launch day</a> (and eventually hit over 260K). As its debut week came to a close, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimates-range-1-6-1-9-million-units-on-steam/">analysts predicted it had sold somewhere between 1.6 and 1.9 million copies</a>.</p>



<p>The real number is, thankfully for Embark Studios, even higher than those predictions, as the studio also collects well over $100 million in revenue from the game being on the market for one week. It's handily a bigger launch than Embark Studio's other major multiplayer game, The Finals, and could very well outlast it partly because of its different approach as a premium release and not a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Of course, the new extraction shooter still has a long way to go. It passed the first hurdle for a multiplayer game by having a great launch, and now the real test becomes its capacity for longevity. Right now, ARC Raiders has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1w">yet to fall below 90K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and even its dip below 100K was only for a very short period of time.</p>



<p>If we're still seeing numbers like that from ARC Raiders in a year, then we'll have a much better sample size for how successful this game can really be. Speaking of what's to come for ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">put out a roadmap for the game's updates for the rest of the year, which you can check out here</a>.</p>

Later this month, Relic is adding a new Battlegroup DLC, Endure &amp; Defy, which may shake up the war during multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs, A.I. fights.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ryr8UF4SX4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each of the four factions is getting their own battlegroup. The U.S. forces will have access to the Italian Partisans, a resistance group that aids their efforts behind enemy lines through sabotage, hidden tunnels, and fighters who will go into battle alongside your troops.</p><p>Germany's Wehrmacht will receive a Last Stand battlegroup that exists to slow down the Allied advance with imposing new vehicles including the Borgward Wanze and Pantherturm. The Last Stand group can also demoralize their enemy through propaganda towers, Panzerfaust rollouts, and improvised barrages.</p><p>British forces will be given backup from the Polish cavalry battlegroup, which thrives against veteran soldiers with a deep desire for revenge against the Nazis. The cavalry is equipped with heavy weaponry, Polish-crewed Sherman Fireflies, and Land Mattresses.</p><p>Deutsches Afrikakorps--aka Germany's Africa expedition force--is getting support from the German navy, the Kriegsmarine. This battlegroup can fortify positions with "catastrophic fire support" while opening up supply chains for troops. The Kriegsmarine can provide supply drops, engineering know-how, and "combat flexibility."</p><p>Company of Heroes 3 Battlegroup DLC - Endure &amp; Defy will drop November 27 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677280/Company_of_Heroes_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. It's regular price is $25, but it will be offered at 10% off that price for the first two weeks. During that time, new players can also purchase the core Company of Heroes 3 game for 60% off its normal $60 price.</p>

The game has been widely praised for its immersive (and challenging) gameplay, exploration, and storytelling. We awarded the game a 9.5 out of 10 in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/a-medieval-day-epic">our review</a>, with editor Wesley LeBlanc saying, “KCD2 is challenging, demanding, and often unforgiving. But, like the sharp blades I smithed in-game, through fire, it forges an exciting, surprising, and unforgettable fable.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/06/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-on-xbox-and-steam]]></content:encoded>
