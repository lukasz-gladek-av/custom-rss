Just like clockwork, one day on, the company has shared an infographic summarising every game that featured.</p>
<p>While it might not have been a presentation of wall-to-wall bangers, there is something quite nice about seeing every game in one image, no? Sure, the biggies like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> immediately draw the eye, but a closer look reminds us that the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/valheim">Valheim</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a> also made an appearance.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ygvwuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nintendo shared the image across its social channels, helpfully splitting the announcements up into Switch 2, Switch 2 / 1 and Switch 1 releases, so you can see what's coming up, regardless of which console you own. Here's a closer look at the graphic itself:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f74f5d9845519"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase - Feb 2026" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74f5d9845519/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-feb-2026.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DUajL7qjgI5/">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We'd say that it's not a bad line-up, all in all. Perhaps not the most surprise-packed Direct in recent memory, but there's no denying that the 2026 release calendar is looking particularly stacked for Switch 2.</p>

			<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a role-playing game that has already become <strong>legendary</strong>, less than one year after its release. Sweeping <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/"><strong>multiple Game of the Year awards</strong></a><strong> </strong>in recognition of its narrative and gameplay achievements, the game developed by French development studio Sandfall Interactive is set to have a lasting influence on the RPG genre as a whole, and it's safe to bet the first <em>Clair Obscur-like</em> game won't take too long to see the light of day.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>These awards</strong></a>, however, may be nothing compared to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">high cultural honor</strong> Sandfall Interactive has now received.</p>

Each will be $299.99, which is slightly more expensive than the $269.99 black or white versions of the console. The new colors include extreme green, ocean, atomic purple, ghost, and glacier, with the last three options being subtler alternatives to the colored collection that launched last December.</p><p>Alongside the new color options, and also available in limited quantities, will be color-matched versions of the 8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller launching on the same day for $44.99 — which is about $5 more expensive than the standard version.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-big-on-portable-bluetooth-speakers-soundlink-plus-restocks-at-a-record-low-for-another-clearance-push-2000662395</link>
            <guid>1428289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose SoundLink Plus is a portable wireless speaker that’s designed for both indoor and outdoor use. A compact, rectangular body with a looped carrying strap makes it easy to hang, grab, or slip into a bag when you’re ready to go. It’s built to be rugged, dustproof, and waterproof (IP67), allowing it to handle wet, sandy conditions and random rain showers without interrupting your music. Plus, its battery lasts up to 20 hours, providing solid playtime for your playlists, podcasts, and background music until you need to recharge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">Go to Amazon and buy the Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $199, down from its original price of $269, for a savings of $70 and 26%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful speaker that projects sound beautifully</h2>
<p>The sound produced by the Soundlink Plus is engineered to produce rich bass and clean mids, making your music feel full and robust, not thin. The speaker can produce enough decibels to comfortably fill a room or an outdoor area, making it perfect for both relaxing background listening and concentrated sessions. So, whether you’re playing music, podcasts, or dialogue-driven shows, this speaker will provide enough presence to make them audible.</p>
<p>Portability and durability were key factors in the design of this speaker. The loop allows you to hang it securely or attach it to a strap, while the durable outer shell protects against minor mishaps like drops and knocks. Since the speaker is also dustproof and waterproof, you can place it on a picnic table, a beach towel, a poolside ledge, etc., without worrying about damaging it. You can also use the speaker to charge your mobile device if needed, as it can double as a power bank.</p>



<p>Wireless features extend the capabilities of the SoundLink Plus beyond a single-speaker setup when you want to expand coverage. For example, you can pair two SoundLink Plus speakers together for greater stereo width, or engage Party Mode with other Bose portable speakers to play the same track across multiple locations. Bose’s SimpleSync feature also lets this speaker connect with certain Bose smart soundbars and speakers, which can be convenient when you want to send a movie or playlist to other parts of your home without physically moving speakers.</p>
<p>The Bose SoundLink Plus Portable Bluetooth Speaker has an IP67 rating, an estimated 20 hours of battery life, a USB-C charging port, the ability to fine-tune your EQ via the Bose app, and the ability to pair with multiple speakers using multi-speaker modes, all at a reduced price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7081/">At $199, compared to the regular retail price of $269, this is a great deal for a high-quality portable wireless speaker to use as your primary music source at home or on the go.</a></p>

These images are from the games’ 2024 beta, so ideally, they’ll look more polished when we see them later this month. We can see several varied environments, including an underwater area, a frozen tundra, grassy fields, and a city. Some of them are very clearly from an early stage in development, though, where a lot of the general shapes are laid out but the details and textures haven’t been added yet.</span></p>

<p>Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 was supposed to arrive on March 4, 2026, but is now arriving on March 19. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 of Fortnite introduces a bunch of new content, including a brand new island, new weapons, collaborations with Hollywood, including Back to the Future and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kill Bill</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Park</a> crossover, and so much more. It seems players will now have to spend some more time with this Season, until Epic Games works on CH7S2. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-now-arrives-on-march-19">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 Now Arrives on March 19 </h2>



<p>A new post on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019788648376393947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) by the official Fortnite Status account confirms that Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 2 will now release on March 19, 15 days later than intended. It also includes the caption “opens the loot vault &amp; starts cooking” with a ‘Let Him Build’ version of the Let Him Cook meme. It seems that Fortnite is hinting that they have something special in the works with the upcoming Season, and that’s the reason for the holdup. </p>



<p>Players have a little over a month until the next season begins, and there is a lot to look forward to. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-february-2026-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February roadmap</a> reveals details on events, maps, skins, collabs, and more coming throughout the month. Additionally, the game’s director has teased a “fun update” coming in February, which is designed to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-director-teases-fun-update-to-spice-up-current-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spice things up</a>” in the current season. </p>



<p>In other news, Paul Heyman wants players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paul-heyman-wwe-2k26-play-instead-fortnite-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play WWE 2K26</a> instead of Call of Duty and Fortnite.

            <p>The House of the Dead is being adapted into a film, and today we have some news about its casting.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was announced Isabela Merced is set to lead the movie adaptation based on Sega's zombie shooter. These won't be the first zombies Merced has seen, with the actress recently starring as Dina in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation.</p>
<p>As well as The Last of Us, Merced has also starred in Superman and Alien: Romulus.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/">Deadline</a>, the upcoming House of the Dead film is a "a top Sega priority" after the success of the company's Sonic the Hedgehog films. The adaptation is coming from Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson, who has also written the script. According to the publication, Anderson's House of the Dead film will  have a "fresh take" on the franchise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Anderson will also serve as a producer</a>, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. In addition, Sega's Toru Nakahara will produce along with Story Kitchen's Dmitri M Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Dan Jevons.</p>
<p>"The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart," Anderson said. "We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films."</p><p>Nakahara added: "Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen.</p>
<p>"With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans."</p>

		<p>2026 is already proving to be another great year for game releases, within the context of long-awaited games being pushed back or cancelled altogether – I’m very sad we’re not getting a Sands of Time remaster, especially when it was seemingly more or less finished. Still, maybe Ubisoft were saving us from ruining our memory of the original. I’ve had plenty of fun this week, continuing to dabble in Highguard, though I can feel the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/overwatch-2-is-just-overwatch-again-with-new-story-focus-and-new-characters-including-a-flying-cat-healer/">soon-to-be numberless Overwatch</a> pulling me back with all of the new announcements coming out from Blizzard. Besides that, I’m working on a Monster Hunter Stories 3 preview and a Switch 2 Citadelum review, which may have just totally sold me on the mouse controls on Nintendo’s latest console.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has played a whole bunch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/02/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-review/">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</a>. He says, “It’s a really good game, thoroughly recommend! In other news, I checked out the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/06/bafta-games-in-concert-opening-night-in-review/">BAFTA Games in Concert</a> at the weekend. It was good, and worth checking out if it comes to an arena near you!”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/nioh-3-review/">played lots of Nioh 3</a>. So much so, that he could only manage to say, “Game good!”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has continued with Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “40 hours in and I’ve only just landed on the last planet to explore. I’m really enjoying the vibe of the game, getting on my speeder and seeing what’s out there.”</p>
<p>Having watched the credits roll on Hellblade II, <strong>Jim</strong> came away from it with mixed feelings. He told us, “Some truly incredible visual set pieces and character building, though the puzzles felt very rehashed and unimaginative even if they look pretty cool. I also played some more Deadlock, which scratches two itches as I’ve been hankering for both a solid hero shooter and a MOBA, even though I don’t have the free time to fully commit to either.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> finally defeated the ram spirit boss in Spirit of the North 2! She said, “I’m just happy it only took me about 30 attempts opposed to some people online who claimed they were at it for months!! Now my fox can go play in the snow in the Frigid Peaks region I love how perturbed the fox looks when it slides down the ice tunnels.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing three game for review, Romeo is A Dead Man, Aces of Thunder, and Icarus. That’s not all though! He said, “I’ve also fit a few goes of Halls of Torment in as well, and a couple hours of Factorio before I had to stop because it threatened to take over all my time.”</p>
<p>Also busy with reviews, <strong>Ade</strong> gave us a whistle-stop rundown of what he played: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/speedball-review/">Speedball</a> (fun but limited), Dispatch – Switch Edition (great if you love black rectangles!), and Aerial Knight’s Dropshot (can’t say, embargoed).</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing so much Romeo is a Dead Man and so much Code Vein II! Meanwhile, Tuffcub actually turned on his PS5 for the first time in weeks and played Highguard and&nbsp; – shock! Horror! – Destiny 2. He’s also starting off with Reanimal too.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing some underwhelming indie horror games that have not scratched the itch before Resident Evil Requiem with The 9th Charnel being the latest. He continued, “I also finished my bedtime Gigasword adventures and absolutely loved my time with it even if it weirdly got easier as it went along. I followed that up with a procedurally generated Metroidvania for review next week and finally a game that I cannot reveal.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been revving his two-stroke, as it were, in Ride 6 for review. He also ran through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/05/resident-evil-requiem-and-pragmata-both-show-what-the-switch-2-is-capable-of/">the Pragmata demo</a> on Switch 2 once again, finishing it in around 11 minutes. Can you do better?</p>
<p>What about you? Played anything good?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Hollow Knight (Switch) - One Of The Finest Metroidvanias That's Not A Metroid Or 'Vania]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight</link>
            <guid>1428256</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><em>This review was originally published in June 2018 when Hollow Knight launched on the Switch 1. To celebrate the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, we're republishing it along with some brief impressions of the free upgrade, which is available to download now.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Switch isn't exactly lacking for quirky <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-metroidvania-games">Metroidvanias</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yokus_island_express">Yoku's Island Express</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dandara">Dandara</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/steamworld_dig_2">SteamWorld Dig 2</a> all stretching the genre in new and interesting directions. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, though, is arguably the most striking of the lot. Team Cherry's platform-adventure has long been awaited by Switch owners in the know. The game has attracted considerable buzz — and no small amount of fan art — since its PC debut last year. Now Hollow Knight has taken its console bow, and it doesn't disappoint.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/90235/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>You take control of the titular knight, a tiny bug warrior in an insectoid world gone to seed. The art style might be cartoony, but this is a surprisingly mournful setting from the off. The once-mighty kingdom of Hallownest has crumbled, its communities either abandoned or driven mad. All but a few lingering eccentrics have disappeared into the ground, drawn downwards by a mysterious miasma.</p>
<p>It's a beautifully melancholic canvas onto which you must gradually paint in the details. In time-honoured Metroidvania fashion, that involves venturing into the unknown to map out the world, conquering lumbering bosses, and expanding your ability set so that you can access new areas.</p>
<p>Structurally, then, Hollow Knight doesn't offer much that's new, but it's in the execution that it really shines. At the core of the game is a crunchy sword-and-magic combat system. Our knight might carry a so-called 'needle', but this spindly blade lands with a heck of a thwack. The recoil from each hit sends both you and your enemy back a little, which is both empowering and potentially endangering — particularly when battle takes place in the midst of a precarious platforming section.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the movement system is just as tight. Whether you're using the left Joy-Con stick or the D-pad on the Switch Pro Controller, our hero responds beautifully. It's no great spoiler to reveal that one of the first abilities you acquire is a dash, and this quickly becomes a staple part of your calculations throughout your adventure. It grants you extra speed on the floor and additional range and manoeuvrability in mid-air.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/2208/embed @ 1770396298 -->
<p>Your magical abilities are fuelled by a smart system that feeds on the souls of defeated enemies. Given that your knight's first magical ability is to heal himself, it means that the best form of defence really is attack in Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Not that you can afford to be too gung-ho about your business. This is a challenging game, with many of the regular grunts employing unorthodox movements and lightning-quick attacks to cause you headaches, particularly in combination. The bosses, meanwhile, will have you failing repeatedly with their formidable health bars and varied attacks.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>-like system at play here, too, which means that you'll drop your soul along with all of your Geo (the game's currency) when you die. You'll need to backtrack and literally fight your own spirit to regain them.</p>

<p>To explain what really sets Hollow Knight apart from pretty much anything else on the eShop, though, we need to go back to its world design. This is a decidedly 2D game, but it's so thick with detail, shade, and texture that it feels positively three-dimensional. The world is full of items and foreground elements that exist only to be broken or smashed through, adding to an enthralling sense of physicality — and it all runs at a silky smooth frame rate in both docked and portable modes.</p>
<p>The sound design is equally inspired, from the dank drip of a drizzly city to the distinctive (and hilariously human) babble of its characters. The map maker's contented hum and a certain boss's prideful goading when you near his lair are particular stand-outs.</p>
<p>Like indie hits Yoku's Island Express and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> before it, Hollow Knight feels like it's found its natural home on Switch. The game's beautiful 2D world, tactile combat, and impressive bevvy of secrets constantly drag you in for more, and it proves to be as strong an experience on the move as it is on your TV. On an eShop that's already filled with top-quality indie games, Hollow Knight is one of the very best.</p>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/90230/large.jpg"></a></figure>

</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hollow Knight is a big, beautiful, forboding Metroidvania that's absolutely thick with detail and feels very much at home on Switch, proving to be as strong an experience on the move as it is on your TV. From its punchy combat system to its charming art and sound design, if you're up for the challenge this is one of the finest, richest adventures you can have on Nintendo Switch.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Nioh 3 is Here, and in Just 3 Hours, It Became the Most-Played Nioh Game on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-here-and-in-just-3-hours-it-became-the-most-played-nioh-game-on-steam/</link>
            <guid>1428253</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Nioh 3</strong> is officially out, and it only took the game three hours (one for every Nioh game) for it to become the <strong>most-played Nioh game on Steam ever</strong>. After going live at 05:00 UTC, with 22K+ jumping in right away, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">SteamDB</a>, it had already surpassed its predecessors' concurrent player counts just <strong>three hours later</strong>.</p>



<p>The first Nioh game peaked on Steam at <strong>10,649 concurrent players,</strong> meaning that Nioh 3 had more than doubled the first game's peak concurrent player count right from the start. Nioh 2's peak concurrent player count currently sits at <strong>41,325 players</strong>, which Nioh 3 surpassed by hitting <strong>42,115 players</strong> by 08:00 UTC.</p>



<p>In the hours since then, it didn't just level out at 42K. The game continued to rise and hit a peak of <strong>70,186 players an hour ago, </strong>at the time of this writing. It has since dipped slightly to just under 70K with approximately 52 players needing to sign off, but that doesn't make the accomplishment any less impressive.</p>



<p>Ultimately, concurrent player counts are not the most significant factor for single-player games, though it's worth giving them a look when a new major single-player title launches, especially in this case, when we have two previous games to compare it to. It's not yet Team Ninja's biggest release on Steam overall, though, as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a></strong> still holds that title with a <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1448440/charts/">75,906 concurrent players peak</a></strong>. That said, if Nioh 3 continues its upward trend, it'll fly by that number in short order.</p>



<p>It's great to see a veteran studio like Team NINJA finding new heights of success in 2026. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-3-review-rise-of-the-shogun/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo gave Nioh 3 a <strong>9.8/10 in his review</strong></a>, and while he admits he has been a fan of Team NINJA's work for years, he's not the only one who shares the sentiment that Nioh 3 may just be one of Team NINJA's best games ever. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/nioh-3/"><strong>86 on Metacritic</strong>,</a> with none of its reviews sitting in the 'Negative' column and only six of its reviews in the 'Mixed' column. Hopefully, this milestone is followed by a sales milestone announcement from Team NINJA.</p>



<p>"<em>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution</em>," writes De Meo. "<em>By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design</em>."</p>

The open world dislikers bundle through the door of Dr Shrinko’s office like mardy harlequins, fuming and shrieking in their oversized licensed gear. One is wearing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> brand trousers so long they reach to her eyes. Another sports an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> hat that extends to his ankles. “Doctor, doctor!” they wail. “The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world games</a> are too big. They consume all of our free time. Why, it takes Yasuke 40-100 hours to get from one end of Assassin’s Creed Shadows to the other!”
</p>
<p>
Dr Shrinko leans back in his chair with a pleasant smile. “Solution is simple,” he trills. “Make Yasuke 40-100 times larger.”

<p>
No sooner has the physician spoken when the window of his office explodes. Another man clambers through the gap, straining to move easily against the friction from excessively tight, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a>-themed pyjamas. “Don’t listen to them, Doctor,” he gasps. “Open world games are too small. Why, you can get through Marvel’s Spider-Man in less than 30 hours, without skimping on sidequests!”
</p>
<p>
Dr Shrinko gestures impatiently. “Then make Peter Parker 30 times smaller.”
</p>
<p>
In case you hadn’t gathered already, Shrinko is an open world exploration game that lets you change your size. There’s <a href="https://ntesh.itch.io/growshrink">a free, work-in-progress build on Itch.io</a>. It’s the most delightful explore-me-do in a while. You play a grinning turquoise tripod who is searching for collectibles - “Stars, Bananas, Jiggies, and the secret Udders”. I don’t really understand the mammary symbolism here, but I’m too overpowered by whimsy to care. Consider: the music alters depending on whether you are unspeakably large or terribly, terribly small.
</p><p>
Some of the collectibles are found in deceptively plain rooms that harbour hidden immensities; others might require you to do a Gigantor and stomp around the skyline. If you’re worried about stepping on people while in kaiju form, take consolation in the fact that the game’s island setting is currently empty of life besides plants and mushrooms. Well, based on the 20 minutes I’ve spent in it, anyway. Perhaps the locals are just hiding. Sensible of them. Dr Shrinko has no time to watch his step. He will secure those udders by any means necessary.
</p>
<p>
The developer, ntesh, is conscious of some blemishes. “The camera is absolutely garbage, I know this, you know this, I am trying really hard, I guess it's a difficult thing to fix,” they rant and rave on the Itch page. What’s more, “sometimes you warp to the ground really fast when running off ledges.” As if that wasn’t enough, “growing near walls can quite often launch you, especially in the city”. The final insult: “this game isn't exactly optimized so there may be screen freezes or jitters”. 
</p>
<p>
Please remove your hair shirt already, ntesh! You have made a game in which I can skydive into a birdbox while jumping over a valley. I think that’s more important than ironing down the frame-rate.

</p>
<p>Thanks for finding it, <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2026/02/06/shrinko/">Warpdoor</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-clears-out-its-power-bank-with-retractable-cable-at-a-record-low-20000mah-165w-2000666200</link>
            <guid>1428235</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything more frustrating than heading out and realizing your phone or laptop is almost out of power, or dying in the middle of something important when you’re on the go? Probably not.</p>
<p>This is where an efficient power bank can come in handy, and now is a great time to pick one up. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/">We just spotted the 20,000mAh, 165W Ugreen Nexode power bank going for $70 at Amazon, after a solid 30% discount on its usual $100 price</a>. This offer is open to all shoppers, and the retailer is also offering free delivery on your purchase.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>This portable, yet mighty charger features a built-in 25.6inch (65cm) retractable USB-C cable that expands when needed and tucks away once you’re done topping your devices up. That means you don’t need to worry about carrying extra wires with this power bank at hand – just toss it in your backpack, and you’re good to go. Additionally, the cable is tested for over 25,000 retractions and 10,000 bends, so it’s going to comfortably support your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p>There are also two additional ports with up to 165W max output, so you can charge a MacBook Pro and an iPhone simultaneously (delivering 100W and 65W respectively). In a setup like this, the power bank can take a 16-inch MacBook Pro from 0 to 43% in just 30 minutes. The informative smart display at the front shares real-time port status and power flow, keeping you in the loop about the charging situation at all times.</p>



<p>The 20,000mAh high capacity is built for demanding days, as it’s capable of supporting all-day business activities without searching for outlets. For reference, that’s enough power to fully power an 11-inch iPad Pro twice, a Galaxy S24 Ultra up to three times, or a 13-inch MacBook Air just over once. Recharging the power bank doesn’t take forever, either, thanks to its 100W max input that juices it back up to full in just under 2 hours. You’ll also appreciate how this thing is equipped with high-rate battery cells that are specifically designed for endurance, and can retain up to 70% health after 1000 full charge cycles. Translation? A longer lifespan, which ensures you won’t really need to replace the power bank anytime soon.</p>
<p>Security is taken just as seriously.

            <guid>1428229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Cloud9 New York has had a <strong>very </strong>tough time of late. Since entering the Call of Duty League in 2024 after buying out the New York Subliners, the organization, one of the oldest in the esports space, has failed to secure traction. Multiple major roster overhauls have led to a lack of identity, and now, an entire squad wipe has left the brand without a team <strong>again</strong>.</p>



<p>However, things are getting worse. The proposed picks are actively turning down a spot on Cloud9 New York, which is shaping up to be the worst-paid team in the Call of Duty League. Even players who should be actively accepting any offer put before them aren’t eager to step into a C9NY role.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-cloud9-new-york-have-a-roster-for-major-2">Will Cloud9 New York Have a Roster For Major 2?</h2>



<p>Major 1 just wrapped in the Call of Duty League recently, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-fails-to-secure-major-i-after-perfect-run/">Paris Gentle Mates snatching the victory</a> – and the tiny trophy – from OpTic Texas in the grand final in Dallas.</p>



<p>Cloud9 NY was the first team to be eliminated, almost without firing a shot. The organization is joint last place in the CDL standings right now, sitting (not so) pretty at the bottom of the board alongside Vancouver Surge with just a single match win this season thus far.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/2019110866248167859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored recently</a> that Cloud9’s leadership was eyeing up the likes of QK4B, Renegade, Kips, Spart, and Owakening for spots on a new roster. In the last few days, both <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/2019212962721112438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">QK4B</a> and <a href="https://x.com/CoDClipped/status/2019562452988637313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spart</a> have reportedly <strong>declined </strong>those spots. Many have suggested that Kips and Renegade, currently in Challengers, should stay where they are, as C9NY’s offer isn’t even worth a pick.</p>



<p>The owners at Cloud9 have had to cut costs dramatically, which is why folks are talking about it being the worst-paid spot in the Call of Duty League. It’s hardly a lucrative concept for any rookie player, even if it’s a guaranteed entry to the top tier of COD esports.</p>







<p>Could we see Cloud9 withdraw from the Call of Duty League before the season is out? If so, which organization will assume control of that spot? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>With a free demo to come</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios and Thunderful's cinematic puzzle/platforming sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf</a>, has looked more stunning with every gameplay reveal. Its latest trailer is no exception, of course, but this one comes with a bonus bit of info: a release date.</p>
<p>Yes, it has been revealed that Children of the Leaf will leap onto Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>5th March 2026</strong> — that's just one month away! What's more, the developer has confirmed that a free demo is in the pipeline too, arriving on PC, PlayStation and Xbox on 11th Feb, and on Switch and Switch 2 at a "later date".</p>
<p>The release date trailer showcases even more puzzle platforming in action, with those visuals once again being the star of the show. Previous gameplay showcases have highlighted Lana's cute companion, Mui, and its transforming abilities, and we get to see a little more here, with the little guy taking on the form of a fish and a flying insect, piloting robots, and channelling electrical currents — way to go, Mui!</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's setup and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As greed and power divide the tribes of their home planet, Lana and her loyal companion Mui must stand together against the forces reshaping their world - struggling not just for survival, but for the very soul of their home. Embark on an unforgettable cinematic puzzle journey across Novo, where ancient mysteries and new threats will test your wits, challenge Lana’s unbreakable bond with Mui, and guide her toward her destiny.<br>
Prepare to explore an expanded story, tackle challenging new puzzles, and master evolved companion mechanics - all brought to life by breathtaking hand-painted environments and a sweeping orchestral soundtrack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be excited to see what this one holds when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 next month — hopefully we don't have to wait too long for the demo, either. We had a great time with its predecessor back in 2024, calling it "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Sales in Japan are “Better-Than-Projected,” and It’s Hurting the Switch 2’s Profitability]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-profitability-hurt-by-better-than-projected-switch-2-japan-sales/</link>
            <guid>1428196</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It might be difficult to imagine that increased sales of <strong>Nintendo's</strong> latest hybrid console, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, in any region, let alone its home base of Japan, would actually hurt the console's profitability. But that's exactly what's happening, according to Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>. In the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">official translation of its Q&amp;A section</a> from its third-quarter financial report, Furukawa confirmed that the "<em>better-than-projected</em>" sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 in Japan<strong> will negatively impact the Switch 2's operating and gross profit</strong>.</p>



<p>How is that the case? Because the parts Nintendo uses to manufacture the Nintendo Switch 2 are purchased in U.S. dollars. So when players in Japan purchase a Switch 2 with Japanese Yen, a currency that is currently in a downward trend, Nintendo still ends up losing money.</p>



<p>During the Q&amp;A section, an investor asked Furukawa, "<em>Considering that most procurement costs are in U.S. dollars, do I understand correctly that profitability is declining due to the continuing depreciation of the Yen?</em>" They also asked if Furukawa could explain why Switch 2 sales in Japan are doing as well as they are, and the answer, according to Furukawa, lies with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kirby-air-riders/">Kirby Air Riders</a></strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Hardware-related procurement purchases are primarily made in U.S. dollars, so given the current exchange rate environment, the better-than-projected hardware sales in Japan will have a <strong>downward effect on gross profit and operating profit</strong></em>," Furukawa responded. </p>



<p>"<em>The backdrop of hardware sales in Japan trending better than our expectations was the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Kirby Air Riders during the holiday season, building on the initial momentum of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware</em>. <em>We believe that users in Japan <strong>saw these titles as an opportunity to transition to Nintendo Switch 2</strong> at a relatively higher rate compared to Nintendo Switch owners outside of Japan.</em>"</p>



<p>This interesting tidbit appeared amidst Furukawa having to answer a flurry of questions about the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage</a></strong> that is currently impacting the entire tech industry, and how Nintendo is planning to accommodate it. It's no surprise that investors only really wanted to talk about the memory shortage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-loses-14-billion-in-value-as-memory-shortage-fears-rise/">especially after <strong>Nintendo lost $14 billion</strong> in share value towards the end of last year</a>, directly due to memory shortage fears. </p>



<p>For now, Furukawa doesn't want to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-president-doesnt-want-to-be-overly-influenced-by-rising-ram-costs-nintendo-switch-2-price-to-remain-stable-for-now/">"<em><strong>overly influenced</strong>" </em></a>by something that could turn out to be a short-term trend, though with recent reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/memory-suppliers-are-taking-zero-chances-on-losing-in-a-dram-contract/">memory suppliers are taking "<em><strong>zero</strong>" </em>chances of being shortchanged</a>, Furukawa and Nintendo may end up having to increase the price of the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, that's only one possible outcome, not an inevitability.

<p>Several individuals, including influencer Cyberboi, a number of journalists, and some Build a Rocket Boy employees, will apparently be "served in person, criminal complaints, shortly", with those complaints alleging "espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference".</p><p>Insider Gaming contacted Ritual Network for comment, and the platform told the publication that it is "not involved in the matter". It goes on to say that it's "not aware of any legitimate legal action" brought by Build a Rocket Boy, and that any suggestion it's connected to the aforementioned sabotage is "incorrect".</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy, however, insists that it's on the right track; in a statement, it told Insider Gaming that it has "evidence that there has been a co-ordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage" both the studio and the game, and that it's "taking steps" to address the issue.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, <em>MindsEye </em>launched last year to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-launch-messy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="090d2e26-517c-4b1d-81d8-0c4c40228804" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pretty negative reception across the board</a>, seemingly leading to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mindseye-build-a-rocket-boy-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cc20a09e-a602-4466-a53f-4fb3ccf68d58" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Build a Rocket Boy shortly after the game's launch</a>, as well as publisher IO Interactive seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-mindseye-third-party-publishing" rel="nofollow">pulling back from third-party publishing</a>.</p>

<p>According to Mazin, he's a big fan of Larian's latest entry into the iconic CRPG series; he says he's put "nearly 1000 hours" into the game, and that he's a "devoted fan" not only of <em>Baldur's Gate </em>but of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>in general.</p><p>Although the show will be based on <em>Baldur's Gate</em>, Deadline says it won't draw from the first two games in the series too much, since they're not "official source material", according to the publication.</p><p>With that said, there will be "some commonalities across those games" that also refer to general <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>lore, and those might come into Mazin's new <em>Baldur's Gate </em>show.</p><p>It's worth noting that this is a distinct entity from the upcoming <em>Forgotten Realms </em>TV show, which is being made for Netflix. It's unlikely, therefore, that the two will cross over in any meaningful way, at least not to begin with.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the cat breeding roguelike battler from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, finally saunters out of its litter box with a cheeky smirk next week. It's been a long time coming, but the developers have opted to make players wait for a full release, rather than going the early access route plenty of games opt for nowadays - the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> spring to mind. As a result, McMillen and Glaiel see the way they've gone as no longer being the norm, and have shed more light on their reasons for not picking early access.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are launching a complete game. That is a weird thing now," Glaiel told <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/mewgenics-interview-launch/">The Escapist</a>. "I’m really not a fan of Early Access," McMillen added. "I feel like it originated from people needing money fast. I’m not shitting on people who do early access, but it feels strange to change the experience after people have already finished it."</p>
<p>Glaiel seconded that view, reasoning that: "There’s a handful of situations where it makes sense, like multiplayer stuff. Other than that, I feel like almost anything else would be better." The due do certainly plan to listen to hands-on player feedback in terms of shaping where Mewgenics goes in future, but in the context of gauging what they might add to it via DLC, rather than shaping the base game.</p>
<p>One aspect that's made Mewgenics' route to release a bit unique is that, while waiting until the game's done to let folks try it fir themselves, McMillen has spent hours <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-says-the-big-important-bits-of-mewgenics-are-done-shows-off-50-minutes-of-weird-cat-roguelikery">streaming his own runs through it</a>, something he points to as having been key in keeping up anticipation as the last few years have ticked by. "If we had never shown gameplay, people would be more frustrated that they still can’t play it," he said. "Instead, they are getting spoon-fed, but bit by bit. We have fans who watch and think about what choices they would make, so they’re almost playing the game in their heads. They are desperate for another video – they just want another run."</p><p>In my estimation, Mewgenics' quirky premise and the reputations its developers have cultivated through years of putting together beloved hits like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End Is Nigh have likely put them in a more ideal position than other studios might be to take the approach of making sure Mewgenics is cooked to near perfection before putting it out. They've certainly done a great job over the past couple of years of not being afraid to offer glimpses of their creation on a regular basis, helping abate any fears folks might have about the amount of time it's spent in development.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this Escapist interview, Glaiel admits that the pair "probably could have released the full game in 2021, roughly, and it would have been okay". Instead, they decided their preferred approach was to give themselves space to refine the thing, so it'd be as ready as they wanted for the moggy adventures that await when it comes out on February 10th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-nintendo-ram-memory-ai-2000666430</link>
            <guid>1428175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The question on every video game investor and analyst’s lips during the recent Nintendo earnings Q&amp;A was whether the Mario maker will have to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">raise the price of the Switch 2</a> due to spiking memory prices amid <a href="https://kotaku.com/dell-ces-ai-hardware-llm-gpu-2000657729">AI-fueled shortages</a>. RAM is through the roof and graphics cards are getting delayed, but Nintendo is keeping a cool head through the market turmoil.</p> <p>“We are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long-term perspective with our business partners,” president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204e.pdf">said this week</a>. “As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond.” As a result, Nintendo confirmed that no decision on raising the price of the $450 Switch 2 has been made yet, but if and when that time comes, it will decide based on things like the “platform’s installed base, sales trends, and the market environment.”</p> <p>Not satisfied with that ambiguity and uncertainty, Q&amp;A members kept grilling Furukawa for more specifics. The company admitted that the recent spike in component prices “exceeds our expectations” but said that it’s been stockpiling inventory and arranging long-term deals to absorb the shocks. Even if prices continue to rise into the summer, Nintendo can put off any painful pricing changes for a bit longer. But not indefinitely.</p>

 <h2>Selling Switch 2 at a profit vs. growing the install base</h2> <p>If push comes to shove, will Nintendo maximize profitability or growing the hardware’s install base? “It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends,” Furukawa said. “The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales.”</p>

 <p>It certainly sounds like Nintendo is going to do everything in its power to avoid making the Switch 2&nbsp;$500 by this time next year. At the same time, if sales momentum picks up even more after the announcement of a new 3D <em>Mario</em>, <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, or the long-awaited Gen 10 <em>Pokémon</em> games, well, maybe it’ll be in a position to do whatever it wants. Nintendo isn’t rushing to embrace one strategy or another just yet.</p> <p>Who knows what will happen to t<a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">he AI bubble</a> in 12 months, what new tariffs will hit consumers in the U.S., or if the company’s most lucrative sales market will be plunged into an unexpected recession? Predicting any of those things is as much a fool’s errand as trying to guess <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-country-dixie-free-update-switch-2-2000661812">what Nintendo’s next move is these days</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="114633">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> (GTA 6) is Rockstar Games’ next mainline GTA release and easily one of the most anticipated video games in years. Rockstar itself has stayed mostly quiet since confirming the game is in development, but reporting, leaks, and publisher comments have steadily filled in the gaps around GTA 6’s setting, release window, and gameplay direction.</p>



<p>This hub is where Insider Gaming keeps everything together—what’s confirmed, what’s been reported, what’s changed, and what still isn’t clear—and it’s updated as new information comes in.</p>







<h2 id="h-latest-gta-6-update">Latest GTA 6 Update </h2>



<p><strong>Latest Update (February 6, 2026)</strong></p>



<p>While details surrounding the game’s features have yet to be officially announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-marketing-to-start-this-summer-will-have-physical-version/" id="173882">it has been confirmed</a> that the game’s marketing will begin sometime this summer. It was also confirmed that Rockstar is planning to release a physical version of the game. </p>



<p>Also, with generative AI being a heavy talking point in the industry right now, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said in a recent interview that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be using GenAI</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar officially announced GTA 6 in December 2023, with the game’s first trailer amassing over 270 million views on the official Rockstar Games YouTube Channel. Beyond that, however, news has been limited. Fans have received one other trailer as well as some information about the game’s location—Leonida (Florida)—and main characters Jason Duval and the franchise’s first female protagonist Lucia Caminos.</p>

<h3 id="h-what-s-confirmed">What’s Confirmed</h3>



<p>Rockstar’s latest release date for GTA 6 is November 19, 2026. That release date announcement came in November 2025, when it was revealed that GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was being delayed</a> from its May 26, 2026 release. This was the third announced release for the game after it was originally announced for a fall 2025 launch. That then turned into the May 2026 release that became November 2026.</p>



<h3>Will GTA 6 Be Delayed Again?</h3>



<p>Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive seem adamant on making sure GTA 6 launches on November 19. However, anything is possible with this franchise, and it won’t be released until the developers feel it’s ready. Should any news or rumors come out about the release date, Insider Gaming will have full details. </p>



<h3 id="h-will-gta-6-come-to-pc">Will GTA 6 Come To PC?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 has only been confirmed for a release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. While it won’t come to PC at first launch, it should be expected on the platform at a later date.  </p>

<h2 id="h-gta-6-setting-and-map">GTA 6 Setting and Map</h2>



<p>For the first time in two decades, Grand Theft Auto returns to Vice City in GTA 6. But it’s not just Vice City that players will explore. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-gta-6-location-confirmed-so-far-vice-city-included-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game is set in the state of Leonida</a> (Florida), with multiple locations to visit and learn about. </p>



<p>While Vice City is the main locale, there are five other key places in GTA 6. The settings for Grand Theft Auto 6 include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Vice City</strong> – The main location based on Miami, Florida</li>



<li><strong>Leonida Keys</strong> – A tropical archipelago based on the Florida Keys</li>



<li><strong>Grassrivers </strong>– Known as the “untamable jewel”, it’s based on the Florida Everglades</li>



<li><strong>Port Gellhorn</strong> – An area filled with “cheap motels, empty strip malls and shuttered attractions”</li>



<li><strong>Ambrosia – </strong>A town in the middle of Leonida</li>



<li><strong>Mount Kalaga National Park </strong>– Located in the northern part of the state, the park features areas to explore, hunt, and fish.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-how-big-is-the-gta-6-map">How Big Is The GTA 6 Map?</h3>



<p>GTA 6 is set to feature the largest map in the history of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. It’s also expected to be an evolving map that will change overtime, though those reports are unconfirmed as of now. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-gameplay-details">GTA 6 Gameplay Details</h2>



<p>As of February 6, officially gameplay details have yet to be released. All that’s known is that, like past GTA games, it will be an open-world action-adventure game. More details will come as the marketing picks up this summer.</p>



<p>One thing that seems to be confirmed is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-support-will-seemingly-continue-after-gta-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA Online support</a> will continue after the game’s release. That makes sure that, at least for a little while, longtime players still have something to go to, especially on platforms where the game isn’t launching yet like PC. </p>

<h2>Latest GTA 6 Leaks</h2>



<p>With any game as anticipated as the next Grand Theft Auto title, many will look for as much information as possible about the game. That can also lead to leaks making their way out of the studio.</p>



<p>For the most part, however, there hasn’t been much in that sense over the past year or so. Back in 2022 and 2023 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there were plenty</a> of leaks from the game, but Rockstar had caught the party responsible. That lead to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hacker-sentenced-for-gta-6-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arion Kurtaj being sentenced</a> for the leaks.</p>



<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailers">GTA 6 Trailers</h2>



<p>There have been two trailers released so far for Grand Theft Auto 6. You can check them both out below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There aren't a ton of games that I've happily put more than 100 hours into as quickly as I have with Mewgenics. This feline-flavored, turn-based, roguelike tactical RPG takes place on a 10x10 grid, with mostly traditional classes like Fighter, Mage, Hunter, Tank, and Necromancer, among others. What sets it apart, aside from the cutesy macabre art style that slathers its creative zones with blood and poop, is that so many of the skills and attributes that your team will end up with are randomized and for the most part out of your control. That all but ensures no two runs will play out the same way, forcing you to improvise and play the hand you're dealt. Combined with the absolute mountain of content here – so much that I'm still seeing entirely new enemies, skills, mutations, and loot pop up after more than 150 hours – it's been able to draw me back in time and time again by dangling the possibility of an absolutely wild team coming together and bulldozing through the boss who turned my last party into kibble. I still haven't seen the final ending after all that time (this game has several) but I can't imagine I'll be tired of it before I do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewgenics is a game about cats, but it's not necessarily going to appeal to people who passionately love them because it's a dark comedy that treats them as meat to be put through a grinder. The name itself is a play on eugenics, a morally appalling practice of selective breeding that has historically led to things like forced sterilization to remove undesirable traits from the gene pool, so you know going in that it's going to be a little spicy. If you've played any of Edmund McMillen's previous work (here he's collaborating once again with Tyler Glaiel), such as the infamously difficult Super Meat Boy or the infinitely replayable Binding of Isaac, you'll have a sense of the type of humor to expect. It's delightfully gross and endlessly weird at every turn.</p><p>It's delightfully gross and endlessly weird at every turn.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even knowing that, as a long-time cat owner myself, I was perhaps a bit too conservative with just how unsympathetic and detached you're expected to be. I probably took longer than I should've to unlock crucial upgrades for my house because doing so requires shipping dozens of cats off to live with a set of goofy weirdo NPCs, never to be seen again. One of the most important and flamboyant, Tink, will only take newborn kittens, and in exchange he'll give you tools that provide more information on how to breed more kittens – and he needs a lot, so you have to get accustomed to parting with them right away. Other characters want older cats, mutated cats, injured cats, or cats who've been on runs to specific places in order to improve stores or add new rooms to your house, among other things. Traditionally an RPG like this is about nurturing your characters and developing them until they become more powerful, but Mewgenics requires a different way of thinking: cats with low or unremarkable stats are lost causes who will weigh your squad down, so you're best off spending them like currency and keeping only the picks of various litters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Selectively breeding your cats takes place in the fairly simple house screen, a 2D side view where your cats chaotically mill around while you arrange furniture pieces that you find as loot or buy from a shop, inventory Tetris-style. The goal here is to improve stats like Stimulation and Comfort in order to get your cats in the mood to produce high-quality offspring and improve the chances they'll come out with favorable mutations. Those can be things like a messed-up tail that makes their basic attacks inflict burning, or fur that gives them more health regen when they're wet, or <em>leech eyes</em>, among tons and tons of others that are all represented visually on your increasingly weird-looking cats. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(You also have to clean up cat poop daily to keep your Health stat up by simply clicking on piles of various shapes and sizes. It's a bit of a chore after a while, especially when it gets crowded and you have to move cats out of the way to get to it – somehow, of all the furniture items I've gathered, I've never seen a single litter box.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When everything's arranged to your liking, you hit the End Day button and your cats will choose their own mates based on who's in a room with them, as well as their own genders, orientations (yup, there are gay and bisexual cats), and libedos. Then, out come the kittens after some bizarre cat humping and gooey birth animations that take obvious pleasure in being unsettling. (You can tone that down if you need it to be safe for work.) Optimizing this to produce the most powerful cats possible while also avoiding too much inbreeding (which, as Tink will tell you, isn't cool even though it has the word "breeding" in it because it causes birth defects) is tricky – but you can't really fail at this part because, even if you lose all your cats, you can just start again from scratch using the randomized strays who show up every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real challenge is in finding the traits you want and ensuring they're passed down to new generations without too many side effects, and that definitely takes some planning. Mewgenics doesn't make it super easy, since there's no way to view all your cats in a list or spreadsheet – you just have to tediously cycle through them one at a time. You do unlock some tools to label them (and view their gnarly family trees), but when you have 40 cats roaming around it can be a pain to find one with the stats and abilities you're looking for when you go to put together a four-cat party (or fewer, if you want to live dangerously and level them up faster) for an adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building your team is another area where Mewgenics is unconventional and unpredictable because when you're picking cats and assigning their classes you can't see what all of their starting abilities will be. You'll get their base stats, mutations, and basic attacks, and sometimes they'll come with a spell or passive ability from one of their parents' classes, but it's not until you lock in their class that you'll learn what you're really working with and if they'll synergize well. Considering that each of the 12 classes has 75 abilities that <em>might </em>pop up (even after all this time I'm still seeing new ones), I get the same thrill from this reveal that I do from picking up my hand in poker or seeing the modifiers on a daily run in Slay the Spire or Monster Train 2: sometimes it's good news and I'm excited to see where it takes me, sometimes it's not and I brace myself for a thrashing and hope for a surprise turnaround if I can survive long enough to level them up and unlock some better skills.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What's inconvenient at this stage is that while you can see what items you have available in your house inventory before you set out on an adventure, and after you lock in your classes you're taken to the equipping screen to deck your cats out with up to five pieces of potentially build-defining gear apiece, you cannot see those items when you're actually picking your classes and your starting abilities are first revealed. That might be fine if you have a fantastic memory, but for the rest of us it's frustrating to not be able to check if I have a good piece of gear to boost the stats of my summoned familiars at the exact moment I'm deciding if I should go with an animal-friend Druid or a robot-building Tinkerer, or if I should go with a Fighter or a Tank instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's tricky to keep track of what you have on hand because gear in Mewgenics doesn't last forever. You can expect to get three, maybe four runs out of something before it breaks, and that's assuming you don't wipe and lose everything you took with you and picked up along the way (except for your choice of one item from several that a helpful weirdo saves for you after a failed attempt). If weapons breaking in recent Zeldas rubbed you the wrong way, you probably won't enjoy that aspect of Mewgenics, but I actually do like the way it prevents me from relying too heavily on any one strategy. You can get something incredibly powerful and play with it more than once, without letting that item define every run you'll do from that point on.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking gear on only two or three runs may not sound like much, but that's more than the actual cats get. Another reason you can't count on the tricks you used in the previous run working just as well on the next, even if you use the same classes and gear, is that each cat only gets one adventure in which to level up and develop their skills. (You'll be able to use them in combat one or even two more times during special battles where major monsters attack your house.) That was tough to get my head around at first, because I'm accustomed to my RPG party members sticking around, at least until I get them killed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe this is why you're not allowed to name your own cats, and instead they come pre-named from a pool of (I estimate) a billion different silly possibilities: Mewgenics doesn't want us to get too attached. After a while I stopped paying much attention to their names except to chuckle at them, preferring to think of my squad members as their classes rather than individuals. Only the ones I ended up using as my primary breeding stock really stuck with me. (Man, talking about this game makes you say some weird stuff.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mewgenics - May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you head out to one of the three acts' adventure maps, which are all drawn in a jerkily animated, charmingly childlike style, you start with a single path that then branches off into two, each of which has two completely different stages packed with their own unique sets of enemies – so many you definitely won't see them all even after several runs. You'll definitely want to mouse over them and read their descriptions before diving into battle, because some of them have some extremely nasty tricks up their sleeves – including a few that can instantly and permanently kill a cat or infect it with a parasite that takes up a gear slot. The stakes are already pretty high given your cats are permanently injured every time they get downed, and can be outright killed if their body is destroyed by attacks or eaten by zombies, so you don't want to get surprised if you can help it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each zone is also stocked with multiple bosses that range from powered-up versions of your own classes to huge, nasty monsters with their own creative game-changing mechanics, and one that's basically just an evil Kirby. Yes, a few of them are annoying (I avoid going to Act 1's Boneyard unless a quest demands it because that boss is a total jerk), but on balance they're excellent battles that often make me think differently about how to manage my team's turn order and abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that stands out to me about the structure of Mewgenics' runs – aside from how they can take as long as two hours once you've unlocked all the zones (and some secret ones) – is that unlike most roguelikes, you rarely get to make decisions about the path you take between battles. You mainly get to choose between the default path and a harder one with better loot and one more battle to level up a cat in, and then very occasionally between two types of rewards (usually an equipable item or a piece of furniture for your house). That makes the between-battle encounters feel a little less interesting than in a lot of similar games, especially when the random encounters turn out to be basically a coin flip where you're picking between a red pill or a blue pill, or pushing a button vs pulling a lever without any indication of which will give you a bonus and which will give you a debuff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are, of course, some more in-depth, multi-stage encounters where you're picking between a set of options in a choose-your-own-adventure story where your chances of success for each one are determined by a cat's stats. However, since the cat whose stats you're working with is chosen randomly, there are two layers of luck involved before you get a shot at a good outcome. It often feels completely random, but that's alright because so much of Mewgenics is doing the best you can with circumstances beyond your control.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During combat, there are so many different things in play that the interactions between cat mutations, passives, spells, gear, environmental modifiers, and enemies can get crazy complex, and figuring out exactly what happened – or predicting what will happen – can be like investigating a crime scene (often with just as much blood splatter). Why did that enemy pingpong between two trash bags, with each bounce doing one point of damage, until it died? How did one of my cats just straight-up eat a boss without me even telling it to move? Or, why did that giant Daddy Shark get to take another move and insta-kill my Cleric when I'd carefully placed him just outside what should've been his projected attack range? (That one stung.) All of those answers are in there somewhere if you know where to look and study the rules carefully. In one of those cases, it was related to – you guessed it – poop. The map does get chaotic when there are a lot of enemies and fire or plants or ice on the screen, but thankfully there's a tactical view that usually clears things up… mostly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, if you think something might work, it will. Water and ice spells and spells will put out fire, water will conduct electricity and zap everything standing in it, that sort of thing. However, sometimes its rules aren't super logical: a couple I've noticed is that robots are susceptible to bleeding, poison, and  parasite infestations, and the Butcher class's innate meat hook weapon can't actually hook meat unless you luck into the right upgrade for it. But again, most of the time it works like you'd expect it to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do love when a powerful team dynamic emerges as you earn new skills (your choice from a random selection of three) or raise one cat's stats after every battle. Recently I had a squad with a Monk who could toss out meat pickups that typically just heal the team, but when combined with a Butcher who can turn all of those meats into minion fly familiars and a Druid who can boost those flys' stats and turn them into killing machines, it became a way to raise an army in a single turn. On another run I had a Cleric whose health regeneration applied to the whole team and an item that let me continually boost that regen multiple times per turn, allowing my Necromancer to run wild with a high-damage attack that also drained half of his own health. There are countless examples like this, and while you won't win the lottery with a great combo every run, they happen more than often enough to make me excited about what might be next.</p><p>While you won't win the lottery with a great combo every run, they happen more than often enough to make me excited about what might be next.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's a little frustrating when I'm planning out my moves in a tough fight where every action matters is that there's no way to access a cat's full character sheet while you're in a battle, so you can't see their list of mutations or all of their equipment's full effects when you need that information the most. It's almost all represented visually on your cats, at least, but you have to remember, for example, what a cat having a second head growing on its butt means. When the rules are changing so dramatically from run to run, I would love to be able to reference all of them at any time.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Games Dan's Put 100+ Hours Into in the Past Decade</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/DanStapleton/lists/games-dans-put-100-hours-into-in-the-past-decade" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">As if all of those variables weren't enough, Mewgenics throws yet another curveball at you when it sends you on one of its story or side quests. Those all revolve around a unique and powerful item that changes the rules in a big way and telling you to take it to a specific zone. One of the most memorable gives you a five-second time limit for every action – and if you don't make a move, the AI will take over and move for you. (I was glad I wasn't playing that one on my Steam Deck because the controls there are serviceable, but not nearly as quick as with a mouse and keyboard.) Another shook things up by giving my cats random selections of abilities from every class when they leveled up, creating powerful hybrids that are usually rare. There are tons of these available, though it's kind of a bummer that if you fail a side quest you don't get a second attempt at that unless it randomly comes up again once you've paid enough cats. The story itself is pretty silly and light – don't expect any Hades-style epics here – but good for a few yuks as you do the bidding of an incompetent mad scientist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another area where Mewgenics is truly exceptional is in its sound and music, which are fantastic in both big and subtle ways. It comes with a collection of original and hilarious songs that accompany each level and culminate in major boss battles that are designed to loop for as long as a battle takes, and there are multiple variations on each that include instrumental versions – your cats will even meow along to them sometimes. (My favorite is probably "Where's That Smell Coming From?") And those meows come from a vast selection of different randomly selected voices, including some celebrity cameos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best touches, though, is the crowd sounds. Mainly you'll hear this after beating a battle: there's cheering and clapping with varying enthusiasm based on how quickly you pulled off your win. That's fine, but the best part is the shocked gasps when one of your cats is killed in action. That gets me every time – and trust me, I've heard it a lot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Mewgenics has a fun and surprising approach to the practice of "save-scumming," where you quit out of a battle you've messed up and restart it with knowledge of what not to do. I won't spoil what happens, but there are consequences if you abuse it. Thankfully, you do get some flexibility in case of a power outage or spouse demanding you stop playing that game you've been playing for 150 hours and do the dishes, and it's kind of implicit that you have permission to save-scum once per run – and yes, I use it regularly.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">More than once, I've looked up from playing Mewgenics and realized that it's 1:30AM. It's that kind of tactical turn-based roguelike, where every new run with a new set of mutant feline adventurers is full of potential for something you didn't know could happen, even after dozens of hours of runs. Maybe you'll earn a new ability for a character class you've used many times, or see some new devious enemies that never appeared in a zone before, or you'll get a new piece of gear that completely upends the rules and chaos will ensue. You'll definitely see something hilariously gross. There will almost certainly be times you'll be sent back to your house with your tail between your legs and have to breed a new batch of cats to avenge their mulched predecessors, but you'll do it to the tune of some outstanding original songs.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review]]></content:encoded>

The Blight Curse deck isn't quite as cheap as we'd like. The precon, which focuses on -1/-1 counters and is helmed by Auntie Ool, is still $50. It's a great deck, admittedly, but you can get it cheaper - sort of.</p></div><div id="228491"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle in question includes two Blight Curse decks and two Dance of the Elements decks, making for an ideal joint purchase for you and a friend who wants one of each deck. It's down to $120.67 now, meaning each deck is around $30 when purchased in this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dance of the Elements itself is discounted, now selling for $35, so factoring that in and the inflated price of Blight Curse, you're getting around $170 of value for your $120</p></div><div id="228490"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228490" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what about Dance of the Elements? This five-color deck is all about bringing Elementals into play and using them to dish out big damage. This can be done either with Ashling, the Limitless, or the backup commander Mass of Mysteries. The deck is fun to play, and just like most precons, has the chance to pop off - in my mind, it’s well worth the $30 it costs in this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, I almost wish I’d help out rather than my friend and I preordering both at MSRP…</p></div><div id="229423"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="229423" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TMNT Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t expect this kind of bundle for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set, either. That one comes with just one Commander Deck called Turtle Power, which, as with Dance of the Elements, is all five colors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Lorwyn Eclipsed, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-most-expensive-cards"><u>our list of the best chase cards</u></a> in the set right now, as well as a look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-weird-wonderful-creatures-of-magic-the-gatherings-new-lorwyn-eclipsed-set"><u>all eight creature types</u></a> in the new set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.
