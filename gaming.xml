This is the RPG’s fifth season and it added a new horde mode, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-patch-notes-infernal-hordes-season-5-1851611347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-patch-notes-infernal-hordes-season-5-1851611347">as well as a giant list of big and small tweaks</a></span>, and some fresh gear and powerful weapons to boot. </p><p>However, one of these powerful weapons—Umbracrux, a unique dagger only rogues can use—started causing some odd stuff to happen. Namely, players were earning millions of XP in seconds. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1elthyx/i_just_leveld_from_29_to_63_in_one_second/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1elthyx/i_just_leveld_from_29_to_63_in_one_second/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One video on Reddit showed a player killing a stronghold boss</a></span> and jumping from level 29 to level 63 in one second.

The community director did say players will still be able to find this weapon via loot drops, and technically they can still equip and use it, too. But its unique ability is currently disabled for all. </p><p>“Once we have a finalized fix, we will re-enable this and communicate this out to players,” said Fletcher. “Thanks for all the reports on this issue. We hope to have a final fix for this soon.”</p><p>Sadly for those looking to power level using this trick, that won’t be possible.

Discovery reported today that its game revenue suffered a major drop this quarter from the same period last year, largely due to weak performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p><p>Games revenue, under the WB Games division, dropped 41% year-over-year. Though Suicide Squad's struggles were the main culprit, it was admittedly up against stiff competition: last year's comparable included strong sales of Hogwarts Legacy, which launched in February of 2023 and continued to do exceedingly well throughout the year that followed. It <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-copies-in-2023-warner-bros-teases-more-harry-potter-games">sold 22 million copies in 2023 alone</a>, and has since reached 24 million.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Suicide Squad, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">panned by critics</a> and called "disappointing" by WB Discovery boss David Zaslav last quarter, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">resulted in a $200 million impairment charge in that report</a>. An impairment charge is a practice businesses use when they need to write off or report a reduction in the value of some of their assets that they previously thought would have a higher value.</p><p>Speaking of impairment charges, Warner Bros. Discovery undertook a massive one this quarter outside of games. The company reported revenue of $9.7 billion, but an overall net loss of $10 billion, $9.1 billion of which was due to impairment charges. Officially, WB cited the charge as due to "the difference between market capitalization and book value, continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, and uncertainty related to affiliate and sports rights renewals, including the NBA."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Best Video Games of 2024 So Far</h3></div></output><p>The first part, about book value, is WB reevaluating the value of its TV networks segment in light of customers and advertiser interest in streaming and digital content over traditional TV. But the NBA bit was likely responsible for a hefty sum of the impairment charge too. WB's contract for NBA media rights expires after the 2024-2025 season, and the NBA appears to have <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/warner-bros-discovery-nba-amazon-basketball-1236017771/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opted to take its business to Amazon instead</a>. Though WB has since attempted to exercise what it says are its rights to match Amazon's offer and is suing the NBA over them, it doesn't seem likely to win.</p><p>While all that sounds fairly dismal, WB's subscription services were up 3.6 million from last quarter, bringing its total to 103.3 million. This is the first time the company has passed 100 million subscribers.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mecha-break-has-a-lot-to-like-and-a-little-to-worry-about<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Feel the need for giant-robot speed.</h2></div><section><p>Jumping headfirst into Mecha BREAK’s chaotic, frenzied combat is overwhelming at first. That’s partially because its presentation is dizzyingly stylish, with flashing neon beams and blisteringly fast mecha screaming through the sky as you and your teammates do your best to capture a king-of-the-hill-like objective or push a payload. The chaos amps up the energy and tension of each skirmish, and certain bots (like my favorite: the Falcon) have additional abilities to help kick up the speed of a match even further. Mecha Break showed lots of promise during my last hands-on preview in January, and now, after a few more hours of hands-on time with the multiplayer mech shooter in its open beta, I’ve had the opportunity to experiment with more of Mecha BREAK’s arsenal of mecha, as well as get a better feel for its modes and controls. And I’m still highly impressed with its arena shooter-style gameplay and with how good it looks.</p><p>While my go-to mech is good for jetting around above the battlefield, laying suppressing fire, and stacking up assists, it’s kind of a glass cannon. That’s where something like the Tricera comes in. New in this beta, this tanky terror is appropriately named after the armored dinosaur. It may be slow and less maneuverable than Falcon, but what it lacks in speed and mobility, it makes up for in raw firepower with its twin gatling guns, overhead cannon, and beefy shields. Each mecha truly feels and plays differently, and I loved swapping between them from match-to-match.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Mecha BREAK Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Even the act of unlocking new mecha is really cool. Instead of just gaining a new selection in your pre-match lobby: unlocking a mech using one of the two in-game currencies I encountered triggers a really flashy cutscene, flexing Mecha BREAK’s stellar mecha design while showcasing some of the new chassis’s capabilities. It does remind me a bit of unlocking a new playable character in a gacha game, which points to some potentially concerning monetization practices. Emphasizing my concerns, Mecha BREAK appears to have something resembling a battle pass, complete with premium and free tiers along with a premium currency. Everything I saw in the beta was free, and most of the apparently premium unlockables I found were cosmetic, with only one mecha being gated behind battle pass progression. But just as gameplay in a game’s beta might not reflect the final version at launch, monetization and in-game mecha or currency prices might not be final either.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unlocking a mech using one of the two in-game currencies I encountered triggers a really flashy cutscene, flexing Mecha BREAK’s stellar mecha design while showcasing some of the new chassis’s capabilities. </p></div><p>The looming threat of aggressive monetization tactics aside, I had lots of fun with this beta… even if I had some trouble shaking off my rust after a few months. After a match or two spent grappling with its controls thanks to an unfortunately scant tutorial, I was eventually able to get back up to snuff with Mecha BREAK’s fast-paced gameplay. As I unlocked and tried out more and more mecha, things started to fall back into place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Its half-baked tutorial—which doesn’t seem like it’s changed or improved since my last preview —left me with more questions than answers about the starter Alysnes’ mecha’s abilities. This was even more frustrating given the fact that you can take any mecha into a firing range of sorts to test out its abilities from the main menu after completing the tutorial, which was a much easier way to learn each machine’s strengths and weaknesses, free from the introductory level’s dissociative chaos.</p><p>It doesn’t help that the tutorial begins abruptly, seemingly in the middle of a story without any context, and doesn’t have any bearing on the rest of what I saw in the beta. Backed by flat, generic dialogue trying to squeeze story and plot into a place where it doesn’t make much sense, the tutorial (where you essentially march forward, shooting spongey enemies before taking on a titanic boss mech) felt like an entirely different game compared to its high-energy multiplayer, which I couldn’t put down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The modes I saw all followed pretty standard objective-based modes you’d find in any team shooter: I escorted payloads and captured objectives, and had lots of fun doing it thanks to Mecha BREAK’s combat, which is easily the star of the show. By catering to different playstyles and power sets, each mecha felt distinct and natural within its suite of abilities. Equipped with a diverse mix of melee and ranged attacks and helpful abilities like cloaking or shields, I found something to enjoy in every match I played—not just ones where I got to play as the mecha I was best or most comfortable with.</p><p>While this beta doesn’t add too much new content on top of what I’ve already seen in previous versions, it did cement my excitement for Mecha BREAK’s eventual launch thanks to its polished gameplay and visual style. But it also left me more wary about its other modes, which are still gated off, and its monetization structures. Let’s hope my worst fears about those don’t come to pass.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Kickstarter campaign for Brandon Sanderson's <em>Cosmere RPG</em> has gone live. Formerly known as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stormlight-archives-ttrpg-will-have-skill-based-magic-system-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Stormlight Archives</em></a> RPG, this tabletop game features an original RPG system set in the world created by the iconic fantasy author. And in a single day, it raised more than $5 million.</p>
<h2>The <em>Cosmere RPG</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to the Kickstarter campaign page, the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> will encompass the entire universe of Sanderson's novels. This is a noticeable change in scope from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sanderson-announces-stormlight-ttrpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original announcement</a> in November of 2023.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-official-artwork.jpg?itok=4zt_lsqo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-official-artwork.jpg?itok=vEuu_ggt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Basically, the RPG will launch with books based on the <em>Stormlight Archives</em> novels. It will encompass three books. The <em>Stormlight World Guide</em> is a 224-page book on the history, culture, and key figures of the world of Roshar. The <em>Stormlight Handbook</em> is a 256-page player handbook. Lastly, the <em>Stonewalkers Stormlight Adventure</em> is a prewritten module.</p>
<p>Afterwards, additional books and supplements will be added to the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> based on the <em>Mistborn</em>, <em>Elantris</em>, and <em>Worldhopper</em> series respectively. This material can be used either for standalone adventures or grand worldhopping epics. If you're a fan of any of these books, the RPG material will include official lore and new canonical material.</p>
<p>For those interested in the Cosmere RPG's core gameplay or character creation, several VTTs have free demos available. Demiplane has <a href="https://app.demiplane.com/nexus/cosmererpg">a character creator</a>, and a beta version of the core rules are on <a href="https://forge.fantasygrounds.com/shop/items/1865/view">Fantasy Grounds</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cosmere-rpg-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=RpfqKLbp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cosmere-rpg-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=vHch8jFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are several stretch goals and add-ons for the <em>Cosmere RPG</em>. The add-ons include official dice, miniatures, a GM screen, tokens, battlemaps, and item decks. As for the stretch goals, only two have been unlocked at the time of writing: a 24-page PDF visual guide of Roshar, and a Lifelight green plot die. More will be revealed as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p>The pledge levels of the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>The E-Reader at $60:</strong> Your choice of two core rulebooks in PDF format.</li>
<li><strong>The Reader at $95:</strong> Your choice of two rulebooks in hardcover format.</li>
<li><strong>The Player at $195:</strong> The Stormlight and Mistborn World Guides and Handbooks, a set of dice, and a set of Opportunities and Complications cards.</li>
<li><strong>The Game Master at $295:</strong> Everything in The Player tier, the <em>Stonewalkers Stormlight Adventure</em>, GM Screen, the <em>Mistborn Legacy</em> campaign, tokens, maps, and a deck of item cards.</li>
<li><strong>The Collector at $385:</strong> Every book and accessory, Stormlight Liquid Core Dice and Stormlight RPG Miniatures.</li>
</ul><p>Within the first day, the <em>Cosmere RPG</em> Kickstarter campaign raised&nbsp;$5,250,350, completely dwarfing its initial funding goal of $250,000. In addition, it eclipses similar TTRPG success stories on the platform like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steinhardts-guide-to-eldritch-hunt-raises-26-million-on-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Steinhardt's Guide to The Eldritch Hunt</em></a><em> </em>and<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The One Ring</a></em>, The campaign concludes August 29.</p>

			<p>It's no secret that PlayStation has a ton of unannounced projects being developed, with one of them being developed <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-later-playstations-firesprite-issues-statement-following-februarys-layoffs/">by Firesprite</a>. This game is set to be a single-player narrative horror. At the moment, there is no real information about this project.</p>
<p>Firesprite was obtained by Sony in 2021, with leaks and rumors regarding this project dropping over the years. This includes an internal document, revealing the code name for the project to be "Heartbreak." Whether that still remains true is uncertain.</p>
<p>Colin Moriarty, an insider has claimed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzgSPOaVG4Y&amp;t=3204s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast from Last Stand Media</a> that the game could possibly be set on an island, with a female protagonist. However, apart from that, we don't know a whole lot about the game, and what stage of development it is in.</p>
<p>Despite that, there are still leaks that have a huge amount of information in them, which could explain a lot about the unannounced project.</p>
<p>One of the main hints about Firesprite's project is the website of Firesprite's Game Designer, Emily Stell who lists the project as a "narrative horror game," with the platforms listed being PlayStation 5 and PC. In addition to this, it says that it is being made by using Unreal Engine 5. It isn't unheard of for PlayStation exclusives to be ported to PC, as we have seen Ghost of Tsushima, The Last of Us Part 1 and Returnal come to PC in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition to Emily Stell's page, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vidAT5YiKkCMdFG2fdAddwC4Gvqf3Qe/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the resume</a> for Firesprite writer Ren Alex-Rose who worked for Firesprite from 2022 until April of 2024 suggests that she worked on designing characters and plot lines "within pre-established IP," which seems to confirm some suspicions.</p>
<p>There is also speculation that the game isn't a unique IP, but a new game coming to an existing IP. This has been suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1b1gzcx/comment/ksexsqj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier</a>, who hinted at it on Reddit. At the moment, we don't know what horror IP this could be referring to, as there are many that are getting new developments in both movies and games right now.</p>
<p>In addition to Stell and Alex-Rose, there is a Pinterest profile from the Environment Artist Andreas Houin, who is currently working at Firesprite. In <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/andrashouin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his boards on Pinterest</a>, with boards dedicated to Cosmic Horror, Architecture and Scifi. Although we have no idea what horror IP this could possibly be for, but we will be keeping an eye out for any future announcements from Sony or Firesprite for their upcoming development.</p>

<p>It’s been an absolutely wild month for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, with numerous announcements and leaks building up the hype train. Thanks to a recent leak, we have the complete list of achievements in the game and the unlock requirements for most of them. Here are all of the Black Ops 6 achievements on launch!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-one-of-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-achievements">Every One of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Achievements</h2>



<p>As usual, it appears the vast majority of Black Ops 6 achievements relate to the game’s various multiplayer modes, with a small handful unlockable during the single-player campaign. Of course, while the story mode is entertaining, and I’ll definitely play through it first before jumping into the frantic multiplayer, it’s the competitive modes that steal the show.</p>

<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-feature-challenges-and-unlocks">Will Black Ops 6 Feature Challenges and Unlocks?</h2>



<p>While we’re not sure if there are any directly tied to completing any of the game’s achievements, we’re sure Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 offers a wide variety of challenges and unlocks in multiplayer. </p>



<p>To keep everyone’s attention, Activision always implements rotating challenges to earn XP, along with unique weapon-specific challenges to unlock additional attachments, kits, and camo schemes. We believe Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will follow suit, but that’s a safe guess, isn’t it?</p>



<hr>



<p>Apparently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>hund</span>reds of people are already playing Black Ops 6</a>, way ahead of the beta launch! I certainly wish I were one of the lucky few; how about you?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Strand rocket launcher Crowning Duologue makes its return in this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-solstice-2024-start-date-rewards-and-everything-we-know/2900-5615/" data-ref-id="2900-5615">Solstice of Heroes</a> event in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, but in a form we haven't seen before. Like the other weapons that are only available during the summertime event, Crowning Duologue has had its perks refreshed this year, and some of them are pretty excellent for dealing massive damage in PvE scenarios. While Crowning Duologue might not replace your go-to rocket launchers like Apex Predator, it can be a great alternative for certain builds or to take advantage of Strand surges in certain events.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's how you can get Crowning Duologue and the god roll perk combinations you'll want to chase.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Crowning_Duologue">How To Get Crowning Duologue</a></li><li><a href="#Crowning_Duologue_God_Rolls">Crowning Duologue God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Crowning_Duologue_PvE_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Crowning_Duologue_PvP_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347125-20240806172148_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347125" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347125-20240806172148_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347125"></a><figcaption>Crowning Duologue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4347125-20240806172148_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Crowning_Duologue">How To Get Crowning Duologue</h2><p dir="ltr">Four weapons are only available during the Solstice of Heroes event, and Crowning Duologue is one of them. That means that the rocket launcher is part of the Solstice loot pool. The best way to get it and to farm multiple rolls is from playing Solstice's Bonfire Bash event, which drops various Solstice weapons at the end depending on your performance. You can also sometimes get Crowning Duologue from Solstice packages, from completing Solstice bounties, and from the Solstice event card. Still, those methods are less reliable than just farming Bonfire Bash.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Crowning_Duologue_God_Rolls">Crowning Duologue God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crowning_Duologue_PvE_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Alloy Casing  <ul><li dir="ltr">+30 Reload Speed, -10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Reconstruction  <ul><li dir="ltr">This weapon slowly reloads itself over time, up to double capacity.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Bait and Switch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Deal damage with all equipped weapons within a short time to give this weapon a damage boost.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you mean to use Crowning Duologue to do damage, the winning perk combo is Reconstruction and Bait and Switch. Reconstruction is similar to Auto-Loading Holster but boosts your magazine to hold two rockets at a time, and Bait and Switch gives you a serious damage boost if you quickly land a shot with each of your weapons before swapping to your rocket to put the hurt on bosses. For everything else, focus on reload speed to get additional rockets as fast as possible so you can keep firing. The combo can make Crowning Duologue a significant DPS weapon. However, because of its archetype, it'll never be quite as good as some of the top-tier meta rockets right now, like Apex Predator. Still, this is a good alternative to deal Strand damage when you need it.</p><p dir="ltr">An alternative roll here is Chain Reaction and Hatchling, shifting Crowning Duologue from a damage-dealing role to an enemy-clearing one. Chain Reaction is always a fun time since it can take out multiple enemies at once, and Hatchling means those kills will spawn additional Threadlines to run around killing more enemies. For that roll, you'll want to focus on Blast Radius to catch even more aliens in your explosions.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crowning_Duologue_PvP_God_Roll">Crowning Duologue PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Velocity, +10 Reload Speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Hatchling / Impulse Amplifier  <ul><li dir="ltr">Hatchling: Precision final blows or rapidly defeating targets with this weapon spawns a Threadling at the target's location.</li><li dir="ltr">Impulse Amplifier: Massively increases projectile velocity, increases reload speed.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Cluster Bomb / Chain Reaction  <ul><li dir="ltr">Cluster Bomb: Rockets spawn cluster bombs upon generation.</li><li dir="ltr">Chain Reaction: Each final blow with this weapon creates an elemental damage explosion.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Blast Radius</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Rockets in PvP mostly rely on the blast radius and velocity stats to be effective: Blast radius to make as big an explosion as possible to get multiple targets, and velocity to get a rocket to its target as quickly as possible, making it tougher to dodge. Crowning Duologue has some perks that can seriously bump the first one, but keep an eye on the velocity stat if you're chasing a PvP roll. Hatchling and Cluster Bomb or Chain Reaction pair well here, with the latter two expanding the size of the explosion when a rocket hits--Chain Reaction requires actually catching enemies in the blast to expand it but can catch opponents unexpected, while Cluster Bomb just adds more bombs to the blast zone. If you can kill more than one Guardian with a rocket, which is the whole point, then Hatchling rewards you for your efforts by creating a Threadling to chase down more opponents.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you're finding your rockets aren't getting to their targets in time to actually kill them, or if you're missing a lot, consider Impulse Amplifier. The perk massively gooses your velocity stat to speed up your rockets, and while a big blast is nice, it's not especially useful if your rockets are too slow.</p>

						<h5>The Sims 4: Lovestruck</h5><p><span>25 July 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Mac, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest expansion</a> to be released for the simulation game. So far, a lot of the expansions haven't quite grabbed my attention in the way this one has. The only one that has come remotely close is Cottage Living. However, I was pleasantly surprised with what Lovestruck had to offer.</p>
<p>An expansion that is tailor made to those who enjoy giving their Sims a dramatic love life, this was everything I was hoping for and more. It had some of the classic cheesy traits and features that were seen in previous games, with nods to The Sims 1. Being able to get a vibrating love bed made me happy, as it reminded me of all of the nostalgic hours I spent playing The Sims 1.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For the character creator, I found that the options were somewhat lacking. While I loved the nose and cheek blush available in the make-up section, it felt as if there were a lot of opportunities that they overlooked. For example, there was not a single piece of lingerie for either men or women. Considering Lovestruck is a pack about romance and spicing up relationships, it seemed weird to me to not include something that is commonly used for doing just that. However, looking at the party outfits, it seemed that the outfits there were more like lingerie, and seemed more suited for indoor affairs rather than outdoor.</p>
<p>I did really like the hair options that were added with this pack, and I could see myself actively using some of them if none of my custom content foots the bill. Overall though, I did feel that the clothing and accessory options for both men and women were slim pickings, and there were plenty of missed opportunities.</p>
<p>The interactions that were added to the game were adorable. I loved that they could either be really cute and worried in their interactions, or very bold and brazen in their attempts to sway someone. I liked the new date system, where you could choose what type of date you were going on. Whether it was a date for sims to get to know each other, or a romantic date to keep the spark alive, there were multiple options. Along with that, you could pick the goals for the date so that you could win awards by the end of it if you were successful.</p>
<p>Compared to packs like Get Together and Get To Work, I feel that Lovestruck actually managed to breathe some realism and depth into the game where the other packs failed. Relationships were more dynamic, as were the interactions. Whether you let them happen on their own, or you picked the prompts, it still felt more realistic than the five repeating interactions sims players usually do in order to boost relationships.</p>

<p>One of the main features that really lets <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">The Sims 4</a> down is how empty the cities feel. While they are aesthetically pleasing to look at on the map, there is so much space that could be utilized and just isn't. Ciudad Enamorada is no different. There is a huge lack of starter homes for sims, and considering your sims only start with 20,000 simoleons after creation, this choice didn't make much sense to me. I understood the appeal of having lavish homes and a city that is built up where the richer sims could live. However, most of the cities available in all of the expansions for The Sims 4 at least have a few starter homes that are affordable.</p>
<p>One of the other features that didn't quite sit well with me was the inclusion of a dating app named Cupid's Corner. While I liked the concept, it overall just fell relatively flat. You could choose two of your Sim's traits to showcase on the app, while taking a selfie. The selfies always turn out a little bit janky, which can add some comedy to the dating app.</p>
<p>I did try to utilize it for my sim, but found that going out into the world and interacting with people organically worked better for her. She had more success in going to a bar randomly than she did with the dating app.</p>

<p>Considering this is an expansion all about love and romance, I was truly disappointed with the lack of traits that came with the expansion. There was only one trait that came with The Sims 4: Lovestruck, and it was a trait about being romantically closed off, making a sim take their time in a relationship. While I liked that it added more dynamic conversations and opened up the possibility for a more realistic relationship, I didn't like that there were no other traits to be found.</p>
<p>Additionally, only one job came with the expansion. I understand that it may be a little bit difficult to create jobs off of something like this, and I did really like the one job that they added. Being a Dating Consultant was a lot of fun, as your sim just had to go around and give unsolicited dating advice. However, the lack of aspirations was also extremely disappointing. I feel that there was a lot of potential to add fun aspirations or traits for this expansion, and it all just came up empty.</p>
<p>Overall, The Sims 4: Lovestruck does do a good job at sprucing up the game and trying to make it a little bit more dynamic, the same way Growing Together did. However, some of the features were incredibly lacking, and I felt that there could have been much more added to make it worthwhile. I really liked the new interactions that they added to the game, but aside from that, the expansion was still quite flat.</p>
<p><em>Played on PC. Code given by Publisher.</em></p>

					
					

<p>While the customization options for the expansion were adorable, and the romance interactions between Sims added a lot more depth, there was an astonishing lack of features added in this expansion. There was a ton of room for new traits and aspirations, but only one was given for each category. Overall, while it made relationships more dynamic, the rest of the world felt empty.</p>

The shotgun has never been especially impressive, but this year, a revamp of its perks have changed things, making it a great addition to your loadout for taking down other players in the Crucible. If you've been struggling to get a good Matador 64, Compass Rose should offer comparable stats and be a little easier to chase. It's also not bad for PvE, but the new perks on Compass Rose make it potentially as useful in PvP as some of the top shotguns in the meta. Here's how you can get Compass Rose and what rolls you'll want to focus on during Solstice of Heroes.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Compass_Rose">How To Get Compass Rose</a></li><li><a href="#Compass_Rose_God_Rolls">Compass Rose God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Compass_Rose_PvP_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Compass_Rose_PvE_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Compass_Rose">How To Get Compass Rose</h2><p dir="ltr">Compass Rose is one of the four weapons that are part of the Solstice of Heroes loot pool, and thus only available during the event. The main way to get it is to play through Bonfire Bash, the Solstice event--you can access it from the Tower map in the Director. Compass Rose will be among the random weapons you can get from completing the event. Alternatively, you should be able to occasionally pick up Compass Roses from Solstice packages, event card Triumphs, and Solstice and Forge bounties you complete during the event. The most reliable way to farm Compass Rose, however, is to finish Bonfire Bash runs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346923-20240806172141_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346923" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346923-20240806172141_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346923"></a><figcaption>Compass Rose</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4346923-20240806172141_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Compass_Rose_God_Rolls">Compass Rose God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Compass_Rose_PvP_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Small Bore  <ul><li dir="ltr">+7 Range, +7 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slickdraw / Threat Detector / Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Slickdraw: Significantly increases handling, significantly decreases target acquisition.</li><li dir="ltr">Threat Detector: Increased reload speed, stability, and handling when enemies are in close proximity.</li><li dir="ltr">Slideshot: Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts range and stability.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Opening Shot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improved accuracy and range on the opening shot of attack.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The common go-to perk combo for a PvP shotgun is Threat Detector and Opening Shot, and with its revamp this year, Compass Rose can now roll those perks. However, the theory going around is that Slickdraw might be a better choice. High handling on a PvP shotgun is great because you want to quickly pull that gun out for a point-blank blast to an opponent's face, whether it's to finish off a hurt opponent or surprise someone in tight confines. Slickdraw kicks handling up to 100 for Compass Rose at the expense of target acquisition, but at close range, you shouldn't really need any. Threat Detector also boosts your handling, but requires you to be close to two opponents to get the benefit, where Slickdraw has no prerequisite.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, Slideshot is always a good choice for a PvP shotgun if you like slidy, agile play--and if you don't, skip this one, because sliding all the time is essential. The perk boosts your shotgun's range right after a slide, making it great for coming in hot around a corner to surprise an opponent, even if they're not perfectly in position for a point-blank blast.</p><p dir="ltr">All the perks are great with Opening Shot, which adds to the range at which Compass Rose can be deadly, and with the rest of your choices, you want to boost range as much as possible to make it more reliable that you'll get those one-hit or finish-off kills.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Compass_Rose_PvE_God_Roll">Compass Rose PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Stability, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Assault Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Stability, +5 Rate of Fire</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Grave Robber  <ul><li dir="ltr">Melee final blows or dealing damage with a charged melee reloads this weapon's magazine from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Trench Barrel / One-Two Punch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Trench Barrel: After a successful melee hit, this weapon gains increased damage, handling, and reload speed for a short duration--or until three shots are fired.</li><li dir="ltr">One-Two Punch: Hitting an enemy with every pellet in a shot increases melee damage for a short duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In PvE, Compass Rose isn't necessarily the best shotgun out there, but it can be very useful for melee builds. Both Trench Barrel and One-Two Punch pair well with punchy builds. With Trench Barrel, you boost Compass Rose's damage after you land a punch, while with One-Two Punch, Compass Rose boosts the power of your melee, so pick the perk that works best with your build. Meanwhile, Grave Robber lets you use your melee to reload the shotgun, circumventing any slow reload issues you might have with the gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, Compass Rose can also roll Incandescent, which is always a fun perk for Solar builds and can be great with certain builds meant to knock out a lot of small enemies quickly. None of these options are particularly unique to Compass Rose, but they can all make it pretty useful.</p>

            <p>
Ready at Dawn - the studio behind the likes of Lone Echo and The Order: 1886 - has reportedly been shut down by its currently owner, Meta, after over two decades of operation. The news follows heavy job cuts at the studio last year.
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn Studios was founded in 2003 by former members of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Blizzard, and was initially known for its work adapting Sony's Daxter and God of War franchises for the PlayStation Portable. In 2015, its first original game, The Order: 1886, released to mixed reviews on PS4, and the company would later shift its focus to VR.
</p>
<p>
Its first VR project was 2017's acclaimed sci-fi adventure Lone Echo, followed by standalone multiplayer spin-off Echo VR (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-and-ready-at-dawn-to-shut-down-popular-multiplayer-game-echo-vr">shut down last year</a>), then a sequel in 2021. Amid Ready at Dawn's success in the VR space, Meta announced it was purchasing the studio in 2020.

<p>
News of Ready at Dawn's closure by Meta comes via Android Central, which <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">reports</a> the studio is permanently shutting its doors, effective immediately. The publication, citing word from a Meta spokesperson, says today's closure is intended to ensure Meta's VR-focused Reality Labs "stays within [its] new budgetary constraints and that Oculus Studios can make a 'better long-term impact' in VR development".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Meta reported a second quarter loss of $4.5bn at its Reality Labs division, which followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-loses-a-billion-per-month-on-its-arvr-division-but-believes-it-will-be-worth-it">$3.8bn loss</a> during its first quarter.
</p>
<p>
Android Central doesn't reveal the number of Ready at Dawn employees affected by today's closure, but was told by Meta that the move "isn't enough to trigger the California WARN Act" - suggesting no more than 50 employees remained at the studio following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-heavily-impacted-by-latest-meta-layoffs">significant layoffs</a> last year. At the time, those layoffs were reported to have affected one third of Ready at Dawn's staff, including its studio head.
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn employees impacted by today's closure are said to have been "encouraged to apply elsewhere" within Meta, with the company claiming it "wants to retain as many talented developers as possible." Meta reportedly also said the closure isn't a sign of wider cuts to the number of first-party games it releases on Quest, insisting it's "still committed to VR development".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Meta for comment.

The newly-revamped <a href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game UI Database</a> is geared toward developers, but there's ton of great stuff in it for anyone who's ever paused to admire (or hate on) a game menu. </p><p>The Database is the work of Edd Coates, and contains over 55,000 screenshots and videos of various video game menus, inventories, game over screens, health bars, maps, objective markers, and more. It's been around for a few years, but its 2.0 version released this week, after what Coates <a href="https://x.com/EddCoates/status/1820555119152300230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> was "nearly 3 years of work" that added, among other things, the ability to filter by "screen types, controls, textures, patterns, HUD elements, colour and more!" </p><p>As a <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival game fan</a>, I've really enjoyed the Database's collection of crafting menus, which shows just how varied--and challenging to create--these kinds of interfaces are. And, as a stealth game fan, I had fun poking through the selection of hacking and lockpicking screens, reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/11/21363734/video-game-lock-pick-museum-itchio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable lockpicking  museum</a> from a few years back.</p><figure><figcaption>Game UI Database</figcaption></figure><p>It's cool to see how different games handle these elements and convey information to the player, and the Database's search tools let you really drill down into finding what you're looking for.

        <p>Massive mod has many mugs... Er, bugs</p>

    </div>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout London</a> launched late last month, but the huge, long in-development mod is so buggy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">Nic had to abandon his attempts to play it</a>. Its developers have already promised hotfixes, and now say a "huge" update is also on the way.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have some big plans for the future, starting with a hotfix," says <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1270453027953705024">the message shasred on the Team FOLON Discord server</a>. "This hotfix will address some crashes and include essential systems like 'Buffout 4,' which will be merged into the mod itself. We’ve also identified several other fixes that will provide immediate help. Additionally, we’ll be explaining certain features we added that might not have been as useful as we thought, so stay tuned for those details."
</p>
<p>"The future is bright! We’re already working on a HUGE patch that will address all the issues reported in our Discord floaty-patrol channel, as well as a multitude of quest-related and other problems.
</p>
<p>"So, the plan is: hotfix first to stop and help with the crashes, then a big patch after."
</p>
<p>The devleopers also say they'll be doing a developer playthrough stream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/teamfolon">their Twitch channel</a> on Thursday, August 8th, at 8pm BST (2pm CST), where they'll offer "behind-the-scenes info" on the development of the mod. If you're looking for help with bugs, they're also continuing to offer "1-on-1 troubleshooting" for players via Discord.
</p>
<p>Nic enjoyed the little of Fallout London he played, but was stymied by it sending him straight to desktop repeatedly over the course of a few hours. Hopefully those patches fix it up soon and we send him back in search of Big Dave.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There seems to be a wave of retro racers around recently, and each one seems to pick a particular target to shoot with its nostalgia gun, whether Wipeout or Lotus or Micro Machines or whatever else. 
</p>
<p>Maybe I'm forgetting some classic arcade racer, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victory-heat-rally">Victory Heat Rally</a> feels less laser targeted and more a modern take on the spirit of the genre. It's a 2.5D, "neo super scaler" arcade racer with split screen, drifting, car tuning and a lot of pep.

<p>As the trailer below notes, it now has a release window of this winter.

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1594060/Victory_Heat_Rally/">Steam page</a> uses cliché phrases like "crank up", "banging beats" and "high octane energy", but screw it, I think it's justified. The trailer looks electric.
</p>
<p>You can play alone or with up to three friends, with championship, arcade and time trial modes. Players also select one of 12 drivers to play as, although I'm unsure whether there's any meaningful difference between the characters or if it's all just style. You can tune the cars to alter how they feel to drive, however, as well as customising how they look.
</p>
<p>"Super scaler" was a technology in Sega arcade games such as OutRun that could scale and rotate 3D sprites to create the illusion of 3D. The SNES equivalent, called Mode 7 and used in F-Zero among others, is perhaps better known.
</p>
<p>If you don't want to wait until the winter, SPGP Super Polygon Grand Prix released on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2459860/SPGP_Super_Polygon_Grand_Prix/">earlier this week</a>. It's in Early Access, and a lot less polished than Victory Heat Rally seems, </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games is dealing with an unforeseen technical malfunction that’s wiping the accounts of hundreds of thousands of players worldwide. On social platforms everywhere, players are expressing their dismay at this devastating issue that has caused some to have their accounts reset mid-raid. It has been stressed that this isn’t part of a pre-wipe event <strong>nor </strong>is it the arrival of the wipe itself, but it’s an unexpected bug that Battlestate might not recover from.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-well-that-s-awkward">Well, That’s Awkward</h2>



<p>Presently, players are finding it impossible to even boot Escape from Tarkov through Battlestate Games’ launcher. Those who were in the game were kicked out, and thousands are reporting their profiles being wiped. It’s unclear at the moment if <strong>every Tarkov player </strong>has been impacted by this issue.</p>



<p>It’s also not clear if this issue has impacted both PvE and PvP platforms, but it’s widely expected that it’s game-wide, which means both ecosystems will have been hit by this issue. That’s a <strong>monumental </strong>blow to PvE players, as one of the biggest selling points of that mode – which is stuck behind a paywall – was that you’d never <strong>need </strong>to undergo a regular wipe. Now, this latest malfunction means that you’ve been forced into one after what might be weeks of play.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As a result of a technical malfunction there was a loss of part of the game profiles data. It is not possible to restore profiles in a short period of time.</p><p>All players whose profiles have been affected will receive proportional in-game compensation in a short period of time.…</p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1821255670579990528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>At this point in the game’s lifecycle, many players are sitting at a high level with tens of millions of roubles in their pockets and countless kits in their stash. They’ll have acquired dozens of keys, keycards, and special items, and they’ll have completed stacks of quests. It was expected that Tarkov would wipe in the coming weeks, but this being a mistake on Battlestate Games’ part just puts a sour taste in the mouths of fans worldwide.</p>



<p>Most players are now just urging Battlestate to hit the wipe button and move on with the planned update. As it stands, the game will revert to normal and then it’ll wipe <strong>again </strong>in a couple of weeks. For some players, this malfunction has wiped their all-time stats, including some that have played Escape from Tarkov for several years.</p>



<p>This isn’t a good look when Arena Breakout: Infinite enters early access in just a few days.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Battlestate Games to hopefully get the full scope of this issue.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-reveals-key-baldurs-gate-3-romance-stats-halsin-bear<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been one year since Baldur’s Gate 3 launched, and now, developer Larian Studios has revealed how players chose to navigate their journey through its Dungeons &amp; Dragons video game.</p><p>The studio unveiled a smorgasbord of stats in <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a lengthy X/Twitter thread</u></a>. While it includes interesting data related to Baldur’s Gate 3’s soul-crushing permadeath Honour Mode and which characters fans favored over others, it also reveals that 1.9 million players were, at one point or another, turned into a wheel of cheese. </p><p>Another crucial stat update reveals that while everyone’s favorite dog, Scratch, was pet 120 million times, The Owlbear Cub and His Majesty the cat received only 41 million and 141,660 pet attempts, respectively. What matters most, though, is that we now know just how everyone chose to approach the game's romance options.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Over the last 12 months, you’ve smooched your companions a total of 75 Million times.</p><p>Please give them a break, their lips are losing pixels. <a href="https://t.co/6UWN45gri6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6UWN45gri6</a></p></div>— Baldur's Gate 3 (@baldursgate3) <a href="https://twitter.com/baldursgate3/status/1821187589925122366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Larian’s posts include a nice selection of romance-related figures. Baldur’s Gate 3 companions have been kissed more than 75 million times in total, with Shadowheart leading the pack at a whopping 27 million kisses. Astarion is, unsurprisingly, in second at 15 million smooches, with poor Minthara in last with 169,937. We also have a look at some stats about Halsin, Larian’s infamous Druid character. Of the 658,000 players who had sex with Halsin, 70% chose to sleep with him in his human form, while the other 30% chose his grizzly bear form.</p><p>In all of Baldur’s Gate 3, Astarion proved to be the most-played as Origin being at 1.21 million characters created with him to start. That’s a lot of High Elf Rogues running around, but Larian does clarify that 93% of players did choose to create their own custom character when beginning an adventure. Meanwhile, while 141,660 players managed to complete Honour Mode, a staggering 1,223,305 playthroughs ended in a loss.</p><p>As for some of the more important story moments achievable in Baldur’s Gate 3, 3.3 million users managed to kill the Netherbrain, while another 1.8 million chose to betray the mind-flayer emperor. Interestingly, only 34 players who chose Lae’zel as their Origin character also chose to kill themselves at the end of the game.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Astarion has been your favourite Origin character avatar, shortly followed by the wizard of Waterdeep and, of course, God’s favourite princess.</p><p>However, over 93% of players chose to play as a custom avatar.

Despite so much to offer at launch, Larian has continued to deliver more content in post-launch updates, with many speculating that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-may-finally-add-everyones-favorite-bard-to-the-party"><u>Alfira may be added as a new companion</u></a> when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-delayed"><u>Patch 7 arrives soon</u></a>.</p><p>While we wait for Larian to expand on the already massive world of Baldur’s Gate 3, be sure to read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>10/10 review</u></a>. At the time of its launch in July 2023, we said, “With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>Humble has teamed up with Capcom for its latest exciting game bundle, and it features some terrific titles across a variety of genres. The full 12-game bundle is valued at $349, but you can snag all 12 Steam games for as low as $30. Technically, the full <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15875915%3Fsid%3DHumbleDealsArticle1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-bundle-capcom-summer-2024%2F1100-6525604%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom Summer 2024 Humble Bundle</a> contains far more than 12 games, as five of the featured titles are compilations, including Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection (12 games), Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle (seven games), and Capcom Fighting Collection (10 games). All told, <strong>this budget-friendly Capcom bundle comes with 41 games</strong>, which breaks down to roughly 75 cents per game.</p><p>Humble Bundles make it easy to add a bunch of great PC games to your Steam library for drastically reduced prices while also supporting a worthy cause. By default, proceeds from each bundle purchased are split between Humble, game publishers, and a charitable organization. You can adjust the ratio of your donation to allocate more or less to each entity. The Capcom Summer 2024 Humble Bundle supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Breakthrough TD. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals raises money for pediatric care at 170 hospitals across the US and Canada. Breakthrough TD is the leading advocacy group for Type 1 diabetes.</p><hr><h2>Capcom Summer 2024 Humble Bundle</h2><p><strong>Pay at least $30 to get the 12 PC titles below.</strong></p><ul><li>Street Fighter V - Champion Edition</li><li>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</li><li>Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle</li><li>Capcom Fighting Collection</li><li>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</li><li>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li><li>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</li><li>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen</li><li>Dead Rising 2</li><li>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</li><li>Dead Rising 3 Apocalypse Edition</li><li>Dead Rising 4: Frank's Big Package</li></ul><p>Like many Humble Bundles, the Capcom Summer 2024 bundle has lower-priced tiers for those who don't want or need all of the games. For $5, you'll get Dead Rising 2, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, and Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. The $10 tier includes those three games as well as Dead Rising 3, Street Fighter V, and Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection. Step up to the $20 level and you'll get everything from the lower tiers and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle, and Dead Rising 4.</p><p>As you can probably already tell, this bundle is a retro gamer's delight. <strong>Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle</strong> has seven retro beat-'em-ups from the studio's back catalog, including Final Fight and Captain Commando. Two of the games, Armored Warriors and Battle Circuit, were only available on Capcom's CPS arcade systems in the '90s.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347031-capcomfighting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347031" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347031-capcomfighting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347031"></a><figcaption>Capcom Fighting Collection</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347031-capcomfighting.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Capcom Fighting Collection</strong> includes faithfully reproduced arcade games from the Darkstalkers series alongside more obscure--but still great--titles like Red Earth and Cyberbots. There are also a few Street Fighter games here, including the absolute gem that is Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.</p><p>Speaking of Capcom's iconic fighting franchise, <strong>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</strong> offers a wide selection of classic entries in the series, including six different Street Fighter 2 titles as well as numerous Street Fighter 3 and Street Fighter Alpha games. For a more modern iteration, <strong>Street Fighter V - Champion Edition</strong> features all 40 fighters and 34 stages as well as over 200 costumes.</p><p>Prefer to spar with your words instead of fists? <strong>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</strong> sees Capcom's favorite defense attorney solve seemingly impossible case. This compilatio includes the first three games in the Ace Attorney series--Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, Justice for All, and Trials and Tribulations--and upgrades the experience with high-definition graphics. There's also <strong>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</strong>, which includes the spin-off games The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures and The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve. Neither game released in the west when on Nintendo DS, and these upgraded versions were given the same level of care as the Phoenix Wright trilogy.</p><p>Phoenix Wright fans will also likely enjoy <strong>Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</strong>. Directed by Ace Attorney creator Shu Takumi, this brilliant puzzle-adventure game didn't garner nearly as large of an audience as it deserved when it first launched for Nintendo DS in 2010, but Capcom gave it a new lease on life last year. Ghost Trick holds an "Overwhelmingly Positive" user rating on Steam.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347032-greatace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347032-greatace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4347032"></a><figcaption>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4347032-greatace.jpg"></figure><p>If you like over-the-top action games loaded with flesh-eating zombies, Capcom's <strong>Dead Rising series</strong> is heavily represented in the bundle by four games. Finally, RPG fans can also check out <strong>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen</strong>, which has become a cult classic since its release back in 2013.</p><hr><h2>More Humble Bundles</h2><p>The impressive Capcom bundle may be Humble's newest offer, but it's certainly not the only bundle that's worth checking out right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/good-news-chooms-cyberpunk-nexus-is-coming-to-demiplane<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> support is coming to the VTT Demiplane. R Talsorian Games has announced Cyberpunk Nexus for the platform, providing players with convenient compendiums and character options all to help them start their journey in Night City on the right foot.</p>
<h2>The Cyberpunk Nexus Announcement</h2>
<p>The Cyberpunk Nexus announcement was made by a <a href="https://x.com/DemiplaneRPG/status/1821229253188350161?t=EbPKc85AglPujTYgMDt9tw&amp;s=19">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) by the official R Talsorian Games account. The post simply states that Cyberpunk Red will have a new home on the platform this Fall. There is no mention of price or what content will be supported.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-red-martial-artist-artwork.jpg?itok=oXYhO5Q- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-red-martial-artist-artwork.jpg?itok=N8Of2kAF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This announcement is important given Demiplane's prominence in the tabletop space. The platform is known for putting all material for supported TTRPGs in one convenient spot. There's no need to keep multiple supplements tabbed; it's all in one space. Whether it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-and-demiplane-announce-pathfinder-nexus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/world-of-darkness-nexus-embraces-partnership-with-demiplane" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>World of Darkness</em></a>, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/demiplane-partners-with-darrington-press-to-launch-candela-obscura-nexus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, you were covered.</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk Red</em> is the latest edition of the dark future sci-fi TTRPG created by Mike Pondsmith. This TTRPG full of cyborg ninjas, brain-melting hackers corporate espionage, and lethal car chases has received plenty of support since launch. These include the <em>Interface RED</em> volumes, the <em>Tales From The Red</em> anthology book, and a mission kit based on the Netflix anime <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</em></a>.</p>
<p>The responses to the Cyberpunk Nexus announcement did include one pertinent question. If someone already owns <em>Cyberpunk Red</em> material on Roll20. will they need to pay again for that content on Demiplane? This is an honest question since Roll20 officially <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired Demiplane</a> back in June.</p>
<p>The official Demiplane account's response was brief and diplomatic. They are still in talks with R Talsorian Games regarding how purchases will be handled across platforms. Given it's an issue of whether or not dedicated players will need to double dip, it is something both companies are taking seriously.</p>
