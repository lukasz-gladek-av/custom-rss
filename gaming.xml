There are some complexities to the game, especially in its differences to <em>Magic</em>. Instead of different colors of magic there are eight different elements that determine similar attributes. Players still must construct a deck of their own, in <em>FFTCG</em> it must have 50 cards exactly. You win by dealing seven points of damage to your opponent directly. </p><p>There are also some specific mechanics that the <em>FFTCG </em>has that try to fix common issues with <em>MTG</em>. As laid out in a helpful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span> post , <em>FFTCG </em>has a smart resource system in place to combat<em> MTG</em>’s common bottlenecking problem that forces you into a card draw loop. It also has a mechanic called EX Burst that gives losing players a better chance at changing the tides, giving you more control over how the game plays out rather than you being so beholden to card draws. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All those specific mechanics make <em>FFTCG </em>sound great, and as someone who has only ever dipped her toes in card games but never fully taken the dive, it makes me feel like this could be a more welcoming experience. The card designs are also a major part of that. I have a strong affinity for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series and its long-history of impeccable character designs. Seeing some of my favorite protagonists, villains, and weird little guys rendered in a beautiful art style on the cards makes me want to buy a bunch of them, even if just to look at them. I haven’t actually played a match yet, and it’s not just because I only have one card.<br></p><p>There are fans of the <em>FFTCG </em>out there. Just look at the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a></span> or dedicated sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://ffdecks.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://ffdecks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ffdecks.com</a></span>, but the community is definitely smaller than <em>MTG</em>’s. Living in New York City, I’m sure I could find a local game shop that does run the occasional game, but by and large, opportunities for playing seem few and far between. As a newcomer it’s hard to find a casual place to learn the basics. I could buy as many cards as I want and read over the rules (which I have done) but I wouldn’t have people to play with, and I don’t think my fiancée would appreciate me trying to force her to play. This makes it all the more confusing to me that there isn’t an online version. </p><p>With the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a></span> making that card game more accessible to players across the world, and a great point of entry for curious newcomers, it feels like a no-brainer for the <em>FFTCG</em>. Yet, until a good online version of the game is released, I think my growing interest in the <em>Final Fantasy Trading Card Game</em> will be limited to purchasing cards so I can look at them. Though it turns out my friend’s gift was strategically timed, as on August 2, <em>FFTCG </em>will release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hidden Trials</em></a></span>, its latest set . Maybe I need to consider setting up Discord matches, at least that way I can excuse the ill-advised spending I’m thinking about doing right now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s head of community has a radical idea: Stop caring about how many people are playing a game at the same time as you. It's pitched mostly at developers and games media, but John Buckley also wants players to let go of the "dead game" mentality.</p>
<p>"Who cares if there's only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don't think it needs to be any more complex than that," Buckley said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ">an interview on the Going Indie YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The people at <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair, in particular, would have reason for panic, if they subscribed to the mentality that active online players are the key benchmark for modern gaming. The game launched into Early Access in January 2024 at rocket speed, selling 5 million copies and reaching 1.3 million concurrent Steam players, surpassing <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. By February 1, the game had sold 19 million between Xbox and Steam, and was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/palworld-has-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever-as-players-near-20-million/">the biggest third-party game launch</a> yet on Xbox's Game Pass service.
</p><p>Given that the creature-catching/survival game with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/pokemon-company-will-investigate-palworld-in-light-of-plagiarism-accusations/">a notably chill approach to intellectual property</a> has so far managed to avoid being sued into oblivion by Pokémon, most would consider it a success. And yet, gaming sites and streaming personalities made sure to note that <em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>suffered "<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/palworld/steam-player-drop">Steam's biggest-ever two-week drop</a>" by mid-February or was "looking like a dead game," as streamer Asmongold said into the microphone around that same time.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NO38QvKraTQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Palworld</em> community boss John Buckley, interviewed by Going Indie.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>“It is fine to take breaks from games”</h2>
<p>As far back as February 20, Buckley (or "Bucky") has been pushing back against metrics as the thing that matters. "This emerging "<em>Palworld has lost X% of its player base</em>" discourse is lazy," <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795">Buckley wrote on X</a>, "but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games." Lots of what Buckley wrote then, and said in the recent interview, is some combination of common sense and remarkable candor: Stop when you're done, play other games, try different genres, support indies, in particular, and don't worry about <em>Palworld</em>, which will put out more content, but not constantly.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>As noted by Going Indie's host, a "dead game" can earn that label through many vectors: concurrent players, developer support, or competitive environment, to name a few. Every game in existence will be "dead," eventually, and that used to be a normal, good thing. Developers started new projects, and players looked forward to new experiences.</p>
<p>But the advent of "live service" games, meant to pull in more money over time through subscriptions and microtransactions, has made a game something that publishers, especially the large kind, never want to see die. They create consistent revenue, rather than the spikes of traditional game publishing, and there are North Stars to look to, like <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>(Or, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">until recently</a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>).</p>
<p>"I don't think it really serves anyone to push gamers to just play the same game day in, day out," Buckley tells Going Indie. While some games, like <em>League of Legends</em> or an MMO, are built to avoid burnout, "Whereas what we're seeing now is a trend of—I won't necessarily say who's trying to push it, but a lot more people are trying to push gamers to play games that aren't really designed to be played for months on end."</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>"Updates, updates, for the good of our economy, there must be more updates."</p><p>Pocketpair</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2><em>Palworld</em> suggests people like new things</h2>
<p>While&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> allows for online play, its huge concurrent player numbers were not the result of its developer carefully cultivating a fear of missing out (FOMO) among players. As Ars' Andrew Cunningham wrote at the peak of <em>Palworld's</em> success, it was more about the devs giving something new to a community that had been habitually starved for something truly new:</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<blockquote><p>Sure, many people are here to see a machine-gun-toting Pikachu mow down other Pikachu. But a ton of people are <em>also</em> there to voice some kind of discontent with the&nbsp;Pokémon franchise as it currently stands, expressing a desire for a deeper and more communal game. ... I think we can look at the combination of reviews, sales, and active users and see that there is clearly an audience hankering for more radical change.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: Moving on to the next ideas rather than competing to keep the same limited pool of constantly online gamers engaged with shareholder-friendly continuity.</p>
<p>"I don't think you need to be kinda pushing yourself to play the same game all the time," Buckley says in the interview. "It's not healthy for us, it's not healthy for developers, it's not healthy for gamers, it's not healthy for gaming media, and it's just not healthy for our industry. Because the more we push this kind of narrative, the more very large companies are going to say, 'Gamers want more live service,' and we're just going to get more of these really soulless live service games that come out and then get shut down nine months later, 12 months later, because they're not making enough money."</p>

However, as players quickly realized, the new Radiant Echoes event isn't good for either one of those things due to how it's currently structured.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, the event sounds fun. Memories of Azeroth's past manifest in one of three older zones, requiring players to complete various objectives in order to summon a boss from the game's long history, like the Lich King, Onyxia, or Ragnaros. Defeating enemies and the bosses, as well as completing objectives, earns players a new event currency, Residual Memories, that can be used to acquire catch-up gear and various cosmetics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Official Shadows Beneath Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It seems simple, but the main issue currently plaguing players is how infrequently the event is actually active. Rather than being active almost all the time, as many players expected and is usually the case for the game's pre-patch events, players complete the event for one zone in just a few minutes, after which it takes about an hour and a half for the event to cycle and begin in another zone. In the meantime, the game tells players it can stick around in the zone where the event was recently completed to farm lingering enemies, but those enemies drop such a small amount of event currency that players would need to kill thousands of them to earn enough to be able to purchase a single item. The best way to earn Residual Memories is to complete a daily quest that awards 1,500 of them, but even those can only be done three times a day on a single character, and still requires players waiting around for hours in order to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">This is, unfortunately, not a mistake but by design. In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24057483/the-war-within-radiant-echoes-event-now-live" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing the event, Blizzard states that the interval between the event zones will be 90 minutes long for the first week. On week two, it will become more frequent, rotating every 60 minutes. For the third and final week of the event, it will cycle every 30 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">The event being such a grind kind of goes against the whole purpose of the rewards, as the gear is meant to prepare characters for The War Within before quickly being replaced in the expansion proper. Given that the expansion is only a month away, it seems pointless to grind out the event as it currently stands, given how long it will take to gear up a single character and how quickly that gear will become irrelevant.</p><p dir="ltr">Players, as they do, took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WoW subreddit</a> to voice their complaints. One player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1eg6rj7/i_feel_scammed_for_resubbing_for_the_prepatch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> they felt "scammed" re-subbing for the event, comparing it unfavorably to the well-liked Legion pre-patch event from 2016.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you're not there right when it starts, it dies in like three minutes," Lpunit writes. "There is basically nothing to do outside of this event other than a 15 minute 'story' quest where nothing really happens. Does anyone else remember the Legion pre-patch event? It was just nonstop going."</p><p dir="ltr">The amount of time between events is the main point of criticism, with another player pointing the absurdity of it all.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's 90 minutes waiting for five minutes of lagging where you wish you can even see the boss to tag it, then wait in the lag if you get a reward," Ur-shak <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ego53a/if_you_isolate_the_gameplay_of_the_prepatch_event/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">writes</a>. "I stopped today to think what's the gameplay of that and the more you think about it the more absurd it is."</p><p dir="ltr">Given player feedback, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard quickly pivots on its intended plan to ramp up the event cycle over the next few weeks and instead lets it run almost constantly from the get-go, but Blizzard has not yet released an official response to player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">new Warbands feature</a>, players can funnel gear and event currency from one character to others on their account. That does make the event grind a little more tolerable, as the event's daily quest is completable on multiple characters and the currency earned can be funneled to other characters as needed, but it still requires players to wait around for the event to actually start.</p><p dir="ltr">The War Within, which introduces new sub specializations called Hero Talents for each class as well as a new form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">endgame content called Delves</a>, releases on August 26.

            <p>BioWare have said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is due for release sometime this autumn, causing many to predict it would arrive in September. That seems unlikely now, as EA say the RPG is due to launch in their financial third quarter which begins October 1st.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA's financial year begins April, with Q1 ending on June 30th and Q2 ending on September 30th. Its latest financial calendar lists The Veilguard has a Q3 release, putting it sometime this year, but in October or later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">according to Eurogamer</a>..
</p>
<p>This is assuming that the game experiences no further development hiccups. That BioWare still haven't put a specific release date on the game means any prediction about its release is foolhardy.
</p>
<p>Edwin saw a 45-minute segment of The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">back in June</a>. He found it to be more of a "single-character action-RPG" than a true party-based RPG in the vein of its predecessors, but he was also plenty impressed with its world, combat and characters. 
</p>
<blockquote>I am definitely in mourning for the less kinetic, more strategic Dragon Age that might have been, but I'm more excited for Veilguard than I thought I'd be after copping the first trailer, which makes the whole thing look like the origin story for a C-list Marvel team. It's worth remembering that Inquisition was often too knotty and expansive for its own good: its battle system is unwieldy, its story is a classic example of midgame bloat, and while Skyhold is a grand and imposing place, it's also a managerial nightmare in which you routinely forget where the crafting tables are, 70 hours in. If Veilguard can carve out the cruft without reducing party members to sidekicks, it could be the soft reboot this long-absent RPG series needs.</blockquote>
<p>The Veilguard has had a long road towards its current state of near-release, as perhaps indicated by us having already written 48 news stories about it since 2018. It was maybe going to be a live service game for a while, it was rebooted as the singleplayer-focused RPG it is now, and it was previously called Dreadwolf. It's a welcome surprise that there are positive vibes about it now that's seemingly mere months away.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-folon-working-on-major-bug-fixes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since its release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> has mostly been received positively, with many fans enjoying what the expansive mod offers. Of course, that's not to say there haven't been a couple of issues along the way. Team FOLON has made a statement to let fans know that they are actively working on bug fixes for the biggest issues and that they will be providing future updates to make Fallout: London as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>These bugs consist of crashes and other bugs. If you are experiencing crashes, there are ways to fix them for Fallout: London, such as installing Buffout 4. By installing this and putting it into the correct folders for Fallout: London, the mod becomes much more robust and crashes less frequently. However, players are still experiencing some major inconsistencies with quick saving, where the game will still crash if too much happens in the background during a quick save.</p>
<p>For those experiencing issues, it is recommended to join the Team FOLON Discord server, where there is ongoing tech support for those in need, and they can try and help you resolve any issues you may be facing. In addition, Team FOLON released a statement on X.</p>
<p>"Firstly, a massive thank you from everyone at Team FOLON. We are very grateful for the amazing attention Fallout: London is receiving, and we appreciate all the great feedback from you! It is truly heartwarming to see the community coming together to praise the release and help one another with it."</p>
<p>Attached to their statement, they included a link to the GOG forum page for Fallout: London, where players and Team FOLON members are <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/fallout_london/fallout_london_quick_start_guide_common_bug_fixes/page1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaming up to help each other</a> out with any issues players may be experiencing. This includes an installation guide for the Buffout 4 mod, which helps massively with crashing issues.</p>
<p>"We're working hard to fix the reported technical issues and expect to release an update soon. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<p>One of the most prominent bug fixes that Team FOLON is working on is the issue with player health and how it is handled after the first train crash. This issue disproportionately lowers the maximum HP of those with high health or endurance levels.</p>
<p>In addition to Team FOLON working on bug fixes, one modder has taken it upon themselves to fix the issue of players having an addiction to dog food. While it may sound comical and insignificant, it can cost the player a huge amount of currency, which is hard to come by in Fallout: London. This mod, created by modder Misslune is titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/74?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dog Food Addiction Remover</a>" and will make your player less likely to want to chow down on Prilladog 24/7.</p>

Only, once they found him, they realized that he had set his account to private, meaning that only pre-existing followers of Parsons could see his posts and respond to him. Many took to mocking his bio, which features a call to “be brave,” and stated that Parsons wasn’t living up to his own values.</p><p>Since then, Parsons, likely reacting to criticisms he was already receiving, has unlocked his account. Despite the gesture, Parsons hasn’t said anything about this morning’s layoffs, and has only shared the blog post via the official Bungie Twitter account.<br></p><p>Coming off the news, disgruntled former employees, fans of Bungie, and voices from around the games industry are now calling for Parsons to take further accountability and step down. Griffin Bennett, a developer who’d been with Bungie from 2018 until the 2023 layoffs, responded to the layoff announcement by calling out Parsons by name and demanding he quit, calling him a “joke.”</p><p>Ben Platnick, a former VFX artist at Bungie, went a step further, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/S3pirion/status/1818674023200702734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/S3pirion/status/1818674023200702734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a></span>, “Pete needs to fucking go. This is mismanagement at the highest level.” He goes on to claim that Parsons’ “spending on R&amp;D while <em>Destiny</em> was not doing the best would prove to be a money pit with no return. And my friends suffer because of it.”</p><p>Among the teams impacted by today’s layoffs, the Player Support team seems to have been particularly gutted. Some members have begun sharing their own stories of the last few months at Bungie working on <em>The Final Shape </em>and their growing distrust in the studio’s leadership, Parsons included.</p><p>Others in the games industry have begun chiming in and expressing their discontent with Parsons’ leadership and have joined in on calls for him to resign. Among the voices are Paul Tassi, who covers <em>Destiny </em>for Forbes, and the <em>Destiny</em>-centric content creator MyNameIsByf.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Destiny developer Bungie has today announced significant cuts at the studio that have seen 220 people, or 17% of the studio’s workforce, let go.</p><p>The cuts affect every level of the company, including most of the Sony-owned studio’s executive and senior leader roles, Bungie boss Pete Parsons said in a post on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bungie.net</a>. "Today is a difficult and painful day," Parsons added.</p><p>Departing staff will be offered "a generous exit package" that includes severance, bonus, and health coverage, Bungie promised.</p><p>Parsons blamed the cuts on the rising costs of development, "industry shifts," and "enduring economic conditions." Because of this, Parsons insistsed, Bungie has had to make "substantial changes" to its cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on live service looter shooter Destiny and the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">Marathon</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape.</p></div><p>The cuts come after what was seen as the successful launch of Destiny 2 expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a>. Parsons acknowledged this in his post, but said they were necessary "to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials." Parsons also said the cuts were made "after exhausting all other mitigation options," although he failed to say what those options were.</p><p>The 220 layoffs come alongside the integration of an additional 155 roles, or 12% of Bungie's workforce, into parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment over the next few quarters. Parsons said this move saves "a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force."</p><p>That suggests that if Sony hadn't taken on these 155 roles, 375 staff would have lost their jobs today, and that the actual reduction in Bungie's workforce over time will be substantially more than 17%.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Marathon CG Stills</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Bungie is working with PlayStation Studios to spin out one of its incubation projects, an action game set in a brand-new sci-fi universe, to form a new studio under the PlayStation banner "to continue its promising development." Parsons did not say how many staff will leave Bungie to form this studio, but did admit "this will be a time of tremendous change for our studio."</p><p>Based on the information provided by Parsons, the total size of Bungie pre-layoffs was roughly 1300, so the number of staff leaving to join this new PlayStation developer is somewhere around 75. This also means the actual percentage of people leaving Bungie proper as a result of this restructuring is around 34%.</p><p>Parsons went on to explain how Bungie got to this point, confirming that the studio had been "running in the red" after its financial safety margins were exceeded following delays to both The Final Shape and Marathon and a rapid expansion that "stretched our talent too thin."</p><p>Over 850 staff remain at Bungie building Destiny and Marathon, Parsons said.</p><p>Here's the statement in full:</p><blockquote>This morning, I’m sharing with all of you some of the most difficult changes we’ve ever had to make as a studio. Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon.  </blockquote><blockquote><strong>That means beginning today, 220 of our roles will be eliminated, representing roughly 17% of our studio’s workforce.   </strong></blockquote><blockquote>These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles.     </blockquote><blockquote>Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie. Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect. For everyone affected by this job reduction, we will be offering a generous exit package, including severance, bonus and health coverage.  </blockquote><blockquote>I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape. But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials. </blockquote><blockquote>We are committing to two other major changes today that we believe will support our focus, leverage Sony’s strengths, and create new opportunities for Bungie talent.   </blockquote><blockquote>First, we are deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment, working to integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12%, into SIE over the next few quarters. SIE has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force.     </blockquote><blockquote>Second, we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development.   </blockquote><blockquote>This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio.  </blockquote><blockquote>Let’s unpack how we ended up in this position; it’s important to understand how we got here. </blockquote><blockquote>For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises. To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development – Destiny and Marathon.  </blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve. We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red. </blockquote><blockquote>After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.   </blockquote><blockquote>As a result, today we must say goodbye to incredible talent, colleagues, and friends. </blockquote><blockquote>This will be a challenging time at Bungie, and we’ll need to help our team navigate these changes in the weeks and months ahead. This will be a hard week, and we know that our team will need time to process, to ask questions, and to absorb this news. Today, and over the next several weeks, we will host team meetings and town halls, team breakout sessions, and private, individual sessions to ensure we are keeping our communication open and transparent.  </blockquote><blockquote>Bungie will continue to make great games. We still have over 850 team members building Destiny and Marathon, and we will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players’ expectations.    </blockquote><blockquote>There will be a time to talk about our goals and projects, but today is not that day. Today, our focus is on supporting our people.  </blockquote><p>In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">multiple sources told IGN</a> that Bungie was in the midst of shifting around its creative leadership on Marathon, including removing long-time Bungie designer Christopher Barrett from the game director role. IGN learned he was being replaced by former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-i-valorant-i-director-leaves-studio-for-bungie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left Riot Games for Bungie</a> in 2022.</p><p>At the time, IGN was told that Bungie was pouring resources into getting Marathon out the door. The game's direction had shifted somewhat under Ziegler's new leadership, one source said, including moving away from custom player characters in favor of a selectable cast of heroes.</p><p>There were also internal fears and rumors that layoffs would immediately follow the release of The Final Shape, with one source saying "nothing adds up" and "something will need to happen to curb costs unless The Final Shape does so well to cover the gap and people can move to Marathon."</p><p>Unfortunately, those fears have now been realized.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Bungie has found itself rocked by a number of major shake-ups in recent years that have tanked morale at the studio and left its future uncertain. Sony <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">officially acquired the studio mid-2022</a>, with the promise it would largely retain a semblance of freedom as an independent subsidiary. Sources told IGN that's largely remained true, but Bungie has struggled to meet key financial targets, with Destiny 2 significantly underperforming last year.</p><p>In October, Bungie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">laid off roughly 100 of its then-1,200 employees</a> amid greater cost-cutting measures that saw Marathon delayed to 2025 and employee benefits slashed, further damaging the mood internally.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/braid">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> "sold like dog shit" according to creator Jonathan Blow.
</p>
<p>Blow discussed the remasters sales performance across several Twitch streams since its release back in May, going so far as to suggest that the studio's "future is uncertain" as a result of low sales.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The comments were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KR5i98aCy0&amp;ab_channel=BlowFan">collated as a series of stream clips by YouTuber Blow Fan</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/braid-anniversary-edition-has-sold-like-dog-sht-creator-jonathan-blow-says/">VGC</a>.
</p>
<p>When asked if the remaster had sold well 34 days after the release of the Anniversary Edition, Blow responded, "No, it sold horribly."
</p>
<p>"Well, it depends on what your standards are. If you compare it to nostalgic things, like the Jeff Minter game that's on Steam, or Atari 50, it's sold much better than all of those. But it has still sold like dog shit compared to what we need to make for the company to survive.
</p>
<p>"The future is uncertain, let's put it that way," he added.
</p>
<p>Blow answered the question similarly 68 and 74 days after release, calling sales "utterly terrible."
</p>
<p>Although sales haven't been great, Blow seems happy with the game they produced, at least. "At some point, you just have to know that what you did was a good thing even if the world doesn't really acknowledge it and this is one of those cases I think."
</p>
<p>First released in 2008, Braid was a critically acclaimed puzzle-platformer pioneer based around the player's ability to manipulate time. Braid: Anniversary Edition remasters the game with fully recreated artwork and over 15 hours of developer commentary. It's the first game released by Blow's company, Thekla, since first-person puzzler The Witness in 2016.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-old-tricks-social-media/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has been silent on social media since kicking off an extended vacation over a month ago. The untimely departure followed the surfacing of allegations that he had messaged a minor in 2017, an event that eventually led to his permanent ban from Twitch. He has since owned up to the wrongdoing – but not before he lost sponsorship deals, assignments, and almost 100,000 followers online.</p>



<p>Just now, Dr Disrespect posted on social media for the first time in five weeks, proving that he’s already up to his old tricks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-those-tricks">Not <em>Those </em>Tricks</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Dr Disrespect posted an image today showing him playing chess against someone playing checkers. It was a shot loaded with thinly veiled meaning, suggesting that he’s playing a much more complex game in the shadows while we’re all at the board playing something much simpler.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s indicative of Dr Disrespect’s narcissistic personality traits, which he has become known for over the last decade or so of streaming.</p>



<p>Soon enough, the ‘Two Time’ had kicked off his staple trend of being a brash loudmouth, firing back at some critics in the comments of his post, referencing one being ‘woke’ and poking fun at another user’s pronouns. Of course, this earned him a mixed response, with some die-hard fans rushing to his defence while others stuck more to the lines of ‘nobody wants you to come back’.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known how or when Dr Disrespect intends to return to streaming, or what’ll be waiting for him when he does. He has lost tens of thousands of followers in recent weeks, but he’s still way up there in the millions – and likely will remain so for quite some time.</p>

            <p>Destiny and Marathon developers Bungie are laying off 220 people - around 17% of their total workforce - as studio heads try to offset a financial crisis brought on by "overly ambitious" expansion, individual project "misfires", and a wider economic downturn in 2023. Bungie are also transferring a further 155 roles to parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment, and are spinning out an untitled incubation project - an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe" - to form a new PlayStation studio.</p><!--more-->
<p>The news follows months of reporting that all is not well at Bungie - the company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-devs-bungie-are-the-latest-big-video-game-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">made an undisclosed number of reductions last year</a>, and were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-face-a-full-sony-takeover-and-more-layoffs-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-flops-according-to-reports">rumoured to be facing a full Sony takeover</a>, with much riding on the fortunes of Destiny 2's Final Shape DLC. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">Writing on the developer's site today</a>, CEO Pete Parsons gave a compressed account of how Bungie have ended up in such dire straits. "For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises," he wrote. "To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly. It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development - Destiny and Marathon. </p>
<p>"Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve," Parsons continued. "We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red."</p>
<p>Parsons's comments about "overly ambitious" expansion during the Covid lockdown years continue a depressing theme. Back at GDC, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">told me</a> that many CEOs are guilty of short-term thinking and fixating on their own bonuses, with staff further down the ladder regarded as disposable.</p>
<p>Perhaps anticipating such comments, Parsons notes that the layoffs "affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles", though he appears to have kept his job. The integration of other roles into Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, has helped "save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force."</p>
<p>Bungie's remaining 850 or so staff will now "focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon". The latter is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-are-rebooting-marathon-as-a-pvp-focused-loot-shooter">a PvP and loot-focussed reboot</a> of the shooter that established Bungie as an FPS developer to watch, prior to Halo: Combat Evolved. It was reportedly subject to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">creative leadership shake-up in March</a>. As for Destiny, The Final Shape was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-is-a-bizarre-dlc-and-all-the-better-for-it">well-received</a> and is a "success" in Parson's view, but evidently hasn't done well enough for the paymasters.</p>
<p>Several now-former Bungie developers have shared the news on social media. Among those hit are sound designer <a href="https://x.com/TransientGamers/status/1818671550163263679">Tzvi Sherman</a>, whose credits include Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp, artist <a href="https://x.com/WestonTJones/status/1818683671110730101">Weston T. Jones</a>, formerly of Rooster Teeth, and Marathon engine/SDET producer <a href="https://x.com/the_ragespy/status/1818673183756874159">Daryl Nelson</a>, formerly of Blizzard and The Pokemon Company.</p>
<p>Other developers have warm words for Bungie's leadership. "Inexcusable," <a href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1818668997443023183">wrote</a> global community lead Dylan Gafner, who still has his job. "Industry leading talent being lost, yet again. Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to deliver for our community time and time again." Former Destiny 2 community manager Liana Ruppert, who was laid off last year, has <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818681130306195616">branded</a> Parsons a "liar" and a "thief" and called on him to step down.</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Lays Off Over 200 Employees, Announces Plans For Deeper Integration With Sony]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/31/bungie-lays-off-over-200-employees-announces-plans-for-deeper-integration-with-sony<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie has announced layoffs affecting 220 employees. In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">blog post</a>, Bungie CEO Pete Parsons cites “rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions” as the primary factor while revealing some dramatic changes for the company going forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These layoffs represent 17 percent of the studio’s workforce and affect every department of the company, with executive and senior leadership roles impacted most. Parsons states that departing employees will receive a “generous” exit package that includes severance, bonus, and health coverage. Bungie also plans to hold employee town halls, along with team and private individual meetings over the coming weeks, to help sort out the next steps. 850 employees remain following the layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape,” Parsons writes. “But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials.”</p>

</article><p>Parsons also reveals plans to further integrate Bungie into Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), which <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/31/sony-announces-its-acquiring-bungie-for-36-billion">acquired the studio in 2022</a>, to leverage its strengths. Firstly, Bungie is working to integrate 155 roles (12 percent of its staff) into SIE over the next few quarters. Bungie states this has allowed it to save additional talent that would have otherwise been affected by today's layoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, Bungie is working with PlayStation Studios to form a new, separate in-house studio that will continue developing one of its incubation projects. Bungie describes this title as, “an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe.”</p>

<p>Parsons then elaborates on how Bungie found itself in this difficult position. He explains that the team’s goal was to ship games in “three enduring, global franchises” and set up several incubation projects to achieve this aim. However, Bungie found itself stretched thin too quickly. This forced its support structures to grow larger than it could feasibly support, especially given the ongoing development of two big titles in Destiny 2 and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon">Marathon</a>.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</p>

</article><p>Parsons also cites this rapid expansion collided with a broader economic slowdown, the sharp downturn games industry, the mixed reception to Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give the recently released The Final Shape expansion for Destiny 2 (which garnered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/destiny-2-the-final-shape/for-the-guardians">critical acclaim</a>) and Marathon more development time to ensure a high quality. “We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red,” Parsons states.</p>

<p>“After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome," Parsons writes. "Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s layoffs come roughly eight months after the studio <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/30/destiny-2-dev-bungie-hit-with-layoffs-just-15-months-after-playstation-acquisition">cut 100 staffers last October</a>, and the second since it was acquired by Sony. It represents another wave of game industry job cuts that have run rampant since last year, and hopefully the affected staff can land on their feet sooner than later.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Microsoft is <a href="https://discord.com/blog/see-whats-happening-on-discord-directly-from-your-xbox">expanding Discord support</a> on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One with a number of new features - including a consolidated Xbox and Discord friends list - that'll be rolling out to general users in the "coming weeks" following a bit of Insider testing.
</p>
<p>
Starting with that Xbox Friends list, Discord friends who are gaming or chatting in Discord Voice will soon appear in the "Happening now" tab alongside Xbox friends in parties or games. Additionally, if a friend is talking or streaming a game in a Discord server voice channel, that channel will also be shown in "Happening Now".
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, once the update is available, it'll be possible to initiate a Discord call, jump straight into a voice channel, or watch a friend streaming directly from the Xbox Friends list.
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Xbox/Discord</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And on that last point, when a Discord friend is streaming their game in voice, watching directly on Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One first requires opening a conversation's member list in the Xbox guide. From there, select the profile of the person streaming in the call, choose "Watch Stream", and their gameplay will be shown full-screen.

			<p>Sony has just <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-august-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-fnaf-security-breach-ender-lilies-quietus-of-the-knights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the August 2024 lineup of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. By far, the most exciting addition is LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.</p>
<p>The licensed open-world title released by TT Games in 2022 <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-biggest-lego-launch-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> new sales records for a LEGO game, with 3.2 million units sold in just two weeks. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga received an eight out of ten score from Nathan Birch in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>In my preview of Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, I worried that the game’s more complex story missions may discourage younger players, and honestly, those concerns were valid. The game doesn’t always explain its objectives as well as it could, to the point even I was confused at times. Of course, parents can help youngsters along via drop-in local co-op, but you’re not always going to be able to head off the frustration and tantrums. That said, I think most kids will have a blast just messing around in the new sandbox stages. TT Games has done a solid job of catering to both sides of the force here – a somewhat more demanding campaign for the parents, and fun sandbox playgrounds for the kiddos.</em></p>
<p><em>And there’s plenty to keep both parents and kids busy. Even given the game’s skimming, it will still take you around 15 hours to play through nine movies worth of story missions, and those looking to collect every brick, stub, character, and vehicle will double or triple that playtime. The Skywalker Saga may be done in theaters, but the game won’t be for a while.</em></p>
<p>The August PlayStation Plus lineup also includes two more games: the dark fantasy 2D action RPG Ender Lilies: Quietus of the Knights for PlayStation 4 users and the family-friendly horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/five-nights-at-freddys-security-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Nights at Freddy’s Security Breach</a>, which is available on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>As a reminder, PlayStation Plus subscribers still have until August 6 to grab July's games (Borderlands 3, NHL 24, and Among Us) for their libraries.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[More Details On The Latest Bungie Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs.941460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/more-details-on-the-latest-bungie-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On Wednesday morning, Bungie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-announces-major-layoffs-and-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced mass layoffs</a> and employee transitions at the company. These layoffs resulted in 220 people being let go, 155 people moved to Sony, and 75 people moved to a new studio. And while the numbers are known, what wasn’t initially known was what specific teams or areas were impacted the layoffs.</p>



<p>“These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles,” CEO Pete Parsons said when announcing the layoffs. </p>



<p>Some of those levels, Insider Gaming has learned, include quality control, player support, and  developers focusing on art, sound, music, and more. And some areas have been hit more than others.</p>

<!-- cache hit 69:single/related:d230c168bfb08d7266f4cf7c90fbb9d7 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Microsoft's revenue from Xbox console sales was down a whopping 42 percent on a year-over-year basis for the quarter ending in June, the company announced in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/press-release-webcast">its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>The massive drop continues a long, pronounced slide for sales of Microsoft's gaming hardware—the Xbox line has now shown year-over-year declines in hardware sales revenue in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/putting-microsofts-cratering-xbox-console-sales-in-context/">six of the last seven calendar quarters</a> (and seven of the last nine). And Microsoft CFO Amy Hood told investors in a follow-up call (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activison-continues-to-boost-xbox-revenues-but-hardware-sees-further-decline">as reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>) to expect hardware sales to decline yet again in the coming fiscal quarter, which ends in September.
</p><p>The 42 percent drop for quarterly hardware revenue—by far the largest such drop since the introduction of the Xbox Series X/S in 2020—follows an 11 percent year-over-year decline in the second calendar quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2>Peaking too early?</h2>
<p>Microsoft no longer shares raw console shipment numbers like its competitors, so we don't know how many Xbox consoles are selling on an absolute basis. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-shipped-five-times-more-ps5-consoles-last-quarter-than-microsoft-did-with-xbox">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad estimates</a> that Microsoft sold less than 900,000 Xbox units for the quarter ending in March, compared to 4.5 million PS5 units shipped in the same period.</p>
<p>Overall, the reported revenue numbers suggest that sales of the Xbox Series X/S line peaked sometime in 2022, during the console's second full year on store shelves. That's extremely rare for a market where sales for successful console hardware <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/02/has-the-ps4-peaked-annual-console-sales-are-flat-for-2017/">usually see a peak in the fourth or fifth year on the market</a> before a slow decline in the run-up to a successor.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/xbox-quarterly.001.png" data-height="768" data-width="1024" alt="Even before this quarter's 42 percent revenue drop (which would be quarter 14 on this graph), Xbox has shown an uncharacteristic early revenue decline."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/xbox-quarterly.001.png" data-height="768" data-width="1024">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Even before this quarter's 42 percent revenue drop (which would be quarter 14 on this graph), Xbox has shown an uncharacteristic early revenue decline.</p><p>Kyle Orland</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The older Nintendo Switch, which launched in 2017, is now firmly in that sales decline period of its life cycle. Yet worldwide unit sales for the console declined only 36 percent year-over-year—to 1.96 million units shipped—for the first calendar quarter of the year. That's a less precipitous relative drop than Microsoft is now facing with the much younger Xbox Series X/S.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Annual sales of Sony's PlayStation 5 have continued to rise in recent years, peaking at 20.8 million units for the fiscal year ending in March. But PS5 sales did decline over 28.5 percent year-over-year for the January-through-March quarter, just the third such quarterly decline the console has posted on a year-over-year basis (Sony has yet to post sales numbers for the April-through-June quarter).</p>
<h2>A subscription bright spot?</h2>
<p>Aside from hardware sales, Microsoft's gaming content and services revenue was up a healthy-sounding 61 percent year-over-year for the latest reported quarter. But a full 58 percent of that increase was the "net impact from the Activision acquisition," which you may remember <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/microsoft-finally-owns-candy-crush-as-it-closes-69b-activision-blizzard-deal/">cost the company $68.7 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Given the cratering Xbox hardware revenues, it's not all that surprising that Microsoft is focusing on its (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/microsoft-asks-many-game-pass-subscribers-to-pay-more-for-less/">now more expensive</a>) Game Pass subscription side to buoy the Xbox business as a whole.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/xbgpu.jpg" data-height="1080" data-width="1920" alt="Xbox Game Pass continues to be a bright spot for Microsoft's gaming business."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/xbgpu.jpg" data-height="1080" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Xbox Game Pass continues to be a bright spot for Microsoft's gaming business.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>"I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places and really build what looks like more to us the software annuity and subscription business," Hood said during the investor call. "I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass."</p>
<p>That kind of talk suggests the Xbox brand will continue to thrive via Xbox Game Pass, and possibly through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">Xbox Game Studios games for other platforms</a>. But if these sales trends continue, we may be facing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/what-a-potential-post-xbox-future-could-mean-for-sony-and-nintendo/">a near future where physical console hardware is no longer a core part of the Xbox brand</a>.

It's a hefty 544-page hardcover tome of character illustrations, promotional art, rough concepts, detailed creator commentary, and an interview with series artist Shigenori Soejima, this will be an essential purchase for Persona fans.</p><p>Art books and collectibles based on Atlus games tend to be very popular, and since Persona 5 is the studio's most popular RPG, we'd expect this book to be uniquely popular in comparison to previous Atlus art books and encyclopedias. The Design Works books for each Persona game typically have limited print runs as well, so once they're gone, you'll have to deal with the reseller market in case you don't reserve an order.</p><p>Priced at $73.40 currently, this price will almost certainly change prior to launch; as a reminder, Amazon will only charge you when the book ships out from its warehouse. You'll also be billed the lowest price at that time, so you won't have to worry about losing out on any potential discounts by preordering now.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you haven't played it, Persona 5 tells the story of the Phantom Thieves, high school students who save people from the twisted desires of those around them by awakening the power of their true selves. It's wonderfully weird stuff, and worth checking out. It's available on all modern platforms, and since it has been out for a few years, you can get a pretty good deal on a game that'll keep you occupied for dozens of hours.

		<p>Bungie has announced it is laying off 220 staff, approximately 17% of its workforce, across all levels of the company including leadership roles. Pete Parsons, CEO of Bungie, has released a long statement for the reasons why 220 will be losing their jobs at the development studio. This includes the economic downturn of recent years, and costs relating to Destiny 2 and Marathon exceeding the financial limits of the company.</p>
<p>Pete Parsons has also confirmed that Bungie will become more integrated into Sony Interactive Entertainment, with 12% of roles being moved over to Sony. In addition, Bungie is spinning off a yet unnamed project into PlayStation Studios with the establishment of a new studio to continue work on the project. The full statement can be read below.</p>


<p><em>This morning, I’m sharing with all of you some of the most difficult changes we’ve ever had to make as a studio. Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>That means beginning today, 220 of our roles will be eliminated, representing roughly 17% of our studio’s workforce.  &nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em>These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie. Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect. For everyone affected by this job reduction, we will be offering a generous exit package, including severance, bonus and health coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape. But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We are committing to two other major changes today that we believe will support our focus, leverage Sony’s strengths, and create new opportunities for Bungie talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>First, we are deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment, working to integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12%, into SIE over the next few quarters. SIE has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Second, we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development.  &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s unpack how we ended up in this position; it’s important to understand how we got here. </em></p>
<p><em>For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises. To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development – Destiny and Marathon. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve. We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.  &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As a result, today we must say goodbye to incredible talent, colleagues, and friends.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>This will be a challenging time at Bungie, and we’ll need to help our team navigate these changes in the weeks and months ahead. This will be a hard week, and we know that our team will need time to process, to ask questions, and to absorb this news. Today, and over the next several weeks, we will host team meetings and town halls, team breakout sessions, and private, individual sessions to ensure we are keeping our communication open and transparent. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Bungie will continue to make great games. We still have over 850 team members building Destiny and Marathon, and we will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players’ expectations.   &nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>There will be a time to talk about our goals and projects, but today is not that day. Today, our focus is on supporting our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>-pete&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has announced layoffs to the tune of over 200 employees as part of what studio head Pete Parsons calls a "new path" for the company.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> made on the Bungie website earlier today, 220 Bungie staffers, or around 17% of the studio's total workforce, will be let go due to "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions".</p>
<p>Parsons says that despite the success of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>'s latest expansion&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>(of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-leaks">May's major leak</a> was presumably not a part), the decision to lay off hundreds of employees was "necessary" in order to move towards "more realistic goals and viable financials".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=w9VANFsY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-layoffs-destiny-2-the-final-shape.jpg?itok=1FnJ5zeK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer Bungie has laid off hundreds of its employees.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as 220 employees being let go, around 155 staffers from Bungie are being integrated into Sony, which Parsons says will enable his studio to "save a great deal of talent" that would otherwise have been let go.</p>
<p>Additionally, although Bungie has seemingly canceled a number of what it calls "incubation projects", one such in-development project, an "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe", will be spun off as a new game to be developed by a newly-created internal PlayStation studio. This project may or may not be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-teases-new-team-based-action-game-set-in-lighthearted-science-fantasy-universe">light-hearted action game</a> revealed by Bungie last year.</p>
<p>These "incubation projects" were, according to Parsons, attempts to expand its work to ship games in "three enduring, global franchises". They would have been headed up by senior execs from existing Bungie teams, but over the course of the last 18 months or so, Bungie leadership realized the incubation project model would "stretch [its] talent too thin, too quickly".</p>
<p>Parsons says that Bungie became "overly ambitious" during this period, and that it was "running in the red". The studio head goes on to say that Bungie did everything it could to "avoid today's outcome", but that it was unable to do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bungie-layoffs-marathon.jpg?itok=jZ89mOZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bungie-layoffs-marathon.jpg?itok=kHmFeEAW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie is now focusing all its efforts on&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Parsons says that Bungie still has more than 850 staffers working on&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>-related projects, and that it will share more information about its upcoming projects in the future.</p>
<p>This isn't the first round of Bungie layoffs within the last 12 months. Back in October, the studio reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-reportedly-laid-off-100-employees-due-to-poor-destiny-2-sales-as-more-detail">laid off around 100 employees</a> following poor sales of the&nbsp;<em>Lightfall&nbsp;</em>expansion. Additionally, in February, Bungie's parent company Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">let around 900 employees from various studios go</a>, although Bungie seemingly wasn't among them.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Bungie has in store for the future, but for now, more than 200 of its employees find themselves without a job. Stay tuned for more.</p>
