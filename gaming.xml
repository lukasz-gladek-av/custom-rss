            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-doing-a-fire-type-event-but-its-not-exactly-setting-the-community-ablaze<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning when I woke up I, like every other well-adjusted individual, immediately silenced my alarm and started Pokémon TCG Pocket to open my morning pack. Lo and behold, I discovered that a brand new event had been introduced to the game overnight. It's a "Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak Event." And it's. Fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This fire-type event seemingly came out of nowhere as a pleasant surprise today, and it includes a few different elements. There's a new set of Missions to complete with various rewards, all largely revolving around collecting certain fire-type Pokémon. There are new event-based Wonder Picks, including one that will let you select from five desirable fire-type cards and another that rewards either a fire-type card or currency. And there's a limited-time flair you can purchase for certain cards that gives them a fiery effect. Neat!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fun as it was to wake up to a surprise event, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gx188l/fire_event_is_now_live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reaction</a> from the community so far is... lukewarm, to say the least. This is not the most exciting event! The mission rewards aren't amazing for one, and they require players to complete them with cards obtained during the event. So, for instance, one of the missions is to obtain an Arcanine ex card. I already have one of those. But that doesn't count, because I had it before the event started. So I have to obtain a second one during the event in order to finish the achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obtaining those cards is supposed to be easier due to the Wonder Pick options, but the hourly free Wonder Pick only has a smaller chance of actually getting a card instead of currency, and the other Wonder Pick that includes five different cards costs a whopping three stamina. For those who don't play Pocket: this means players either need to wait for very long periods of time to get a chance of obtaining the card they want, or they have to spend real money to roll the dice more frequently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, there's the event flair. It works how all other flairs work - you need to exchange a currency called Shinedust as well as an unusable duplicate of the card you want the flair on to obtain it. That means, for instance, if you want to obtain the event flair for an Arcanine ex, you need not one, not two, but <em>three </em>Arcanine exes sitting around, and then you can exchange the spare one for the flair. Sure, your chances of getting that Arcanine ex are higher thanks to the event Wonder Pick... but, oh, did I mention that the event only lasts five days?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's admittedly hard to complain here, given that this was a totally unexpected event that really only gives players a few extra chances at some fire-type cards they might want. But in recent days, the Pokémon TCG Pocket community has been getting restless. Community members have been increasingly complaining that there's just not a lot to do after a certain point beyond waiting to open new packs twice a day. Some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters">inventing their own battle formats to pass the time</a>, but at the moment, event activities are the main form of entertainment in Pocket. The previous water-type event included a bunch of PvE battles with cards to earn from them, so the fire-type event not including something similar is a bit perplexing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, this seems more like a stopgap between the water-type event and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">upcoming expected new booster pack releases</a>. For now, we'll just have to keep opening packs while we wait for something new to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Because the moon theory was proved true for Trailer 1. Two months before Trailer 1 came out, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/excitement-for-rockstars-gta-6-reveal-is-sending-fans-to-the-moon">Rockstar released a GTA Online image that included the moon</a> in a phase (Waning Gibbous) that ended up corresponding with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-confirms-gta-6-trailer-1-release-date">the day Rockstar announced the release date of Trailer 1</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the start of November 2024, and Rockstar’s release of another GTA Online image, below, that - you guessed it - includes the moon in the Waning Gibbous phase. The real-life moon ends its current Waning Gibbous phase today, November 22, and from tomorrow moves on to the Last Quarter phase. And so, fans thought today would be the last possible day for either Trailer 2 itself or an announcement on when it would drop.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GTA Online Community Update</p><p>First details on an exciting new GTA Online update coming in December — featuring clandestine operations launched from the Darnell Bros.

With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later. But will the moon show fans the way? Or is Rockstar just messing with its fanbase, as it’s done many times in the past?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025">the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response">coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>A little teaser story to end the week, care of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-21">Maw</a> reader MiniMatt. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> devs Wube Software have dropped the vaguest of hints about their next game project, or at least, shared one of their current inspirations: World Of Warcraft.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The news comes in the shape of a <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-438">wrap-up article</a> about the Factorio Space Age expansion, which we think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorio-space-age-review">pretty decent</a>. There's a few paragraphs on player stats, bugs and the official soundtrack, and then, a brief aside on future projects.</p>
<p>"This is one of the most frequent questions I'm getting," writes developer Kovarex. "Well, I'm not really sure, but we are playing with different kinds of ideas for the next game. Will we figure out something worth doing? Maybe.</p>
<p>"To clear my head, and gather a little bit of inspiration, I decided to experience the Fresh <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> world for a while, you can find me in the Fresh server in the guild called Factory must grow," he adds. "The game I'm thinking about is related to WoW in a similar way as to how Factorio is related to Minecraft." </p>
<p>And there you have it. Told you it was brief. Yes, I am currently scrunching my eyes up and trying to solve the following quasi-mathematical equation: (factory builder/block builder) = (massively multiplayer RPG/???).</p>
<p>Let me know if you figure anything out. Many thanks again to MiniMatt, who also tipped us off about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dayz-creator-reveals-a-kerbal-space-program-killer-with-kittens-and-challenges-license-owners-to-sue-him">that spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program from the original creator of DayZ</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sniper-elites-battle-royale-game-has-been-canceled-as-tencent-pulls-funding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Just a few months after its announcement, Rebellion has canceled its Sniper Elite Battle Royale game, Archipelago.</p>



<p>First announced in August 2024, Project Archipelago, internally known as Sniper Island, was a team-based multiplayer Battle Royale in which teams of three battled it out to be the last to survive. The game had its last Alpha playtests in mid-August 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game was canceled because Tencent decided not to continue funding the project. While we’ve not been able to pinpoint the exact reason, Rebellion higher-ups implied in meetings with staff that funding was pulled due to the disastrous launch of Firewalk Studios’ Concord, which caused Tencent to get skittish about some of its projects.</p>



<p>Archipelago’s announcement didn’t necessarily go down well with Sniper Elite fans, either. Its reveal was criticized on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulSkpVklx4&amp;ab_channel=Rebellion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rebellion YouTube channel</a>, with fans confused over Rebellion’s decision to move from single-player games to a Battle Royale. </p>



<p><span>It’s understood that despite the game’s canc</span>ellation, no one’s employment was affected, with staff being moved to other projects, including&nbsp;Sniper Elite: Resistance, its next mainline Sniper Elite game.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming asked Rebellion to comment before publication, but they declined to comment.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/winter-burrow-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/winter-burrow-makes-a-harsh-survival-game-awfully-cute.1043127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/winter-burrow-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Winter Burrow </em>was announced in an Xbox showcase back in June, but it more or less promptly fell off my radar: while I love a survival game, especially one with snow, I’m not necessarily a “cozy” games fan. I will be 100% honest that it came back in front of me thanks to a press release about a new trailer this week, and I will be even more honest that this form of outreach did exactly what it was supposed to, because I then played the game’s Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a>, and it is extremely my thing.</p><p>In <a href="https://noodlecake.com/games/winter-burrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Winter Burrow</em></a>, you play as a tiny mouse who has returned to their remote childhood home to fix it up. There’s a lot of the usual stuff of survival games: hunger, stamina, and temperature meters to manage; items to forage and craft; a day/night cycle that means you need to be careful with your time. The “cozy” aspect comes through in the form of aesthetics; instead of crafting a coat out of the hides of slaughtered wolves like in my favorite game <em>The Long Dark</em>, you knit thick sweaters in your tattered armchair next to the fire.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Winter Burrow Developer Commentary | THE MIX Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2DWZHQnYAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The demo took me about 15 minutes and was mostly an introduction to the basics of the game, tasking me with repairing some items around the burrow and the surrounding world. That world is big and cold and challenging; I easily got lost in all the snow and rocks and froze to death with surprising frequency. On death, you drop your items and can retrieve them, but on a few occasions I had simply wandered too far and had to abandon my loot. Knitting a fuzzy sweater and pants helped me survive a bit longer, but they didn’t stop the cold from keeping me on my toes. Dread would fill me as my screen started icing over and I’d rush back to my burrow.</p><p>I know everyone isn’t a fan of this kind of survival game rhythm (or as prone to getting lost in games), but I love it. In many games, traversing the world is negligible, but I love games that use cold to make navigation such a present challenge, where surviving small jaunts out of your base feel like big achievements. This pace feels like it fits well with the fact that your character is a mouse, a creature that’s inherently tiny and vulnerable and always looks a bit outmatched. This made me appreciate the cozy aspects of the game; making a hot meal and nice clothes for a tiny mouse made me feel like I was taking care of a stressed-out pet, and gave me the same feeling as when I scrape together enough resources to make my character a hot cup of coffee in <em>The Long Dark</em>.</p><p>When the demo ended I groaned “nnooo…,” so now that I’ve followed its plot threads, I’m curious to jump back in and explore the world more. <em>Winter Burrow</em> is due to come out in 2025.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

the Show, new elements of Diamond Dynasty that will replace Sets and Seasons, and improved Franchise trade metrics and offseason play. The gameplay is also set for a bit of a refresh, with MLB 25 expanding on quick-time events, defensive AI, and updated pathing for more engaging gameplay in the moment.</p><p>We can expect to hear more about MLB 25 and what it will be bringing to the franchise in the lead up to its release, which can be expected around the start of the Major League Baseball season in March next year.</p>

		<p>It’s been real chilly, but that’s not the end of the world when your gaming PC can pump out enough waste heat energy to keep your gaming room warm, is it? Or maybe that <em>is</em> a sign of the end times…&nbsp;I don’t rightly know.</p>
<p>My PC’s actually been relatively silent this week, and my gaming in general rather limited. I did try to boot up Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but foolishly thought that would be possible on launch day, and haven’t managed to get back to it. That’s on my to-do list for the weekend, though, alongside checking out the Gran Turismo 7 PS5 Pro update.</p>

<p>We’ll start with <strong>Dom</strong> this week, who’s been playing a wide range of games out of Japan. There’s the adorable platforming of Astro Bot, the Persona-like JRPG-ing of Metaphor: ReFantazio, and he’s done a “let’s watch Eastenders from the start” with a fresh Final Fantasy XIV run. But the highlight of the week has been being able to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which he had a great time previewing ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/dynasty-warriors-origins-demo-launching-this-week/">the demo release</a>.</p>
<p>The big release of the week was STALKER 2, with GSC Game Worlds’ journey culminating in a game that <strong>Miguel</strong> found incredibly immersive and compelling. No, it’s not quite perfect and there’s a menagerie of oddities and bugs, but they didn’t really bother him that much while reviewing, and the devs new adventure is trying to patch as much of the problems out ASAP.</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> had a typically heady blend of different things as well. He’s enjoyed “the philosophically fascinating Threshold, the wonderfully scary Beyond Hanwell , the cosy Flock and cleared the extra trophies and speedrun levels on Astro Bot.” Add some Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership to that, though he’s found it a bit disappointing so far. Then again, he’s just managed to get some hammers.</p>
<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> booted up his PS Vita for a play through of Tearaway, which “is still a fantastic experience that a lot more people should try and revisit.” <strong>Nic B</strong> might disagree, but he’s a complete reprobate and shouldn’t be listened to.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454706">Not Aran’s hands.</p>
<p>Now with around 40 hours in Phasmophobia, <strong>Gamoc</strong> is still surprised by how much he’s enjoying it, and has started to unlock some of the higher end gear to help. That’s been joined by some Rimworld, Necesse, and Noita.</p>
<p>The birthday boy <strong>Ade</strong> was lucky enough to get Super Smash Bros. and Bayonetta 3 for his birthday. “Super Smash Bros has been a massive hit (pun totally intended). My family and I enjoying unlocking a seemingly never ending roster of iconic characters. I’ve been enjoying Bayonetta 3 too, but seeing as I missed Bayonetta 2, the plot has me utterly bamboozled! Though, judging by my hazy memories of playing through the original game on PS3 and the sheer madness of <em>that</em> story, the bamboozling sounds about right!”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Jim</strong> sadly didn’t have&nbsp;“Dynasty Warriors: Origins being pretty great, actually” on his bingo card for 2025, so hasn’t won this week’s jackpot, but did enjoy the demo.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have been voluble lately about potentially adding elements from other sci-fi worlds to the shooter, with chief creative officer Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000#comments">rubbing his hands gleefully at the prospect of partnerships with Warhammer, Alien, the Fifth Element</a>, and more besides. Speaking at the G-STAR Conference in Busan earlier this month, recently appointed chief executive officer Shams Jorjani confirmed that Arrowhead are looking into such collaborations, giving the example of refitting your dropship to look like one of Halo's Pelicans, or introducing the Zerg from Blizzard's Starcraft as an enemy faction. </p>
<p>Jorjani cautioned listeners, however, that these injections of third-party DNA need to look and feel appropriate to the setting. After all, if you start fecklessly chucking the Zerg, Chaos Space Marines or Fifth Element's, er, flying taxis into Helldivers 2, it might spoil the meticulous coherency of a game in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-escaping-death-by-performing-aerial-salutes-and-hugs">saluting protects you against lethal falls</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-apc-deliverer-isnt-joel-claims-source-raising-grim-prospect-of-multiple-joels">some guy called Joel is running the universe</a>. The funny part is that according to Jorjani, Arrowhead once envisaged a system that would get round the problem of inconsistency by essentially making third-party cosmetics, including whole map skins, visible only to players who have them enabled. To put that another way, Arrowhead once envisaged a system in which individual <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> would <em>hallucinate other licenses</em>.</p> <!--more-->
<p>I feel a <em>little</em> guilty about writing this up, because it's based on <a href="https://www-inven-co-kr.translate.goog/webzine/news/?news=300928&amp;_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">an automatic Google translation of an article in Korean</a>, and automatic translations aren't always reliable. But also, it's fun. Find the relevant extract from Jorjani's answer below. I would focus on the spirit of the statements rather than the specific wording.</p>
<blockquote><p>We've discussed a cosmetic system in the past where only what the gamer sees changes. For example, in the case of 'Dota 2', when applying a map skin, the user's map will appear to have changed, but others will see it as the default map. However, this was rejected because it could cause confusion during the game. The terrain or object that one person is talking about may appear different to another person. In any case, even if there is a crossover, it seems that most of it will be applied to armor or weapons. As long as it does not interfere with the gamers' gaming experience. </p></blockquote>
<p>Games have done things like this before, but I'm struggling to think of one that renders the entire map differently for every player with the associated DLC installed. I, personally, think that having certain players effectively occupy parallel realities would be both brilliant and entirely in keeping with Helldivers 2's parody of brainless kamikaze heroism.</p><p>You could portray it as an injection of experimental combat amphetamines. Imagine landing on Malevelon Creek and trying to coordinate a base assault when half of your squad think they're in Disneyland. You ask your sniper to cover you but unfortunately, she's got the 101 Dalmations DLC installed and perceives the Tyranids as puppies. You call in the dropship and she runs away screaming about the disembodied head of Glenn Close. What I'm basically saying is: make it a bit like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I">this cinematic of the Pyro in Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<p>There's a fair bit more from both Jorjani and Pilestedt in the full G-STAR Conference piece, including reflections on the ever-incendiary question of weapon balancing, recent additions like the Democracy Space Station, and how they've adapted their production process since Helldivers 2's release. They also cheerfully refused to talk about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sightings-of-helldivers-2-illuminate-faction-on-galactic-war-map-are-fake-news-says-arrowhead-boss">Illuminate</a>, those wily devils.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just before the test period began, Blizzard released the first footage of Hazard in action and a breakdown of the Scottish hero’s kit. In some ways, Hazard feels like an amalgamation of other characters’ abilities, similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-juno-support-trial-period-space-ranger-1851599766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-juno-support-trial-period-space-ranger-1851599766">Juno</a></span>. However, there’s enough variation here that I can see him feeling fairly distinct, and not just like a copy of the heroes he borrows from.<br></p><p>Like most other tanks in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, Hazard’s kit is about claiming space and disrupting the enemy team. His primary fire is a medium-range, shotgun-like burst of spikes from the gatling gun on his right hand, which compliments the rest of his playstyle as a mobile, scrappy tank along the lines of Winston or Doomfist. Hazard can leap like Winston, and follow it up with a powerful melee attack using the purple spikes that grow from his armor. His mobility doesn’t end there, though, as he can also climb up walls like Hanzo and Genji. Both these abilities help him reach the high ground with ease and chase down foes that would otherwise give a more stationary tank trouble.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197298" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When Hazard actually reaches enemies in close range, he can also brawl and claim space with his Spike Guard ability that heavily reduces incoming damage, regenerates ammo, and fires spikes from his back a short distance in front of him. This is good for both pushing forward against enemies as well as retreating, but unlike Ramattra’s guarding ability, it has a time limit and can’t be used indefinitely.</p><p>Probably the most interesting tool in Hazard’s arsenal is the Jagged Wall ability. Similar to Mei with her Ice Wall, Hazard is able to build a wall that can block incoming attacks, but it’s not quite as wide as Mei’s. It makes up for this with some additional perks, including its spiky exterior that damages and repels foes who touch it, and that it can be built onto the side of walls. This gives him the opportunity to erect a wall in some spaces Mei can’t, and maybe even knock an enemy off the side of the map if you can time it right.</p><p>Rounding all this out is his ultimate, Downpour. This ability rains down purple spikes a decent distance in front of Hazard, holding enemies caught in the, er, downpour in place. Those affected can still fire their weapons, but they will be immobile for a short time, leaving them open for a killing shot.</p><p>Overall, Hazard seems like he thrives when he’s claiming space and squishy heroes will probably hate to see him coming. But I’m curious to actually see how players react to him after playing, as every time an <em>Overwatch 2 </em>hero is released, there are weeks of discourse about how they have ruined the game or aren’t good enough to move the needle. Where will Hazard fall? We’ll see in the coming days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/how-wall-running-and-high-speed-movement-works-in-project-haste<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Howdy! My name is Connor Roberts, the programmer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xgcRzsQED8">Project: Haste</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an online first-person arena shooter made in Unity. Today I would like to run you through how I implemented the high-speed movement for our project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an arena shooter game where players chain together movement techniques to outmaneuver their opponents. Our main goal with this game was to give players ultimate control over their positioning and maneuverability. The movement system is the basis for the game, especially as the game expands from a student project at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://vfs.edu/programs/game-design">Vancouver Film School</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://vfs.edu/news/2024/09/26/alumni-success-vfs-students-nominated-for-%E2%80%98project-haste%E2%80%99-at-the-16th-unity-awards">Unity Awards 2024 Nominee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and finally into a full-scale live-ops release where this movement will be the bread and butter of the player experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It starts with the design">It starts with the design</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a team, we knew immediately when starting pre-production for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that we wanted the basis of our game to be a satisfying movement system. I began prototyping based solely on intuition because I wanted to test movement out before we had a concrete design - this let us understand what we wanted before we sat down at the whiteboard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This ended up being one of our greatest strengths, as I had unknowingly created the foundational system for the game; it was complete with wall-running, slides, double jumps, and a dash.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For some time we considered basing the game around grappling hooks or rocket jumping, but came to the conclusion that the dash ability solved those problems for us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I developed this movement to have a lot of tunability so the rest of the team could easily work with it. I also made sure to use scriptable objects and remote config to allow for the team’s designers Trex Hossain and Sergio Lisuardi to tune our movement while they ran hundreds of playtests for our movement as the project matured.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had many core inspirations, such as Quake and Titanfall 2, but before we had fully studied these titles or even had the full concept for the game, the movement was largely complete - at least technically.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s hard for me to personally say where I drew inspiration during the early movement prototyping, even to the end of production. Not to say I didn’t study similar games, but the movement system became so core to our project that there wasn’t much time to study movement in other games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With this in mind, I think it would be a good idea to move on to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the movement actually works, which is made up of our:</span><br></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Camera and Screen Space Effects</span></p></div></li><li></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> evolved, these layers made our movement go from good to addicting.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Custom physics">Custom physics</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the core of our movement is my disdain for using built-in physics in game engines. I don’t know what it is, but I’d rather program it all so I can provide maximum tunability for the design team, or just for myself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make the physics easier on myself, I used a state machine to divide every movement state’s physics into individual closed systems with input and output parameters. With each closed system created, the state machine allowed for the inputs and outputs of these systems to feed into each other to create a predictable, tuneable, and fluid movement system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, our wall run has an input of the player’s current speed and a gravity input. This speed is simply the value in meters per second, and the gravity is fed in as a tuned gravity specific to wall running. These are then used in conjunction with some collision-vector shenanigans to let you run along curved surfaces in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This then outputs a velocity value to the player, which can later be used as an input for any other movement state.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even though the main movement mechanics are our Wall Run, Slide, and Double Jump, we also had movement mechanics that were hidden from the player such as our slide jumping, our double jump’s forward boost, or our mental ability used for affordance at ledges. Each of these had its own closed physics systems which fed together to allow the player to traverse our levels with additive speed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Camera and screen space effects">Camera and screen space effects</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now with all of our movement pieces connected together, we needed to make the player </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fast. We used a bunch of tricks here to make the player feel in tune with the movement of the player, such as FOV changes mapped to the change in velocity of the player, dash lines that scale based on player speed, and changing color depending on the current movement ability. We basically wanted to make the game feel satisfying in every movement that you do, really scratching the fast-paced itch all of our brains were craving.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to these tricks, we also rotate the camera depending on the player’s turn speed, which made us feel really in tune with the way we were moving. We also do this with the wall run -and all of our jumps for that matter- to tilt the player away from the surface they are on, which really sold those movement abilities for us and made it feel like you were impacting the surfaces of the game world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, we had some other screen space effects. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is very stylized, so we wanted to add some feedback to our movement in a more stylized fashion. I created a halftone shader that we used around our project with various masks to create effects like screen transitions, and we realized we could use custom-designed masks to make different halftone shapes. We ended up using this on the edges of our screen to create feedback directly for wall running, sliding, double jumping, and even when you are using boost pads and jump pads. Matching the colors with the dash lines made everything feel very cohesive and fast.</span><br></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Animation feedback">Animation feedback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I can’t write this section without mentioning our team’s artists Chevi Hernandez and Jose Andres Lopez. Chevi really worked wonders on all of our character animations, along with weapon models and animations done by Jose, which became a key indicator for our players in order to maintain understanding during the high-octane gameplay found while players duke it out in the Haste League.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We ultimately had many layers of animation present, including a unique animation for each directional input for each movement ability- this was used to ensure players fully understand their movements as they make them, and gives a point of reference for what a movement action is going to do to your direction in gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mixing these animations with SFX and music from our composer and SFX designer Declan Johnston means that players have all the tools in their tool belt in order to fully understand what is happening with their own character, as well as their surroundings in a match.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final takeaway">Final takeaway</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’d like to highlight how making a game within a short time frame really does take a village. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was only in development for four months, which looking back is incredibly short. It is thanks to my amazing team that I am fortunate enough to even be writing about our project, let alone programming away and getting it prepared for a full scale release. I feel truly lucky. Our process was very interesting; by the book in some ways, and very much not for others. The communication and cohesive vision of this team allowed for something pivotal to our gameplay, our movement, to be proved out and iterated on from week one of pre-production, needing few revisions as the game matured. Being the programmer for the team allowed me to focus in and get a mind map of how the game was going to function in its entirety, and that really started with that one clear goal of having precise and responsive fast-paced movement. I have loved watching that mind map transform into a game that I can see with the help of my team, it truly has been the most rewarding experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Project: Haste</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team and myself really hope you have enjoyed reading this!

			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would help boost sales, as it's one of the most popular and best-selling game franchises out there. As a result, US games consumer spending is rising once more in the month of October, with the sales being boosted nicely by the launch of Call of Duty. This information comes from<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sales-up-10-following-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-us-monthly-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Circana's monthly report</a>, which says that hardware, software, and accessories sales combined have gone up by 10% year-on-year for a sum of $4.7 billion. Activision confirmed with The Washington Post that with the inclusion of Black Ops 6, the franchise as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/10/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-500-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whole surpassed 500 million units</a> sold. This statistic makes it one of the best-selling game franchises of all time.</p>
<p>Content represented $4.23 billion of that sum, which is a 12% rise compared to October 2023. Hardware sales were down by 23%, making it a sum of $249 million.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched and immediately hit number one in the October charts, becoming the third best-selling game of 2024 to date. Subscription spending also increased, which can also be attributed to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as this was the first game in the franchise to be a day-one release on Game Pass. In the report, Circana stated that non-mobile subscriptions grew by 16% compared to last year, making it evident that Black Ops 6 played a massive part in this. <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/">Xbox further verified this information</a>, as they announced that the title was breaking records for Game Pass subscriptions at the end of October.</p>
<p>The report also goes on to mention that console content was the biggest contributor to the rise in content spending, providing a 27% increase compared to the same period last year, with the rise being driven by digital full-game sales. Again, Black Ops 6 is to thank for this. Confirmed by Circana's Mat Piscatella, it's been confirmed that PlayStation platforms accounted for 82% of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 total console full game dollar sales during October.</p>
<p>"Over its first two weeks in market, full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 were 23% higher than the full game dollar sales of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 over its first two weeks in a market a year ago," says Piscatella. Overall, this information isn't too much of a surprise, as Modern Warfare 3 wasn't as well received as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has been.</p>
<p>Along with the new Call of Duty, games like Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Silent Hill 2, and Metaphor: ReFantazio were amongst the top-selling games from October 6 to November 2.</p>
