            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Final have a long and storied history in the audio sector. Established in 1974, the Japanese company soon became well-known for their detailed audio, with products from record player cartridges through to speakers and amps. In the present day, Final have retained that penchant for detail, turning their focus to consumer headsets and earbuds. The Final VR3000 Wireless is the latest of those products, a true wireless</p>
<p>The Final VR3000 Wireless is a pair of gaming-focused Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless-equipped earbuds, with our review unit arriving in an understated black. In the pack you get the earbuds, a dinky USB-C low-latency wireless dongle, a curved charging case, a charging cable, and a selection of eartips so you can find the best fit.</p>
<p>The case is relatively small – about the same width as an Airpod Pro case, but thicker thanks to the wider earbuds inside. It’s pleasantly smooth, but it’s definitely lighter and more plasticky feeling than some of those you’ll experience with more premium earbuds. In terms of controls, there’s a single pairing button on the front, and four LEDs to show charging state and connection to the earbuds, while charging comes via the USB-C port at the bottom.</p>



<p>The earbuds boast a very good 11 hours of charge, with the case extending that by 38 hours, and they can both go&nbsp;from empty to full in two hours. The VR3000 Wireless have been great for a few recent trips, lasting through all of my Switch 2 gaming while on the go, and the few times I’ve had to charge they’ve topped up super-fast. They’re definitely easy to live with.</p>

<p>The low-latency USB-C transmitter is nice and small, so whether you’re using the top or bottom USB-C sockets on Switch 2 – or any other device, including mobile – it’s small enough to stay out of the way, and doesn’t look too odd or out of place. My one fear is that there’s no place for this in the charging case, and it feels as though it’s something that I’m going to lose sooner or later, or a feature that’s best kept at home.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves take some design cues from Apple’s Airpods, with a short arm extending down from the body of the earbud, though the touch controls are on the main surface of the earbud instead of the stem. They have a larger central body though, and that undoubtedly helps the VR3000’s bass response. It doesn’t make them the slimmest or sleekest buds though, and I found they stick out just that little more than some earbuds out there. They’re made from relatively light black plastic though, and the low weight means that they don’t start to wear on you through longer listening or gaming sessions.</p>

<p>The Final VR3000 wireless sound excellent, especially for gaming. The use of the USB-C 2.4Ghz transmitter certainly improves the audio quality, but there isn’t a gulf of difference between wireless and Bluetooth that you might find elsewhere. The bass response is powerful and enveloping, making it ideal for high-action titles like Cyberpunk 2077, while it dispenses more thoughtful soundtracks like those found in Tales of Shire or Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar with careful nuance.</p>
<p>There is a little more mid in the mix than I’d often look for, particularly when listening to music, but it helps to lift vocals and dialogue from the other instrumentation or audio details. I did find that music listening benefited from some EQ tweaking, but Bad Omen’s Concrete Jungle sounded excellent, with powerful guitars grinding away while the soaring vocals showcase the separation that the VR3000 are capable of.</p>
<p>The VR3000 Wireless have clearly been tuned for gaming and content though. I’ve been consistently surprised by just how good they sound, and their form factor has made them an ideal choice for handheld and mobile gaming. I’ve been playing a lot of Wild Hearts S, and the monster-hunting action sounded brilliant with the VR3000, especially the Eastern-influenced orchestral soundtrack.</p>

<p>That’s helped by the hybrid ANC. The noise cancellation is clearly a step below what you’ll find in Apple’s AirPods Pro or Sony’s XM5 earbuds, but it does a decent job of erasing sounds like fan noise from your PC, Steam Deck or Switch 2, or cutting down on &nbsp;low-level train and plane background sound. The lighter effect does mean that no discernible pressure or audio alteration is happening, and if you’re playing competitively, that’s going to help you stay focused and on point. At this price point, it’s a welcome inclusion, even if it isn’t the strongest version I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>Final have their own Android and iOS app as well, though it is distinctly bare bones. It does, however, let you adjust the EQ settings, with a batch of presets, and there’s the option to customise the sound setup as well, which is essential. Besides that, you can turn the ANC on and off, or set it to Ambient, and update the earbuds’ firmware. It is all very clear and easy to operate, but it would have been nice to delve into the earbuds’ setup a little further.</p>
<p>At £129.99, the Final VR3000 sit in the mid-range price point for earbuds. If you’re gaming, the USB-C dongle offers a clear advantage over Bluetooth-only options, both in terms of latency and reliable connection. If you have a Switch 2 or a Steam Deck, that recommendation is even higher as the dongle pops into the top USB-C port. If you’re planning on listening to a lot of music though, the Hecate GX05 are the better option, offering Hi-Res audio, and a place to store the USB-C dongle, though the huge, heavy, screen-scratching metal case will be a distinctly bigger statement than the VR3000’s understated option. If you find you have more money in your pocket, there’s also the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds which have a lot of the same features, but improve on some of the VR3000’s core features such as ANC, while including having a space in the case for the dongle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1955159081259258112">has announced</a> that it’s bringing <em>Fortnite</em> back to iOS in Australia, after the country’s federal court ruled that Apple and Google’s app marketplaces are anticompetitive. Epic CEO <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1955163422502408272">Tim Sweeney said on X</a> that <em>Fortnite</em> will be made available on iPhones via the Epic Games Store “at a date to be determined,” while the company navigates the complexities of Australia’s antitrust ruling.</p><p>Epic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323100/epic-google-australia-legal-claim-fortnite-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit">sued Google in Australia</a> in March 2021, after suing Apple in November 2020. A single court is handling both cases in parallel, even though they weren’t filed at the same time.</p><p>On Tuesday, federal judge Jonathan Beach found that Apple and Google misused their app marketplace dominance and in-app purchase commission fees of up to 30 percent to reduce competition, the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/federal-court-finds-apple-google-anticompetitive-in-fortnite-app-fight-20250811-p5mm2f"><em>Australian Financial Review</em></a> reports. However, Beach rejected Epic’s claims that the tech giants had broken consumer law or engaged in “unconscionable conduct” — meaning particularly harsh, unfair, or oppressive behavior that goes against societal norms. We are still awaiting further details from Beach’s final judgment, which is more than 2,000 pages long and won’t be released publicly.</p><p>“We welcome the court’s rejection of Epic’s demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic’s attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on,” Google spokesperson Dan Jackson said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>“However, we disagree with the court’s characterization of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships, which were all shaped in a fiercely competitive mobile landscape on behalf of users and developers,” Jackson said. “We will review the full decision when we receive it and assess our next steps.”</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-12/epic-games-fortnite-v-apple-google-federal-court-case/105641794">Australia’s <em>ABC News</em></a>, an unnamed Apple spokesperson said that the company welcomes the court’s rejection of some of Epic’s claims, but that it disagrees with other aspects of the ruling. “Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate,” the spokesperson said. “We continuously invest and innovate to make the App Store the safest place for users to get apps and a great business opportunity for developers in Australia and around the world.”</p><p>Epic originally sued Apple and Google in the United States on August 13th, 2020, in two separate cases which went before two separate judges, with dramatically different results in each case. Epic largely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling">lost its fight against Apple</a> after attempting to take the fight all the way to the US Supreme Court, but Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">may lose a large degree of control over its App Store anyhow</a> because it failed to comply with the district court’s order.</p><div><p>After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments">removing <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store</a> in 2020 amid its feud with Epic, Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">brought the game back</a> to its iPhone app marketplace in May. <em>Fortnite</em> also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">returned to iPhones in the EU last year</a>, but only via the Epic Games Store for iOS.</p></div><p>Meanwhile in the US version of the Google trial, Epic has continually won: in late 2023, a jury unanimously decided that Google turned its Play Store and Play Billing system into an illegal monopoly, and a panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716856/epic-v-google-win-in-appeals-court">just affirmed that decision at the end of July</a>.</p><p>That decision could blow up Google’s control over its app store <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717440/google-epic-open-play-store-emergency-stay">within weeks or months</a>, unless Google gets the Ninth Circuit to grant a stay while it appeals to the US Supreme Court or grants a full en banc review of the three-judge panel’s decision. Google is arguing that the Apple decision should be relevant to the Google decision, but so far US courts disagree.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/757885/epic-apple-google-australia-judgment]]></content:encoded>

Humanity might be on the ropes, but in the towering stronghold of The Belfry they have created a beacon of salvation that casts rays of hope across a ruined land.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of optimism in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds is seared into the gameplay itself, with Stoic asking players to lean on their companions and fight for a brighter future by working together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grammy-nominated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> composer Austin Wintory, who previously worked with Stoic to piece together the score for The Banner Saga, sought to mirror that sense of optimism and joyousness in the game's soundscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking about his process to Game Developer earlier this year, Wintory explained he strove to craft a score that refused to veer into nihilism or cynicism. Yes, there is darkness—but never without light. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> creative director Ernie Jorgensen told Wintory he wanted the title to reflect the sort of emotional qualities you often find in Pixar or Disney movies. The veteran composer did his best to oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That [request] felt really novel because lots of games are all too excited to lean into the gritty side of things, not least of which our previous collaboration, The Banner Saga trilogy! Those games were super heavy, and so I think part of it was also just a reaction to that," explained Wintory.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/digging-into-sag-aftra-s-stellar-win-with-sarah-elmaleh-game-developer-podcast-ep-51" target="_self" data-discover="true">Digging into SAG-AFTRA’s Stellar Win With Sarah Elmaleh - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 51</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"How that manifested musically was a few different things but above all, the music is very very melodic. Big, old fashioned, almost 19th century-style Romantic melodies in a great big orchestral palette. In a world where so many games (including many of my own!) put tons of emphasis on mood and texture, leaning so hard into a bygone tradition gave it that optimistic quality. I think part of why that works, and maybe I'm simply being sentimental here, is that those traditions are really powerful and special, and it felt like we were doing our part to ensure their preservation."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Wintory, preservation is itself an act of hope. "To say 'these things that were plentiful before actually mattered, and are worth saving,' that feels like an intrinsically optimistic thing to do," he added. "That's my own projection at least."&nbsp;</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBPHKPDIscw?si=b3bWIWbnXkcxwExm" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, Wintory admitted he initially felt as if he was "betraying" his own creative process by leaning on old fashioned techniques instead of taking wild swings. He said he strives to be as "radical as possible" within the parameters of each project, but this time around had to coax out his nostalgic side.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-members-ratify-new-interactive-media-contract-conclude-year-long-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA members ratify new interactive media contract</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of that process, he sought to ensure individual musicians received their time in the limelight. Highlighting musicianship has always been a fundamental part of his approach, but it became even more central with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For example, the cello performances of Tina Guo in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Journey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were extremely significant to me. I wanted to make sure players don't just hear a 'cello' in some abstract way, but that they feel and hear her. Her choices, her subjective touches. Every project I've worked on except for the very, very tiny number of ones that were truly 100 percent electronic (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>flOw</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, my first ever game), this has been important. But with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Towerborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there aren't really any tricks beyond that. It's the entire focus," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On top of that, our interactive combat system is built around an idea of really feeling the orchestra up-shift and down-shift in energy. Without feeling those changes in the actual performances themselves, and the way they made the air vibrate, the whole thing wouldn't come off. I wanted to make sure you could feel this amazing 70-piece orchestra pivot from playing very loud to very soft. The actual decibels on the recording are nearly the same, but the emotional impacts are so distinct from each other."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/sag-aftra-urges-more-non-struck-game-studios-to-sign-interim-agreement" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA urges more non-struck game studios to sign interim agreement</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those performances were captured in Wintory's backyard of Los Angeles at the legendary Warner Bros scoring stage. The seasoned maestro said it's one of only a handful of video game projects to have been recorded in the city in the past 15 years—joining the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in that very exclusive club. It has been 12 years since Wintory himself recorded there and it was a homecoming that felt long overdue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I was about 14 years old I saw a documentary about the composer Jerry Goldsmith, my all-time favorite, and in it we see a lot of footage of him conducting the recordings from the 1994 thriller </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The River Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And something I always loved was that he wouldn't say "French Horns, at bar 20 can you be louder?" He would say "Jim, a bit louder at bar 20." Or "Mike, let's try something else at the end here," talking to pianist Mike Lang," he explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The orchestra were his peers, even his friends. Almost like being in a band. And that was a huge motivation for me wanting to pursue music and composing, and also to live specifically in LA. A town where seemingly everyone is creative and you constantly go into a studio together to make art. What a dream!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Sadly, it's proven to not be the case in terms of recording games. I've been lucky to do a handful of movies and other things here over the years, but 99 percent of my game recording has been in cities like London, Nashville, Vienna and Skopje (Macedonia). And don't get me wrong, I've traveled to all those cities and built some amazing friendships and wonderful memories. But being the sentimental type that I am, it's never quite the same as recording in your home, with sort of 'chosen family.' These musicians here are so much a part of my social life, but so rarely my professional one. So it was a massively cathartic and wonderful experience to finally rectify that."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>In layman's terms, both Valorant and Battlefield 6 need to run in a particular way while they are running on your computer. When it comes to interacting with game memory, they do the same thing. Detecting another program is messing around at the kernel level and touching things they are monitoring, the anti-cheats identify each other as potential problems and thus issues arise.</p>

<p>The conversation around Javalin and Vanguard causing problems together stems from several posts during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">last weekend's Battlefield 6 open beta</a>, in which some users were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mlwcbl/battlefield_6_just_told_me_to_uninstall_valorant/">reporting error messages</a> stopping them from playing the absurdly popular shooter while Valorant was running. So while you don't need to uninstall Valorant to play Battlefield 6 this weekend for its second open beta, you should probably make sure the game is totally closed before you do so.</p>
<p>Still it's easy to see why deep-access kernel level anti-cheats are used in games like Battlefield 6. According to EA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">Javelin caught over 330,000 attempted cheaters over its first weekend</a>. All this during what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">EA has dubbed Battlefield's biggest open beta ever</a>.</p>
<p>So for now it seems like an easy fix for those looking to get some Battlefield 6 games in. It does seem unlikely the way either Javelin or Vanguard work will be changing, due to the low number of players looking to run two shooters simultaneously. Still, as kernel-level anti-cheats become the norm these conflicts between opposing systems is something to keep an eye on.</p></div>

            <p>Remedy is "unsatisfied" with the sales of its live-service shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, as the game underperformed on Steam.</p>
<p>As part of the company's half year financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">report</a>, CEO Tero Virtala stated Remedy's revenue increased by 63.5 percent, with game sales increasing due to the release of FBC: Firebreak.</p>
<p>The launch succeeded technically and had over a million players in its first 10 days. However, the majority of players were on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, where the game was available day one on subscription services. On Steam - intended as the primary sales channel on PC - the launch "underperformed".</p>

<p>"The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews," admitted Virtala. "As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive."</p>
<p>Virtala continued: "Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognised throughout the contract period."</p>
<p>The performance of FBC: Firebreak is important to Remedy as its first self-published game, a spin-off of its popular single-player game Control.</p>
<p>Shortly after the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now">Remedy stated it heard fan feedback "loud and clearly"</a> and was committed to improving the game. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-team-acknowledges-onboarding-frustrations-assuring-things-will-change">Remedy acknowledged onboarding frustrations </a>and noted patches released for a better experience.</p>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," said Virtala in the report. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive - showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining."</p>
<p>A major update is planned for September, which Remedy expects will drive further interest in the game. "We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," said Virtala.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> development is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", focusing now on gameplay, environments, and missions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remake project is also in full production.</p>
<p>Lifetime sales of Control have now surpassed 5m copies. Earlier this year, the publishing, distribution and marketing rights for the game transferred to Remedy, resulting in positive sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, meanwhile, has "continued to sell steadily and accrue royalties", though no sales figure has been provided. The horror game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-fastest-selling-remedy-game-but-yet-to-turn-a-profit">Remedy's fastest-selling game</a>, but only became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">profitable a year after release once sales passed 2m</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Finnish developer Remedy Games <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the half-year financial report, admitting that FBC: Firebreak did not perform well. We already knew that, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-has-surpassed-1-million-players-though-remedy-knows-theres-a-lot-of-work-to-do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of one million players</a> was highly misleading since the game was available on both Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus to the respective subscribers.</p>



<p>Indeed, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said that the majority of the players were on those two platforms, whereas the Steam launch 'underperformed' compared to the studio's hopes:</p>



<p><em>The game's initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.</em></p>



<p><em>Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak. Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.</em></p>



<p>With that being said, it was not all doom-and-gloom from the Remedy executive, who noted that FBC: Firebreak was always meant to be a live, evolving game. The studio now thinks it has a solid foundation to expand on, with the next major update scheduled to go live in late September.</p>



<p>On the bright side, Control's lifetime sales have now surpassed five million units. Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regained full control of its publishing, distribution, and marketing rights in February 2024</a>, so the sales now go only to the Finnish developer. Alan Wake 2 continues to sell 'steadily' and accrue royalties, according to Virtala, who then switched to an update on the studio's upcoming projects.</p>



<p>Control 2 (which is being made <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a smaller budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) is on track to meet its next milestones, which will be focused on gameplay, environments, and missions. The studio wants the game to have a strong commercial offering when it launches. The Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake also made steady progress; during the last quarter, Remedy built on the momentum established earlier in 2025 while collaborating closely with IP owner Rockstar Games. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sarah-bond-brings-xbox-expertise-to-tyson-foods-by-joining-board-of-directors.1267695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox since 2023, has revealed a new appointment on the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods. The curveball placement was uncovered in a press release from Tyson Foods, a company with Arkansas origins dating back to 1931. Under the Tyson banner sit the likes of Bosco’s, State Fair, Jimmy Dean, and Reuben.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean that Sarah Bond is relocating from under a tech titan to work at a food-focused conglomerate. She has joined the board as an independent director, which is a similar position she already holds at other corporations and companies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dynamic-and-passionate">Dynamic and Passionate</h2>



<p><br>In <a href="https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/news-releases/2025/8/tyson-foods-names-microsoft-executive-board-directors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> celebrating the appointment of Sarah Bond to the Board of Directors at Tyson Foods, the firm wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Sarah is dynamic and passionate, with proven management strength, and her energy and personality are a wonderful fit for our culture. As our management team, members of the board and the Tyson family got to know Sarah, we immediately felt that she would be a tremendous addition to Tyson Foods.</p>



<p>We are confident that her unique expertise will help us continue to grow and serve our customers, our team members, and our shareholders.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a short response, Bond said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Tyson Foods is a world-class food company with iconic brands, and I am delighted to join the board and support the company as it continues to execute its long-term growth strategy with customers and consumers.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Taking a glance at Bond’s LinkedIn profile, you can see that she’s also on the board of the USC School of Cinematic Arts and the Entertainment Software Association. In a report from <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/08/xbox-president-delighted-to-join-board-of-directors-at-tyson-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PureXbox</a>, it was also noted that Bond is on the board of Zuora, a subscription management platform.</p>



<p>When I looked up Tyson Foods, I found that the company provides extensive volumes of meat and ingredients to fast food chains like KFC, Taco Bell, McDonald’s, and Burger King, and that the titan boasts more than 120 food processing plants. That’s one hell of a global reach.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mrbeast-joins-kick-to-promote-teamwater-with-adin-ross-and-xqc.1267689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MrBeast has officially joined Kick.com to further promote his TeamWater campaign, just weeks after receiving a one-of-a-kind trophy from YouTube for landing 400 million subscribers. The TeamWater campaign has just ticked over $15 million raised after a trio comprised of MrBeast, Adin Ross, and xQc fronted the mission.</p>



<p>The goal is to raise $40 million by the end of the month to support the provision of clean water to countries around the world. It’s a classic MrBeast move, and it has attracted the support of more than 3,000 influencers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-kick-mrbeast">Welcome to Kick, MrBeast</h2>



<p>MrBeast’s arrival on Kick was celebrated by the platform in <a href="https://x.com/KickStreaming/status/1955021765878616107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a social media post</a> akin to the ones published to welcome <strong>partnered creators</strong>. In the hours that followed, MrBeast racked up thousands of followers on the third most-popular streaming platform in the business, further extending his reach and leaning on Adin Ross and xQc’s audiences.</p>



<p>It has been reported that ‘the deal’ to secure MrBeast’s affiliation included a $5 million donation towards the TeamWater campaign.</p>



<p>If there’s one negative sentiment to take away from this reveal, it’s that MrBeast has aligned himself with some less-than-favored creators who have worked hard drumming up awful auras for themselves in recent years.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If successful, the TeamWater campaign will provide clean water to a range of countries around the world, including those located in Africa and South America.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-black-ops-7-teasers-promote-the-guild/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-black-ops-7-teasers-are-appearing-to-promote-%E2%80%98the-guild%E2%80%99.1267671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, eagle-eyed Call of Duty fans have been finding and sharing teasers promoting ‘The Guild’, a fictional tech titan operating (assumedly) at the heart of Black Ops 7. The global reveal of Black Ops 7 is set to take place next week at the Opening Night Live ceremony at Gamescom.</p>



<p>The teasers, which include a trailer, a new Activision-backed website, and billboards in San Francisco, have fans theorizing about Black Ops 7.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-won-t-fear-tomorrow">‘We Won’t Fear Tomorrow’</h2>



<p>In social circles, a new website built by Activision is being shared. It promotes a fictional company called The Guild, an organization charged with shaping the future and using technology as the mold:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At The Guild, our mission is to harness the power of technology to protect and uplift lives around the world. We unite exceptional minds to build a future where security and peace of mind are a universal right.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://theguild.io/?ref=gamingtrend.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The website</a> is packed with robotic iconography, showcasing ‘Guild robots’ in a series of situations, such as saving children from fires, providing aid to refugees, and rebuilding shattered settlements.</p>



<p>CharlieIntel captured and shared the teaser video hosted on the site:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to comment on the video and the teaser, suggesting it’s not at all what they were hoping for from Black Ops 7. One wrote that it’s ‘Black Ops Advanced Warfare with SBMM and futuristic garbage’, while another said, ‘Why even try with this BS?’</p>



<p>Plenty of netizens were keen to point out that Battlefield 6 is dominating this year. It’s accurate, given that the Battlefield 6 beta decimated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/">Call of Duty’s player records</a> on Steam and hit almost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/">one million concurrent viewers</a> on Twitch. This could be the first year that Battlefield ‘beats’ Call of Duty, even if EA’s developers don’t feel they need to.</p>



<p>What do you think about the imminent reveal of Black Ops 7? Are you hopeful that it’ll be a banger year for Call of Duty? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-legal-notice-banned-predator-hunter-freeschlep/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-issues-legal-notice-to-banned-%E2%80%98predator-hunter%E2%80%99-in-freeschlep-drama.1267665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Roblox Corporation has banned a prolific ‘predator hunter’ from the platform and issued to them a cease and desist order penned by the company’s lawyers, it has been revealed. In recent days, ‘Schlep’, a YouTuber with over 640,000 followers, has revealed a battle with Roblox that stems from his predator-hunting activities on the platform.</p>



<p>Schlep claims he has directly influenced the arrest of six predators using the Roblox ecosystem for nefarious activities, and historically, he has joined forces with other creators to trap and catch wrongdoers.</p>



<p>He’s now being pursued by the Roblox Corporation, which is eager to clamp down on his work, but the ‘FreeSchlep’ campaign is fighting back.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-sleep-well-at-night">‘I Sleep Well at Night’</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Schlep expressed his sentiments towards the ban issued to him by Roblox, before following up with a copy of the cease and desist order sent by the company:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how it gets painted, me and my team got 6 predators arrested within the Roblox community in under a year. </p>



<p><strong>I sleep well at night</strong> knowing these people will not be able to abuse anymore children on Roblox. My work will always have amounted to something.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The cease and desist order from Roblox accused Schlep of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Engaging in simulated child endangerment conversations</li>



<li>Sharing or soliciting personally identifiable information (PII)</li>



<li>Directing users to move conversations off-platform</li>
</ul>



<p>The claim is that Schlep and ‘his team’ are directly undermining Roblox’s safety efforts and exposing users to <strong>more risks</strong>. </p>



<div><article><p><span>Full legal cease and desist notice from Roblox to me.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Schlep uploaded a video talking about the FreeSchlep situation that garnered more than 1.3 million views in less than 48 hours:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Roblox Is Threatening to Sue Me For Protecting Kids" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMqAw_NjHK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The ban and legal action have prompted a social media campaign fronted by the hashtag #FreeSchlep. The creator and predator hunter has been supported by other YouTubers like JiDion, who created a 15-minute video explaining the situation and revealed that he too is being pursued by Roblox.</p>



<p>Roblox has had a clear and well-documented issue with predators and child safety for years. It’s a critical concern that has been addressed publicly by many activists and protestors fighting against the inherently unsafe platform. It’s not easy to keep children safe on Roblox, despite the lengths the company has gone to in a bid to protect them.</p>



<p>Recently, in a bizarre twist, it was suggested that Roblox might soon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-dating-someday-for-those-afraid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">host a <strong>dating platform</strong></a> that users can lean on to find love in Roblox rather than meeting people in real life.</p>



<p>Do you think Roblox has a huge issue with predators, and this kind of legal action isn’t a good look for the corporation? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It has rubberized grips with a leather-like texture, which makes the controller feel slightly different than other Xbox Wireless Controllers with textured grips. On each side of the Xbox Guide button, you'll find two 3D "spikes" to mimic Doomguy's helmet. Since Doomguy is always slaying demons, the controller has streaks of blood and "chips" in the paint.</p><p>The Doom Slayer armor theme extends to the controls as well. The left stick is gray, while the right is red to align with Doomguy's chest port. Instead of ABXY labels, each face button is marked by a letter from the Sentinel alphabet. The triggers and bumpers are green on the left and silver on the right.</p><p>Inside the box, you'll find a voucher to redeem the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin in The Dark Ages. When you get the controller, remove the battery cover for a neat Easter Egg.</p><p>Like all Xbox Wireless Controllers from Microsoft, the Doom-themed model works wirelessly on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and mobile.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4548522"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages Xbox Wireless Controller (Limited Edition)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4548522-doomthedarkagescontroller.png"></figure><p>Along with Doom: The Dark Ages, fans can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DOOM-Anthology-Steam-PC-Other-System/dp/B0DCHS3FJB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">save on Doom Anthology</a>, which compiles six Doom games in one package with a steelbook case and a miniature BFG for display.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart/1100-6533821/">Mario Nintendo Switch Games Hit All-Time Low Prices At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dark-ages-limited-edition-xbox-wireless-controller-gets-massive-discount/1100-6533850/">Doom Limited Edition Xbox Controller Gets Massive Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-0-directors-cut-for-switch-2-is-discounted-for-the-first-time/1100-6531083/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut For Switch 2 Is Discounted For The First Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>"Get ready for a whole new ball game"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last weekend, Nintendo held a special 'Global Jam' for the Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>This game is described as "the next generation" of 3-on-3 sports, where you use the mouse controls to speed around the court, and flick your wrists to perform tricks and shoot some hoops. To top it off, you can join in on the fun with up to 12 players online.</p>
<p>So, now that the Global Jam has ended, and we've even had the chance to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-shoot-some-hoops-with-drag-x-drives-dev-team-this-weekend">take on the game's developers</a> during the same event, we're wondering about your first impressions and if you're planning to add it to your game library on release.</p>
<p>Leave a comment and vote in our poll. You can also see the skills of the developers in the video above.</p>

<p>Drag x Drive will launch on the eShop for the Switch 2 on <strong>14th August, 2025</strong> and is priced at <strong>$19.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>

<p>If you can’t decide which one of the 32 NFL teams to use in your first Madden 26 Franchise mode save, this list should help narrow down your top choices. </p>



<p>EA gave overhauled Franchise mode in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. The first step in creating a coach is selecting your archetype, and the choices are offensive guru, defensive genius, or developmental wizard. Your preference will dictate the abilities you start with, which is a new feature for this title. </p>



<p>From there, it’s up to you to build a staff of coordinators, develop weekly strategies, playsheets, and mold your roster as you see fit. On-field performances and how well you manage relationships with the GM, coaching staff, players, fans, and media contribute to your approval rating. At the end of every season, coaches are judged by their approval rating, so it’s essential to pay attention to every detail. For those who are up for a challenge, here are the best teams to rebuild. </p>

<h3 id="h-cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</h3>



<p>The Cleveland Browns roster is full of intriguing question marks. Starting quarterback Deshaun Watson is expected to miss most, if not all, of the upcoming season because he re-ruptured his Achilles tendon. There are also doubts about his future, even when he returns. </p>



<p>Cleveland’s front office is fully aware of that and responded in the draft by selecting Oregon quarterback Dillion Gabriel in the third round, and Colorado quarterback in the fifth round. Both players are intriguing prospects, and there is a possibility that one of them will finally end the agonizing drought of not having a franchise QB. </p>



<p>There is one sure thing about the Browns, and that’s Myles Garrett. The superstar edge rusher signed a four-year $160 million extension in the offseason, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Standout outside linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah also signed a three-year contract in the offseason, and Denzel Ward is one of the best cornerbacks in the league, so the building blocks are there for a successful rebuild. </p>



<h3 id="h-carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers </h3>



<p>It’s been seven years since the Carolina Panthers last made the playoffs, but things are looking up in Charlotte. At one point, it looked like Bryce Young would never live up to being the first overall pick in the 2023 draft after being benched. However, Young retook the starting spot and showed glimpses of becoming a formidable QB. </p>



<p>Carolina put faith in its rising star by drafting an exciting wide receiver, Tetairoa McMillan, and also revamped the offensive line last offseason. On the other side of the ball, Derrick Brown is back after missing the entire previous season. He is poised to be once again one of the best defensive linemen in the league, and Jaycee Horn has proven to be a lockdown cornerback when healthy. The Panthers still have several holes to fill, but the potential is there. </p>



<h3 id="h-atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons </h3>



<p>Speaking of seven-year playoff droughts, Carolina’s NFC South rival, Atlanta, also has the same playoff drought. The days of Matt Ryan leading Atlanta on long postseason runs are far in the rear-view mirror, and fans have turned to a new face of the team in Michael Penix Jr. The league was collectively shocked when Atlanta drafted the Washington quarterback eighth overall after giving Kirk Cousins a massive contract in the same offseason, but the gamble paid off. </p>



<p>Cousins had a terrible start to the season, and Atlanta handed the keys to Penix Jr. It’s still very much a development project, but he showed flashes of being the guy. However, even if he doesn’t pan out, the Falcons are loaded elsewhere on the roster. Jessie Bates III is the best safety in football, Chris Lindstrom is a stalwart offensive lineman, Bijan Robinson is a star running back, and Drak London is one of the most electrifying receivers currently playing.  </p>



<h3 id="h-tennessee-titans">Tennessee Titans </h3>



<p>After potentially striking out on Will Levis, Tennessee shifted gears and drafted Miami quarterback Cam Ward first overall in the 2025 draft. EA only gave Ward a 72 overall and a Star development trait, but there is still a strong chance that the Titans have a franchise quarterback on their hands. The rest of the roster is relatively weak, but Jeffery Simmons has game-wrecking capabilities at defensive tackle, and Kevin Zeitler is a reliable guard.  </p>



<p>With that in mind, rebuilding the Titans will be much more challenging than other teams on this list, who have several exciting prospects and established veterans, but that’s what makes the challenge so exciting. From top to bottom, the organization needs a new identity and a new face of the team, and it’s up to you to solve that puzzle. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-york-jets">New York Jets </h3>



<p>While Panthers and Falcons fans have it bad, the Jets haven’t reached the postseason in 14 seasons, which is tied for the longest drought among all professional sports in the United States. It finally looked like the corner had been turned after signing Aaron Rodgers, but that experiment failed, despite having a talented roster on paper. </p>



<p>In the aftermath of Rodgers’s departure for Pittsburgh, the Jets made a low-risk, high-reward gamble by signing former 11th overall pick Justin Fields at quarterback. Meanwhile, star cornerback Sauce Gardner and standout wide receiver Garrett Wilson both signed four-year contract extensions in the offseason. The Jets also have plenty of other talent to fill out the rest of the roster, including the consistently dominant defensive tackle Quinnen Williams. The talent is there, but if history has shown anything, it’s going to take more than that to right the ship in New York.   </p>



<h3 id="h-new-york-giants">New York Giants</h3>



<p>Staying in the same stadium, the Giants also have a daunting rebuild ahead without a sure-fire guy at quarterback. New York gave Daniel Jones six seasons, but he never proved enough. With two first-round picks in the 2025 draft, the Giants added to an already dominant defensive line by selecting star edge rusher Abdul Carter third overall and selecting Ole Miss quarterback Jaxon Dart, with the 25th overall pick. </p>



<p>Offensive lines will have their hands full this season attempting to contain the front seven unit, comprised of the likes of Dexter Lawrence II, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeaux, and the previously mentioned Carter. That’s not all on defense, as Bobby Okerke, Jevon Holland, and Paulson Adebo are also exciting players on that side of the ball. And wide receiver phenom, Malik Nabers, should help make life easier for the rookie QB Jaxon Dart. As long as you play your cards right and make smart draft picks and savvy free agency signings, this rebuild shouldn’t be too challenging. </p>



<h3 id="h-las-vegas-raiders">Las Vegas Raiders </h3>



<p>The AFC West is arguably the most challenging division to find success in because the Kansas City Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid at the helm, Jim Harbaugh and Justin Herbert are leading the charge with the Los Angeles Chargers, and Sean Payton and Bo Nix are building something special in Denver. All three teams have franchise coaches and quarterbacks, leaving Las Vegas in no man’s land. </p>



<p>Maxx Crosby, Brock Bowers, Kolton Miller, and potentially Ashon Jeanty are foundational pieces that can help turn things around, but the roster has a long way to go to stack up against the rest of the daunting division. It’s up to you to find a franchise quarterback and become a coach who can go toe-to-toe with legends of the game. </p>

<p>Before jumping into a game of Madden 26, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with the best players and the top ratings by position. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-madden-26-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a> and previous games, EA determines player ratings by evaluating 43 different attributes for each player, combining them with position-specific weightings, and updating them throughout the season based on real-world performance. There are dedicated employees tasked with analyzing film to make these subjective decisions. </p>



<p>In the 2023/24 season, several players had breakout seasons, while others suffered lackluster campaigns. Based on that data, here are the best offensive and defensive players in Madden 26. </p>

<p>Treasure Tracker also got a Switch 2 upgrade recently</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> has received its weekly update today and this time it adds the soundtrack from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/captain_toad_treasure_tracker">Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to listen to tracks like the game's title theme, The King of Pyropuff Peak and much more. All up, this album contains a total of <strong>58 tracks</strong> and has a runtime of 1 hour and 46 minutes.</p>
<p>To listen to this soundtrack on the Nintendo Music app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>

<p>This follows an update to the app last week which added the soundtracks for the Pilotwings series. The app was also recently updated to Version 1.3.0 – adding the ability to use some functions of the app, even without an active Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was originally released on the Wii U, and was followed up with a 3DS and Switch release. It was also one of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free game upgrades</a> released alongside the Switch 2 recently, optimising the game visuals, and adding HDR and GameShare support.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-bloody-love-the-drifter.1267623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Drifter</em> is a new point-and-click adventure game from Powerhoof that I have been <em>very </em>into these past couple of weeks. It’s a game that owes a debt to many influences, all of which end up being a perfect match for this story, genre and, most importantly of all (for me), setting.</p><p>First and most obviously it owes a <em>lot </em>to the Lucasarts adventure games of the 90s, a subgenre that has inspired countless successors and imitators over the decades, but few--if any--that have felt as close to the source as this. Playing <em>The Drifter</em> is like visiting a parallel timeline where Lucasarts never went 3D after <em>Full Throttle</em>, and instead simply iterated on their existing art style over and over and at some point came up with, somehow, an even smarter interface.</p><p>But this is not a breezy adventure with a slapstick pirate and a load of double entendres, nor is it a game content to simply trace over the lines of a 30-year-old genre. <em>The Drifter's</em> own promos say the game draws heavily from "King, Crichton and Carpenter, with a dash of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozploitation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 70s Ozpolitation</a>", and those are all correct. <em>The Drifter </em>has a <em>mood</em>, nailing its self-proclaimed "pulp adventure thriller brief" absolutely, the whole thing dripping with atmospheric lighting and intrigue, a sci-fi noir vibe brought to life by some incredibly <em>cool </em>pixel art and voice acting. </p><p>It also calls itself a fast-paced adventure game, a sentence that makes no sense until you play it, then it makes perfect sense. While in some ways this is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, it's not the type to keep you stuck on a puzzle for 10 hours; between its snappy interface, in-game hints, action sequences (I can't explain these without spoiling a central story element, but just trust me, they work) and relentless pacing, it really does keep moving at a brisk rate, which doesn't just remove a long-standing roadblock with this genre but also helps keep the story zipping along.</p><p>Were this all I wanted to talk about--me taking time out of your day just to say "this is the best Lucasarts homage I've ever played"--I think <em>The Drifter</em> would be worth talking about! Its story of grief, love, murder and monsters plays like you're clicking rapidly through a pulpy graphic novel, and nailing that Lucasarts energy is hard! Those games were magic, making this magic by association!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Drifter - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CgNrA925M44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But what really got me about <em>The Drifter</em> was how <em>Australian </em>it is. Let me explain:<a href="https://aftermath.site/australian-video-game-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Australia has enjoyed an indie renaissance over the past decade, a recovery from the dark days of the late 00s/early 2010s when a AAApocalypse closed all of the country's major studios</a>. From <em>Hollow Knight</em> to <em>Crossy Road</em>, <em>Goose Game</em> to <em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, <em>Plucky Squire</em> to <em>Unpacking</em>, many of the best and most important games of the last few years have been developed in Australia.</p><p>And almost none of them have anything to say about living here, or being from here, or just <em>here</em>. That's fine, nobody is obligated to make their game about anything, you can set it whenever and wherever you want. But when you live outside the US, Japan or Europe as a player, you're almost always playing games about other people's homes and other people's stories, and sometimes, just sometimes, I wish there were more video games set a little closer to home.</p><p>Of course the problem here is that even when a game <em>is </em>set here, depictions of Australia in popular culture tend to skew towards a spectrum of caricatures:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_(2015_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Mad Max</em></a> on one end, <em>Crocodile Dundee</em> on the other. Which is fine, but also sometimes I just want to play video games where the characters are Australian and they use Australian slang and the game is set here, but that setting doesn’t really doesn't <em>matter</em>, in a way that I would find nice but you (statistically most people reading this are not Australian) could play it and not mind either, the same way I (an Australian) find <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>KRZ </em>interesting.</p><p>(<a href="https://youtu.be/Xt2Rj1FeZgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wayward Strand </em>is a good example of what I’m talking about!<em>)</em></a></p><p><em>The Drifter</em> is very much set here, and has some of the most Australian voice acting I've ever heard in a game, but it's also extremely relaxed about it. Like yeah, this is an Australian video game, but it's not interested in cringe or tropes, desert vistas or kangaroos, it just wants to tell a very cool story that just happens to be set here. This is exactly what I've been after in an Australian game for a while now, so I'm very thankful to have got the chance to play through it here.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tiny-bookshop-impressions"><h3>Recommending Books Is The Best Part Of Tiny Bookshop</h3></a><p>Forget The Lorax, kid; it's time for classic architecture</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia]]></content:encoded>

The announcement was accompanied by a teaser trailer that may give fans of The Witcher some Deja vu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHH6xQT2-dw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PHH6xQT2-dw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There's no English language audio option for this video, but the closed captioning does offer an English translation of the spoken lines. The woman's name is Myoan, and she's a shaman who performs a violent sacrificial rite with a snake. Woochi is the man who confronts Myoan at her dark shrine before she transforms into a monster before his eyes. Woochi isn't defenseless and the manifestation of his sword is impressive. However, Myoan overpowers Woochi before declaring, "Proclaim it to Heaven, we rise again."</p><p>The game is set durning Korea's Joseon era, and Jeon Woochi is said to be a man "who uses his powers to fight injustice and trick the corrupt." This is a single-player game built with Unreal Engine 5 by developer LoreVault Studio. The announcement notes the dev team is currently consulting experts on Korean literature and traditional music, while also scouting locations that will be used to recreate the period setting of the game. The game's music will be composed by Jung Jae-il, whose previous credits include Squid Game and Parasite.</p><p>Nexon Games hasn't set a release date yet for Woochi the Wayfarer, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

There are 40 playable characters with their own unique stats and a slew of unlockables to keep you playing.</p><p>If you already own Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 for Switch (or another console), the new features probably aren't worth the price of admission.

Like the other Sega games for Switch 2, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is a Game-Key Card, so you'll download the bulk of the game from the eShop when inserting the cartridge for the first time.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart/1100-6533821/">Mario Nintendo Switch Games Hit All-Time Low Prices At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-dark-ages-limited-edition-xbox-wireless-controller-gets-massive-discount/1100-6533850/">Doom Limited Edition Xbox Controller Gets Massive Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-0-directors-cut-for-switch-2-is-discounted-for-the-first-time/1100-6531083/">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut For Switch 2 Is Discounted For The First Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crkd-gibson-les-paul-wireless-guitar-controllers-consoles-and-pc-buying-guide/1100-6529788/">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers Are Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rebuild-of-evangelion-blu-ray-editions-neon-genesis-evangelion-complete-series/1100-6533665/">Two Rebuild Of Evangelion Movies Are Finally Returning To Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-star-wars-3-in-1-clone-wars-mandalorian-adventure-gift-set-walmart-2025/1100-6533571/">New Lego Star Wars Gift Bundle In Stock At Walmart - 3 Sets For $45</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-5-in-1-world-explorer-walmart-gift-set-2025/1100-6533572/">Lego Minecraft 5-In-1 Gift Set Up For Grabs For $45 Exclusively At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-deals-limited-edition-restock-guide/1100-6526172/">Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma For Switch 2 Gets First Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-20083">Warhammer 40: Dawn of War's</a> original opening cinematic has been remastered a second time in order to restore a "beloved" Space Marine scream that, to the dismay of fans, had been removed the first time around.</p><p dir="ltr">When developer Relic Entertainment first announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remaster-of-one-of-warhammer-40ks-best-games-is-just-a-month-away-with-discount-for-loyal-fans/1100-6533148/" data-ref-id="1100-6533148">August 14 release date for Dawn of War - Definitive Edition</a>--an updated version of the RTS classic that includes features like upscaled unit textures, lighting upgrades, and 4K resolution support--it did so by releasing a new, remastered version of the original's iconic opening cinematic. The CGI trailer shows the Space Marines of the Blood Ravens battling against an Orkish horde in a desperate last stand against all odds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HiUectTy9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2HiUectTy9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a well-loved cinematic, largely because at the time it was released in 2004, it was one of the first great looks at the Warhammer 40K universe in action. The remastered cinematic (the first time it was put out) was nearly identical to the original aside from the higher-definition visuals, except for one notable exception--the scream of a Space Marine charging into battle had been removed and replaced with voice over from a different character entirely, that of Blood Ravens Chapter Master Gabriel Angelos.</p><p dir="ltr">That didn't sit well with fans, who complained about the scream's absence and its lore-breaking replacement in the comments for the trailer on YouTube. Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-dev-says-replaced-space-marine-scream-was-even-more-beloved-than-we-realized-as-intro-cinematic-changes-spark-backlash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> amidst the outcry, Relic seemed to have been caught off-guard by upset fans and said the Space Marine's "roar was even more beloved than we realized." Relic then teased it would have "something for OG roar enjoyers soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Now, the remastered cinematic has been uploaded once again, this time with the original audio. The Space Marine's battle cry has been restored to its previous glory, and Dawn of War fans can (hopefully) now rest easy, assured that an iconic part of Warhammer 40K video game history has been properly preserved.</p><p dir="ltr">"We heard you!" the description of the new original audio trailer reads. "We've re-released the enhanced trailer with the original audio. The iconic roar is back to celebrate launch week. Are you ready to serve...again?"</p><p dir="ltr">Dawn of War - Definitive Edition arrives August 14 and will be $30, with "loyal fans" who own the game's previous anniversary edition receiving a 30% discount, putting the price at around $21. The Definitive Edition includes a remastered version of the original game along with all three of the game's expansions, Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm, which each include an additional campaign and fan-favorite factions like the Imperial Guard, Necrons, and the Sisters of Battle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm looking at a map of my city, Kansas City, right now, and wondering what I should do for fun this coming weekend. Should I visit the giant purple Zoroark stomping over downtown? If I want to see the Superman with the glowing red eyes in the suburbs to the south, I first have to pass Ralsei Deltarune sitting atop the highway, smoking an enormous blunt. I could go visit the Northland, but there is an enormous United Airlines plane straddling the Missouri River, which might make transit a bit confusing. Hmm. Options, options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That probably sounded like nonsense if you're not aware of <a href="https://wplace.live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wplace</a>, a delightful new time waster in the form of a world map where users can draw a single pixel in a color of their choice, wherever they like, once every 30 seconds. If that sounds familiar, you're probably thinking of one of its main inspirations: /r/place, the Reddit game with a blank canvas that let users similarly place one pixel at a time. Though /r/place closed a few years ago, wplace has rapidly gained popularly in the last few days, to the point where just about wherever you live or wherever you look, you can find detailed collaborative drawings, silly graffiti, inside jokes, and more doodled all over the map. And unshockingly, a lot of those doodles are gaming references.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like most people, I checked out my own city first before exploring wplace more widely. Kansas City is indeed covered with gaming characters. At a glance, I can see several Pokemon, characters from Rain World, Deltarune, OneShot, Metroid, Final Fantasy, Mario, Earthbound, Among Us, Angry Birds, and plenty more can be spotted amid the city's roadways and rivers. There are also lots of other pop culture icons, like SpongeBob and various Transformers, sprinkled in with political messages, sports team logos, various flags, location-specific graffiti, and other random doodles. Some people just wrote their names.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754943131032.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">wplace at the time this piece was written, hovering over Kansas City</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But KC is far from the most interesting city on wplace.

Despite the various adventurers that call it home and stop to rest at the Yawning Portal Inn, the city and its citizenry find themselves under assault by dangerous and powerful monsters, leaving everyone Horrified. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest rendition of Ravensburger's popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> series, Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, crosses over with Wizards of the Coast's legendary tabletop RPG. The result is a game that my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed and were eager to play again, despite a few stumbling blocks.</p><div catalogid="d6f233e8-bd4d-4b71-9c36-c72486a907f5" id="226288"><div id="226288" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8jXm?object_uuid=6ec8716a-8fd3-41d4-ae12-392dc5a9d851&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">original Horrified</a> was released back in 2019, and this new Dungeons &amp; Dragons edition is the series’ sixth iteration. The basic premise each game shares is that up to five players work together to vanquish a selection of monsters by racing around the map, collecting resources, escorting civilians to safety, and beating back the monsters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To win, each monster has to be dealt with. But players will lose if the monster deck is depleted or if the terror track ever hits seven (it's raised whenever a citizen is killed, hero is knocked out, or an effect triggers it). The extra fun part is taking out the monsters. How you deal with each monster is unique, with each one having its own sort of mini-game associated with it that players have to work through before they are gone for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Being <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> themed, this version of Horrified features some of the most recognizable creatures from its pantheon, including the Displacer Beast, a Mimic, the Beholder, and of course, a big red dragon. As a longtime fan and player of D&amp;D, I was instantly intrigued by the box art and the board – but it was the monsters and how they operate that really drew my friends and me in. The developers really managed to work in how these creatures behave according to D&amp;D lore when designing their challenges.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Red Dragon, for instance, has a treasure you have to claim before you can vanquish it upon its treasure horde. The Mimic, for its part, is hidden and off the board until the party manages to finally reveal it. My favorite, by far, was the Beholder, which requires you to take out its 10 eye tendrils first, before going after its large central eye, each with a unique and powerful effect they could hit you with, dictated by a die roll. And yes, of course, there are dice rolls here; you can’t have Dungeons &amp; Dragons without some sort of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">dice-rolling goodness</a> involved, and it doesn’t stop with just eye lasers either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players assume the roles of staple D&amp;D classes, including the Fighter, Rogue, Cleric, Bard, or Wizard. For the most part, each character plays identically, with the exception of their special actions, which require you to roll a 20-sided die (one is included with the game in case you don’t have a small dice horde like yours truly). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That’s just how it goes when you’re rolling d20s.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking your special action can result in one of five possible outcomes, with the various classes behaving differently. For instance, bards can allure other players and citizens towards themselves. The fighter can rush to the nearest monster to do battle, and the cleric helps during monster attacks by letting you re-roll dice. We had some especially funny moments where our resident Wizard teleported the Beholder monster straight to the spot where our cleric just so happened to be – twice in a row. We had a good laugh about that (at least most of us), but that’s just how it goes when you’re rolling d20s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, we did homebrew and tweak the cleric a bit, however, allowing her to “stock” her special actions (basically using actions on her turn to hold rolls for actions), allowing her to use her beneficial skills during any monster phase up until her next turn. This lets the character feel more cleric-y, helping her teammates, as opposed to the as-written rules, which only let her use those skills on her turn’s monster phase. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horrified, in general, isn’t an overly complex board game. In my testing, first-time players were usually able to grasp the flow of the game within a turn or two. Taking actions is straightforward, and the monster cards that dictate how many new items are spawned, any events that take place, citizens that appear, and what monsters activate, are equally so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the wording on how monsters behave caused some confusion and debate, such as whether the mimic monster moved the number of spaces indicacted on the monster card’s movement space, or just a single space when it is activated. But overall, we figured it out (whether our decision was correct or not) and it worked out for us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unique to this version of Horrified is the ability to reduce the terror track, which gives players a hand, pushing them further back from defeat. This is done whenever a monster is defeated, and I found it to be a great addition to use – especially when first introducing new players to the game, as Horrified games can be a bit challenging and require strategy to win. I also appreciate that it is easy enough <em>not</em> to use, so Horrified veterans can simply ignore this feature if they find it lessens the challenge too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One aspect that I am a bit disappointed by with Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is its small pool of monsters you can pick from. With “easy” games asking players to pick from two monsters and the standard challenge requiring three, it means you'll be replaying these monsters frequently. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other versions featured six or seven monsters, with only the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QbbBNw?object_uuid=6ec8716a-8fd3-41d4-ae12-392dc5a9d851&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cthulu-themed Horrified</a> offering just four monsters. And with so many other classic D&amp;D monsters left on the table, it’s a shame we couldn’t have gotten a couple more in the box. Where are my Gelatinous Cubes and Owlbears, or heck, throw something wild like Vecna, the terrifying Lich, into the mix. I can only hope that Ravensburger adds more monsters or classes with future expansions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/92xB1E?object_uuid=6ec8716a-8fd3-41d4-ae12-392dc5a9d851&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a><em></em></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 11, 2025 9:42 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is one of those games that I find easy to recommend to anyone who enjoys the tabletop RPG and even has an inclination to play board games. It does a wonderful job blending the realms of the Horrified and D&amp;D worlds together for a fun game night title that is approachable but offers avenues for strategy and cooperation. For fans of Horrified, if the idea of a new random dice rolling element doesn’t turn you off, I think you will have a great time with this new iteration as well. It’s more Horrified, after all.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horrified-dungeons-and-dragons-is-a-scary-good-time]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The head of the biggest gaming site in the world is leaving the company at the end of August, <em>Kotaku</em> has learned. John Davison, who has been <em>IGN</em>‘s publisher since joining back in 2019, told staff on Monday it was time for “the next chapter.” The high-profile departure comes shortly after a big round of layoffs that saw multiple departments across the company impacted.</p> <p>Arriving just months before the start of the 2020 pandemic, Davison’s tenure at <em>IGN</em> saw the site expand into events like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-and-sega-among-publishers-appearing-at-ign-live">IGN Live</a> and a market analytics platform called <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-launches-gaming-trends-platform-shedding-light-on-how-mobile-roblox-and-more-are-reshaping-the-industry">Gaming Trends</a>. Under parent-company Ziff Davis, <em>IGN</em> also made a massive acquisition last year in the form of the Gamer Network, a suite of European-facing gaming sites like <em>Eurogamer</em>, <em>VG247</em>, and <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em>. Many of those sites were hit with mass layoffs at the time of the deal, and <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> was gutted. One of the most valuable parts of that package, <em>Digital Foundry</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/digital-foundry-df-direct-ign-patreon-retro-games-media-2000616308">announced just last week</a> that it had purchased all outstanding equity to allow it to leave<em> IGN</em> and go fully independent.</p> <p>Davison, whose 25+ years in games media include stints at <em>EGM</em>, <em>Official PlayStation Magazine</em>, and <em>GameSpot</em>, will be leaving<em> IGN</em> at a time when its future trajectory has never been more uncertain. A reporting, news, and features operation that expanded under previous EIC Tina Amini has suffered cuts in recent years due to multiple rounds of layoffs and buyouts. Amini, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-editor-in-chief-tina-amini-steps-down">who left in 2022 and now works at Xbox</a>, was never replaced. Davison reported to Ziff Davis president of gaming and entertainment Yael Prough, and it’s not yet clear if the parent company plans on backfilling his role.</p>

 <p>Davison and <em>IGN</em> did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>IGN</em> laid off over a dozen staff earlier this month, which included approximately 12 percent members in its editorial union. “The company has told us that the reason for this layoff stems from a Ziff Davis mandate to cut costs despite several quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue increases, to which IGN Entertainment responded by coming for our members’ jobs,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvm4rhup5k2a">the IGN Creators Guild wrote at the time</a>. “This is perplexing to us, as we are told again and again that IGN Entertainment has had a tremendously successful year thus far thanks to their hard work.”</p> <p>“It’s been an honor to work alongside such talented, passionate people, and I’m deeply proud of what we’ve accomplished together,” Davison wrote in a message to staff today. “I’m excited for what comes next.”</p>

This new update adds the "Mesa" biome to the game, which temporarily replaces the Alpine biome, and will eventually go into rotation alongside it. Where the Alpine level was a chilly place with freezing winds and icy rocks, the Mesa is a sun-baked little world where sunscreen and umbrellas aren't just a suggestion but a requirement to survive. This new biome has it all: cactuses, tumbleweeds, a deadly sun, and tornadoes that will send you flying.</p><p>This new update has more people playing today than any time since Peak launched (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/#1m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), so this quick fix will be appreciated by many fans and newcomers.</p>

              <p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665"><em>League of Legends</em></a> player who claimed to have built a career around boosting accounts and selling them replied angrily on social media to a developer at Riot Games. He was worried about how he would make money now. The dev’s response was a link to McDonalds’ careers page.</p> <p>On August 11, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-banning-bots-boosters-and-more-in-2025/?_gl=1*dgamq1*_gcl_au*MTU3NTAxOTczNy4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga*MTM2MDIzODkzMS4xNzU0OTQ2Nzkw*_ga_FXBJE5DEDD*czE3NTQ5NDY3OTAkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQ5NDY3OTEkajU5JGwwJGgw">Riot Games announced plans</a>&nbsp;to ramp up its efforts to fight back against smurf and alt account misuse in <em>League of Legends,</em> one of the biggest MOBAs on the planet. These new plans include banning and punishing people who grind on accounts owned by other players, boosting their rank in the process, and charging a fee for doing so. These services have <a href="https://insaneboost.gg/">become quite common online.</a> Even <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">Elon Musk admitted to using one such service</a> in <em>Path of Exile II.</em> But Riot is cracking down and banning accounts associated with the practice. These changes will begin in <em>LoL</em> update 25.18 and will likely lead to players being far more cautious about paying others to boost their rank in<em> League of Legends</em>. That will lead to fewer customers for those offering such “services,” and one of these people wasn’t happy about that news.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://x.com/cat1_alex/status/1954924168245358742?">Twitter user SLS replied to Riot’s Director of Product Drew Levin</a>, and explained that their “main income” comes primarily from boosting other players’ accounts in <em>League of Legends</em>. They also coach players in the free-to-play MOBA, but admitted that this only earned them about 15 percent of what they make boosting in a month. They wrapped up their comment with: “What I do after? [sic] Just chill at McDonald’s?” Levin reshared the post and included a link to McDonald’s careers page, seemingly joking that it was time for SLS to find a new job.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4">https://t.co/Ku080U0fB4</a> <a href="https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF">https://t.co/7JgyjgOpJF</a></p> <p>— Drew Levin (@drewlevin) <a href="https://twitter.com/drewlevin/status/1954931160469114915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Bro, you do understand that you have built a business off of ruining other people’s games, right?” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954926308049494207">replied Levin</a>. “[I] have no desire to preserve that at the expense of whatever lobbies you’re boosting accounts through.”</p> <p>When SLS replied to that message with a complaint that the boosting industry wasn’t hurting the game and that boosters take specific orders related to very high ranks, Levin replied again, this time pointing out how absurd it was that SLS was describing breaking how the game ranks players as an “industry.”</p> <p>“‘The industry?’ ‘Taking orders?’ Bro you are paid to trick our skill evaluation systems, and you are talking to the person leading the effort to improve their integrity,” <a href="https://x.com/drewlevin/status/1954930709510168878">said Levin on social media</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Riot Games about the response.</p> <p>While some players who relied on boosting or liked smurfing–which is when a high-level player creates a new account to use their skills against low-level players–were upset about the changes, the vast majority of the replies to Levin were happy to hear Riot Games was taking alt account abuse seriously in 2025. Of course, it remains to be seen if Riot Games can actually weed out all the boosters and smurf accounts from <em>League of Legends</em> and how quickly people find ways around their new efforts.</p> <p>Also, it should be noted that working at McDonald’s, like any other fast food joint, is a very hard job that requires incredible amounts of patience and stamina. It would be nice if we could all stop acting like people who work at these places are lazy teens working a summer job for beer money or whatever. If that cultural shift were to happen, perhaps they’d have a better shot at getting paid more. And don’t you think the people making your food deserve more money? I do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh no, the latest World of Warcraft patch has us teaming up with an evil cosmic void being who has tried to kill us many times already and will <em>definitely</em> stab us in the back later...but we're all kind of okay with it? Partially because we have no choice but also because she's hot and sarcastic?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about Xal'atath. You know, this lady. <strong>Heads up, I'm going to talk in this article about spoilers for World of Warcraft: The War Within leading up to the events in Patch 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh that dropped last Tuesday.</strong> If you haven't started playing the patch yet and don't want to know what's happening, maybe don't keep reading.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/the-war-within-official-cinematic-shadows-beneath-world-of-warcraft-2-17-screenshot-1754926715062.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you're a lapsed World of Warcraft player, you might know this lady if you've dipped in as recently as World of Warcraft: Legion. Xal'atath first appeared in that expansion in the form of a dagger artifact weapon wielded by Shadow Priests, which would occasionally whisper creepy evil stuff to them about N'Zoth and the Old Gods and all that malarky. At the time, <em>some</em> folks grew rather fond of her unsettling whispers, even affectionately referring to her as "knaifu". The dagger, with the rest of the expansion's artifact weapons, was used to drain the corruption from the giant sword that Sargeras stuck in the planet at the end of the expansion. Normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we naively thought we wouldn't hear from Xal'atath ever again, what was once one weapon among a giant stack of them turned out to be hugely plot-relevant. Xal'atath was passed around from place to place in the interim expansions, finally regaining her power and emerging from the dagger in the form of a void-infused high elf, all the better to corrupt people with. She bopped around Azeroth for a while, manipulating the underground giant bug people and some dragons before she finally made herself known as something called the "Harbinger of Dimensius," basically a herald of a super powerful void lord bent on destroying reality. Again, normal stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of our current expansion, The War Within, Xal'atath appears to be the main villain. She opens the expansion by causing the destruction of Dalaran (again), and she's responsible for the events that lead us to fighting both the Nerubians and the goblin Gallywix. She's spent a lot of time popping up here and there and taunting our ally Alleria Windrunner, she nearly kills Khadgar, and she's obsessed with this void artifact she's been carrying around called the Dark Heart, which she keeps using to corrupt and empower and manipulate. All of this is to say, she seems pretty evil to me! She serves the void and is clearly very interested in destroying us, our buddies, and probably all of Azeroth! Nothing she has done so far seems good, at all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>And yet.</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In patch 11.2, Xal'atath <em>joins us.</em> The short explanation is that she actually betrayed Dimensius in the past, but he's coming back, and he's probably pissed off at her. If he shows up, she's done for. Out of a sense of self-preservation, she's been trying to beef up the Dark Heart to <em>stop</em> his return rather than accelerate it, and was messing around with the Nerubians and the Goblins in an effort to get that done. But at the end of patch 11.1, she accidentally (and sort of stupidly) loses the Dark Heart, forcing her to team up with Alleria and the player as a back-up plan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this actually means, in practice, is that Xal'atath follows us around while questing and occasionally proposes we do things that sound horrible and dangerous, like turn ourselves into an energy being and fill someone with void energy so they can hear the planet sing to them (normal stuff!). But, you know, we can't stop Dimensius without her. She knows his weaknesses, and is pretty much the only path to getting close enough to him to do something about his encroachment. So the murdery knife-elf gets to come along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754938789710.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkdb1y/tone_matters_magni/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, Blizzard has done such a lovely job writing Xal'atath, and Claudia Christian does such a great job voicing her, that most players are...kind of enjoying her presence. The first few days of the new patch last week saw the community subreddit flooded with cheeky, obsessive posts about Xal'atath. Sure, she's evil, but apart from being gorgeous, she's also clever, funny, powerful, and dare I say, kind of sultry? Her banter with the player is almost flirtateous at times, referring to us again and again as "my champion", while simultaneously reminding us that she could snuff us out on a whim. She spends a <em>lot</em> of time needling Alleria Windrunner and, as the ever-wise Ve'nari puts it, "floating around and making sarcastic remarks." And irritatingly enough, she's also correct a lot of the time about the behaviors and motivations of the other people who claim to be Alleria's allies (looking at you, Locus-Walker) and the ways in which they aren't exactly behaving righteously, either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love for Xal'atath has reached such a point that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkv7jh/mommy_xalatath_addon/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">someone even made a mod (add-on) for World of Warcraft</a> that has Xal'atath whisper praise to the player every time they exit a combat scenario...though notably in these messages, Xal'atath refers to herself as "mommy". So download that at your own risk, I guess.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this lady is <em>definitely</em> going to turn on us. And while plenty of players are enjoying the twist of her temporary allegiance and the opportunity to get to know her a little better, others are (rightfully!) recognizing that Xal'atath is definitely a hot mess we're going to regret partying with sooner or later:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/capture-1754939255090.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/">https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj3014/the_story_so_far/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an interesting move by Blizzard to build Xal'atath up for, technically, five expansions, introduce her as the <em>seemingly</em> big bad of this one, only to form an alliance of convenience in the final act of The War Within with the promise that she's definitely going to keep on being evil in future expansions. With Xal'atath's dark and void theming, it seems likely she might play a major role in the next expansion, Midnight, which will be fully revealed at Gamescom in just a few weeks. The long game Blizzard's playing here is especially potent given that some of its other storylines that similar took several expansions of setup did not go over so well, such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23015539/world-of-warcraft-sylvanas-windrunner-story-explainer-battle-for-azeroth-shadowlands-novel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whatever was going on with Sylvanas and the Jailer</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, trust Knaifu at your own risk, and enjoy her while you can. Manaforge Omega, the new raid, opens tomorrow and will bring with it another chapter of The War Within's story as we inch closer to the Midnight reveal and what I can only assume is Xal'atath's inevitable re-betrayal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

From scoring a touchdown to recording an interception to just making a first down, you'll be able to celebrate quite often during a game. However, you first have to know what buttons to press to be able to celebrate and which celebrations you have access to, depending on what kind of play you made.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available celebrations in Madden 26, how to perform them, and when you can perform each one.</p><h2>How to perform celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Before we get into each celebration offered in Madden 26, how do you perform one after you make a big play? Fortunately, it's fairly simple.</p><p>After you score a touchdown, intercept a pass, or make a first down, look at the bottom left corner of your screen. You'll see a "Celebrate" icon appear, and you can press a specific button combination after it appears to perform a celebration. You want to make sure you press the celebration buttons quickly, though, as the icon doesn't stay on the screen for too long.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548149"></a><figcaption>The Celebration icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548149-img_6903.jpg"></figure><p>Once the icon disappears, your celebration window has passed, and you'll have to wait for the next big play to celebrate.</p><h2>All celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Now that you know what to look for before you celebrate, let's go over all of the celebrations and the buttons to press to perform each one.</p><p>As we mentioned before, you can celebrate after scoring a touchdown, intercepting a pass, or making a first down. There are specific celebrations you can perform after each of these big plays. This means you can only use certain celebrations after scoring a touchdown, and those celebrations aren't available after intercepting a pass or making a first down.</p><p>All three of the big play types in Madden 26 have their own celebrations with unique button combinations, so you have to remember which celebrations correlate with each play. You'll also have to remember the buttons to press to perform the celebration you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548150"></a><figcaption>Some of the TD celebrations in Madden 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548150-img_6901.jpg"></figure><p>Below, we've separated the different categories of celebrations and listed the button combinations for each one in Madden 26:</p><p><strong>All Touchdown celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Point to Fans</td><td>Right Stick (RS) Up</td></tr><tr><td>Step Back on Em</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Griddy</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Salute</td><td>RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Reach Low Flex</td><td>L2/LT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Shake With It</td><td>L2/LT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Wavy Walk</td><td>L2/LT + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>He's a Dawg</td><td><p>L2/LT + RS Left</p></td></tr><tr><td>Stand on Biz</td><td>L1/LB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Afterburners</td><td>L1/LB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Spike</td><td>L1/LB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Two-Step Shuffle</td><td>L1/LB + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Headstand</td><td>R2/RT + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Run Up Flex</td><td>R2/RT + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Fancy Flip</td><td><p>R2/RT + RS Down</p></td></tr><tr><td>All Together Now</td><td>R2/RT + RS Left</td></tr><tr><td>Candy Karate</td><td>R1/RB + RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Wait For It</td><td>R1/RB + RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Shake Em Up</td><td>R1/RB + RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>At the Y</td><td>R1/RB + RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All Interception celebrations</strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wave Goodbye</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Why You Throwing My Way</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Strapped</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Head Swag</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>All First Down celebrations </strong></p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Celebration</th><th scope="col">Button Combination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Signal It</td><td>RS Up</td></tr><tr><td>Touch Em Up</td><td>RS Right</td></tr><tr><td>Jacked</td><td>RS Down</td></tr><tr><td>Shake It Off</td><td>RS Left</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can view all of these celebrations by pressing pause during the middle of a game or training session and selecting the "Celebrations" tab.</p><h2>How to perform Hot Spot Celebrations in Madden 26</h2><p>Finally, Madden 26 has also introduced Hot Spot Celebrations, which give you more freedom in how your player celebrates after a touchdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4548151"></a><figcaption>Performing a touchdown celebration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4548151-img_6902.jpg"></figure><p>Hot Spot Celebrations work by giving you time to move your player after they've scored a touchdown. During this time, you can move your player to certain parts of the endzone to have them interact with specific elements of the field. There are a few different zones throughout the endzone, and moving to each zone will result in a new celebration.</p><p>For example, running to the field goal post will make your player interact with it, while running to one side of the endzone sees your player get the crowd involved. You only have a few seconds to move your player after they've scored a touchdown if you want to use a Hot Spot Celebration, so make your movements count.</p>

              <p>OpenAI launched its long-awaited <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">AI update, GPT-5,</a> on August 7. It made lofty promises like “PhD‑level intelligence.” But within 24 hours, the tool’s most devoted users were cataloging its many bugs, errors, and shortcomings on Reddit. The ChatGPT fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mkobei/openai_just_pulled_the_biggest_baitandswitch_in/">started melting down</a>. CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1953893841381273969">responded</a> by promising to let customers start using the older GPT models again. By August 11, Altman was in <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1954703747495649670">full screencap apology</a> mode trying to cauterize the flow of bad vibes.</p> <p>“If you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models,” he posted on X earlier today. “It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake).”</p> <p>The tenor of this self-inflicted debacle should be familiar to anyone who’s played <em>Destin</em>y, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or dozens of other online multiplayer games. It’s the same mix of developer hubris, corporate profit motive, hyper fandom, and “<a href="https://x.com/dril/status/660644922744262656?lang=en">Sorry. Im sorry. Im trying to remove it</a>.” An upcoming expansion is sold with lofty promises. It arrives full of half-baked ideas and stealth nerfs. Players encounter a surprising number of bugs. Meanwhile the prices in the microtransaction shop are going up and the places where you can earn rewards for free are disappearing.</p>

 <p>“This guy communicates in a way that is indistinguishable from a community manager of a live service video game having a botched expansion release,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/catharsis23.bsky.social/post/3lw5jvotgfk2s">wrote</a> one Bluesky user in response. “Seems kind of humiliating.” Vocal AI critic Ed Zitron, who pegged GPT-5 as <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittification-of-generative-ai/">generative AI’s enshittification moment</a>, was more direct. “This is the ultimate folly of OpenAI: they engaged gamer-like hype, got gamer-like fandom, and now face the wrath of gamer-like hate,” he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/edzitron.com/post/3lw5k3nkztc2r">wrote</a> today.</p> <p>The GTP-5 fiasco <a href="https://gizmodo.com/it-took-just-24-hours-of-complaints-for-openai-to-start-bringing-back-its-old-model-2000640912">revolved around a few main issues</a>. While it was promised as another big leap in the model’s capabilities, what really seemed to be going on was that it was just routing queries to lots of different models to save time and money. There was also a very limiting cap on the number of queries users outside of the most expensive plans could make each week. Finally, there was the disappearances of GPT-4o, one of OpenAI’s most popular models which also <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">had a reputation for being</a> “sycophantic.”</p> <p>“ChatGPT psychosis” is one of the biggest concerns with the billion-dollar cash-burning enterprise right now. Chat bots can suck users into “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html">delusional spirals</a>” with them. People are reportedly being <a href="https://futurism.com/commitment-jail-chatgpt-psychosis">involuntarily committed or jailed</a> after becoming obsessed with their GPT interactions. One guy thought he had trained his AI to become self-aware and that <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/">it was talking to God for him</a>.</p>

 <p>Altman clearly thinks this aspect of ChatGPT can be harmful in the wrong hands. But many of the people currently paying for ChatGPT also clearly prefer it. And he’s spent so long packaging OpenAI’s platform-shift moonshot as a grand cosmic journey everyone’s on together that dialing down the snake oil is no longer an option. After years of hyping AGI (artificial general intelligence), Altman told Wall Street last week that it’s actually “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/sam-altman-says-agi-is-a-pointless-term-experts-agree.html?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=689a05a3778386000185beda&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">not a super useful term</a>.”</p> <p>This is the part in the live-service hype cycle where studios usually go from talking about how their game is completely transformative and unlike anything else you’ve ever played before to offering very in-the-weeds explanations of why patch notes that are impossible for outsiders to parse will overhaul the game into the best version of the thing you already love. The players, who have invested not just their money and free time but also no small chunk of their identity in how your product makes them feel will now become like the dinosaurs at Jurassic Park. They are not trapped in your hyper-complex, infinitely monetizable skinner box. You are trapped in whatever they insist on perverting it into. Even if that’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/i-feel-like-im-going-crazy-chatgpt-fuels-delusional-spirals-ae5a51fc?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAiqx4e9RsfPVEG8-vSVaF26bdgC8kiLYXSykv1hX5M3kzc2lNInkty8wQyYn5o%3D&amp;gaa_ts=689a6287&amp;gaa_sig=w891GxyjybddGBhS316rMpTsfH3domwnKveQDIM4DMGXW47JE1c4U4x30cETuWVawzdNGNzebYIZi-hOBA5Rcw%3D%3D">an expensive rabbit hole full of apocalyptic conspiracies</a>.</p>

                <p>From the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises to the 2K sports titles, Take-Two Interactive has some of the most-desirable games in the industry. However, the company has largely kept its marquee titles away from Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Now, Take-Two President Karl Slatoff has explained why the company hasn't embraced lending more of its games to subscription services.</p><p>"We do put our titles occasionally into some of the subscription services," Slatoff said earlier this month during a Take-Two investor call (via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/07/take-two-ttwo-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Motley Fool</a>). "They're great partners for us. And in many cases, they're great ... We wouldn't do it unless it was a good economic deal. The platforms wouldn't do it either. So we do take advantage of that, and it's been compelling much from an economic standpoint. As it relates to NBA, we have done it in the past. We don't really talk about whether we're gonna do anything in the future. But when you do put something into a channel like that, it generates obviously, engagement. It generates income for us. And it's something that we consider, and we do it if the time is right, if the math makes sense."</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has previously weighed in on the subject by stating that it doesn't make sense <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">to put any of the company's new titles on Game Pass or PS Plus</a>. He also said that high-profile day-one games like Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will only drive up Game Pass subscriptions for a short period of time</a>.</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">launching titles day one on Game Pass can devalue games</a> and hurt the industry. Hutchinson has first-hand experience with the subject: Raccoon Logic launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/" data-ref-id="5000-640444">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> as a day one title earlier this year, and the company didn't get the response it hoped for.</p>
