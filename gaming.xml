                <p>It is no secret that 2021's Battlefield 2042 was not the success that EA and developer DICE hoped for. Although the game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">No. 5 best-selling title in the US during 2021</a>, it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-failed-to-reach-expectations-but-ea-still-had-its-best-q3-in-company-history/1100-6500197/" data-ref-id="1100-6500197">disappointment commercially for EA</a> and fans didn't have the best things to say about it either.

We took so many learnings from that, and while it strayed from what people found core to Battlefield, it meant that it was very clear and easy for people to vocalize the things that 2042 was <em>not</em>, and what we need to make sure Battlefield 6 <em>is,</em>" Christofi told <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/battlefield-6-looks-to-the-future-by-staying-true-to-its-foundations-and-creating-meaningful-change-through-community-driven-feedback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Well-Played.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another producer, David Sirland, said the studio spent a lot of time thinking about the core pillars of Battlefield--destruction, classes, and vehicles--and designing Battlefield 6 in service to those.</p><p>Christofi said it was important to define what Battlefield's core tenets were and Sirland said it was also important to nail down what they are not.</p><p>"We needed to define that clearly, because that guides us for a long time, like 10-plus years, or whatever. It should be that stringent. Sure, you can amend it and change it, but everyone on the team should be able to feel that and be like, 'Okay, I know what we're doing,'" he said. "So, when I get a new idea, does it fit? Yes, cool. It's not like it tells exactly what to do, but it should tell you the lane to stay within. I think that is what's needed. Because I think that maybe, if anything, for 2042, that wasn't super clear, right, especially not over time. It was more of a reaction to something that didn’t work and we changed it as fast as possible."</p><p>In 2022, DICE general manager Rebecka Coutaz reacted to Battlefield 2042's poor launch, saying, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">"Everybody was disappointed."</a> Following the game's release. DICE shuffled its top leaders, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-franchise-undergoes-major-shake-up/1100-6498521/" data-ref-id="1100-6498521">former GM Oskar Gabrielson leaving the studio and other major changes in a big shakeup.</a></p><p>EA also created a new label, Battlefield Studios, to oversee the development of the brand. DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive all work under Battlefield Studios. The former general manager of Call of Duty--Byron Beede--is now the general manager of Battlefield. The future of Battlefield is also being developed under the leadership of EA executive Vince Zampella, a former Call of Duty boss as well.</p><p>So far, EA appears to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">saying and doing the right things with Battlefield 6</a> to help win fans back, but only time will tell if the game can stick the landing and find a place in an ultra-competitive marketplace. Beyond Battlefield 6's multiplayer and campaign, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">new battle royale experience is in the works as well.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> begins August 7 for a limited group of people before expanding more widely later in August. The full game, meanwhile, launches October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gabe-newell-bought-a-yacht-company.1261881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As you all know, it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boat Day</a> on Aftermath, which gives rise to an obvious question: What’s Gabe Newell up to? The sea-loving founder of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-reported-profit-per-head-from-steam-commissions-is-out-there-and-at-usd3-5-million-per-employee-it-makes-apple-and-facebook-look-like-a-lemonade-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most insanely profitable companies ever</a> recently described himself as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">effectively retired</a> despite still working all the time and noted that scuba diving is part of his daily routine. He also owns <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an armada of yachts</a> worth roughly $1 billion. And so, to put as fine a point on it as humanly possible, he recently bought a yacht company.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro/news/oceanco-yacht-builder-sold-to-gabe-newell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boat International</a>, a publication whose name I cannot help but laugh at, reports that Newell purchased <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/new-chapter-gabe-newell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oceano</a>, one of the world’s leading builders of custom superyachts. In an accompanying press release, Oceano assured its ultra-wealthy clientele that despite a new captain taking the wheel, it’s going to keep building incredibly large boats.</p><p>“Gabe Newell is not entering this world as a financier or a strategist, but as a hands-on visionary who respects the sea, the craft, and above all, the people who make it possible,” Oceano <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-new-chapter-for-oceanco-new-shareholder-gabe-newell-302517592.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “He wants Oceanco to continue on what it already does best: placing people first. This is not about buying a yacht company. It's about plugging into a team and exploring what kind of future they can create when nothing holds them back.”</p><p>This is important, because rich people fucking love big boats. As the rich have gotten richer over the course of the past few decades, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/09/superyachts-and-bragging-rights-why-the-super-rich-love-their-floating-homes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yacht collecting has become a pastime</a> for those who believe themselves both inheritors of the Earth and also entirely bereft of responsibility to its environment or people. In part, it’s a simple matter of social status: What better way to flaunt your wealth to both your peers and the local peasants than a towering sea city from which you can descend at will, like God delivering an edict? What could feel better, if you’re a wealth-drunk sociopath whose brain is shrinking by the day, than hearing that your friend built an 80-meter yacht and replying “Well fuck you, mine is gonna be 85 meters”?&nbsp;</p><p>But of course, rich people wouldn’t be <em>spending </em>sums from their ill-gotten dragon hoards unless there was some kind of society-immiserating loophole for them to exploit. As <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-rich-people-buy-yachts-jets-taking-loans-against-them-2022-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Borrowing against yachts or jets at the point of purchase — or shortly after — means customers can put up little to no cash to close the deals. Depending on the desirability of the asset, banks extend loans from half to nearly 100% of its value. Borrowers can either draw on another line of credit, pledge more collateral, or use cash to cover the rest of the purchase. For rich individuals whose assets are tied up in stock, real estate, and other assets subject to capital gains taxes, the move is a no-brainer. In California, for instance,&nbsp;capital gains taxes can total nearly 40%, whereas interest rates are near historic lows.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In other words, rich people aren’t spending much on these <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/11/megayachts-environment-carbon-emissions-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planet-sickening</a> bathtub toys, but money is changing hands nonetheless. The big boat business is booming, and Gabe Newell – a big boat connoisseur – has decided to gamble some of his untold billions on what is, in all likelihood, a pretty safe bet.&nbsp;</p><p>But hey, at least good guy Gabe is chill about AI, right? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/gabe-newell-says-young-people-need-to-use-ai-tools-to-get-off-to-the-races-rather-than-reading-articles-on-variety-to-try-to-understand-what-its-impact-is-going-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ah, well.

It’s a topic the actor has spoken about before, and one he is extremely passionate about.</p> <p>In early July, a user on Twitter posted that people should download a mod that replaces the main character’s voice in<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> with that of Adam Jensen, the protagonist of the two most recent&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>games, using AI. They also suggested customizing the main character to look like the <em>Deus Ex</em> character. They claimed that if you took these steps, it would turn CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG into a “pretty convincing” <em>Deus Ex</em> game. A month later, on August 2, this tweet came to the attention of Jensen’s voice actor, Toufexis, and he had a simple, clear reply to this idea: “No. Do not fucking do that.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">No. Do not fucking do that. <a href="https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg">https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg</a></p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>When another Twitter user asked Toufexis, who voiced Sam Cole in 2023’s <em>Starfield</em>, why they shouldn’t use the AI mod to add Jensen to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the voice actor replied: <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951804424252441040">“You going to pay me for using my voice?”</a></p>

 <p>The voice replacement mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;mentioned in the original tweet was uploaded to the internet in October 2023. Its creator states that they mean no disrespect to Toufexis and claims that if the voice actor ever reached out to them and demanded it be removed, the modder would comply. “I would never want someone to feel like I’m robbing them of their right to own and dictate when or how their voice is to be used,” <a href="https://schaken-mods.com/forums/topic/153170-adam-jensen-as-v-ai-voice-over/#:~:text=I%20would%20never%20want%20someone%20to%20feel%20like%20I%27m%20robbing%20them%20of%20their%20right%20to%20own%20and%20dictate%20when%20or%20how%20their%20voice%20is%20to%20be%20used.">explained the modder</a>. It’s not clear if Toufexis has reached out to the modder yet.</p> <p>Adam Jensen appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-mankind-divided-the-kotaku-review-1785610152">2011’s<em> Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> and its 2016 sequel, </a><em>Mankind Divided. </em>The brooding cyborg badass became famous for his raspy, deep voice and has remained a fan favorite. Toufexis loves talking about the character, so much so that <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">he was told to stop by series developers Edios Montreal in 2020</a>. In 2024, a new, unannounced <em>Deus Ex</em> game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890">reportedly canceled</a> by Embracer Group.</p> <p>This is far from the first time Toufexis has spoken about AI generation tools being used to replace voice actors. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-sam-coe-voice-actor-romance-elias-toufexis-1850826699">In a 2023 interview with <em>Kotaku</em></a>, Jensen’s iconic voice actor called AI a “tool that steals from other people’s work.”</p>

 <p>“I honestly feel that AI cannot replace real actors in the long run,” said Toufexis. “But it can take away a whole slew of jobs that normally go to actors. Big roles like Sam [from <em>Starfield</em>] are probably safe. AI is just a tool that steals from other people’s work and tries to create reality. But it’s not reality, and I believe people will know the difference and want the real thing. But it may take some time. I look at it like NFTs or 3D TVs. There will be a little while where people fool around with the new tech, but eventually they’ll realize how fake it is.”</p> <p>He also explained that if he catches people using AI to recreate his voice for profit or promotion, he’ll ask them to stop. If they do, that will be the end of it. However, if they continue, he’ll go after them, telling <em>Kotaku</em> in 2023: “We have to protect actors from replacement. It’s a dangerous slope. If my voice can be replaced, that is almost literally leading to taking food out of my kids’ mouths. This is a huge part of my livelihood.”</p>

                <p>In the wake of the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered's release</a>, the developers behind Skylivion are making clear that their ambitious mod over 10 years in the making is far more than just a graphics update: It "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion looks to recreate the 2006 open-world RPG in the engine of 2011's Skyrim, albeit with new content and gameplay changes. The mod is still slated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">release in 2025</a>, and in the latest development diary for the project, the TESRenewal mod team behind Skyblivion answers the question that has been top of mind since Oblivion Remastered released in April--what's the point of Skyblivion when the official remaster is already available?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MH-BqXk2WA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The answer is simple," the dev diary states. "Skyblivion is a full-scale remake that reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards. While the official remaster impressively upgrades textures and assets, Skyblivion introduces entirely newly designed areas, dungeons, cities, gameplay enhancements, and much more."</p><p dir="ltr">Far from just Oblivion running in a new engine, the devs state that "every fort, home, cave, and landscape has been thoughtfully redesigned."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've infused this sort of creative detail to breathe new life into a beloved classic--one that is nearly two decades old," the dev diary states.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the dev diary provides ample evidence to back up the team's "full-scale remake" claims, as it highlights how it remade the city of Anvil to feature a large harbor and is introducing a new Oblivion biome to make closing Oblivion gates "less repetitive and monotonous."</p><p dir="ltr">An overhaul to the original game's "unique" items also coming with Skyblivion. The devs note how in the original game, most unique items were unique in "name only" and were largely just modified versions of existing items recolored with a slight stat boost. In Skylivion, unique items will be "truly unique," with updated appearances and, in the case of many unique weapons, new attack animations to help players "diversify" their playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">Previous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ambitious-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-shows-off-20-minutes-of-quest-gameplay/1100-6525882/" data-ref-id="1100-6525882">Skyblivion updates</a> outlined how it will include new quests, monsters, a reimagined lockpicking minigame, and even new music, as well as updates to the game's menus and UI.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion doesn't have specific release date, but the dev diary states the team is "confident" it will meet its goal of releasing this year. The mod will be free to download for those who own both Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're excited to show off more soon and get Skyblivion into your hands, but we've still got work to do in finalizing key areas and giving Skyblivion proper quality and assurance to make sure we all get the game fans deserve," the video concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">In light of Oblivion Remastered's reveal, Skyblivion's project lead said the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">remaster was a "win-win" for the community</a>. Bethesda later gifted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-gave-oblivion-remastered-keys-to-the-entire-skyblivion-remake-team/1100-6531035/" data-ref-id="1100-6531035">copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion</a> mod team.</p>

      </div>
<p>Portal was introduced in Battlefield 2042 as a means to allow players to create and customize their own gametypes with custom rules and settings. In Battlefield 6, it goes further and allows players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609">make their own maps.</a></p><p>The nice thing about a server browser, fans say, is that it allows players the freedom to choose to play whatever they want, on any map they want, in a region near them with an ideal ping. While there may not be a server browser for official servers in Battlefield 6, it's likely fans will do the work themselves and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1metpxq/no_server_browser_for_official_servers_so_its/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create copies of the official servers</a>. That may not be an ideal experience, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 producer Alexia Christofi addressed the fan discussion about server browsers, asking people to send in feedback as to why an official server browser is so important to them.

<p>And he'd love to make another soundtrack, "if asked"</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="hip tanaka" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/156b6e5e3f525/hip-tanaka.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6S7C9Sh7xE&amp;ab_channel=ChipTanaka">Hip Tanaka</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Those lovely folks over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/legendary-nintendo-composer-hip-tanaka-says-hed-love-to-make-another-full-game-soundtrack-if-asked/">VGC</a> spoke to the one and only Hirokazu Tanaka — better known as 'Hip' or 'Chip' Tanaka — at Bitsummit's Indie Game Event in Kyoto last month and, it seems, the main man may well be up for making some sweet new music, if somebody asks. Would somebody just let him make some new music quickly, please, for crying out loud!</p>
<p>Tanaka, who you might know as the composer behind soundtracks for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/kid_icarus">Kid Icarus</a> and the Game Boy version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a>, to name just a few things he's got on the old CV. He worked on the soundtracks for both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/earthbound">EarthBound</a>. Oh, and he also played a key role in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poca-is-a-game-boy-camera-photobook-adventure-and-a-heartfelt-homage-to-hip-tanaka">creating and designing the Game Boy</a>. So, yeah, he's kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>Mr Tanaka, who was in-house with Nintendo working on music all through the 8- and 16-bit eras, left the company and ended up as President of Creatures Inc after his work on the <strong>Pokémon</strong> anime became a conflict of interest for Nintendo.</p>
<p>And so it's delightful to hear, and doubly so given that Chip's work has shifted away from music somewhat since the move from Nintendo, that he's all in on returning to it. Speaking to VGC, when asked if he'd be into making another videogame soundtrack, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, if somebody came up to me and said ‘hey, do you want to make music for a game?’ I’d say ‘yeah, sure, sounds like fun...There’s a studio called 17-Bit making a game called <strong>Awaysis</strong>, created by a guy called Jake (Kazdal), and I actually made a track for that game. I’m not the only person making music for that game, there’s a bunch of us, but I created a track for it, and I’m playing it tomorrow.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When then asked if he'd prefer to make single tracks or a full soundtrack, the musical maestro responded that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actually, to correct that [previous answer], I didn’t just do one song for Awaysis, I’m doing 70-80% of the game...But I think, for me, I spent my 20s to around 40 or so just making game music, and since then I’ve spent about 20 years where I haven’t really made any, so it’s kind of (about) getting back into it right now."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanaka also confirmed that he actually composed a track for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> saying, <em>“So if anybody comes up to me and says ‘hey, can you do this’, I’d be like ‘yes, I’d love to’.</em> Now, let's check out Mr Tanaka's contribution to Street Fighter 6, 'Glorious Match'!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>So, who's gonna give the man a job writing a new soundtrack? Let us know your thoughts!</em></p></section>

                <p>Pac-Man made the jump to 3D way back in 1999 with Pac-Man World, which earned solid reviews and went on to become something of a cult classic. It would later earn a remake, Pac-Man World Re-Pac, in 2022. A similar thing is now happening with the original game's sequel, Pac-Man World 2. The 3D platformer launched for PS2, GameCube, and Xbox in 2002, and more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK7YV5RB,B0FK8D2W2C,B0FK7ZW7F3,B0FK7Z44K4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is bringing it to a whole new audience with new features, enhanced graphics, and voice acting. Preorders are open ahead of its September 26 release on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC, with two options available: a $30 standard edition and a $40 Digital Deluxe Edition.

        <p>As NSFW games controversy continues.</p>

            <p>
As Steam and Itch.io continued to grapple with recent pressure by payment processors to withdraw NSFW games from their platforms, Mastercard has moved to distance itself from the ensuing censorship controversy, insisting it has not "required restrictions of any" game. But Valve says otherwise, pointing to a Mastercard rule saying the company can refuse to process anything it believes 'reflects negatively' on its brand.
</p>
<p>
Last month, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">introduced vague new guidelines</a> preventing "certain types of adult content" from being distributed on Steam, later confirming it had begun "retiring" certain adult games that "may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks". Shortly after, indie-focused digital distribution platform Itch.io <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">began 'deindexing' all NSFW games</a>, blaming the same anti-porn group - Australia-based Collective Shout - that had pressured Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal into targeting Steam. In both cases, Itch.io and Valve noted the support of payment processors was essential to the ongoing operation of their platforms.
</p>
<p>
Plenty has happened since then; Itch.io has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itch-begins-re-indexing-free-adult-nsfw-content-as-it-seeks-alternative-payment-processors">begun reindexing free NSFW games</a> and confirmed it's looking to partner with a payment processor comfortable with adult material, while other parts of the games industry - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames">rival storefront GOG with its FreedomToBuy campaign</a> - have spoken out against game censorship. But amid all this, Mastercard is now attempting to distance itself from recent events, denying it put pressure on Itch.io and Valve to remove games from their platforms. In a <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html">statement shared on its website,</a> the credit card company insisted it had "not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations."
</p>
<p>
"Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law," it continued. "Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."
</p>
<p>
However, Valve claims otherwise, saying that while Mastercard didn't directly pressure it to remove adult content from Steam, the credit card company instead "communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks", and these, in turn, contacted Valve.
</p>
<p>
"Mastercard did not communicate with Valve directly, despite our request to do so," the Steam operator wrote in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">statement shared with Kotaku over the weekend</a>. "Mastercard communicated with payment processors and their acquiring banks. Payment processors communicated this with Valve, and we replied by outlining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">Steam's policy since 2018</a> of attempting to distribute games that are legal for distribution. Payment processors rejected this, and specifically cited Mastercard's Rule 5.12.7 and risk to the Mastercard brand."
</p>
<p>
Mastercard's <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/content/dam/public/mastercardcom/na/global-site/documents/mastercard-rules.pdf">Rule 5.12.7</a> prohibits transactions that are illegal or that "in the sole discretion of the Corporation, may damage the goodwill of the Corporation or reflect negatively on the Marks." The first part is easy to define - Mastercard says the sale of "products or services other than [those] in full compliance with law" violates its terms - but the second is more open-ended, giving the company potentially limitless freedom to define what is and isn't acceptable. It can then either fine, audit, or withdraw services for violations.
</p>
<p>
This latter clause prohibits "the sale of a product or service, including an image, which is patently offensive and lacks serious artistic value (such as, by way of example and not limitation, images of nonconsensual sexual behavior, sexual exploitation of a minor, nonconsensual mutilation of a person or body part, and bestiality)", but also "any other material that the Corporation deems unacceptable to sell in connection with a Mark."
</p>
<p>
As the events at Steam and Itch.io have continued to unfold, industry figures and representative bodies have spoken out against payment processor overreach. The International Game Developer Association <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/">recently showed its support</a> for games depicting "consensual adult content", pushing back against "financial institutions... influencing which stories can be told and sold in games, with minimal transparency or public accountability". But with adult content increasingly under fire - as more countries begin drafting legislation such as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">UK's controversial Online Safety Act</a> - the adult games industry may have a difficult road ahead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend at GenCon, Wizards of the Coast dropped new information on their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Forgotten Realms supplements. They outlined what players can expect when returning to the most iconic setting in the enduring fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Forgotten Realms Supplement Preview</h2>

<p>As archived in a post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2032-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast has announced that the new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms supplement will be broken up into two books: <em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun</em>. Both of these supplements are for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</a>, also referred to as 5.5 Edition by the community.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=koCdasu7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-monster-artwork.jpg?itok=L06_98P8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Forgotten Realms: Heroes of Faerun</em> focuses entirely on player options. The book will include information on regional factions like The Harpers and the Zhentarim, an overview of various locales for player backstories, and a bunch of new backgrounds feats, and subclasses like the Bladesinger Wizard and the Scion of the Three Rogue. The subclasses are notable since they appeared in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a> back in June.</p>

<p>Curiously, this new book includes a new mechanic called Circle Magic. The overview is brief, referring to it as "cooperative casting magic," but it does invite speculation.</p>

<p>The second <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms book, Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerun, is all about DM materials. It will contain over 50 prewritten adventures for levels 1-15, five gazetteers on key areas of Faerun like Icewind Dale or Baldur's Gate, over 50 quickplay maps, new monster and villain statblocks, and new magic items and bastions.</p>

<p>Wizards of the Coast has also included some digital exclusives with these books. Three digital supplements are being sold at an MSRP of $14.99. <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em>, which will include vampiric rules, an updated Dhampir player option, and a prewritten adventure featuring the titular vampire from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

The details on the third book are yet to be announced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Forgotten Realms books are available for pre-order. Both <em>Heroes of Faerun</em> and <em>Adventures in Faerun</em> are available in physical (MSRP $49.99), digital (MSRP $29.99) and physical and digital (MSRP $ 59.99) bundles. In addition, there is an Ultimate Bundle that includes digital and physical copies of both books, the digital expansions, and digital dice and maps for D&amp;D Beyond (MSRP $159.99).</p>

<p>The books are expected to release November 11.</p>

<p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> features a handful of secret characters to unlock. Some are immediately available to buy in the Secret Shop, like Michelangelo and <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Margera</a>. Others are only added to the shop once you’ve completed a hidden objective. One of the most difficult to unlock is the fan-favorite Officer Dick, who is lovingly portrayed by Jack Black for the second time.</p> <p>You’ll need to explore the deep corners of each level before this skater can be added to your roster. Using <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140">Photo Mode</a> to scour the map can help, but this guide will save you a lot more time.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614521"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614521">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b>To unlock Officer Dick, you’ll need to collect the hidden Panda plush in each level.</b> These can be harder to find than most Secret Tapes, since the latter has the benefit of being a giant floating item that’s highlighted to boot.</p> <p>Once you’ve collected them all, a familiar-looking skater named Constable Richard will be added to the Secret Shop for $5,000. Pay up the cash to unlock him and an alternate outfit with his iconic Officer Dick look.</p> <p>Let’s dive into where each plushie is located. We’re going in order from the first map of the third game to the last new map for the fourth game.</p> <h3><span id="foundry"></span>Foundry<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614522"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614522">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Head to the other side of the map from where you start. Build up some speed and jump off the half pipe here to catch a grind on the upper level. Hop off the edge and go to the leftmost corner to find the plush.</p> <h3><span id="canada"></span>Canada<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614523">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn around and go towards the giant tree surrounded by half pipes.

Go left to the C2 terminal that’s meant for Tokyo flights. Skate up the ramp in front and try to land behind the three monitors to easily access this plush.</p> <h3><span id="skater-island"></span>Skater Island<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614527">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Exit the building and head towards the overturned boat on your left. The plush will be found sitting on the other side of it.</p> <h3><span id="los-angeles"></span>Los Angeles<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614528">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the road to your right and then barrel through the fountain building’s glass windows. Transfer over the watery half pipe in front of you and venture into either hole to acquire this plush. If all you see are grates, you need to trigger the “They’re Grate” gap by grinding the rails nearby.</p> <h3><span id="tokyo"></span>Tokyo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614529">©Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Panda is located in the hidden left area of the map, which you can access after grinding the top levels of the left side and collapsing the giant circle advertisement. Technically, the plush is directly beneath you in this new area. Jump off and venture towards either side to grind the edges of their half pipes. A separate path can be grinded close to the plush, but you’ll zoom past. I could only reach this one by awkwardly jumping towards it.</p> <h3><span id="cruise-ship"></span>Cruise Ship<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614530">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn right from the start and hop down to the lower level of the cruise ship. The plush is well-hidden up in the planters on the left side. Grind the rails above to reach them.</p> <h3><span id="college"></span>College<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614531">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>From the start, head left and grind up the barrier arm that leads up to the parking garage’s second level. Turn around and jump between the college-decorated wires, the purple rail on the right, and finally the roof of the white building ahead to collect this level’s plush.</p> <h3><span id="san-francisco"></span>San Francisco<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614533">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn left and keep skating until you reach the Pier 12 building. Make a big jump to reach its roof, where you can find the plush in front of a pink dog graffiti.</p> <h3><span id="movie-studio"></span>Movie Studio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614534">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Start moving forward and transfer off the half pipes to the left. Jump into the green bowl with the spaceship prop above it, and then cross the tied rope in the corner. The plush is sitting a little to the right, so you might need to fling yourself to collect it.</p> <h3><span id="alcatraz"></span>Alcatraz<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614535">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll need to head to the rooftops for this one. Once you’re up there, skate up the ramp leading to a red pipe and grind it around the old water tower and down the wire leading to a silo. Jump off the wire and try to land on the small walkway to reach the plush.</p> <h3><span id="water-park"></span>Water Park<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614536">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Jump off to the right as soon as you can and skate around until you reach a wooden ramp and a gigantic red bucket. Just beneath the wooden ramp and to the right is a small platform with the plush.</p> <h3><span id="kona"></span>Kona<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614539"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614539">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The starting position for this map changes, so I suggest finding the corner with the long, windy grey ramps. Follow the wooden fence perimeter until you see a blue dumpster next to a red half pipe. You can find the plush next to the former.</p> <h3><span id="shipyard"></span>Shipyard<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614540">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and then move between the buildings to the left. Enter the open warehouse on the left side to reach the rooftop. Jump to the adjacent roof and then jump to the grated walkway on the right. Hop over the small half pipe and then jump onto the walkway of the nearby rusted building. The plush is sitting on the other side.</p> <h3><span id="london"></span>London<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614541">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and approach where the blue van is for Stompy the Elephant. Turn left instead and descend into a small parking garage. The blue sports car is pointing directly toward some trash and the small plush.</p> <h3><span id="zoo"></span>Zoo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614542"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614542">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the ramp and turn right. Keep on going until you reach the Lion’s area, which you’ll want to grind the top of. On the left side will be a small platform for the plush.</p> <h3><span id="pinball"></span>Pinball<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614543" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614543"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614543">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go down the ramp and take either rail across. Slow down and climb on the brown bolted-on bar on the left side. Position yourself with lots of room, because you need to climb up this wall. This is done by executing a wallride and then immediately jumping to grind the edge at the top and then hopping off before your skater zooms off. The only thing up here is the final plush, which will unlock Constable Richard in the Secret Shop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <p>
It turns out there's more to Microsoft's 40th birthday celebrations for beloved UK studio Rare than just an ugly controller. Xbox has now <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/04/rare-40th-anniversary-rewards-sea-of-thieves/">outlined its full anniversary plans</a>, which include an Evercade cartridge collection, a four-disc vinyl soundtrack, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> bits, and more.
</p>
<p>
These days, Rare is best known for Sea of Thieves, but before that it gave us the wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viva-piata">Viva Piñata</a> among other delights. And fans of a certain age will fondly recall the studio's legendary Nintendo output, which included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> series on SNES, and a stellar run of N64 titles, such as Banjo-Kazooie, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>, Blast Corps, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-force-gemini">Jet Force Gemini</a>, Diddy Kong Racing, Perfect Dark, and Conker's Bad Fur Day. But go back even further, to the days of rubber-keyed Spectrums and tangled tape cassettes, and the studio - then known as Ultimate Play the Game - was already pumping out bangers like Sabre Wolf, Jetpack, Atic Atac, and Knight Lore.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say there's a lot to celebrate as the studio turns 40, and current Rare owner Microsoft has now detailed its birthday plans. Long-time fans will, for instance, have the opportunity to purchase iam8bit's Rare 40th Anniversary Box Set, which features 39 tracks across four-discs. It costs $100 USD (pre-orders <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/rare-40th-anniversary-box-set-4xlp">go live on 7th August</a>) and includes two and a half hours of music, spanning the likes of Sea of Thieves, Viva Piñata, Battletoads, Banjo-Kazooie, Kinect Sports, Perfect Dark, Killer Instinct, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Jet Force Gemini, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Blast Corps, and Kameo: Elements of Power.

<figcaption>Here's a look at that Evercade collection.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWq8EOwLFrk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Microsoft has also <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/cartridges/rare-collection-1/">teamed up with Evercade to release a new cartridge collection</a> featuring twelve "vintage" Rare titles. Specifically, it includes Jetpac, Lunar Jetman, Atic Atac, Sabre Wulf, Underwurlde, Knight Lore, Gunfright, RC Pro-Am, Cobra Triangle, Battletoads, Battletoads Arcade, and Conker's Pocket Tales, with pre-orders going live on 30th September. Elsewhere, Fangamer has a wide-ranging (but disappointingly Viva Piñata-averse) <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/rare">merchandise collection</a>, which runs from t-shirts and vinyl soundtracks to key rings and a King Conker plushie I'm struggling to resist. As for that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-a-rough-year-for-rare-but-at-least-xbox-is-celebrating-its-40th-anniversary-with-a-licensed-controller">previously leaked 8bitdo Rare 40th Anniversary Edition controller</a>, it costs $89.99 USD and still seems to be a US exclusive.
</p>
<p>
And inevitably, Sea of Thieves is also getting in on the birthday action. Starting tomorrow, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can grab the in-game Rare Ruby Emote as a Perk, and a Pirate Emporium sale begins on 6th August, discounting various cosmetics inspired by classic Rare games. There's more happening from 14th August, when the multiplayer pirate adventure's next season, Smugglers' Tide, begins. Players that log in before the end of the month, for instance, get the Rare Ruby Eyepatch; various ruby-themed items will be available to purchase from Outposts, and the Ruby Legend Figurehead can be unlocked as a goal during the next Community Weekend on 30th August. On top of that, there's a 40th Anniversary Sea of Thieves cosmetics bundle coming to digital storefronts when the new season starts, as well as a ruby ship set in the Pirate Emporium and ruby items in the Seasonal Plunder Pass.
</p>

<p>
But if you're in need of more immediate celebrations, Microsoft has just launched new Xbox gamerpics and a dynamic background featuring a "who's-who of Rare characters old and new". Furthermore, Rare fans able to make the pilgrimage to the English town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, can gaze upon a blue heritage plaque, which has been unveiled on the building where Tim and Chris Stamper co-founded the studio in 1985.
</p>
<p>
It's just a shame all this follows a difficult year for Rare, which saw its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">long-in-the-works fantasy game Everwild cancelled</a> in July with some employees facing redundancy amid devastating Xbox restructuring that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">resulted in substantial job cuts across Microsoft's games division</a>. Additionally, Rare veteran Gregg Mayles, who directed the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departed the studio after more than 35 years</a>.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/titan-quest-2-early-access-out-now-2000614459"><em>Titan Quest II</em> snuck up out of nowhere</a> and surprised us all. The sequel to the 2006 classic may have nothing to do with the original developers, nor even the original publishers, but after spending a few hours with the game I’m left in no doubt that it understands the spirit of what it’s trying to recreate. It’s just that this Early Access release isn’t close to optimized, and lacks some incredibly obvious quality-of-life features.</p> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was released midway through the twelve-year gap between&nbsp;<em>Diablo II </em>and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>, and even three years before the release of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight</em>. While hardcore action-RPG players had just been given 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Fate</em>, the market was so very open for a more immediately approachable&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like, and Iron Lore Entertainment’s Greek (and Egyptian) mythology game perfectly fit the bill. It’s super-low-key approach to the genre meant you weren’t worrying about min-maxing your intricate build, but were far more likely to just be methodically click-click-clicking your way through its luscious lands. Not quite an idle game (those were years from being a thing), <em>Titan Quest</em> allowed a nonchalance in its delivery of constant dopamine hits as you incessantly progressed, whether geographically or in the quality of your equipment. And this, from my admittedly brief time so far with <em>Titan Quest II</em>, seems to be entirely understood. In a lot of ways–and ways that leave me optimistic despite my laundry list of complaints–it’s the sequel you would want.</p> <p>Then, on the other hand, the game is causing my GPU to be transformed into a thermo-nuclear bomb, forcing me to turn it off lest I blow up my entire town.</p>

 <p>A lack of optimization is perhaps typical for an Early Access game, but&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>‘s crappy framerates and attempts at arson via my PC feel a bit too much. More frustrating to me are the obvious quality-of-life features that you just expect any game in this genre to already have in place, like, I dunno, being able to rebind controller buttons, or not have to hold down a key to be able to compare inventory items. It’s also not great that trying to use a ladder can see you endlessly spinning on the spot with no choice but to reload.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614551"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614551">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Titan Quest II</em> starts exactly right. The opening of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was so idyllic, such a perfect bucolic setting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-seem-to-be-having-trouble-starting-titan-quest">that I didn’t want to leave it</a>. This sequel 19 years on seems to have fully understood this, and offers something that evokes the very same sense of serenity and safety. You stand atop a cliff, looking out over the gorgeous blue sea on the coast, a ruined building below, a shipwreck to your right, but it’s all so peaceful and pretty. However, you’re quickly urged on by another character to hurry and help, as a gryphon is attacking the nearby town, so off you go.</p> <p>After this, there’s definitely nothing that’ll especially surprise you if you’re familiar with action-RPGs.&nbsp;You left click to move, right click to attack, and enemies and items will drop you new equipment. After some inventory <em>Tetris</em>, you compare what you’ve picked up with what you’ve already got, swap it out, and then find a merchant on whom to dump the rest. And repeat. And that’s enough! That’s the joy of this genre, just enough to keep you distracted, ideally accompanied by a favorite podcast. However, for min-maxxers,&nbsp;<em>TQ2</em> does go the extra mile, with intricate information about your current build, allowing far more in-depth development should that be your thing; for everyone else, you can just make sure numbers go up, and when you gain a new level, add the abilities that sound the most interesting to you.</p>

 <p>Like in the original, there are various Masteries to choose from, although at this point in the sequel’s Early Access they number just four, all familiar. There’s Earth, Lightning, Warfare, and Rogue, and alongside these there’s Core, which lets you boost your main attack in various ways. Then there’s the usual stats to push upward as you go. However, this time out it’s all far more complicated than it should be, with each Mastery filled with a squillion different skills, and each of those skills then upgraded themselves with micro-skills, and given the result is just hitting something harder, or making lightning zap the enemies, it doesn’t need to be anywhere this muddled. The tutorials aren’t great at explaining it all at this point either, although I just sort of guessed and things seemed fine.</p> <p>There are a couple of more significant changes. Firstly, there’s now a dash, which makes for more interesting moments in combat when you’re being targeted by an attack that’s focused on a particular spot on the ground. And perhaps slightly controversially, the game has done away with proper potions, instead having sort of magic ones that refill as a result of your combat. Fight more, and you can heal more. It’s odd. I think I preferred just being able to buy a hundred health potions and not having to think about it. Along with these, there are little details that felt very positive; I was especially pleased with how arrows pierce enemies and can be used to take down groups charging in a line. Or the way a portal spawns nearby where you die, so you don’t have the misery of trudging all the way back to where you fell.</p>

 <p>I was happy! I found ranged attacks far more viable here than they were in the original, which is lovely, and I was happily switching between bow and club depending upon the circumstances, walloping everything and scooping up loot. But, the more I played, the more something felt off. And it’s not just the shitty framerates. But it is also the shitty framerates.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614553"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614553">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s get the tech stuff out of the way, as this aspect is likely to be fixed the most quickly. The game ran for me at around 40FPS, even when I’d lowered the settings from its recommendations, and even running it in a too-small window. Worse, that fluctuated, sometimes 55, sometimes 35, and all that jarring change made it feel clumsy. And remember, this is a fixed-camera isometric RPG. It’s also pretty astonishing that a PC game from a big-name publisher released in 2025 wouldn’t have sensible graphics settings, but <em>TQ2</em>‘s are a mess. I have an ultra-wide monitor, and was only able to choose between 3440×1440 in fullscreen (which I wouldn’t expect to be optimized for just yet) or the deeply obscure 2048×1152 in a window, which is tiny on this screen. There was no option for a bog-standard 2560×1440, which is pretty dreadful, especially since it clearly&nbsp;<em>can</em> run in those higher resolutions. This feels pretty amateurish.</p>

 <p>That leaden feeling to movement, likely caused by framerate issues, is I think the most off-putting aspect at the moment. But there’s more insidious stuff, like the weird way loot drops from all the wrong places. A real joy of <em>Titan Quest</em> is that enemies dropped what they had. If you killed a boar, the best you’d get is a boar hide. But if your enemy was equipped with a shield and axe, there was a strong chance of finding those on the floor after it was dead. But here, I watched the intense silliness of a giant eagle dropping a pair of shoes as it died. I also saw snakes flinging out gloves as they flopped to the ground. I’m not a fully qualified herpetologist, but I’m pretty sure they have little use for gloves. No, it doesn’t <em>matter</em>, but it’s kind of crap.</p> <p>Then there’s just inexplicable choices, like needing to hold down Alt to compare items in your inventory with those that are equipped. There’s no circumstance ever where you don’t want the comparison to pop up, which is why all games like this do it by default (or offer a toggle for the mad people). Here, when you’re trying to sort through your junk to sell to a merchant, you have to tie your fingers in knots holding down Alt to compare, the Shift to sell, and it’s all far more of a fiddle than could possibly be needed. Why no toggle? Who lives like that? Then there’s the inability to rebind controller inputs, and the astonishingly hard boss fights, and maybe most of all, the lack of a sense of place.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614560"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614560">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It says it’s set in ancient Greece, but if that’s true, why are there ruins everywhere? The developers know they didn’t start out that way, right? There’s a lovely intro video which explains how Nemesis is out of control, and the threads of Fate have been corrupted, and someone has to stop her, but then absolutely no sense of how that links to who you are and why you’re there. Everyone else seems to know who you are, but you don’t! You just start off with someone shouting about a gryphon and you just get on with it, but with no grounding. At least in <em>Titan Quest</em>, this blank slate start was understood by your having just arrived on a boat, with NPCs frantically getting you up to date.</p> <p>I dunno. I think I’m perhaps being overly fussy, and will likely get over all of this as soon as I can run the game at a steady framerate and a sensible scale without personally accelerating global climate change. I actually really like a lot about this, and think that with a few patches, it’ll be an Early Access game worth investing in. Sure, more Masteries would be good, but they’ve put in the most popular here, so you’ve plenty to get on with.</p> <p>It’s also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> isn’t&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>, and was never trying to be. This isn’t about rushing through the actual game in order to reach end-game sicko content–it’s about enjoying the journey. And it’s incredibly refreshing to pick up an ARPG that <em>isn’t</em> bloated with live-service faff of the sort that makes games like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> feel so incredibly inaccessible to me. I feel like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em> might be exactly the game I’ve been wanting ever since the last time <em>Torchlight&nbsp;</em>was any good, and it just needs a little bit of work before it can deliver it.</p> <p>For now, you may want to hold off a couple of weeks while it gets its shit together. That it’s only $24 really does make a massive difference, it should be said, and once that sluggish feel is gone, I’ll likely be mainlining the game.</p>

But don’t hold your breath for a reveal: Vincke called on fans to be patient as Larian "need a bit of time to make it all work."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game Baldur’s Gate 3 was a breakout hit in 2023, dominating online conversation and setting sales records. Its wild success was a game-changer for Larian, and it has continued to perform strongly in the two years since launch, with mods helping to fuel seemingly never-ending interest in the RPG, especially on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke told IGN in September 2024 that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-one-year-later-larian-interview"><u>the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 meant Larian was now in a “luxurious position,”</u></a> and could “pick our own destiny and our own path.” The developer shocked the video game world when it announced plans to make brand new games outside the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, rather than follow Baldur’s Gate 3 with DLC or a sequel. It is now hard at work realizing that vision, Vincke said in a tweet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Crazy to think it’s only been two years,” he said. “It’s truly been life changing. Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing. How that will pan out is anyone’s guess but I can assure you we’re working hard to ensure you’ll have plenty of fun. Like really — loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can’t wait to show you. But you’ll need to be patient / we’ll need a bit of time to make it all work. It’ll be worth it though.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Crazy to think it’s only been two years. It’s truly been life changing.

Its release sparked a player surge as fans flocked to test out the new subclasses as well as the brand new photo mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1914637297946931379" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> to say he expected Baldur’s Gate 3 to “continue to do well for quite some time,” not just because of the Patch 8 player boost, but because of “thriving” mod support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on Steam</a> issued today, August 4, Larian said that since the introduction of mod support in September 2024, players have uploaded over 8,500 mods to mod.io and hit 265 million mod downloads ("of which, over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals by the way - we just thought you’d like to know"). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ongoing success in turn gives Larian “room to focus on making our next big thing as good as we can,” Vincke continued. “We’ve got big shoes to fill.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN 10 of 2023</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian is done with Baldur's Gate, but D&amp;D owner Hasbro has teased plans to continue with the series.

                <p>Blizzard's dark fantasy ARPG series Diablo is getting the tabletop RPG treatment, and it promises to have players geared up and ready to hack and slash through armies of demons from "session zero."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/706666020?ref=36816m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> page for Diablo: The Roleplaying Game recently went live, and while the campaign won't officially begin until this fall, it does provide some details on what players can expect from the TTRPG adaptation. The game comes from Glass Cannon, which has made board game versions of plenty of video games in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-is-planned-for-later-this-year/1100-6511682/" data-ref-id="1100-6511682">Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how the TTRPG will try to capture the spirit of the Diablo video games, Glass Cannon name drops a few Diablo classes players will be able to play as, including Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer (the same classes available at launch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>). More importantly, it gives a glimpse of how it is looking to adapt Diablo's fast-and-frenetic ARPG action into a tabletop format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744"></a><figcaption>A look at some of the miniatures included as part of Diablo: The Roleplaying Game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, Glass Cannon promises there won't be "inexperienced and squishy first-level characters." Instead, player characters will begin their adventure "fully equipped as a seasoned hero ready to live the epic-level dream of TTRPGs from session zero." Battles will see players fighting through "endless mobs in fast paced, tactical combat where story, stats, and synergies hold sway." There will additionally be a "push-your-luck" mechanic inspired by the Diablo universe's Eternal Conflict between the forces of heaven and hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo: The Roleplaying Game will sport a 300-page core rulebook that will provide game rules, lore, and artwork. It will be accompanied by a number of one-shot adventures for players to experience from writers like Graham McNeill, known for their work in the Warhammer universe, and MJ Newman of Arkham Horror fame. The game's rules will use a custom d6 dice-pool system and will also come with detailed miniatures, previews of which can be seen on the Kickstarter page.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when in the Diablo timeline the Diablo TTRPG will be set, it looks to take place around the time of Diablo 4, with marketing material showing Lilith and featuring taglines like "be beautiful in sin." The Kickstarter page states that players will be able to "explore Sanctuary's diverse lands and history spanning the entire franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">That's about all the details known so far, but those interested in learning more can sign up to be notified about the Kickstarter campaign's upcoming launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo video game news, various content creators were treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse at Diablo 4's future</a>, even as Blizzard itself states that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/those-hoping-for-major-diablo-4-update-news-may-have-to-keep-waiting/1100-6533522/" data-ref-id="1100-6533522">won't be any major Diablo 4 news</a> ahead of Season 10 in September.

<figure><a title="Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1c019541f4a5/super-mario-bros-40th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Five years ago, Nintendo made an appropriately big thing of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a>' 35th anniversary, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/09/nintendo_announces_super_mario_remasters_and_much_more_in_super_mario_bros_35th_anniversary_direct">a bespoke Direct</a> broadcast featuring a bunch of new games and, naturally, merch celebrating the Famicom release of video gaming's most famous platformer on 13th September 1985.</p>
<p>Half a decade on and the 40th anniversary is just over a month away. With Switch 2 out in the wild and a Mario platformer-shaped gap in Nintendo's announced lineup, it feels natural that there would be similar celebrations planned for this year. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_bros_35">Super Mario Bros. <del>35</del> 40</a>, anyone?</p>
<p>There are some easy gimmes Nintendo could put out — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> updates, a new Lego set, a bunch of swag with 'Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary' plastered all over it — and with DK ably taking on 3D platformer duties in the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>, the need for the brand new 3D Mario game we've all been waiting for since 2017's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a> isn't <em>quite</em> as desperate as it was at the start of the year. But still, the door is wide open for all sorts of plumber-related news.</p>
<p>Realistically, we're a few weeks away from any potential announcements, but let's take a look at what Team NL predicts Nintendo is cooking up for SMB's 40th...</p>
<h2>Super Mario Maker 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Ludicrously Long Title Addendum That's Totally Impractical For Any Normal Person To Say Or Even Remem— (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Maker" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d48df7d5e3761/mario-maker.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's coming up on four decades of SMB, it's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_maker">Super Mario Maker</a>'s 10th anniversary on 10th September. Seeing as it's already a celebration of the series, I've got my money on a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_maker_2">Mario Maker 2</a>, which adds in a Wonder theme and some Mouse Mode controls.</p>
<p>Sticking to anniversary-related releases (hey, where would games media be without a good old 'It's now been longer since X than it was between Y and Z', huh?), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi's Island</a> turns 30 on 5th August. Now, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/soapbox_25_years_on_i_still_cant_get_into_yoshis_island">I've never been a big fan</a> — beyond the stellar art — due to wailing baby anxiety, but can you imagine what a 4K sequel could look like?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know there have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshis_island_ds">Island</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/yoshis_new_island">sequels</a> already, but let's not talk about those. I'm thinking something more along the lines of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">Link Between Worlds</a> to the original's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">Link to the Past</a>, not a wet fart to Yoshi's Island's...</p>
<p>Hmm, I've gotten myself in trouble with an analogy and a game I don't even like very much, Alana. Hilfe, bitte...</p>
<h2>Weird Mario, please (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="DDR: Mario Mix" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e555c6997d524/ddr-mario-mix.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hooo boy, I'm going to forgo all of the obvious things here; yes, it's time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_golf">Mario Golf</a>. Yes, it's time for a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_super_sluggers">Mario Sluggers</a>. But where the heck is a new version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/dance_dance_revolution_mario_mix">Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix</a>???</p>
<p>Okay, I'm not the target audience for a new DDR Mario game, but this gets to the core I want from Mario going forward — more <em>weird</em> Mario. The <strong>Mario RPG</strong>s and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> have been carrying the torch over the past few years, and with Nintendo's improved animations, I think it's time we got some of those unusual spin-offs on Nintendo Switch Online. Or a new game.</p>
<p>Realistically, we'll get a <strong>Mario Movie 2</strong> teaser, a 3D Mario tease... maybe a new Nintendo Switch 2 design? Let's be reasonable, folks!</p>

<h2>Space, Jam (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario 3-on-3 Hoops" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b64dcb8587cf/mario-3-on-3-hoops.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can keep your Golf, Sluggers, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_strikers_battle_league">Strikers</a>, and Olympic Game crossovers; there's only one sporting event that I want to see back in action come September, and that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/mario_hoops_3_on_3">Mario Hoops 3 on 3</a>.</p>
<p>I mean, come on. Basketball seems to be bigger around the world today than ever before, and the death of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nba_jam">NBA Jam</a> has left an arcade baller-shaped hole in all of our hearts. Give me a full-blown Mario Hoops revival, complete with high-flying dunks and silky smooth performance, and you've got yourself a winner.</p>
<p>If that's off the table, however, it seems only right that we get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> on Switch 2 in <em>some form</em>. At this point, I honestly don't care if it's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">3D All-Stars</a> update or the announcement of a catchily-titled 'Super Mario 3D All-Stars + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition'. I'll do whatever it takes to play it on modern hardware.</p>

<h2>99 Marios and 1 Yoshi in a thong (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi's New Island" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/762268c5260f4/yoshis-new-island.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I reckon the smart money is on a remaster or upgrade of some sort for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario Wonder</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy</a> games, or hey, I'd even take a full remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> with fancy new Switch 2 controls and gimmicks. Shouting "Pump it!" into the mic for paint to come out of your gun or something. I'll let the boffins figure out the fine details.</p>
<p>However, seeing as there's been so little fanfare thus far, maybe it's gonna be something totally different, something small-scale. Or maybe we'll get a brand new game, a whole new-ass Mario stealthing onto the scene, they could even call it New-Ass Mario, they can have that for free.</p>
<p>If I had my choice, I'd like to see where Nintendo would go with some sort of Mario 99 game, something challenging and unique. You know, jumping along a route and when you fall, you're out. Or, since we've just had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> drop on NSO, maybe they're testing the waters for a brand new version of that. I'd also like to see Mario Beach Volleyball. Come on, Nintendo, you know you want to put Yoshi in bikini bottoms.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Those are a few of our hopes, but what do you think Nintendo might roll out as Super Mario Bros. enters its fifth decade? Does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario Land 3D</a> get a Deluxe port? Do we get a 1:1 of 1-1 in Lego form? Is it time for Mario's Broadway debut as we discover Miyamoto's been on a Gilbert and Sullivan binge?</em> <em>Let us know below.</em></p>
