			<p>The Decima Engine, the game engine developed by Guerrilla Games that powers the Horizon series as well as the original Death Stranding and its upcoming sequel, could be used by other PlayStation Studios titles in the future, according to some recent findings.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/playstation-studios-embrace-decima-engine-guerrilla-expands-dev-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twisted Voxel</a>, Guerrilla Games Senior Producer Astrid Huntjens is listing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/astridhuntjens/?originalSubdomain=nl">LinkedIn</a> among experiences at the studio, the management of communication and relations with other Sony studios interested in or using the Decima Engine, essentially confirming how Guerrilla has already expanded the support it can provide to other studios.</p>
<p>At the time, it is unknown which other games could be using the Horizon series Decima Engine, but there's a good chance Bend Studio's unannounced next project could be among them. On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-seymour-019b0b93/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn,</a> former Senior Game Designer at Bend Studio Mathew Seymour, who was involved in the development of the unannounced game until their departure from the studio last year, mentioned the Decime Engine among the tools used for the project, strongly suggesting that it will indeed use Guerrilla's game engine.</p>
<p>The aforementioned Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be the next game using the Horizon series Decima Engine, and although we haven't seen much of the game in action so far, there's no denying that what we have seen looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/">extremely impressive</a>. The latest iteration of the engine can also be seen in action in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered,</a> which launched a few months back on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

Yet, through some strange coincidence, engineer Hanzo happens upon the struggling Kiba and pulls him back from the brink of death.</p><p>Through a series of modifications and reinforcements, Kiba gains even more strength.

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Destiny 2: The Final Shape</h2>



<p>Developer: Bungie | Release Date: June 4th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Bungie's Light and Darkness saga concluded this year with<em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. This finale managed to end their space opera tale and deliver the most robust expansion ever to the game.</p>

<p>The Pale Heart location is a stellar showcase of Bungie's impeccable art direction, presenting familiar locations twisted into grotesque corrupted shapes. The story campaign managed a strong blend of pitched gunbattles, haunting imagery, and powerful character moments.</p>

<p>Its fundamental game design reached a zenith with the introduction of Prismatic subclasses and its most challenging Raid to date, Salvation's Edge.</p>

<p><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shap</em>e reminded the world of Bungie's talent and dedication. For an entire generation, this expansion will be what they remember when they imagine what this studio is capable of.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Alan Wake II: The Lake House</h2>



<p>Developer: Remedy Entertainment | Release Date: October 22nd, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>While light on runtime, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> continues the atmosphere and overarching themes of the original game. Blending the reality-bending surreality of a world at the whims of Alan's creative process with the sterile procedural office culture of the Federal Bureau of Control.</p>

<p>The level design also manages a similar mix, combining the key-hunting navigation of <em>Control </em>with the meticulous dangerous monster encounters of <em>Alan Wake 2</em>. This is punctuated perfectly with the introduction of the new painted enemies.</p>

<p>In two short hours, <em>Alan Wake 2: The Lake House</em> expands the possibilities of the Remedy Connected Universe and alludes to the nightmares and thrills that we may see in the next title</p>

<h2>Winner - Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<p>Developer: FromSoftware | Release Date: June 21st, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Joseph Allen</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is longer, more involved, and more rewarding than many full-length games.</p>

<p>Given the huge success of the base game, director Hidetaka Miyazaki and his studio FromSoftware could have just indulged in a victory lap, but that’s never been their style, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is arguably even more ambitious than the foundations upon which it’s built.</p>

<p>This expansion packs in some of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s most beautiful (and horrifying) sights, from ruined, flooded castle courtyards to caves embedded with giant coffins and gorgeous fields full of delicate blue flowers in bloom.</p>

<p>The story you’ll discover as you explore those locations is characteristically obscure, but Miyazaki and company know that if you’re invested in <em>Elden Ring</em> enough to reach the point you need to in order to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, you’re in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>It’s that attitude that also allows FromSoftware to craft some of the most involved, satisfying, and occasionally maddening bosses they’ve ever put forth in one of their signature Soulslike action RPGs.</p>

<p>It’s best to know as little as possible about <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s gauntlet of boss encounters before playing, so if you’ve yet to experience this near-masterpiece, I won’t go into detail. Suffice it to say that if, for some reason, you thought <em>Elden Ring</em> went too easy on you, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will give you the run for your money you want.</p>

<p>Like all of FromSoftware’s work, it’s not perfect, but <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> cements the studio’s legacy as an art-driven collective looking to engage and inspire you with its work rather than simply to help you kill time.</p>

It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So the game isn't totally dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it's unclear what will happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortune's Run launched in early access form on Steam in September 2023 and met with a "very positive" user review rating. Its blend of quick-fire first-person shooter elements with immersive sim mechanics inspired by the likes of Deus Ex and Thief caught the attention of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amid-a-legendary-autumn-for-pc-gaming-a-team-of-three-developers-quietly-released-one-of-the-best-shooters-you-can-play-right-now-into-early-access/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, which called Fortune's Run "one of the best shooters you can play right now." Dizzie was one of just two developers working on the game, the other being her wife, Arachne, although she recently left the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dizzie refused to reveal the exact nature of the sentence or the charges, but insisted she did not commit “a sex crime.” “What I did was wrong and that's all you need to know,” Dizzie added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dizzie also told Fortune’s Run fans that the case dates from “before I met the other dev,” which is a reference to Arachne. “She is not related to it in any way,” Dizzie added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears to be the case that Arachne left the project following a significant surgery last summer. “Like I said, the other dev was recovering from a botched surgery,” Dizzie said. “If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other developer has left the project,” Dizzie’s message continued. “Once she recovered, she decided that she was no longer interested in game development. She was in charge of [quality assurance] and a few level segments, all of which [have] been abandoned and I've been forced to get by on my own for the past while. It's been very difficult to do alone but I actually managed, by basically not sleeping, to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, the prison sentence puts an end to Fortune’s Run development, although Dizzie insisted it will begin again upon release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since we [Dizzie and Arachne] decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released,” Dizzie said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do. These wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want to underline that I'm no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold okay, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there's a chance that if you wait a few years I'll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there's not very much content left to work on; I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen. I'm going to do my best, because I love this game and I want to finish it. Seriously, I just want to finish it. Finish it already, Dizzie!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a separate post on Steam</a>, Dizzie published patch notes for a new Fortune’s Run update and mentioned an upcoming post that will detail work set to take place next month before her prison sentence begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It turns out that Batman had planned for Harley Quinn and the gang to murder their doppelgangers all along, as while the Suicide Squad was causing chaos in Metropolis, the Dark Knight was working in the shadows to sabotage Brainiac and his multiversal counterparts.</p><p>Basically, every Justice League member is just fine--except for Wonder Woman--and with Brainiac stopped, the team is focused on saving Metropolis and the other dimensions that fell to Brainiac. As for the Suicide Squad? Thanks to their allies Hack, Lawless, and Toyman, the gang has embarked on a road trip across the Elseworlds multiverse, leaving the Arkhamverse behind. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-spoiler-not-going-over-well-with-dc-fans/1100-6520732/">Batman's controversial death</a> has been erased and the ambitious Brainiac saga has been wrapped up, closing the curtain on the game.</p><p>Released in February 2024, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-warner-bros-discovery-says/1100-6521318/">didn't live up to Warner Bros.

In comparison, NetEase's free-to-play Marvel Rivals has done very well so far, as it currently has a high number of players regularly engaged in the Overwatch-like game.</p><p>As for the future of games based on DC Comics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-games-wants-to-give-other-studios-a-chance-on-its-franchises/1100-6525635/">last year Warner Bros.

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo. However, Retro Studios is not the team behind the upcoming remaster, with porting duties instead being handled by Forever Entertainment.</p>
<p>In the new game's credits, Forever Entertainment is front and centre, however Nintendo has omitted the original development team from the credits. Instead, the credits simply state the HD remaster was "based on the work of the original development staff", as you can see in the images below (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/retro-staff-credits-removed-from-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-forever-entertainment-confirmed-as-devs">Nintendo Life</a>).</p>

<p>This is not the first time an original game's staff have been left out of the credits by Nintendo.

<p>Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-rpg">Super Mario RPG</a>.</p>

            <p>Retro immersive-sim Fortune's Run has had its early access development paused due to its sole developer being sentenced to prison.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie explained why the game's other developer left the project and admitted to being sentenced to three years in prison, meaning development is "imploding".</p>
<p>Dizzie doesn't explain the nature of the crime, though the developer "lived a very different life" prior to working on this project. The post does specify, though, that the crime was not sexual in nature and the other developer was not involved.</p>

<p>"I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years," wrote Dizzie. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this.</p><p>"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life."</p>
<p>The developer said the game "isn't totally dead" but "it's unclear what will happen".</p>
<p>And without the other developer, development on Fortune's Run will be "completely interrupted" until Dizzie is released. She left the project after recovering from a botched surgery, Dizzie explained. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post continues: "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p>Due to game sales, Dizzie will be able to afford rent once released, so there's a chance the game could be completed. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post comes alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320">new major update</a> to Fortune's Run as part of its early access.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-founding-family-and-tencent-are-considering-a-new-venture-using-some-of-ubisofts-assets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Guillemot family and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are considering starting a new venture using some of the Ubisoft assets, according to a new report.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the two parties are evaluating which assets to include in this new venture and their valuation. If it goes through, this deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in this venture, gain more control of some of Ubisoft's properties, and boost its presence in the video games market outside China considerably. The Guillemot family, on the other hand, would be able to retain control of Ubisoft.</p>
<p>As these deliberations are private, neither Tencent nor Ubisoft have confirmed if the possibility of a new venture is real. A representative for the Chinese company declined to comment on the matter, while a Ubisoft representative only referred to the recent appointment of advisors to review and pursue various options to boost the company's value. As these talks seem to be ongoing, nothing has been decided yet, and it's likely nothing will be decided until some time after the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was recently delayed once again.</p>
<p>Given how much seems to be riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows' success, it was not surprising to learn last week that the game was delayed to<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> March 20th</a>. Being the most ambitious entry in the series to date, Ubisoft co-founder Yves Guillemot said an additional month of development time will allow the involved studios to incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months, fully deliver on the game's potential, and finish the year on a strong note.</p>

Reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping £18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to £30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million).

Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from?

            <p>
The current sole creator of immersive sim-shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortunes-run">Fortune's Run</a> has abruptly announced that the project will be going on hiatus, because they are going to jail. Team Fortune's lead developer, Dizzie, has been handed a three year sentence for a "violent crime", following around five years of legal proceedings. The other developer, Arachne, recently left game development after recovering from a mishandled surgical procedure last year. According to Dizzie, her departure doesn't have anything to do with the aforesaid violent crime, which pre-dates their relationship.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The news comes in the form of a developer Steam post that accompanies what may prove to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320?l=english">the final Fortune's Run update</a>. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well," Dizzie writes. "My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this. 
</p>
<p>
"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn't going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that." The post doesn't specify the violent crime, beyond qualifying that it wasn't sexual in nature. 
</p>
<p>
As for Arachne's departure, Dizzie adds that "my case dates from before I met the other dev" and that "she is not related to it in any way". For context, Dizzie <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/4234028300480496465">blogged about Arachne's hospitalisation in July last year</a>. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," today's Steam post adds.
</p><p>
Arachne had been in charge of Fortune Run's QA and "a few level segments". Following her surgical procedure, Dizzie has been working on the game solo, trying to finish as much as possible before beginning their period of incarceration (it's not clear when, exactly, the sentence was given). "It's been very difficult to do alone but I actually managed, by basically not sleeping, to complete all of the work in time so that it could be released before I'm sent away," the post adds.
</p>
<p>
"Since [Arachne and I] decided to part ways, development will be completely interrupted until I'm released," it continues. "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time." 
</p>
<p>
Existing sales of Fortune's Run have been strong enough that Dizzie should be able to afford rent after they're released from prison, and there's "a chance" they'll be able to resume development of Fortune's Run. "In fact, there's not very much content left to work on, I've been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time," the post continues. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen."

            <p>An attorney for Nintendo has discussed the company's stance on emulation and what it considers to be illegal, according to Japanese law.</p>
<p>Koji Nishiura, patent attorney and deputy general manager of Nintendo's intellectual property department, spoke on behalf of the company at a joint lecture on "The Importance of Intellectual Property Rights in the Game Industry", which was hosted by Japan's Association of Copyright for Computer Software at the Tokyo eSports Festa 2025 (<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2">Denfaminicogamer</a>, via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"To begin with, are emulators illegal or not?" posed Nishiura. "This is a point often debated. While you can't immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it's used."</p>

<p>One example of illegal use is if an emulator copies a programme belonging to the game device it's imitating, which would be copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Another is if an emulator can disable security mechanisms like encryption (or "technical protection measures", as they're legally known), which would violate Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act. Nishiura added that outside of Japan this would be stipulated in copyright law.</p>
<p>Nishiura specified this point is why Nintendo has filed lawsuits and issued warnings over several Switch emulators, due to disabling Nintendo's "technical protection measures".</p>
<p>A further violation would be if an emulator contains links to sources to download pirated games, what's known as a "reach app" in Japanese law and is considered a copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Nishiura also emphasised the use of emulators is a problem for all developers making software for Nintendo devices, which is why the company is strengthening measures against such illegal tools.</p>
<p>Just last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-switch-emulator-creator-for-facilitating-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale">Nintendo sued the creators of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> as it claimed over a million copies of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> were pirated ahead of release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Yuzu was then shut down</a> by its developers Tropical Haze and agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m.</p><p>Also last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-emulator-pizza-emulators-pulls-its-apps-from-google-play-store">Game Boy emulator Pizza Emulators</a> was pulled from the Google Play store, though there was no mention of a Nintendo settlement. A month later, another Nintendo emulator - the Delta app - was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-game-emulator-currently-top-free-download-on-iphone-app-store">top free download on the iPhone App Store</a> and it remains available today.</p>
<p>In further Nintendo news, the company has also requested players not use "unauthorised services" to access online services. Posted the <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1879332711451795501">Japanese Nintendo account</a>: "We have confirmed the existence of unauthorised services that replace functions such as online play for the Wii U, which ended service on April 9, 2024. Please refrain from using such services as they may pose unexpected security risks."</p>
<p>After Nintendo shut down Wii U and 3DS online servers last April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-day-after-nintendos-wii-u-server-shutdown-fans-are-using-an-unofficial-trick-to-play-multiplayer-online">players brought the functionality back online just a day later</a> thanks to fan collective Pretendo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-tiktok-be-banned-in-the-us-and-when-will-it-happen-answered.1082667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-tiktok-be-banned-us-and-when/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>TikTok is in a precious position at present. It sits on a precipice, with the United States government attempting to shut down the application’s operations in the country. It would be a monumental blow to the application owner, ByteDance, and it all stems from the organisation being headquartered in Beijing, China.</p>



<p>Will TikTok be banned in the US? In the middle of January, the Supreme Court will determine whether the application will receive a blanket ban in the nation, but many things can happen before then to prevent that.</p>



<p>Find out in this guide if TikTok will be banned and when that might happen, plus learn about some alternatives.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-tiktok-getting-banned-in-the-us">Is TikTok Getting Banned in the US?</h2>



<p>The United States Supreme Court is attempting to ban TikTok <strong>unless </strong>the platform breaks away from Chinese ownership. By way of a resolution, an American company or entity could purchase a portion of the platform to run it from the United States, which would keep everything running as normal.</p>



<p>A few months back, the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">Bobby Kotick were rumoured</a> to be interested in purchasing the site, and recently, MrBeast’s name came up in the discussion. It could even be someone like Elon Musk who might save TikTok from being banned in the US.</p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/president-joe-biden-signs-bill-to-ban-tiktok-in-united-states/">Joe Biden signed a bill</a> that would see TikTok banned in January 2025 if it wasn’t divested away from the Chinese owners.</p>



<p><strong>The due date for the final decision (and ultimate action) is January 19. If nobody secures TikTok’s US operations by then, the application will be banned nationwide. As nobody has stepped forward to claim or save TikTok just yet, it looks like the ban will go ahead.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-happens-if-tiktok-is-banned">What Happens if TikTok is Banned?</h2>



<p>Most likely, the Supreme Court will order app store operators such as Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their storefronts, making it near-impossible to download the application on devices.</p>



<p>Also, internet service providers will be required to place blocks on the desktop version of the site, further restricting access. This could also apply to cellphone network carriers.</p>



<p>If you’re using a VPN, you may be able to still access TikTok. A VPN allows you to ‘spoof’ your location, making it seem as though you’re in another country or region, which is the most effective way to bypass geoblocking measures.</p>



<p>Ultimately, if TikTok is ‘hard banned’ in the United States, many content creators who rely on the app for a revenue stream will be massively impacted.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-donald-trump-save-tiktok">Will Donald Trump Save TikTok?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Donald Trump was hellbent on shutting down TikTok, but as underwent his political campaign for election into the presidency in 2024, he doubled back on that decision. </p>



<p>It became a belief that Donald Trump would halt the US TikTok ban, which he has the power to do once he has entered office. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, he will be sworn in as the United States President on January 20, one day <strong>after </strong>the ban takes place. He could retroactively make a change, but he can’t stop it from going ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-tiktok-alternatives">What Are The Best TikTok Alternatives?</h2>



<p>If you want an alternative to TikTok in case the application is banned in the US, you’re in luck.</p>



<p>Many people rely on Instagram Reels as an alternative to TikTok, or Facebook, which also supports a ‘shorts’ ecosystem. One of the best alternatives to TikTok is YouTube, which has a strong shorts platform that many creators use to earn a fair bit of money.</p>



<p>In recent months, YouTube has been slipping back a little on live streaming and prioritising short- and long-form content, so there’s a strong argument there for moving from TikTok to YouTube.</p>



<p>Other sites, such as Lemon8 and RedNote, could also face legislative action, given that they’re owned by Chinese organisations. Lemon8 is owned by ByteDance, the parent company sitting over TikTok, so that’s not the best step if you’re looking for a TikTok alternative.</p>



<p>To put it finely, 170 million American users could be set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiktok-ban-united-states-closer/">lose access to TikTok this month</a>, so be prepared. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s ‘BTR Driver Storyline’ is Now Available]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-btr-driver-storyline-unlocked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98btr-driver-storyline%E2%80%99-is-now-available.1082661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-btr-driver-storyline-unlocked/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has announced the arrival of the ‘BTR Driver’ storyline in Escape from Tarkov. This snapshot mission chain will allow users to learn more about the BTR driver, who is present on several of the game’s maps, including Streets of Tarkov and Woods.</p>



<p>This news comes amid a slump for the game exacerbated by an increasing number of cheaters and technical issues. That fact alone has prompted some users to slam Battlestate for focusing on ‘things that don’t matter’ to the average player.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-driver">Enter The Driver</h2>



<p>On social media, the Escape from Tarkov team posted an update explaining when, where, and how you can access the BTR Driver storyline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>BTR driver storyline is now available in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li>The chain starts at Mechanic with the task “A Helping Hand” at character level 20</li>



<li>Completing the chain earns the new achievement and unique rewards such as barters for new items and weapons, customization items, and more</li>



<li>The task chain will be permanent.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been more than a year since the BTR mechanic was added to Escape from Tarkov, and for most players, it goes by relatively unnoticed. When it was introduced, it was buggy as all hell, gunning down PMCs with reckless abandon for no reason whatsoever.</p>



<p>It has a few neat functions, such as banking found loot, using it as a taxi service, and providing cover fire to PMCs willing to stump up the cash, but for the bulk of users, it’s just a thing that drives around the map on loop.</p>



<p>Admittedly, it’s nice to get a bit more content in Escape from Tarkov, but I’ll mirror what some users are saying – perhaps BSG’s efforts would be better spent fixing what exists rather than adding more to the game.</p>



<p>Have you ever used Escape from Tarkov’s BTR, or could you not care less about the thing? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-state-looks-fantastic-in-this-4k-gameplay-from-ces-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Turkish independent developer Motion Blur immediately caught our attention when they first <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed off</a> their upcoming Black State project last Summer. The third-person shooter puts a lot of emphasis on stealth and seems clearly inspired by KONAMI's legendary series Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>Black State was demonstrated once again at the recent CES 2025 in Las Vegas, where IGN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeHqPHRAWR0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grabbed</a> around three and a half minutes of new footage in 4K resolution, and it looks glorious. The level of photorealism is incredible, especially for an indie studio. The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but interestingly, it won't leverage the built-in Lume and Nanite features as nearly all UE5 games do. Motion Blur has instead developed a 'special pipeline after a long R&amp;D process', which they promise will provide outstanding visuals and unbelievable optimization.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black State | CES 2025 4K Alpha Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XeHqPHRAWR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Black State is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as one of the games that will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which will allow for optimal performance on the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>
<p>In the game, the main character is summoned by a secret group of scientists called the Architects for a mysterious mission to save captives and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event. Players will be able to seamlessly move between levels without any loading screens. Motion Blur said these real-time transitions lead to different adventures, ensuring players never know which door opens to where, adding an element of thrill and danger.</p>
<p>Players will have a vast array of weapons and tactical gadgets at their disposal to succeed in a series of intense combat scenarios and stealth sequences, including guns (pistols, rifles, shotguns) and unique explosive devices. Just like in Metal Gear Solid, there will be close-quarter combat as well, with over a hundred cinematic kill moves implemented in the game. Players must be very careful, though, as they will face both elite human tactical forces and relentless robot-like killing machines. To top it all, Black State also includes several boss battles featuring unique patterns and mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>Black State doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll be sure to let you know when it does.</p>

            <p>There are currently 35 heroes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, split between the roles of Vanguard (tanks), Duellists (DPS) and Strategists (support). That's plenty to get your head around, and the roster is expanding rapidly. NetEase have announced that they plan to introduce a new hero approximately every six weeks - in other words, twice per three-month season. I wonder how long it'll take them to probe beyond the obvious Marvel headliners and start seriously abrading the bottom of the Connected Universe barrel. <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Nagneto_(Earth-14094)">Nagneto</a>, for example. Or how about J. Pennington Pennypacker, who shoots coins out of his wrists?</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from an interview with the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, in which game director Guangyun Chen spills the beans on questions of hero design. "Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," he said. "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero."</p>
<p>The just-launched Marvel Rivals Season 1 is seemingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-patch-makes-hulk-less-hulky-hawkeye-less-shooty-and-the-goddess-of-death-deader-just-in-time-for-season-1">juicier than the norm</a>. It introduces several new heroes in the shape of the Fantastic Four, together with three new maps, a Doom Match game mode and some special events.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview with Metro, Chen expounds upon the game's competitive design. One detail that catches my eye is NetEase's decision not to enforce a role lock, which would ensure an even spread of Vanguards, Duellists and Strategists per team, but might also scare off the antisocial people who just want to play DPS. You know who you are.</p><p>"Yeah, so we totally get that the community is discussing role lock and role queue," said Chen, when asked whether NetEase would consider changing their stance here. "At its core, it's really about the game balance. So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p>
<p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Strong early days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> vibes here. I for one look forward to the spectacle of six Pennypackers kicking Iron Man's face in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You know when you drop your nice, shiny pen and it rolls under your bed, and you look under there and see it winking from the depths of a stygian expanse of superannuated dust bunnies, lakes of mildew and anomalous debris that absorbs far too much light? Just me? I need to get out the mould spray more often.
</p>
<p>
OK, how about when you were a kid and you lifted up a nice, round stone and the damp, fertile soil beneath writhed away from you in a fervent knotting of pellucid, boneless bodies and the tickling of a thousand little legs? Right. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a> is that and also, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game about drilling for oil. The recently released <a href="https://abylight-studios.itch.io/anoxia-station">Itch.io demo</a> is rough around the edges, but I do adore the vibe.

In Anoxia Station you lead a huge, mobile rig into the depths of a dying world. In each chapter, you'll deploy your rig so that you can build resource-generating structures such as refineries and convertors, search for pools of petroleum on your radar, then either relocate to the area or expand in that direction. 
</p><p>
You'll also have to worry about keeping your workforce alive, happy and non-mutinous. This is difficult, because there is a lot down here that can either kill you or severely bum you out: heat, suffocation, radiation, earthquakes, marauding fungus, acts of human treachery, oh, and the insects. You'll definitely want to avoid the insects.</p>
<p>Right now, my proud rig the HMS Dork Fortress is nestling close to a clutch of eggs the size of sperm whales. I do not know what lurks in the eggs and I do not wish to find out. If anybody from my crew asks about them I will say that they are just really sticky rocks. I am also going to build a watchtower pronto, so that I can equip my crew with grenades.
</p>
<p>
Each semi-randomised tile-based level is a mass of unholy 2D art, viewed from a cramped, angled perspective. Buildings form shadowy huddles of pipes, windows and turbines, their fittings blurred by hanging mist and the insidious, queasy wobbling of the camera. The soundscape consists of machine tones, tectonic rumbles, and unidentifiable organic noises. Building anything here feels like a presumption, like you're inviting the darkness to take an interest.
</p>
<p>
Again, I adore the vibe. I'm less keen on the interface being made up of very small icons and text. It can be hard to find the necessaries, even given tutorial hints, and that's bothersome because each turn is on a timer. You can pause using F11, but you can't queue up orders while time is suspended. I'll probably acclimatise to the fiddly presentation, but it's going to be a pain if I have to manage any especially elaborate drilling operations. Right now, I'm only worrying about the tiles around my rig. Especially the one with the sticky rocks.

According to developer Yakov Butuzoff, Anoxia Station takes particular inspiration from Into The Breach, Polytopia, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>. They've written <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2924310/view/546723866324501263?l=english">a little Steam blog about the core mechanics</a>, putting an emphasis on random map generation and unpredictability: apparently, one of the key objectives is "to make sure something crazy happens every turn". The full game is out... at some point.

            <p>Rocksteady has released the final piece of content for its beleaguered live-service game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>.</p>
<p>Back in December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">studio confirmed the fourth season would be the game's last</a>, and now its final chapter has been released. Season four, chapter eight went live last night, and in the process wrapped up the story of Harley Quinn and her fellow band of misfits as they sought to stop the conniving Brainiac from causing mishap here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p>It also gave players clarification on exactly what was going on with DC's heroes, such as Batman. <strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League season four, episode eight below</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The final chapter of the game closes with a 2D animated cinematic narrated by Harley Quinn, revealing that - shocker - those members of the Justice League that were popped off earlier in the game were in fact clones. So yes, the actual Batman is still alive and well. In fact, it is the caped crusader who delivers that final blow to Brainiac. The mini bombs that were implanted in the Suicide Squad's heads at the start of the game are then disabled, and Brainiac gets delivered to Waller.</p>
<p>However, many players are, alas, pretty disappointed by how the ending of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ultimately played out.</p>
<p>"What was the point of the game if they are all alive," reads one comment on a video showcasing the final scenes. Another added: "Because of some small clues, the Justice League not actually being dead was teased since the launch of the game. However this still feels cheap as hell."</p><p>Some are more forgiving than others, though. "Honestly that's all I care about is seeing (Batman Alive)," one wrote. Another reasoned given some of the backlash Rocksteady faced early on in the game's life, bringing the Justice League back from the supposed dead was a good move.</p>

<p>While it won't be receiving any new content from here on, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will still remain playable in both online and the recently released offline mode, Rocksteady has said.</p>
<p>"All online features will continue to be available after Season 4, so players will still be able to enjoy co-op with friends, as well as all previous seasonal/episodic content. An offline mode will also be available as part of the Season 4 update, giving players the option to experience the main campaign and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection," reads the season's <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">FAQ page</a>. The developer added any remaining LutherCoin will "continue to be available after Season 4", while also confirming the in-game store will also continue to function.</p>

<p>Soon after release, Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A report then followed, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>

            <p>NetEase has confirmed Marvel Rivals will receive a new hero every month and a half, but won't be adding enforced roles.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen was asked about the cadence of heroes joining the game.</p>
<p>"Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," said Chen. "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community."</p>

<p>Chen also discussed why the team has not included enforced role lock - setting a limit on what class types can be in a team, for a balanced spread of healers, tanks, attackers - which is something the community wishes to change.</p>
<p>It appears the team won't be altering this, but will instead provide new possibilities with the team-up mechanic.</p>
<p>"At its core, it's really about the game balance," said Chen. "So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p><p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Game balance will also continue to be scrutinised. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">Season One has brought a number of balance changes</a> to nerf some of the most popular characters, as NetEase has released a Hero Hot List to show the most frequently chosen heroes.</p>
<p>"After the launch, we've been keeping a close eye on the game's environment and balance," said Chen. "Moving forward, we will be looking at hero pick rates and win rates in different scenarios. Once we have some more detailed analysis and through thoughtful consideration, we'll definitely make necessary balances and adjustments.</p>
<p>"It's all about creating a good experience for our players. It hasn't been that long since our launch, so we're going to continue to monitor everything and make sure everything feels right."</p>
<p>The hero shooter's first season also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-update-kills-mods-removing-cheats-skins-and-19-inches-of-venom">briefly put an end to mods on PC</a>, to prevent custom skins, FPS boosts and potential cheats. However, modders quickly found a way to use them once again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-3-doom-the-dark-ages.1082628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-3-doom-the-dark-ages/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Where to next for the Doom Slayer? Having battled against wave after wave of demonic invasion and delved through Hell to defeat even the Dark Lord himself by the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>, there’s really only one place to go: back to the start. It’s time for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Doom: The Dark Ages might be a Bethesda game (and by that virtue a Microsoft and Xbox game), but it’s also a sign of the times within that company that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-with-a-gory-trailer-and-its-coming-to-ps5/">it is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Xbox Series X|S and PC</a>. Of course, it’s also going to be day one in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> as well.</p>
<p>We’re due a fresh look at the game next week as part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">the 2025 Xbox Developer Direct stream</a>, but for now, here’s the announcement trailer from last year:</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Yup, this game is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>

<p>You’ll be just as powerful as in the last couple of Doom games, but the weaponry in your hand will be just a little bit different. Now you couldn’t do without a Super Shotgun, even if you’re this far back in time, but alongside that you’ll be able to whip out a Flail to knock some heads in, or rev up a throwable chainsaw shield, like it’s some kind of Captain America –&nbsp;Warhammer 40,000 crossover.</p>

<p>And lets add the Power Rangers into that mix as well? The Slayer will also be able to hop into the cockpit of his Atlan, a huge skyscaper-sized mech that will let you go toe-to-toe with kaiju-sized demons, and there’s also the Mecha Dragon complete with jet engines and a huge amount of weaponry for when you need to take to the skies.</p>
<p>I’m sure that id Software will be able to claim medieval mythology for these additions, with tales and Arthurian legends of dragon slaying and giants, but it’s given an over-the-top twist here.</p>

<p>On intriguing facet will be the direction that the latest iteration of idTech will take. After making various compromises through Doom 3, Quake 4 and Rage to meet the platforms of the day, while pioneering various ingenious graphical techniques through the end of John Carmack’s tenure at the studio, 2016’s Doom was a bit of a reset with the arrival of Tiago Sousa to lead development of the renderer –&nbsp;he had previously worked on CryEngine. While still looking fantastic, Doom really put performance first with 60fps achieved on PS4 and Xbox One to enable the ultra-slick FPS action.</p>
<p>But we’re now in an era of ray tracing, an especially costly technology in terms of performance that often relies on machine learning to upscale and enhance lower resolutions and fidelity. Doom Eternal was able to feed ray-tracing effects like flashy RT reflections when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/29/doom-eternal-free-ps5-upgrade-how-to-guide-xbox-series-xs-smart-delivery-update/">upgraded with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S support</a>, while MachineGames have just released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> with a customised version of idTech (branded Motor) that puts more focus on RT global illumination for consoles, but offers full path-tracing on PC. Which direction will Doom: The Dark Ages take? Well from the initial trailer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-doom-the-dark-ages-trailer-tech-analysis">ray-tracing is subtle at best in what it showed</a>, with a greater emphasis on ramping up volumetric effects and fine detail, but we’d trust id Software to strike the right balance between performance and visuals.</p>
<p>Not that you’ll really have a moment to take in those fine details when sprinting around and blasting enemies. We can’t wait!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-was-originally-going-to-have-much-more-gore-says-ex-employee/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you were hoping to find more gore when playing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield</a>, it might be interesting to know that the game was originally going to feature much more of that. The systems were in place, at least, according to former Bethesda Game Studios Character Artist Dennis Mejillones. In an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the YouTube channel KIWI TALKZ</a>, he explained the motive behind the cut was two-fold: technical and thematic.</p>
<p><em>The level of gore has a lot of implications with the different suits. From a technical perspective, there's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way and it's got to come off and you got to meet caps to the bottom where the flesh is. We had systems for all of that and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for now with all these crazy hoses </em><em>on the helmets and all that kind of stuff that we added. In Starfield, you can change your body size significantly. You</em><em> know, the character creator had evolved quite a bit, so I think that was part of it. The other thing is, like, Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's meant to be part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk, splatter mess, where you can make a mess out of something and it just blow up into goo? It's part of the fun. It's like those old-school animes, like Fist of the North Star; they punch each other, and gushes of blood come out. Nobody can hold that much blood, but you're like, that's cool. It adds to that style.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Starfield was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things, The Expanse, Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think it just didn't fit thematically, and on top of that, you have the technical overhead cost to get that to work. So, we were kind of like, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><br>
<em>probably better not to include it in this game.</em></p>
<p>In the lengthy interview, Mejillones also shared his profound admiration for Todd Howard, whom he regards as a mentor. As for Starfield gore, if you're looking to add that kind of spice to your playthrough on PC, there's a neat new mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/12833?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorefield</a> that was just updated today.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-rumors-reveal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is perhaps just days from announcing a new video game console, and that has understandably got a lot of people excited. </p><p>For a while now--but it feels like things really got going in the last week or two--the more enthusiastic sections of video games and tech media have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been filling the quieter holiday news cycle with rumours, whispers and speculation</a> about new hardware. "Nintendo Switch 2 reveal imminent, reports suggest"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reads a Eurogamer headline</a>. "Nintendo Switch 2: everything we know about a potential Switch successor"<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is at the top of this Techradar story</a>. There was even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a frenzy over a third-party peripheral maker’s CES booth</a>.</p><p>This kind of fever pitch isn't new. As long as we've had the internet--<a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/54076/the-nintendo-revolution-and-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and especially dating back to the 2000s reveal of the Wii</a>--we've been inundated with rumours, guesses, mockups and hoaxes during the leadup for each successive Nintendo console, few if any of which proved to be even <em>remotely </em>accurate, or even if they were, actually meant anything. Doesn't matter! People <em>really </em>want to know what a new Nintendo machine is like, and when we’re going to see it for the first time, and if Nintendo isn’t forthcoming with that information then fans will gobble up whatever else is out there.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand the excitement; a Nintendo console announcement is a big deal, and we haven't had one for <em>eight years</em>. But the Switch 2 (or whatever it's called) will be announced...only when it's announced. Nintendo will show a video (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342802/get-ready-for-the-switch-2-announcement-this-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or two</a>), unveil the machine, announce some games, maybe even some prices and release dates. Then it'll be a <em>thing </em>that we know about. Until that moment, despite everyone's excitement and enthusiasm, none of the guesses and rumours and reports mean much. They’re vapour, rumour, fragments of information mostly lacking in context.&nbsp;</p><p>You cannot rush Christmas. Christmas (if you celebrate it!) rules. You get cool stuff to play with, there's joy, you see people, it's great. Folks look forward to it all year long; it’s a very special day. But no matter how much I love Christmas, no matter how many rumours I could read about Santa leaving his workshop on December 3, no matter how many Photoshops I could see showing him climbing down chimneys on December 19, I cannot change that date, or its significance. The presents only get opened one day a year. Like other jolly old men with white beards, Santa will get here precisely when he means to. The calendar is immovable.</p><p>And so is Nintendo. So unless we find ourselves in the extremely unlikely event of a full leak ahead of time--images, specs, dates, the works--we can just relax! The Switch's successor is coming. One day hopefully soon, and when it arrives, you will know everything about it, see everything about it, and it will be a real, verifiable thing.</p><p>Until then, despite all the rumours and speculation flying around out there, you'll just need to wait a little bit longer. You've made it this far, you can make it another few–if reports are to be believed–days.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones"><h3>The Affordable Accuracy Monitor Is Everything That DIY Should Be</h3></a><p>Dennis Murphy's mod to the now-discontinued Andrew Jones Pioneer speakers are the perfect combination of price and performance.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players take on the role of Breakers, who are elite warriors tasked with restoring civilization by exploring an ever-changing realm called The Overgrowth and defeating the evil Abyss King who controls it. Players team up in online co-op and head out in expeditions to explore, defeat bosses, and collect loot--then return to base to upgrade the settlement with the resources you acquired, gear up, and head back out to an all-new version of the Overgrowth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649"></a><figcaption>Hyper Light Breaker</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Note that like all early access games, Hyper Light Breaker is not considered a finished game yet, and you're likely to encounter some bugs and performance issues if you dive in now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League just received its final update, which along with the promised offline mode, adds an official ending to the game's story that wraps everything up in a tidy, if rather uninteresting, way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, Episode 8: Balance is the final update planned for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Alongside some new armore and exotic weapons, the biggest feature in the update is a new Offline Mode that will allow players to continue playing Suicide Squad Game by themselves without requiring an internet connection.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">As a reminder, Episode 8 will be the final update to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuicideSquadGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#SuicideSquadGame</a>. The title will remain playable in both Online and the recently released Offline Mode for players to continue to wreak havoc in Metropolis 💥</p>— Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League (@suicidesquadRS) <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1879238211643605436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Offline Mode was announced in December 2023 as part of Rocksteady's post-launch plans, but the studio was also committed to releasing its promised DLCs and additional characters, leaving the Offline Mode for its final update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a big comic book ending to wrap up the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, <strong>so if you're okay with spoilers feel free to read below the break. You've been warned.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay so Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, as the name implies, is about taking out members of the Justice League who have been brainwashed by Brainiac. One of the biggest shocks in the game was when Harley Quinn <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kevin-conroys-batman-is-completely-wasted-in-suicide-squad">shoots Batman point blank in the head</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Batman was actually still alive. In his masterful gambit, he allowed Brainiac to create clones of the Justice League and then oversaw the events of the game from the shadows as he worked to take down Brainiac in secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ending is told via the comic book illustrations that the different post-launch episodes have been presented in and in true comic book fashion, your favorite heroes are still all alive and the bad guys are defeated. Woo-hoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this how Rocksteady envisioned the end of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League? Who can say. The game released to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-worst-reviewed-games-of-2024">mixed reviews</a> and Warner Bros. said the game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">fell short of expectations</a> when it came to sales, and the developers announced that it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-confirms-its-pulling-the-plug-on-new-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-content-after-season-4">ending future updates</a> on the game after Season 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can read our full review of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League here and for anyone looking to play the game, the Offline Mode means you're able to fully. So if you see it on sale next time, don't worry about picking it up as the game will still run just fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series has seen two follow-up games since then--a Japan-exclusive update of the first game called Justice Private Academy: Fighting Spirit Diary 2 in 1999, followed by the sequel Project Justice in 2000. The series has been largely dormant since then, outside of a few Rival School character cameo appearances in other Capcom fighting games, which makes the new Complete Works artbook and Project Justice's inclusion in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-fighting-collection-2-launch-edition-includes-exclusive-comic-book/1100-6528240/" data-ref-id="1100-6528240">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> later this year all the more exciting.</p><p>Speaking of which, preorders for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch physical editions of Capcom Fighting Collection 2 are <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZCRiN6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available now at Amazon</a> and include a limited-edition Capcom vs. SNK comic.

Along with hundreds of images, you’ll also get a detailed rundown of character profiles, world lore, and more. Considering the game has deep mythology to pull from, there should be plenty of incredible details packed between its covers. Wo Long was quite popular when it released in 2023--if you’re worried about the art book selling out, consider landing a preorder soon. Note that the final cover art has not yet been revealed.</p>                      </div><p>The book is being published by Udon Entertainment--a brand that has previously worked on art books for Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Monster Hunter. All of these earned positive reviews from readers, and The Art of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty should retain the brand’s high-quality publishing standards.</p><p>These previous volumes also make great companions for the upcoming book, and since many are currently on sale, they’re worth checking out ahead of The Art of Wo Long’s release in July.
