After season one ended with Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), also known as Player 456,  choosing to search for the people behind the game instead of boarding a flight to Los Angeles to reconnect with his daughter, we catch up with him two years later as he’s contracted a group of people to search for The Salesman (Gong Yoo), the man who recruits people into the game. The formerly naive Gi-hun is now a radicalized vigilante with a makeshift shooting range and illegal guns in his hotel room. But, that’s not the only change this season. </p><p>Over seven episodes, <em>Squid Game</em> introduces its first transgender character, shows us someone being recruited to be a guard, and turns more children’s games into chaos creators. It’s not all good, as some of the second season’s changes left us yearning for more. But one thing is for sure: these changes make it abundantly clear that we are entering the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> as a series. Let’s cherish them while we can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central tension of the show has always been rooted in the deadly consequences of playing the show’s twisted versions of children’s games. In the past, <em>Squid Game </em>has turned Red Light, Green Light into a massacre machine, throwing marbles into a breeding ground for lethal deception, and literally put lives in people’s hands with Tug of War. The new season gives still more traditionally harmless games a murderous twist.</p><p>Before the season gets to the island for the start of the competition, the Salesman merges double-handed Rock, Paper, Scissors with Russian Roulette. After capturing Woo-seok (June Suk-ho) and Mr. Kim (Oh Dal-su), two of the men tasked by Gi-hun to find him, he forces them to each throw out a choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors with each of their hands before taking one choice back and determining the winner based on the final selections. The loser got a gunshot to the temple, with the chance that the hammer could come down on an empty chamber. As we saw, the split-second nature of having to observe what your opponent played and choosing which of your hands to take back led to Mr. Kim acting on instinct alone, instincts that convinced him to spare his younger flunky. </p><p>Later, the season introduced a six-legged pentathlon in which six contestants each tie one of their legs to another’s while moving through a course that has them playing five games—Ddakji, Flying Stone, Gongi, Spinning Top, and Jegi. Outside of Ddakji, the other four were all new additions. But none of those produced heart-wrenching results like the final new game introduced in the second season: Mingle.</p><p>In Mingle, contestants stand on a spinning platform surrounded by a number of open rooms. When the platform stops spinning, the announcer speaks out the number of people that must be grouped together and in one of the rooms by the time the timer stops. Anyone left out of a room when the timer is out gets shot dead, along with contestants in a room with the incorrect number of (alive) players. Alliances are formed and broken within minutes, depending on what is asked of them to survive, and the mad dash to doors turns into contestants physically trying to keep others out of their rooms, effectively killing them. This was the first game of the season that made it abundantly clear to the contestants that teamwork is a survivalist illusion, and saving yourself ultimately will come down to killing others.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Following the death of game creator Oh Il-nam (O Yeong-su) at the end of Season 1, it looks like the head of the games In-ho (Lee Byung-hun) took what he learned from last season and expanded it. In the first season, contestants were only given one opportunity to vote on whether the games should continue or stop without any compensation. While the majority voted for the games to stop, they all returned back to the murder lottery after spending a day in their depressing realities. In true <em>Squid Game</em> fashion, one of the few parts of the competition that had any sort of moral fiber was twisted into another opportunity for those working the game to engineer more competition. </p><p>In the second season, players get to vote on the game’s continuation after every competition. To make the decision even harder, players receive an equal share of the prize money if the majority votes to leave. It grows deadlier the deeper into the competition the contestants go, especially when players wear a patch of their choice. The people who vote to stay typically feel as if more money is the only way to save their lives from the debt that could lead to their deaths. The people who vote to leave believe they’d rather be alive and broke than risk their lives for the hopes of a little more money. Even though their decisions are conflicting, they’re both rooted in survival, which inherently puts anyone voting against their decision in opposition to them living. What results from that is one of the bloodiest group fights in <em>Squid Game</em> history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is either blatant foreshadowing of the next winner in <em>Squid Game</em>, or Netflix is about to venture into a dark place of no return. In this season, Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), is revealed to be pregnant with the child of fellow contestant Player 333, Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan) after he ghosts her. She’s in the competition because she lost her money due to following Myung-gi’s terrible investment advice. Regardless of why she’s there, she’s officially the first pregnant woman in <em>Squid Game</em> history, which means her death could be unprecedented in the worst way.</p><p>Outside of the young guards who get killed in both seasons, <em>Squid Game</em> has pretty much excluded children from risking their lives. Given that Jun-hee’s pregnancy wasn’t overtly visible, it’s possible the organizers of the game were unaware of her bringing a fetus into a warzone. However, a child’s life being decided by their parent’s desperation is the type of social experiment <em>Squid Game</em> has come to be known for. Luckily she survives Season 2, but that doesn’t mean she or her child are in the clear just yet. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gi-hun has had a one-track mindset since winning the 45.6 billion  in the first season of <em>Squid Game</em>: stop the people running the game. His first plan fails after the organizers remove the tracking chip implanted in the molar of one of his teeth meant to guide former police officer Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun) and his team to the remote island that has eluded him for two years. Well, if you can’t bring them to justice, take them to hell. That, or some version of that mentality, was clearly at play when he staged the first attack on the guards by the contestants.</p><p>He doesn’t only remember the games he played in his first go-around, but also the human dynamics that often had depraved results. Once the contestants’ voting reached its first draw, requiring votes to be cast again the following day, Gi-hun knew those who voted to stay would see bedtime as a golden opportunity to take out dissenters from the other side of the voting aisle. He acknowledged that his plan would require fellow contestants to lose their lives, giving him and his collaborators the chance to play dead themselves before attacking guards coming out check their vital signs.</p><p>Even though his plan led to mass casualties, and was ultimately thwarted by In-ho secretly playing as Player 001, Gi-hun now knows the game’s once-impenetrable fortress has exploitable vulnerabilities. Hopefully his attack destabilized their defenses enough for his cavalry to come in and save the day. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should’ve seen this coming when show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>that he envisioned the second and third seasons as one season until he realized there were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many episodes</a></span>. Let me speak for the rest of us binge warriors who have routinely dedicated 30 hours of streaming to watch an entire 30-episode series in one weekend: there can never be too many episodes. As a result, the second season of <em>Squid Game </em>is good, but not as satisfying as the first season, which Dong-hyuk also admits was as far as he originally planned for the story to go. </p><p>The primary issue with the truncated season is that the stakes aren’t high enough for viewing interest to be guaranteed much longer. As of now, the third season will show what ramifications will be levied against players for threatening to kill the organizers, how voting on the game’s continuation will change after the bloodbath, whether Gi-hun’s backup arrives in time, and who ultimately will win the competition. Outside of the mutiny, we’ve experienced these stakes in the first season, but they all felt a bit higher because it was our first time. Plus, <em>Squid Game</em> is less of a mystery-style thriller and more of an action thriller that derives its suspense from us clicking to the next episode and finding out how else this show will depict the survival of the fittest. </p><p>While <em>Squid Game</em>’s third season will arrive sometime in 2025, cutting the final season into two parts wasn’t a smart move. Still, if it helped Dong-hyuk get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more money</a></span> (and lose less teeth), then job well done. See you back on the island.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A massive leak of Halo content that contains development tools, unreleased content, and dev builds has leaked online.</p>



<p>The content is said to date back all the way to 1998 at Bungie, when the developers had just released Myth II: Soulblighter and were working on Oni and Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VISCERAL</a>, the leak contains around 90GB of data and is said to have leaked because 343 Industries hired a group of modders to try and restore cut content and data from the old games. This was known as the Digsite project, with some users familiar with the project, including one modder who had worked on the project, <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that the leak was genuine</a>.</p>



<p><em>As with all leaks of this nature, downloading them is at your own risk, and the files can be found on various social media platforms.</em></p>



<p>As for the Halo franchise today, 343 Industries renamed itself to Halo Studios in 2024 and continues developing the next Halo games. <span>As part of the announcement of its studio</span>‘s name change, the development also announced its games would be moving&nbsp;to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>



<p>Will you be checking out more of the Halo leak? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assetto Corsa EVO - Everything You Need To Know" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jH5hZqNirVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>

		<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is a getting a free trial weekend on PS5, with players able to sample all of the game from December 27th to December 31st. There are plans for an Xbox Series X|S and PC free trial, but that will not be this weekend and a date is yet to be confirmed. To take part on PS5, all you will have to do is download <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown trial version</a> off the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Season 2 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L58fbjTNOT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s free trial weekend includes access to the season 2 features, adding Ibiza as another location to drive around in, as well as Hong Kong. Though to get to Ibiza, players will need to reach level 12, as well as side with either the Sharps or the Streets clans. Ibiza also adds new cars, alongside the roster of cars available in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown released in September, and met with middling reviews due to a number of issues. Since then, KT Racing has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-first-patch-notes/">sought to fix the issues</a> that players had concerns about, including the suspension on cars, AI behaviours, and more support for various racing wheels. In our review of the game, Stefan said, <em>“After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</em></p>

Yet, in recent years, we’ve seen a trend of animated movies and franchises being remade in live-action (or, sometimes, CGI that’s meant to mimic live action with its realism), like Disney’s <em>The Lion King</em> or Universal’s upcoming<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-train-your-dragon-live-action-trailer-2025-httyd-1851703309"><em>How To Train Your Dragon</em></a></span>. So you might wonder if Wallace and his silent dog Gromit will ever get a live-action remake. According to the duo’s creator, Nick Park, that ain’t ever happening. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/501986/wallace-gromit-netflix-live-action-disney-remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon </em>talked to Park about the upcoming <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> movie</a></span>, <em>Vengeance Most Fowl, </em>and asked him about the possibility of the duo getting a fancy live-action remake. According to the outlet, his response was quick: </p><p> “Well, it’s quite an easy answer,” said Park. “NOOOOOOOO.” </p><p>Park isn’t against bringing the characters to more platforms and mediums. For example, there have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/wallace-and-gromits-grand-adventures"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit </em>video games</a></span>. But when it comes to the big movies and shorts, Park thinks the characters will “always be clay.” </p><p> “I think [the clay] is part of the character, it’s part of their soul to be that medium. It’s what they were born out of and [losing the clay] might take something away. It’s quite hard to define. ‘Thumby and funny’ is the phrase we’ve often used.”</p><p>While <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> won’t be making the leap to live action anytime soon, Disney is continuing to push ahead with its attempts at turning its popular animated features into live-action hits.

<p>With the absolute smash month that is February 2025, in which we see the release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Civilization VII, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, and Avowed, March may appear like a lightweight initially. The month does feature a few big releases, like Two Point Museum and Atomfall, but they’re more niche. No matter, the biggest video game releases in March 2025 still look enticing!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-march-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of March 2025</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for a slew of AAA releases in the month of March, then you’re going to be sorely disappointed. But if you want a few indie and AA titles to round out your library and provide a little break from the big studio releases before summer, then March definitely has you covered!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Two Point Museum</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 4, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Split Fiction</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>FragPunk </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 6, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 18, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</strong> (Nintendo Switch) – March 20, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – March 21, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tales of the Shire</strong> (PC/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S/Nintendo Switch) – March 25, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Atomfall </strong>(PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S) – March 27, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, a handful of titles are expected in March 2025 but with no official release date, including <strong>Commandos: Origins</strong>, <strong>Football Manager 25</strong>, and <strong>Killing Floor 3</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-april-2025">Looking Forward to April 2025</h2>



<p>Before anyone gets too excited, April looks like a light month—at least for now. The most significant releases aren’t that major and include:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered (PC)</li>



<li>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</li>



<li>Tempest Rising</li>
</ul>



<p>This is the lull before summer pops off; just wait and see!</p>

It was a sad ending for a once-popular franchise. But a small indie team’s new game might provide a happy ending after all. </p><p>Announced way back in 2020, <em>Restitched </em>is an upcoming PC game that looks a lot like<em> LittleBigPlanet</em>. It features a stuffed teddy bear as its main character and will let players create new levels and maps to share online via the Steam Workshop. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer for <em>Restitched:</em></p><p>It’s impossible to not notice how similar this game is to Sony’s <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>. According to Trixel Creative, the small team behind the project, they were fans of <em>LBP </em>and many played it years ago. But Trixel Creative claims <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/press" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Restitched</em></a></span> isn’t just about remaking <em>LBP </em>on PC. </p><p>“Some may think we’re creating <em>Restitched </em>just to bring the same experience to the PC, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” explained the studio in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.trixelcreative.com/restitched/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ on the game’s website</a></span>. “This genre of gaming is largely unexplored, and we love the concept so much that we think there is room for multiple titles to explore it!”</p><p>“Games like <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>have nurtured many creative minds and offered a way for all ages to realize their imagination,” the FAQ continues. “We aim to make a game that can do the same for PC players, albeit with our own unique innovations. We will always have massive admiration and respect for the genre-pioneer that is <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, along with its many talented developers.”</p><p>The devs also claim this new game isn’t connected to a fan remake of <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>which was also called “Restitched” that was canceled by Sony lawyers in 2020.

Now, four years later, Sony has pulled the plug on <em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, and <em>Restitched </em>could be the closest thing fans get to a full-on sequel. </p><p>There’s still no release date for <em>Restitched </em>and it sounds like the game won’t be arriving on consoles anytime soon. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361090/Restitched/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can, however, wishlist it on Steam now</a></span>.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/walmart-restart-independent-video-games-journalism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A season centered around a miraculous birth is in full swing, so it’s only fitting that a couple weeks ago, something verging on impossible happened: A company announced a new video game website. No, that’s not a typo; no, the company did not <em>shutter </em>the website, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as tends to be the case</a> with alarming frequency these days. But there’s a catch: <a href="https://www.restart.run/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Restart</a>, a publication that billed itself as “independent,” is sponsored by Walmart.</p><p>When a critical mass of video game journalists and industry figures took notice of Restart last week, they <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ohmymithrandir.bsky.social/post/3ldhe243b6c2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/renegadecut.bsky.social/post/3ldhbxultks2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamingonlinux.com/post/3ldhe4wqizc2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposition</a> to that label. Walmart, after all, is about as far from independent as one can get. This seeming contradiction suffused the site’s identity. Initially, a banner at the top of the site read “Independent gaming news powered by Walmart,” but it was later changed to “Triple-I gaming news powered by Walmart.” (This, editor-in-chief Brandy Berthelson told Aftermath, was both an acknowledgement of the criticism and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/is-dave-the-diver-an-indie-game-i-would-say-no-says-game-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a nod to <em>Dave The Diver</em></a>, which similarly took flack for embracing an indie aesthetic while owing its existence to a corporate benefactor.)&nbsp;</p><p>Despite that bit of front-and-center branding, Restart staff attempted to distance themselves from Walmart’s influence out the gate.</p><p>“Restart is powered by Walmart, but Restart operates as an independent site,” editor-in-chief Brandy Berthelson wrote in <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/welcome-to-restart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post introducing the site</a>. “When we mention a game, we'll provide purchase links that will take you to Walmart using a partner tracking code. This link provides us with 0% of the sale if you decide to buy the product, but it does help Walmart see exactly how customers arrived at the product. Walmart doesn't influence our editorial direction. We hope you can see this gives us zero incentive to provide biased review scores or other information about a game.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>I'd just rather them position themselves as that explicitly – an entertainment venture that might get some access because they're a marketing arm – rather than something 'independent.'</p></blockquote></figure><p>This disclaimer only led to more questions: Why stress that you’re not getting affiliate dollars from Walmart when the company is still ultimately footing the bills? How do you avoid a conflict of interest when, as stated, Restart is at its most beneficial to Walmart when people are clicking affiliate links and generating data? What, with that in mind, would incentivize you to ever publish negative reviews? And above all else, why suggest to prospective readers that you are “the video game industry’s latest (and in our humble opinion, greatest) independent source for gaming analysis and entertainment” when your corporate connection is clear as day?&nbsp;</p><p>John Warren, who headed up Tencent-owned gaming publication Fanbyte until the mega-corporation <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/15/tencent-lays-off-nearly-all-of-staff-at-its-gaming-site-fanbyte/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off nearly all its staff in 2022</a>, can’t help but feel skeptical.</p><p>"While [Restart's] arrangement is different than Fanbyte's, in which Tencent directly owned and ultimately controlled the fate of the site, I still see parallels that tell me the positioning of Restart as ‘independent’ is extremely odd,” Warren told Aftermath. “Independent how? I'm not going to go to Restart for hard-hitting investigations or opinions because they've essentially stated we shouldn't expect it. ... That's actually totally fine! I'd just rather them position themselves as that explicitly – an entertainment venture that might get some access because they're a marketing arm – rather than something 'independent.'"</p><p>Waters were further muddied by the discovery that Restart is the product of Moonrock, a strategy and content marketing agency – something which, at first blush, would not seem to share the same goals as a more traditional news publisher. But those who run Restart – Berthelson and two other full-time writers, as well as editorial director John Benyamine and managing editor John Gaudiosi – have deep roots in games journalism, and they want to build a publication that serves readers, not just Walmart.</p><p>“When I left Gamer Network (which I loved), I went into content marketing with another company and, eventually, my partner and I started Moonrock. We wanted to use our now-50+ years of collective experience to help connect brands to gamers, and we decided we wanted to do that for brands that already understood the importance of gaming," Benyamine, who got his start at Nintendojo and went on to work at places like GameDaily, AOL Games, Joystiq, and the Gamer Network, told Aftermath. "There was also serendipity, as the same layoffs that prompted Moonrock’s creation also meant some amazing writers lost their jobs. We worked our asses off to make this natural connection happen. Talented, passionate writers who can create great content for an audience who will hopefully buy and preorder their games from the retailer funding the effort.”</p><p>As for why Benyamine chose not to go the <em>wholly </em>independent route, he’s seen – and worked at – too many sites that have crashed and burned while charting their own course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“While launching Restart without a sponsor may be looked at as preferable, there’s the danger of getting into the trap of chasing traffic, making a poor user experience through more and more ads, and giving more work to fewer staff to make ends meet,” he said. “We weren’t interested in following the same path that has proven very difficult and sometimes fatal to some amazing publications."</p><p>But big money backers – even those who “get it,” as Benyamine insists Walmart does – don’t always make for lasting foundations. Restart’s closest well-known analog, Game Informer, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-closed-layoffs-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently folded</a> despite a decades-long lifeline from GameStop, and major publications like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2023/03/31/launcher-mission-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Washington Post</a> (disclosure: I worked there) and <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> have abandoned gaming verticals at various points.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>We weren’t interested in following the same path that has proven very difficult and sometimes fatal to some amazing publications.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Restart’s staff isn’t harboring any delusions that Walmart will provide unconditional support.</p><p>“We would be naïve to think Restart can last forever if it underperforms, but thus far, through the building of the site and our few months in soft-launch, Walmart has been nothing but a supportive partner,” Berthelson told Aftermath. “‘Why would Walmart continue to fund Restart if the site underperforms?’ is a bridge we would cross if and when we had to cross it, but it helps that we – the Restart team at Moonrock – have our own standards and metrics for success we hold ourselves to, rather than being beholden to a list of [key performance indicators] from Walmart. The editorial team isn’t even aware of how poor the numbers would have to be before Walmart would consider pulling its funding.”</p><p>When it comes to affiliate links, Walmart’s main horse in this race, the matter is a little more complicated. In short, readers don’t have to click them, but it would be good if they did, and that would almost certainly please Walmart. Still, Berthelson believes that if she and her team create something worthwhile, the rest will come.</p><p>“If we can build a community of passionate gamers by sharing our opinions and recommendations, then of course we hope those readers will look to support our work by clicking the affiliate links we offer, and they will always have a choice regarding whether or not to do so,” Bertheleson said. “We can’t and would never force people to click our affiliate links or make a purchase after clicking them, but we will have those links there if they’re interested. Restart doesn’t receive any money when someone uses an affiliate link and buys a product on Walmart’s website. The links will simply tell Walmart where the shopper came from and will help Walmart see whether or not the site is achieving its goal of community building and outreach."</p><p>Berthelson added that Restart won’t shy away from negative reviews. Though the site’s review system only includes three badges – Required, Recommended, and Respectable – games that miss the mark won’t be awarded with any badge. She offered <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/funko-fusion-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a (gently) critical review of <em>Funko Fusion</em></a> as an example.</p><p>“The three review badges are an alternative to having a 5- or 10-point scale, or a star-based scale, and is similar to how other sites may use word-based quality descriptors,” she said. “We took some inspiration from Eurogamer’s previous scoring system for that. If a game receives a negative review, it simply doesn’t receive a badge."</p><figure><blockquote><p>We would be naïve to think Restart can last forever if it underperforms, but thus far ... Walmart has been nothing but a supportive partner.</p></blockquote></figure><p>If you’ve made it this far and have come to the conclusion that Restart isn’t especially well equipped to challenge an industry prone to exploiting workers and audiences alike, you are correct. But as with spiritual forebears like Game Informer – or <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kyleor.land/post/3ldhddje7ea2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart’s own in-store magazine</a>, GameCenter, which ran until 2023 – that’s not really the goal.</p><p>“We know sites like Aftermath are better equipped for hard-hitting journalism,” said Benyamine. “Our focus is a bit simpler in covering and celebrating this passion of ours from a consumer perspective.”</p><p>Freelancers like Jason Fanelli also understand the assignment.</p><p>“From my experience, they have news pieces handled in-house for the most part, so whenever I pitch them, it would be for a review or preview opportunity. The occasional feature might play there too, but admittedly I pitch elsewhere for pieces like that,” Fanelli, who’s been writing about video games for 16 years and who has contributed to Restart, told Aftermath. “I'd agree that Restart isn't looking to do what [Jason] Schreier is doing, and that their content is more focused on the games themselves: news, reviews, previews, etc. I could be wrong, of course, and they could be working on the biggest exposé the industry has ever seen as we speak, but I wouldn't hold my breath.”</p><p>This gets to the core of the conflict around Restart: On one hand, a publication like this is far from unprecedented; just speaking from a personal standpoint, I grew up obsessively poring over Game Informer and its lesser-known Electronics Boutique equivalent GMR while, especially as I got older, recognizing that they existed in part to help sell video games. But while video game magazines and websites have always ridden various cascading waves of marketing hype, there used to be alternatives. Now publications fold on what feels like a regular basis, and traffic/SEO mandates have big sites cozying up more and more closely to corporate interests. </p><p>With a growing number of journalists out of work, companies like <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic</a>, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> have also launched their own editorial efforts that use a similar voice and draw on some of the same talent primarily to sell games. Independent sites are few and far between because – per the <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">object lesson we’ve provided</a> – it’s really hard to do this kind of thing in the current landscape. That tension, perhaps more than Restart’s existence in a vacuum, has left a bad taste in the mouths of some industry figures.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Walmart money could fund valuable journalism, but it never will. That's the truth that's so frustrating for me and many others as it relates to Restart.</p></blockquote></figure><p>"My issue is, no one seems to want to fund investigations, reporting, and criticism,” said Warren. “Journalism is obviously in a terrible place everywhere, but games journalism is especially anemic right now. With all respect to the staff of Restart, I didn't recognize any of them as established journalists known for the kind of reporting that is being underfunded right now. Walmart money could fund valuable journalism, but it never will. That's the truth that's so frustrating for me and many others as it relates to Restart."</p><p>Does the video game industry at large <em>need </em>another Restart-shaped publication when the internet is already inundated with enthusiast sites, sludge farms, and content creators? No, probably not. But with walls closing in on writers of all stripes, the site offers <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/restart-is-now-accepting-freelance-pitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fresh source of income</a> for those still trying to hack it atop a rapidly-melting ice floe. That’s not nothing, especially considering <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the state of things elsewhere</a>.</p><p>"As a freelancer, my options for pitching features is a very small list – and most of the time I don’t even get a response. My options for pitching features that pay well? It’s like two places," writer, author, and friend of Aftermath Aidan Moher <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3ldhd2voslk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Bluesky. "So, honestly, Restart will go on my list and its turn-order placement will be dictated by pay rate."&nbsp;</p><p>“The funding from Walmart, coupled with Moonrock's other work, does scream corporate influence, and the skepticism is understandable. However, in my working with them, it seemed above board,” said Fanelli. “Working with them on the pieces they commissioned was a respectful experience where I was given the freedom to write however I want, Brandy's editing process was quick and simple, and the rates were solid. I never felt limited by them while I worked for them; they trusted me, and I wrote what I wanted to write. I enjoyed writing for them, and I'd do it again if the opportunity arose.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-games-journalism-2024-game-informer-ign"><h3>The Best And Worst Games Journalism Moments Of 2024</h3></a><p>It was the worst of times, it was the less-worst of times</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
