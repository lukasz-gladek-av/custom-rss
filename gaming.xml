                <p>Historically, collecting coins in the Mario Kart series generally grants a bit of a speed boost. While never a huge improvement, it gives players another way to build a marginal edge in races. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, coins do grant additional speed, but it's a more complicated process than in past titles.</p><p>New evidence surfaced by TikTok user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shortcatt321</a> suggests that each additional coin (up to the max of 20) does not grant a constant speed boost. In other words, coins add speed on a curve--rather than the speed bonus building on a linear scale. In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a TikTok video</a>, the user explains that this speed boost curve is actually different depending on the kart and character a player selects.</p>

<p>The curve for low top-speed builds is front-loaded, where early coins add a bigger bonus than later coins. High top-speed builds, meanwhile, are the inverse: later coins matter much more. At 20 coins acquired, both types of builds receive the same boost of 5.1% faster top speed.</p><p>Because of this discrepancy, optimal strategies toward collecting coins can differ depending on whether you choose a lightweight or heavyweight combo. Shortcatt321 suggests that collecting at least seven coins is important for lightweight, low-speed character/kart players, while heavyweight combos should either commit to collecting 20 coins, or not worry about coins at all.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched with the Switch 2 earlier this month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">an immediate hit with Switch 2 early adopters</a>.

If Pillars of Eternity 3 ever happens, director Josh Sawyer says it will likely take some influence from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p><p>Sawyer--who directed both of the Pillars of Eternity games--recently suggested that that the franchise's isometric perspective needs to shift to the 3D style in Baldur's Gate 3 in order to enhance the overall presentation of the game.</p><p>"I think if we did go into a 3D environment, we could patch up one of the things that's really lacking," Sawyer told <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/i-dont-feel-good-about-the-industry-but-i-feel-good-about-the-abi/z377e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamepressure</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/josh-sawyer-says-a-hypothetical-pillars-of-eternity-3-would-be-3d-just-like-baldurs-gate-3-with-environmental-mechanics-elevation-hazards-and-dynamic-terrain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "Because [Pillars of Eternity 2] is isometric, there's no sense of height, and the environment can't be that dynamic. When you compare it to something like [Baldur's Gate 3], you realize it's such a huge part of the appeal. I think, at some point, I would like to see a game that used all those Deadfire mechanics, plus more environmental mechanics, elevation hazards, and dynamic terrain stuff. That could be super cool... I think that a third game should be an isometric 3D with an environment more like Baldur’s Gate 3. It would work."</p><p>In 2020, Sawyer suggested that Pillars of Eternity 3 would only happen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-says-a-3rd-game-will-/1100-6480569/" data-ref-id="1100-6480569">if the dev team were excited to make it</a>.

And players couldn’t re-order the upcoming games. Since then,  Nintendo games have largely been unavailable for purchase directly from Amazon. Instead, when purchased on the site, they were sold and shipped via third-party sellers. And earlier this month, the Switch 2, its first-party launch games, and its official accessories, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-wont-find-switch-2-consoles-on-amazon-but-you-can-get-games-gear/1100-6531143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">were similarly unavailable to pre-order on Amazon</a></span>. It’s been a frustrating situation for gamers who rely on the online retailer. But it’s finally, possibly, coming to an end. </p><p>Over the weekend, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-amazon-switch-2-freeze-out-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as spotted by <em>IGN </em>and others</a></span>, a handful of first-party Nintendo games popped up on Amazon and are being officially shipped and sold by the retail giant. <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/amazon-switch-2-nintendo-mario-donkey-kong-pre-orders-1851784603&amp;asc_source=&amp;asins=B0F66KLYVH,B0F66JNF9W,B0F66GWKZS,B0F66DW2X7,B0F66DXJNM,B0F66GQLHH,B0F66DHVR7&amp;isPreview=1&amp;isSlp=1&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree, </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</em></a></span><em> </em>are some of the first-party Nintendo games now available to pre-order directly from Amazon and Nintendo. This seems to indicate that the two companies have come to an agreement and ended the lockout. There was even a listing for the Switch 2, though that has been removed for now. But this all seems to point to Nintendo products and games returning fully to Amazon in the near future. </p><p>As for why Nintendo stopped selling new games and consoles on Amazon, there’s never been a confirmation from either company. Some fans speculate that Amazon was shipping games ahead of their release and that this led to leaks, but that has yet to be confirmed. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's a bit chunkier and wider than the real thing, so it doesn't have the same exact form factor, but it adds several compelling features that make it a versatile option for GameCube games on Switch Online as well as modern Nintendo games.</p><p>Beyond offering conventional bumpers and triggers, the Warrior Lite has two remappable back buttons. The right and left back buttons have a one-piece panel design that can be removed and switched with an alternate panel inside the box. The main difference between the two styles of back buttons is that one of them is textured and slightly raised for increased tactile feedback.</p><p>The Warrior Lite is equipped with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks. The right stick mimics the GameCube's yellow C-stick, but you can swap it out for a yellow stick with a more conventional, larger grip. Similarly, you can switch between octagonal stick gates inspired by the GameCube controller and regular stick gates with a circular range of motion.</p><p>Face buttons, the 8-way D-pad, and shoulder bumpers are actuated by microswitches, giving them a mouse-click feel. Like the sticks, the triggers are activated with Hall Effect sensors, and can be set at two different stopping points with the locking switches on the back. Other core features include built-in, adjustable rumble and 6-axis motion controls.</p><p>The main downside is battery life, as the Lite version has a smaller battery that only runs for up to five hours on a full charge. Like many Bluetooth controllers for Switch 2 and Switch, you can use the Warrior Lite on PC, mobile, Steam Deck, and other devices.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">NYXI Warrior Wireless Controller for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$69 | Adds support for original GameCube hardware</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Bluetooth Wireless: Switch 2, Switch, PC, Mobile</li><li><strong>2.4GHz Wireless: GameCube, Wii, PC</strong></li><li>Connects wirelessly via Bluetooth</li><li>Hall Effect sticks and triggers</li><li>Modern trigger and bumper design</li><li>Adjustable trigger locks</li><li>Two remappable back buttons</li><li>Swappable back button module</li><li>Swappable sticks and gates</li><li>Microswitch face buttons</li><li>8-way microswitch D-pad</li><li>6-axis gyroscope for motion controls</li><li>Adjustable dual-rumble motors</li><li><strong>Up to 10 hours of battery life</strong></li></ul><p>NYXI released the original Warrior controller last year.

The Warrior also has a larger battery that can run for up to 10 hours between charges, which is a nice perk.</p><p>The Warrior comes in three different colors--purple, orange, and black--though only purple is still in stock at Amazon.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616"></a><figcaption>NYXI Warrior back button module and trigger locks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514617,1300-4514618" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"></figure><h2>GameCube-style Controllers for Switch 2 &amp; Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Toad)</a> -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Zelda)</a> -- $48</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Nintendo GameCube Controller (Switch 2)</a> -- $65</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-PC-Mechanical-Vibration/dp/B0F631L416?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior Lite</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior</a> -- $69</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=This+GameCube+Controller+With+Back+Buttons+And+Hall+Effect+Sticks+Works+On+Switch+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A29&amp;fnarticle_id=6532458&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnyxigame.com%2Fproducts%2Fnyxi-wizard-2-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-gamecube-controller-with-back-buttons-and-hall-effect-sticks-works-on-switch-2%2F1100-6532458%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard 2</a> -- $80 (<del>$90</del>)</li></ul><p>From a customization perspective, the Warrior lineup is the most impressive GameCube-style controller we've tried, but there are other GameCube controllers for Switch 2 that offer a more authentic experience. As mentioned, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's new wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2</a> is as close to the original as you'll find. It feels almost exactly like the original, just without the cable and with a few extra small buttons on the top: C button for GameChat, home/menu buttons, and a small ZL button to make up for the fact the GameCube controller only had one shoulder button. But while this is best option for GameCube games on Switch Online, the aforementioned tiny ZL button makes it less than ideal for modern games.</p><p>Officially licensed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameCube-style controllers from PowerA</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori</a> add Nintendo-inspired designs and have modernized shoulder and trigger layouts.

The Wizard replaces the Joy-Con controllers on the original Switch and Switch OLED in handheld mode, but the left and right sides can connect together as a wireless controller in docked mode.

The follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-sonic-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-482784">Team Sonic Racing</a> aims to combine its predecessor's formula with the more competitive make-up of the Sonic Riders games, but the culmination lacks both the cooperative nature of the first game and thrilling sense of speed of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders/" data-ref-id="5000-25205">Riders</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders-zero-gravity/" data-ref-id="5000-32739">Zero Gravity</a>. All that's left is a game that plays fine, but feels like a lesser version of arcade racer juggernaut Mario Kart. CrossWorlds might have been better off solely building on the teamwork focus of Team Sonic Racing (or, better yet, giving us a true follow-up to Zero Gravity that isn't built around gimmicky motion controls).</p><p dir="ltr">If you have played any kart racer, you already have an idea as to how CrossWorlds works. Like its contemporaries, you pick a character and a kart for them to drive, and then after a brief countdown, do your best to drive around a track a set number of times while going over jumps, drifting around corners, and smashing into glowing boxes that reward you with an item to use to mess with other players. The first to finish the race wins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Guest Characters Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">CrossWorlds' main gimmick is how each track can cross into another--when the player currently in first place finishes their first lap, they can choose to drive into one of two portals, each of which provides a clear view of a different track on another world. Whichever portal the player picks decides the outcome for everyone, and the second lap is then run on the new track. As lap three begins, the race returns to whatever the original track was.</p><p dir="ltr">At Summer Game Fest 2025, I played a demo that showcased the CrossWorlds' Grand Prix mode, trying it on easy as Jet the Hawk and then again on normal with Amy Rose. Like Grand Prix modes in other racers, this saw me competing in back-to-back races, earning a set number of points for the place I took in each one. CrossWorlds' take on the formula is three races on three different tracks, concluding with a fourth race where lap one is the first track in the series, lap two is the second track, and so on. There's also a "rival" feature, where the game told me which opponent was my rival, and I'd earn extra points for ensuring I at least finished ahead of that character.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, I had a good time. Racers like this are always more exciting with friends than computers, so despite the game repeatedly reminding me that so-and-so was my rival, I just couldn't muster up the level of hatred in my heart for an AI-controlled opponent that I do for my back-stabbing "friends" who use a well-timed item to take away a hard-fought victory. But I couldn't help but compare CrossWorlds to Mario Kart. The changing maps and rival character are neat, but they don't add anything to the experience that fundamentally changes how you race.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620"></a><figcaption>Several guest characters will be included in the playable roster, including Persona 5's Joker and Minecraft's Steve.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's such a shame how large a departure CrossWorlds is from its predecessor, Team Sonic Racing. The main gimmick of Team Sonic Racing was that every player was racing as part of a team. For example, whichever member of the team was in front would leave behind a draft their allies could use to speed up. There was this great back-and-forth, pull-and-push nature to the gameplay, which didn't exist in other mainstream competitors. Being a good racer was still important, but it was crucial to work in tandem with your teammates to maintain your top speed. It was a new way to play a kart racer.</p><p dir="ltr">I think there's a lot that a sequel could have built upon that foundation, especially as a means to differentiate itself from Mario Kart, which CrossWorlds is clearly trying to emulate. Alternatively, if the teamwork element had to be abandoned in the sequel, going even further and switching to the Riders formula might have also worked. That game leaned into Sonic's legendary speed to deliver another arcade racer that's all about going almost uncontrollably fast, while needing to strategically weigh the risks of pushing forward or replenishing your fuel. That focus would also have been a fantastic way to stand out from similar racers.</p><p dir="ltr">By taking the middle ground, CrossWorlds doesn't rise to the level of what's come before. It's still fun, but any sort of unique flavoring it could have brought to the genre feels absent. Granted, there might be a lot more to the game than what I played at Summer Game Fest--if so, that could change my mind about it.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC on September 25. A Switch 2 version of the game is also in the works, but no release date has been confirmed.</p>

Perkins and Crawford will now serve as Darrington Press' Creative Director and Game Director, respectively, <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/">according to an announcement on the company's website</a>.</p><p>This is a massive shakeup for the TTRPG world. Critical Role, known for its livestreamed games of Dungeons &amp; Dragons played by high-profile voice actors, launched Darrington Press in 2020. While the company's first projects were Critical Role adjacent, this year it released Daggerheart, a standalone role-playing game designed to compete with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other similar games. The cast is currently in the midst of a mini-arc using the game system, and fans have speculated the company might intend to move away from D&amp;D entirely one day.</p>

<p>Daggerheart, the tabletop role-playing game from Critical Role, is a system that uses dice and cards to tell stories in a fantasy setting.</p>

<p>By bringing on Crawford and Perkins, Darrington Press's pedigree increases significantly. The two have worked at Wizards of the Coast for many years (Crawford for 18, Perkins for 28), and are considered two of the primary architects behind Dungeons and Dragons' extremely popular fifth edition and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/05/14/the-art-of-the-new-dungeons-dragons">its 2024 overhaul of that ruleset</a>. The designers were public spokespeople for the brand as well, appearing in videos to explain new books or playtests and even clarifying rules on social media. Shortly after the new books were released, however, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisperkinsdnd.bsky.social/post/3llyvdjkphk2p">Chris Perkins</a> and <a href="https://screenrant.com/jeremy-crawford-chris-perkins-leaving-dnd-interview/">Jeremy Crawford</a> each announced they had decided to leave the company.</p><p>Their jump to Darrington is an unexpected move, to say the least, but it seems Wizards of the Coast was aware of the transition, making a point to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dndbeyond.com/post/3lrqh6lyth22l">congratulate the move on Bluesky</a>. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-06-16/critical-role-raids-dungeons-and-dragons-coffers-to-sign-storytelling-duo">The pair also did an interview with <em>The Los Angeles Times</em></a><em> </em>explaining their decision process and generally praising the Critical Role team.</p><p>The two will be "developing novel game concepts as well as expanding the games [Darrington has] released so far," according to the announcement. This likely involves additions to Daggerheart, which launched a few weeks ago. For more Daggerheart and its inspirations, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/tabletop/2025/05/15/exclusive-diving-deep-into-critical-roles-daggerheart">you can read our interview with its lead game designer, Spenser Starke</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/borderlands-4-standard-edition-confirmed-to-cost-70<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Gearbox has opened pre-orders for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-deep-dive-details-new-vault-hunters-open-world-changes-loot-shakeups-and">Borderlands 4</a>, confirming a $69.99 price for the Standard Edition. This news alleviates fan concern that the upcoming shooter would retail at $80 and follows CEO Randy Pitchford’s controversial comment last month that “real fans” would find a way to purchase the game at that price.</p><p>The worry over Borderlands 4’s price stemmed from an <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">exchange on X</a> with Randy Pitchford on May 13 where a fan told him the game “better not be 80 dollars.” Pitchford responded by saying the decision was “Not my call”, then added the following:</p><p>“If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.”</p><p>Pitchford’s comment attracted criticism from those who took this as him implying that players who couldn’t afford to pay $80 are not true fans. It also fueled speculation that Borderlands 4 would indeed follow the growing trend set by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/nintendo-says-mario-kart-worlds-value-justifies-its-80-price">Mario Kart World</a> of retailing at the higher price point.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, Pitchford addressed his comment by <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1925108385625809225">sharing a clip</a> from a PAX East developer panel (which occurred before Pitchford’s controversial X post), where he elaborated on Borderlands 4’s then-potential price by speaking on the current realities of video game development budgets and pricing.</p><p>“It’s an interesting time, right?” says Pitchford during the Q&amp;A session. “On one level, we’ve got a competitive marketplace where the people who make those choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people who are price-sensitive. So there’s some folks who don’t want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There’s other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there’s tariffs for the retail packaging and it’s getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is, I don’t know what the price is going to be.”</p><p>He then added, “As artists, we want everybody to have it. We want to make it as easy as possible for everybody to enjoy what we’re creating.”</p>

Each AI-powered car you round up has a distinct personality. Some are great, like a car terrified of drive too fast that you have to carefully direct back to its home base.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nexus-mods-owner-steps-down-after-24-years-to-focus-on-mental-health<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gaming mod hub Nexus Mods is under new ownership for the first time in 24 years as creator Robin “Dark0ne” Scott hands off the baton for the sake of his mental health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The figurehead of one of the biggest gaming sites on the internet posted about its next chapter in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a message</u></a> published today. It comes with confirmation that Scott has already officially stepped away from Nexus Mods, “following months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message keeps many of the behind-the-scenes details under wraps but says two new individuals — one named Victor (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Foledinho</u></a>) and another named Marinus (a.k.a. <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rapsak</u></a>) — have adopted the leadership role, with both of their profiles now bearing the “Site Owner” title. The leadership change signals the beginning of a new era for Nexus Mods, and for Scott, a much-needed break.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,” Scott explained. “The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The small project born in Scott’s bedroom for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind eventually ballooned into a massive entity in the gaming space. The Nexus Mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/about" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>About Us page</u></a> notes that this beating heart of the PC gaming community is made up of 63.4 million users and 16.8 billion file downloads, positioning it as one of the most highly trafficked UK-based websites on the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Nexus Mods has grown, so too has its impact on Scott, who has spent “every single day” for more than 20 years “on call.” Losing his direct input in the day-to-day operations of Nexus Mods will surely result in some changes, but Scott assured modders and gamers alike that the shift should not be cause for concern.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Behind the scenes, I’ve already been stepping back bit by bit,” Scott clarifies. “Over the past few years, the team has taken on more of the weight and the site’s been doing better than ever. What’s changing now is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scott says his stepping down from Nexus Mods, as well as a few small structural changes, are moves made to ensure “long-term stability” and won’t impact how the site has been operating recently. He goes as far as to say, “Nexus Mods is community-first and mod-author focused, that’s not up for negotiation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Scott steps away from his direct leadership position, the modding creator says he’ll still engage with the Nexus Mods community on its Mod Author Discord, forums, and more. He’ll also help guide the site’s 40-person team as the page is turned, relieving his duties as its face and figurehead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn’t some corporate ‘exit’ or a backroom deal,” Scott adds. “This is me doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nexus Mods has housed thousands of fan-made creations for games like franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Stardew Valley, Baldur’s Gate, Cyberpunk 2077, and many, many more for decades. In fact, just moments after The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion shadow-dropped earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-mods-have-already-been-published-online">dozens of minor mods had already been published on the site</a>. It’s the go-to place for PC gamers to modify their games to their liking, and with its first change in leadership in 24 years comes a fair amount of uncertainty for its future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-addresses-pay-to-win-fears-as-it-introduces-unprecedented-20-premium-pass-with-gold-bottle-cap-that-boosts-a-pokmons-stats-to-100<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's iconic anime theme tune talks about wanting to be the very best — but what if there was a premium in-game item that could, over time, give your Pokémon a helping hand? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, as in the main series of Pokémon games, hit smartphone spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is set to offer Gold Bottle Caps — rare items that will let you boost a creature's stats until it becomes a perfect 100%, or in Pokémon fan language, a 'hundo.' But these items won't be cheap — and seemingly won't be available very often.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go has recently allowed users to engage with more of the game's activities remotely, and begun selling items that bestow the stat-boosting Lucky Friend status on players when trading creatures. Now, the introduction of Bottle Caps marks another new frontier for the game, as something that will inarguably offer a gameplay advantage — better, stronger stats for the Pokémon of your choice — in exchange for your money.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first Gold Bottle Cap, singular, will be offered as part of a new $19.99 event pass, GO Pass Deluxe: Ancients Recovered, which is set to be made available from Monday, June 23 until Sunday, June 29. Previous passes have cost either $7.99 or $14.99, making this offering the most expensive pass yet. It will also be the first time players will have overlapping event passes, as the monthly June pass will still be ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While a free version of the Ancients Recovered pass will also be available, Pokémon Go's first Gold Bottle Cap will only be offered in the pass' Deluxe version, which is a paid upgrade. The free pass will include an encounter with a Legendary Pokémon (one of the Regi family), three Pikachu wearing "dapper" costumes, plus Stardust, XP and other items. The paid upgrade adds Zacian and Zamazenta masks for your in-game avatar, plus premium in-game items such as Incense, an Incubator and Lure Modules, as well as that Gold Bottle Cap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you buy the premium upgrade via your browser on the Pokémon Go Web Store — outside of the game, and therefore outside of Apple and Google's pesky platform fees — you will additionally receive 10 Max Revives, 10 Max Potions, five Premium Battle Passes, five Max Particle Packs, a Max Mushroom, and an Incubator. And then there's the even more premium GO Pass: Deluxe: Ancients Recovered + 10 Ranks bundle, which unlocks the first 10 event pass tiers immediately and comes with even more Incubators when acquired via a Web Store purchase.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/736-a-new-way-to-power-up-pokmon-is-coming-to-pokmon-go-00-00-09-1750066518265.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go's Golden Bottle Cap. (Detective Pikachu not included.)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the full details regarding Gold Bottle Caps are being confirmed today, the game's community has been expecting their announcement for several months after traces of the feature were spotted by dataminers within the game's code. Various concepts for their implementation have been discussed, and fans have had much to say on how they expect the feature to be introduced, how much it will cost, and how it will affect game balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today's announcement, I put these concerns to Pokémon Go game director Michael Steranka, who said the feature had been designed to ensure Pokémon Go as a whole would not become pay-to-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have been really careful with the design for Bottle Caps," Steranka told IGN, during an interview held at the game's big Go Fest 2025 live event in Paris this past weekend. "That's something where, if we weren't thoughtful with the integration, it could really destroy the economy of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An item like a Bottle Cap is only going to be available very, very rarely," he continued. "And because of that, we don't feel that players will be able to just spend their way to having the best of the best of everything. And even once you obtain a Bottle Cap, it's actually going to be quite a lot of effort for people to Hyper Train their Pokémon to get their stats up."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p> "It's not something that is just an immediate, you know, spend money and then get powerful Pokémon type of a system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once unlocked via the event pass and applied to the Pokémon of your choice, a Gold Bottle Cap will begin a new feature, Hyper Training, that requires you complete tasks to slowly level your Pokémon's stats over time. Raising a Pokémon's Attack stat requires you battle using the Pokémon while it is set as your Buddy. Boosting defense will be possible as you strengthen your bond with your Buddy, by playing together, exploring, and catching other Pokémon. Levelling up HP, meanwhile, will see you exploring alongside your trainee as a buddy, spinning PokéStops, earning Buddy Candy, or via other adventures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that this further gameplay is also required will also help protect game balance, Steranka continued. "It's not something that is just an immediate, you know, spend money and then get powerful Pokémon type of a system," he said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of today's official announcement, I spent some time at Go Fest 2025 chatting with players about their thoughts on the current state of Pokémon Go, and of the previously-datamined suggestion that Bottle Caps could be introduced at some point in the future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid some excitement for the feature's arrival, a key question I heard from fans was how often Gold Bottle Caps would be offered — and the suggestion they needed to provided sparingly, in order to preserve game balance, and also to ensure players never felt continually pressured to spend money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's announcement describes Gold Bottle Caps as "extremely rare" and states that "obtaining one is a special occasion, so select your trainee wisely!" When asked how often Gold Bottle Caps would be offered to players, Steranka said the exact frequency of their availability was still to be announced. Still, he confirmed, they would remain a rare item, and not another item designed to simply be always available via Pokémon Go's in-game shop.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/bafkreiakqe47b5kliht3pu3iieqmsf26d7d6coh6yftfdujte5bcjjuipy-1750066497410.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go Fest 2025 in Paris. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the past, Pokémon Go has offered the ultra-rare Master Ball item a handful of times over the past few years — and this frequency is something I heard a majority of players saying they thought would be fitting for Bottle Caps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think we're ready to share the frequency that Bottle Caps will be available," Steranka said when I asked about the exact availability of the item going forward, "but it definitely will be one of the most rare items in the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the item's price, some fans have rationalised a high cost would be likely due to the sheer rarity of finding a 100% stat Pokémon via other means, such as paying for hundreds of chances to try and encounter the creature through normal gameplay such as raids. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prior to the announcement, players had wondered whether other forms of Bottle Cap would be available, which perhaps might raise a Pokémon's stats by a fraction, or be offered for free. That does not seem to be the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right now we're launching with the Gold Bottle Cap, and that will enable you to train with a Pokémon to take any Pokémon up to max stats," Steranka confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy year for Pokémon Go, whose development team now sits as part of Monopoly Go owner Scopely, following the recent closing of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-dev-moves-to-reassure-players-after-35-billion-sale-to-monopoly-go-company-is-confirmed">$3.5 billion buyout of Niantic's gaming portfolio</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Ubisoft first announced that it was remaking the beloved action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-518598">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, back in September 2020, but five years on, the game has yet to even get a release date. This week, Ubisoft assured fans that development is still ongoing--but provided little detail on the game's current state.</p><p>In tweets posted from the Prince of Persia account, the company shared that "development continues behind the scenes," and it thanked fans "for sticking with us" throughout the protracted process. Ubisoft also provided an (admittedly beautiful) piece of art ostensibly from the remake, which you can see in the embed below.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166/" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Yep, we’re still deep in the game — exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. 🗡️⏳</p><p> This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step.</p><p> Thank you for sticking with us. 💖 <a href="https://t.co/9bKjZHjmur" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9bKjZHjmur</a></p></div>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In its most recent earnings call, Ubisoft shared that it plans for the remake to launch by the end of its current fiscal year; this means that the game would be released by March 31, 2026, at the latest. This was a refinement on its previous announcement of a 2026 release window, which itself followed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-might-be-going-through-a-remake-of-its-own-report/1100-6522543/" data-ref-id="1100-6522543">multiple reports of development woes</a>.</p><p>While Sands of Time fans will still need to wait a considerable amount of time before getting their hands on the remake, it isn't the only Prince of Persia title in the works. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" data-ref-id="5000-625410">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, a roguelike with a cel-shaded and cartoony art style, is currently in Early Access on Steam; its 1.0 version releases in August. The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown likely won't be getting a sequel anytime soon, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/most-of-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team-shifted-to-other-projects/1100-6527334/" data-ref-id="1100-6527334">Ubisoft disbanded its developer last fall</a>.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">a very bad year for the company</a>, Ubisoft has largely remained quiet about its development pipeline. It had a limited presence at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, and it did not hold its normal summertime Ubisoft Forward event. This is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">its decision to delay many of its major upcoming titles</a>.</p>

			<p>Earlier today, Gearbox Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> up the official pre-orders for Borderlands 4. Fans of the looter shooter franchise certainly held their breath for a while when Gearbox president Randy Pitchford wouldn't confirm the pricing, and now they can rest a bit easier knowing that the game won't be priced at $80 as some had feared.</p>
<p>Alongside the opening of pre-orders, though, the Texas-based development studio also revealed the minimum and recommended PC requirements for Borderlands 4. They can be read on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> pages, although we've posted them below too for your convenience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p>Considering that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5, these system requirements are fairly tame compared to others we've seen. The game is also said to offer the largest and most seamless map in the franchise, with anything you see in the distance reachable by the players.</p>
<p>Traversal has been improved, too, with moves such as double jumping, gliding, dodging, and grappling available. As with the previous entries, drop-in, drop-out cooperative gameplay is said to be the centerpiece of the game, and cross-play is also supported (although you'll need to sign up for a SHiFT Account to join fellow teammates from other platforms).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to debut on September 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-welcomes-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-darrington-press<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford have found a new home at Darrington Press. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">former</a> creative leads behind the most popular edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>will now collaborate with Critical Role's tabletop studio to produce new TTRPG experiences.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Darrington Press announced that Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford will be joining their design team. Perkins will be joining as the Creative Director, and Crawford's new role will be Game Director. They will be both developing novel game concepts and expanding upon games previously released by Darrington Press.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darrington-press-daggerheart-promo-photo.jpg?itok=XMh1zPSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darrington-press-daggerheart-promo-photo.jpg?itok=Xp3hdetL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both of these roles are strongly aligned with Perkins' and Crawford's skills. Perkins was the Senior Story Designer for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition, playing a key role in shaping the official campaign modules and settings of the fantasy TTRPG. Crawford was the lead system designer for Fifth Edition, introducing the highly influential Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic.</p>

<p>Perkins and Crawford recently left Wizards of the Coast after working on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a> Core Rulebooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Storytelling has always been at the heart of everything I do, and joining Darrington Press feels a bit like coming home,” said Perkins, Creative Director of Darrington Press. “I’ve loved being a part of the extended Critical Role family as a regular guest over the years and I’m beyond excited to help create new worlds full of adventure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition of Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford to the core design team has continued to expand Darrington Press' clout. There is a strong possibility they can bring their substantive experience to guide and build upon the company's <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/success-with-fear-daggerheart-sold-out/" rel="nofollow">best-selling</a> hit, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>. Alternatively, their new position offers new creative freedom to try different things away from Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>Either way, this shift of talent is huge for the tabletop industry as a whole, one that will lead to ongoing competition and innovation.</p>

She gained fame in the United Kingdom for her role in the Doctor Who serial Mind of Evil, which originally broadcast in 1971; she is also remembered for her role in the British military drama Spearhead.

                <p>Roger Clark, who voiced Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, has revealed his newest project--and it's out soon. It's not another western, but instead a game about cats.</p><p>Clark is lending his voice to Ultra Mega Cats, a PvE co-op shooter "where badass cats battle waves of enemies in explosive arenas." Clark is voicing the feline Clint, and he described his work on the game as <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934660290420822433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"another wild ride in the gaming world."</a> Clint is a cowboy cat who dual-wields pistols, so while this role is unexpected and very different, it does harken back to Clark's most famous role in Rockstar's Western.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCut0thGMIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oCut0thGMIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultra Mega Cats has players controlling so-called Mega Cats, which are basically cats with super-abilities and incredible power.</p><p>"Imagine living in a world flipped upside down, where rodents and feathered forces rule and cats are shunned. You're one of the last cats standing--disgraced, brainwashed, and trained to serve your former prey as their personal killing machine," reads a line from the game's description. "But that is not enough, as the cat's soul knows no master! Awaken your inner predator and restore balance to this world!"</p><p>There are five different cats in Ultra Mega Cats, including two who will be available when the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1882130/Ultra_Mega_Cats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launches into Steam Early Access on June 17</a>. Each cat has 50 different modifications that can be unlocked over time. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Ultra Mega Cats.</p><p>After Red Dead Redemption II, Clark also had voice roles in Back 4 Blood and Tactics Ogre: Reborn, among other projects.</p><p>As for the Red Dead series, John Marston actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-john-marston-actor-teases-exciting-news-coming-soon/1100-6532444/" data-ref-id="1100-6532444">Rob Wiethoff has teased big news for this week</a> amid reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II heading to Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </a></p>

                <p>Fortnite has lost its crown. Grow a Garden, the breakout game on Roblox, has broken the concurrent-player-count record.

The battle royale held the previous record of 14.3 million.</p><p>Grow a Garden is an idle video game where a garden changes between sessions. Released in March, it has players plant crops and flowers and design their own garden. The plants will grow when they are offline, making for a nice surprise when they log back on.</p><p>"Grow a Garden has more players than New Zealand and Norway combined," wrote Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/comment/mxqxrim/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agentsunnyside7_4</a> in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/grow_a_garden_has_now_broken_the_record_for_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a> that covered the huge player-count news. "If it [were] a country, it would be the 78th-most-populated country, behind Rwanda and above Burundi."</p><p>A recent promotion gave players a free pet if they were online when an update was released. They had to be online at the exact time the Working Bee update dropped in order to receive the Cooked Owl pet, giving a clear reason for why so many players were online over the weekend.</p><p>Grow a Garden--while not especially unique compared to similar titles--has captured the minds of millions of Roblox players. It's approachable with nearly no learning curve. It's resonated with players of all ages and has a huge audience in Asia.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-%E2%80%98neo%E2%80%99.1219821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-neo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, French cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-impressions-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHADOW</a> announced '<a href="https://shadow.tech/shadowpc/offers/#pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neo</a>', a new tier of its cloud gaming offering. Neo replaces the previous 'Boost' tier with much-improved specifications, delivering greatly accelerated performance in gaming (up to 150%) and software (up to 200%). All current subscribers at the Boost tier have been upgraded to Neo, which is still priced at $37.99 monthly, taxes excluded. These are the updated specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD EPYC – 8 vCores @ 3.25-3.8GHz</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Equivalent to NVIDIA RTX 4060 16GB (Server-grade NVIDIA RTX 2000 ADA 16GB)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR5</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 1Gb/s fiber connection</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11</li>
</ul>
<p>Olivier Abecassis, CEO at Shadow, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Neo is our newest and most versatile cloud PC yet. Whether you’re gaming in 2K with RTX and DLSS, editing complex 3D models, or working on the go, Shadow Neo gives you the power of a high-end PC — instantly and from anywhere.</em></p>
<p>The new configuration supports DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.3, RTX, DLSS, FSR, and Frame Generation. This, however, raises the question of whether the Power tier makes any sense anymore. Currently, Power provides access to a similar CPU and an older GPU, the RTX 3070 Ti. When factoring in the fact that the RTX 4060 has access to DLSS Frame Generation while the RTX 3070 Ti does not, paying $50 for the Power tier does not make much sense, as the performance is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmAG4PL7Nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly the same</a> in some games. SHADOW will have to upgrade this tier too shortly to make it viable again.</p>
<p>Overall, you might be baffled to hear about such high prices compared to, for example, NVIDIA's GeForce NOW platform, which lets you rent an RTX 4080-class GPU for $20 monthly. The big difference is that SHADOW gives you access to a whole PC, so you can use it however you see fit. That means installing any kind of software, or, staying within the gaming subject, being able to install mods for your PC games, which isn't really possible on GeForce NOW (or similar competitors like Boosteroid).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has finally provided an update on how things are going with the highly anticipated Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and the update is that they're still working on it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">post on the studio's official Prince of Persia X account</a>, Ubisoft simply says, "<em>Yep, we're still deep in the game - exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. This game is being created by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us</em>."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642139247321113">follow-up post</a>, Ubisoft reminds players that there's another Prince of Persia game they could go play right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>While development continues behind the scenes, there's another adventure waiting for you right now: The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>."</p>
<p>The post also includes a new piece of art from the game, displaying the exterior of one of the buildings those who played the original game will remember.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Last month, the company's annual earnings report confirmed that the remake will be out by<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> March 2026</a>, which is only a small update from the game's previous release window of '<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">sometime in 2026</a>'.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-will-expand-farahs-character-long-development-time-is-due-to-high-remake-bar/">previously spoken</a> about having a high bar for this remake, which is evident from the fact that the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">entirely rebooted the game's development once before</a>, after its initial reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">failed to impress</a>.</p>
<p>It may be upsetting for fans of the series who are looking forward to this remake that there's still basically no update on how things are going, but it's also not surprising given <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">Ubisoft's muted appearance during this year's Summer Game Fest festivities</a>. And with the lack of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft Forward</a> event for 2025, it's not worth holding your breath on any major updates from Ubisoft this year.</p>

But sadly, these players won’t be able to share the pitch with folks on other platforms at launch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early in the morning on June 16</a></span>, just hours before <em>Rematch’s </em>paid early access period kicked off, Sloclap confirmed that the online soccer game won’t support crossplay at launch and didn’t give a timeline on when it will arrive. </p><p>“Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won’t be available at launch, but it’s one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! We’ll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!”</p><p>Many people were frustrated by the short notice, and others were disappointed that they wouldn’t be able to play <em>Rematch </em>with friends on other consoles at launch or soon after. However, the developers had previously hinted that crossplay might not be available on day one. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdoes-rematch-have-cross-progression-and-cross-play-v0-kv8cnw0s4b6f1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D59e813b8a508135e2436384fca45e0f75fcd4080&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fdoes-rematch-have-cross-progression-and-cross-play-v0-kv8cnw0s4b6f1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D59e813b8a508135e2436384fca45e0f75fcd4080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That warning came in March in the game’s official Discord server</a></span>, with a Sloclap rep saying the team was doing its best to get crossplay in <em>Rematch </em>ready for launch, but couldn’t guarantee it would happen. That same rep claimed it would be added shortly after launch via an update if the team couldn’t get the feature working in time. </p><p>It is a bit funny how, in 2025, the idea of an online video game launching without crossplay is news. A few years ago, crossplay was still a relatively new concept, and it wasn’t a guarantee that a multiplayer game would support letting Xbox and PlayStation people play together. Now, if your game doesn’t ship with crossplay, it’s weird, and people get mad. We all really got used to crossplay being a given in a short amount of time, huh? </p><p><em>Rematch </em>is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC if you paid extra for the fancier editions of the game. It launches for everyone on June 19, when it will also become available via Game Pass on Xbox. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
