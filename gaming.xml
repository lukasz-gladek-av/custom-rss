			<p>Along with Microsoft and Xbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">hiking the price of Xbox Game Pass up by 50%</a>, the three tiers of Game Pass also changed, adding new features for each tier. But it also seems like some features were removed, namely the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers would get on add-ons for Call of Duty, including COD Points.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279">CharlieINTEL on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, prior to the price change, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription got you discounts on games included in Game Pass, and in the case of Call of Duty, subscribers also a 10% discount on Call of Duty cosmetic add-ons and COD Points. Not anymore though.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty - including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's the latest example of Microsoft sending a clear message that playing games on Xbox and using Xbox services, including Game Pass, are no longer for people trying to save money on their annual gaming spend.</p>



<p>Removing a 10% discount is the kind of squeezing that, after a price hike for Game Pass, which followed a price hike of the Xbox Series consoles in the US (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">the second console price hike this year</a>), will only work to drive a bigger and bigger wedge between Xbox and its players. It's the kind of thing that leads people who have been with the Xbox platform since the beginning <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-xbox-generation-will-be-remembered-for-one-thing-greed">to write features lambasting the greed Microsoft has shown</a>.</p>



<p>Pretty much everything coming out of Xbox lately has told players they will have to pay a premium to play games on Xbox. It's no wonder that after the console price hikes, Microsoft removing the ability for players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">redeem Microsoft Points towards Game Pass subs</a>, and of course, the price hike of Game Pass itself, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">players swarmed to Microsoft's website to cancel their Game Pass subscriptions</a>.</p>



<p>Actual living essentials are already increasing and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">encouraging people to spend less on non-essential areas of their lives, like videogames</a>. The decision to leave Xbox and its services behind is made even easier when Microsoft is simultaneously raising prices and removing discounts.  </p>

            <p>Lo, when we perform the great ritual to open the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> beta, the cheaters will come. That's what Activision said a few days ago, more or less. Hark, friends and foes enveloped in tactical gear and the occasional goofy crossover skin, it's now a few days later and the cheatening is upon us. It arrived with the beta going live, just as prophesised.</p>
<!--more--> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Cue posts like the one above, from helpless souls caught in the frothing swirl of the cheatening maelstrom. And cue responses from Activision's powerful anti-cheat druids, writing of these foretold ritual side-effects things like: "This clip was from earlier today. The account was already banned."</p>
<p>The bearded warders against the likes of wallhacks and aimbotting have even broken out a powerful magical artefact, the hammer emoji of reassurance, in their responses to clips like this, a number of which went viral on the tweeter last night. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/">Reddit</a>, as a far as I can tell, looks relatively free of such clippage or anger about cheating, which is a sign of the end times if I've ever seen one.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>It's at this point that Activision would want us all to take solace in their prediction from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">this blog post</a> a few days ago, AKA the prophecy I paraphrased earlier. "Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta," it read. "That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear. Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> to future releases."</p><p>Obviously, this isn't an affliction unique to Call of Duty. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-battlefield-6-betas-hacking-problem-shows-the-difficulty-in-playing-cat-and-mouse-with-cheaters">James eloquently outlined when Battlefield 6's beta was similarly afflicted by cheating</a>, despite both it and Blops 7 seeing studios take the extra step of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">making it mandatory for PC players to enable secure boot</a> in an effort to curb tech-savvy tricksters. The debate is whether continuing to take more and more measures like that in an effort to whack whatever persistent cheating moles keep popping up or slipping through the array of defenses already assembled is worth any inconvenience caused to those playing fairly as a result.</p>
<p>It's a delicate balance to strike, and where you stand on the issue may well depend on just how many cheaters you've happened to run into in online games over the years and the situations in which those encounters happened.  In Black Ops 7's case, there's also arguably a little bit of irony in Activion's strong stance, due to the ability to temporarily see and shoot foes through several layers of wall, a bit like some cheats allow you to do permanently, actually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amid-call-of-dutys-war-on-cheating-black-ops-7-says-ehh-whatever-heres-a-wallhack-esque-killstreak">being in the game as a killstreak reward</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I await Black Ops 7's full release on November 14th, at which point I prophesise that the cheating chatter will emerge once more. That's provided the round of cheat chatter prompted by Battlefield 6's arrival on October 10th has actually managed to dissipate by mid-November.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-hiring-a-director-of-generative-ai-for-gaming-with-a-starting-salary-of-up-to-840k.1315687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Netflix’s gaming strategy <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122">has yet to take clear shape</a>, but generative AI could end up being a big part of it. Or at least that’s what the company seems to hope for, based on a recent job posting. The <em>Squid Games </em>and <em>Stranger Things</em> streaming giant is looking to hire a director of generative AI for gaming to potentially lead implementation of the experimental technology across its game studios. They’ll be paid up to $840K for the honor.</p> <p>Shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kendrawcandraw.bsky.social/post/3m2aecshw2k2e">on Bluesky</a> by the comic writer and artist Kendra Wells, <a href="https://explore.jobs.netflix.net/careers?query=AI&amp;pid=790304524254&amp;domain=netflix.com&amp;sort_by=relevance">the listing</a> describes how this prospective leader within the company’s gaming division will “define and lead the Gen AI strategy across Netflix Games, helping to shape foundational infrastructure to player-facing features” and “identify and evaluate opportunities to apply Gen AI across our portfolio and studios both in the creation of new experiences and improving our workflows and pipelines.”</p>

 <p>The position, posted back in September, is onsite in Los Angeles, California and, thanks to state disclosure laws, advertises a salary band of $430,000 to $840,000. Netflix laid off developers at its <em>Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio who probably weren’t making close to a million each <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">earlier this year</a>.</p>   <p>This isn’t Netflix’s first foray into generative AI gaming. The division’s previous boss, Mike Verdu, held the title VP of GenAI for Games until earlier this year when he <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc">abruptly left the company</a>. “Many view this technology with fear, but I am a game-maker at heart and I see its potential to unlock all of us, to create mind-blowing new experiences for players, to lift us to new heights,” the industry veteran <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7259029850827423744/">wrote in a 2024 LinkedIn post</a> complete with AI-slop imagery. “Yes, we’ll have to adapt and change, but when have we failed to meet that challenge as an industry?”</p> <p>His replacement, former Epic Games exec Alain Tascan, took over in March and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spirit-crossing-netflix-trailer-mobile-tv-cozy-mmo-sim-1851771671">said Netflix’s evolving gaming strategy</a> would focus on party games, narrative games, and quick mobile adaptations of its hit franchises. Its first Smart TV games are supposed to launch later this year, while <em>Spirit</em> <em>Crossing</em>, a cozy MMO sim that mashes together <em>Animal Crossing</em> and Studio Ghibli vibes, will be the test of whether it can finally deliver a breakout hit. It walked away from <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">its AAA blockbuster gaming ambitions last year</a>. Who knows if this exploration of generative AI-influenced gaming will be just as short-lived?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> takes up around 150GB to install on PC (three times larger than on console), and the game's deputy technical director has now explained why that won't be changing anytime soon.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">blog post on Steam</a>, Arrowhead's Brendan Armstrong explained for the PC version the developers utilised data duplication to reduce loading times, something that's primarily used to optimise games for HDDs.</p>
<p>As the older storage drives use a physical arm to read data, duplicating that data can make it quicker to find and thereby reduce loading times. SSDs don't work in this way, which explains why the console versions of Helldivers 2 take up less storage space.</p>

<p>However, as Armstrong acknowledged, HDDs are part of the game's minimum specs on PC but the studio doesn't know how many players are still using them.</p>
<p>"Our best estimates put it at around 12 percent of all PC gamers but the data is very unreliable and relies on a lot of extrapolations," said Armstrong. "Until we can more accurately determine the number of mechanical HDDs that Helldivers 2 is installed on, it is difficult to know how many players will be impacted by reducing the amount of data duplication. Even if that number is small, keep in mind that the load time for each player dropping into a mission is determined by the slowest member of the squad."</p>
<p>Still, the studio is "actively exploring" a number of solutions for the future, although it "cannot eliminate all duplication without making loading times for mechanical HDDs 10 times slower and we do not feel that this is acceptable".</p>
<p>In the short term, unused assets will be removed in the next update, though these will be replaced by new additions so won't reduce the amount of storage space required.</p>
<p>A medium term solution is to bundle frequently used assets and remove duplicates, though Armstrong admitted this would increase load times for players using HDDs. In the long term, engine improvements are planned to not waste RAM loading data that isn't needed.</p><p>A further solution would be to make the highest resolution textures an optional download. However, this isn't natively supported in Arrowhead's engine so would be a substantial project, Armstrong explained. As such, time on this would not be spent elsewhere on optimising performance or fixing stability issues.</p>
<p>"We're taking your concerns very seriously but there are no easy solutions," Armstrong surmised. "Until we live in a world where we know that most of our PC players are using SSD drives, sacrificing some extra hard drive space is necessary to ensure we're all able to load into missions in a reasonable amount of time. We've clearly reached the limits of how much duplicated data is acceptable so smarter solutions and compromises are now required. We are very carefully weighing up the costs and tradeoffs of the options we have, and we'll be sure to find a better balance between loading times and installation size soon."</p>
<p>As a broader issue of game size, Armstrong's reasoning explains why many modern games on PC now require an SSD, even as a minimum requirement. Arrowhead has instead aimed Helldivers 2 at a wider spectrum of PC specs, but this comes at a storage cost.</p>
<p>This blog post is the first of what the developer aims to be a series of posts detailing the technical challenges it's working on.</p>
<p>An update for Helldivers 2 is due later this month to alleviate a number of performance issues players are currently experiencing, particularly as the game has grown in size and content since release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform">Helldivers 2 also made its way to Xbox Series X/S consoles</a> back in August, becoming the first Sony-published game on the platform and further broadening the audience.</p>

              <p>Prime Big Deals Day is coming next week. Through the day on October 7 and October, you can save big on a ton of great stuff all across Amazon. Whatever it is you’ve been waiting on for a good deal, you might be able to finally pull the trigger as you see the price drop low. We’ll be seeing products across every category from power banks to microwaves to other power banks going on sale. If you are feeling antsy and don’t want to wait that wrong for something to give you that hit of dopamine that buying new things give you, good news. There are already some great stuff on sale right now. Do you like Lego? Of course you do. Everyone does. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/">Well, this Lego dancing Groot set has dropped from $45 to just $36. That 20% savings amounts to $9 you get to keep in your wallet.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>This Groot Actually Dances</h2>
<p>Groot who first showed up on the big screen in 2014’s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;</em>has taken many shapes and sizes in his various appearances throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the comics before that. Though, it is this writer’s humble opinion that the best version of this walking tree man is the one that didn’t walk at all. You may have forgotten he was once smaller than Baby Groot in the second&nbsp;<em>Guardians</em> flick. In the post credits scene following the first of the trilogy, we saw the new Groot come to life as a tiny twig in his pot, dancing to the music stylings of The Jackson 5.</p>
<p>This dancing Groot can be yours in Lego form. The <strong>459-piece set</strong> is fully posable with a head and arms that turn and move. At the back of the pot once fully constructed is a handle you can crank which makes Groot waist shift back and forth and arms go up and down, effectively making the little guy dance right before your eyes.</p>



<p>The flower pot can also be used to store extra pieces and accessories. The dancing Lego Groot does come with three different name plates. One depicts his iconic catchphrase (and practically only phrase), “I am Groot.” Another has the title on the movie while the last also shows the title of the movie but in James Gunn’s made-up space language. Lego Groot also comes with some extra leaves, headphones, and eve sunglasses which can be added or removed like some kind of modern-day Mr. Potato Head.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4464/">The Lego dancing Groot make for a great gift for Marvel fans of all ages. Get it for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>

              <p>Players are still <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">discovering new ways</a> in which their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=+kotaku+xbox+game+pass&amp;sca_esv=1001961491ba09a8&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOqnIJ-sk57N88LRgENtAPrEj6Ttg%3A1759496735838&amp;ei=H8rfaKH2MrOqptQPq6vCwQg&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhgbGPjIiQAxUzlYkEHauVMIgQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=+kotaku+xbox+game+pass&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFiBrb3Rha3UgeGJveCBnYW1lIHBhc3NISFAAWABwAHgBkAEAmAEAoAEAqgEAuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIAoAIAmAMA4gMFEgExIECSBwCgBwCyBwC4BwDCBwDIBwA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">are getting worse</a>. <em>Call of Duty</em> is the latest target, with a 10-percent discount on <em>Call of Duty</em> points and add-on content like the BlackCell premium battle pass bundles. While small, the savings can quickly add up for dedicated fans over the annual lifecycle of a new entry in the series like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>.</p> <p>Spotted <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973938451830747279%7Ctwgr%5E2120216adb854b9deedab5678f7e582be9eee66d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, the 10-percent discount on buying<em> Call of Duty</em> points no longer appears for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers in the Xbox store. This impacts any add-on content players buy throughout the year, of which there is increasingly a ton. It’s another stealth nerf to the program not mentioned in Microsoft’s official blog post about the pricing changes this week. PC Game Pass going from $12 a month to $16.49 wasn’t listed either.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox has removed the 10% discount that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members could get on add-on content for Call of Duty – including removing the discount on Call of Duty Points and BlackCell as part of the changes to Game Pass this week. <a href="https://t.co/ipaMgENuwi">pic.twitter.com/ipaMgENuwi</a></p> <p>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973938451830747279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the second discount that’s eroded under the new version of what used to be considered the best deal in gaming. Microsoft is also capping the Xbox Rewards fans can earn at lower tiers of the Game Pass subscription, as well as removing the option to spend those loyalty program points on additional months of Game Pass for a cheaper price. “They’ve been slowly enshitifying Rewards for a while now but this really is the nail in the coffin for anyone who uses points to pay for Game Pass,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nujypo/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">wrote</a> one user on the subreddit. “You simply can’t earn enough in a month to pay for a month after this change.”</p> <p>Microsoft had previously teased the release of its first $80 games this fall beginning with<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em>, but ultimately ended up reversing course amid an ongoing backlash from players and likely soft-preorder numbers for the upcoming RPG shooter. So far at least, the tech giant hasn’t offered any signs it plans to compromise on the latest price hikes, even as it touts Game Pass’ profitability and annual revenue of $5 billion. “They’re on their villain arc,” one player <a href="https://x.com/MalikRules_/status/1973944018406179308">quipped</a> in response to the <em>Call of Duty</em> discount change.</p>

<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159347/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>Disgaea fans know the drill by now. Whenever a new mainline entry in the long-running tactical RPG series breaks onto the scene, it’s only a matter of time before it gets a re-released edition that bundles in the base game’s DLC along with a suite of gameplay tweaks and additions. It’s series tradition at this point, as every single numbered Disgaea game to date has received an expanded version (or even a couple) post-release. Now, with the Western release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a> at hand, the latest title in Nippon Ichi Software’s zany crown jewel of a franchise is ready to join its brethren in the Valhalla of unparalleled game definitiveness.</p>
<p>D7C takes 2023’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disgaea_7_vows_of_the_virtueless">Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless</a> and repackages it with a plethora of brand-new additions, like a special bonus campaign episode and a new superboss to conquer. The title doesn’t lie — this is the ultimate version of Disgaea 7 and it completely supersedes the original release as the ideal way to experience the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159353/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For some current and potential fans, that alone is reason enough to dive in on this release. That said, others — especially those who already picked up the base game on Switch or other platforms — may be wondering whether there’s enough value added to justify double-dipping. Unfortunately, the answer as to whether to pick up this definitive edition isn’t quite so definitive itself.</p>
<p>Just as in the base game, Disgaea 7 Complete centres upon the story of two unlikely leads. The ruthless demon warrior Fuji wanders the feudal Japan-inspired realm of Hinomoto, a land that has been plunged into a dark era under the ruling shogunate. In a chance meeting, he encounters Pirilika, a bubbly, ultra-rich corporate elite and self-proclaimed Hinomoto otaku. Spurred to action by the populace’s abandonment of bushidō (the Japanese term for the samurai code of honour), Pirilika contracts Fuji as her bodyguard, and the two embark on a wacky quest throughout the Netherworlds to gather the Founding Weapons and defeat the dark forces in control of Hinomoto.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159352/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Mitch’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless">original review of Disgaea 7</a>, he described the game as “the ultimate distillation of the Disgaea experience” and praised both its irreverent tone and its handling of the series’ classic gameplay hook of training units up to ludicrous power levels and dealing eye-popping amounts of damage in turn-based tactical battles. Those observations all still ring true for this re-release, so give Mitch’s review a readthrough for a deeper dive into the game’s core.</p>
<p>But the crux is this: There are very few tactics RPGs out there that can even hold a candle to the level of flexibility, depth, and freedom that Disgaea 7 offers in its gameplay. At every turn, you’re encouraged to experiment with and exploit the game’s mechanics, all in service of building a team that can utterly destroy even the most absurdly difficult challenges. Simply put, you get out what you put in, and the game can be as simplistic and straightforward or as mind-bendingly complex as you prefer.</p>
<p>Disgaea 7 Complete still has that same great core, but what actually sets it apart from the base game? Well, not much — during the core campaign, at least. For anyone who did play the game’s original release, those first 20 to 30 hours in which you progress through the main story are awfully familiar. Aside from all of the DLC episodes and bonuses being available from the get-go, the primary campaign here remains largely unchanged.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159351/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of its brand-new gameplay additions are locked behind the post-game, and some require a not-insignificant time investment to access. Returning players hoping to retain their hard-earned save file progress from the base game and skip right to the new stuff are out of luck, too, as there’s no upgrade path available between the two versions.</p>
<p>Not having any significant brand-new content to experience until the post-game is a bummer, but once you finally reach those fresh additions, they’re pretty neat. Perhaps the most substantial piece of new content is the Nethertime Support Force episode. This mini-campaign, set after the main story, sees Fuji, Pirilika, and the rest of the crew crossing paths with characters from previous Disgaea titles and engaging in a couple of fun and unique battle maps along the way.</p>
<p>For fans of the greater series, these crossover cameos serve as a great bit of fan service, though the lack of voice acting for these sequences is disappointing. Clearing this episode also unlocks Asagi — a legacy character who many Disgaea enthusiasts are no doubt acquainted with — as a playable unit, which is a nice little bonus.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159348/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from that, several exclusive post-game bills have been added to the Dark Assembly that offer some entertaining gameplay additions. The Freely Use Infernal Treasures! bill, when unlocked and passed, allows any unit you have to equip one of the titular weapons and enter the powered-up Hell Mode during battle. Then, there’s the Take Me Beyond the Limits! bill, which lifts the previously-held caps on unit stats and allows you to power them up to an even greater degree of insanity.</p>
<p>Offering yet more ways to tweak and strengthen your units is Disgaea’s bread and butter, and these smart additions give any unit you’ve trained — whether it’s a story-relevant character or a custom character you scouted and built from the ground up — an equal shot at becoming your team’s next big-hitter.</p>
<p>The final addition of note is the inclusion of a new, ultra-difficult superboss in the form of Rakshasa Baal. In keeping with superbosses from Disgaea history, this challenge is intended solely for those who are committed to spending hour after hour delving deep into the game’s mechanics and raising units to a formidable degree.</p>
<figure><a title="Disgaea 7 Complete Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159345/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While it’s cool to add yet another lofty objective for Disgaea devotees to clear, this last piece of content hammers home a crucial point about Disgaea 7 Complete: pretty much all of the new stuff added to this release exclusively appeals to pre-existing Disgaea players or people who intend to spend a ton (and I mean a ton) of time with the game once the main campaign has concluded. Even then, it’s not a revolutionary amount of new content, and franchise fans may have been hoping for a bit more to justify picking up this re-release.</p>
<p>I’d also be remiss in not mentioning the odd nature of Disgaea 7 Complete’s Western release. Even though the game launched in Japan in 2024 for the regular ol’ Switch, this localisation is launching exclusively on the Switch 2 with no Switch 1 version in sight (at least, at the time of review).</p>
<p>It’s certainly nice to play natively on Switch 2, on which performance is as smooth as can be, but it’s strange to eschew a localised Switch 1 version when the game can demonstrably run just fine on that hardware. This decision also means that Disgaea 7 Complete can only be purchased digitally or as a Game-Key Card, a move that is sure to ruffle the feathers of a number of would-be players.</p>

<p>Perhaps some substantial Switch 2 enhancements would have made this weird release strategy an easier pill to swallow, but there are none to speak of. I would have very much appreciated integration with the Switch 2’s mouse controls for the map cursor in the hopes of alleviating how finicky maps can get with varying elevations — my one major grievance with the moment-to-moment gameplay. Alas.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With how stellar a package the Vows of the Virtueless proved to be upon release, the expanded and feature-packed Disgaea 7 Complete should be a slam dunk of a recommendation to any tactical RPG fan — but re-releases are rarely that simple. For anyone who missed out on the original the first time around, this version is every bit as great and stands tall as the ultimate, feature-complete iteration of the game.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s no denying that the handful of brand-new content additions fall on the niche side and mostly serve those who want to live and breathe Disgaea 7 for their next hundred-plus hours of game time. Even stalwart fans who loved the base game may want to think twice before dropping the price of admission on this updated version and starting from scratch for a couple of post-game goodies.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, DOOM: The Dark Ages became the sixth PC game (not counting RTX remakes like those made for Quake II and Portal) to support real-time path tracing after Cyberpunk 2077, DESORDRE, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>id Software's latest entry in the DOOM franchise did not support the technology at launch. Still, a month later, on June 18, 2025, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-pc-performance-slaying-demons-never-looked-better-nvidia-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released an update introducing path tracing and NVIDIA's DLSS Ray Reconstruction</a>. Both features significantly improved the game's visual quality and made it, alongside its excellent performance, a benchmark against which developers must compare their work.</p>



<p>This week, NVIDIA <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/how-id-software-used-neural-rendering-and-path-tracing-in-doom-the-dark-ages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a Q&amp;A with id Software's Director of Engine Technology</a>, Billy Khan, to discuss the studio's implementation of path tracing. According to Khan, it took the Texas-based studio around six months to implement the technology in their game. The programmer also shared the belief that more games will make the leap from ray tracing to path tracing in the coming years.  </p>



<p><em>Path tracing is now part of id Tech 8. We’ll continue research and development in this area. As with all technology, we evaluate its use on a per-game basis to ensure it meets the needs of the game and delivers value to players. I believe path tracing will continue to evolve and will be used in more games in the coming years. </em></p>



<p>Of course, game developers' adoption will likely accelerate if, as rumored, future AMD graphics cards <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-details-how-next-gen-udna-gpus-could-boost-ray-tracing-with-dense-geometry-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are going to offer significant ray tracing optimizations</a>. Meanwhile, Khan mentioned NVIDIA's Opacity Micro-Maps and Shader Execution Reordering, the latter specifically, as highly helpful for optimization in DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>



<p><em>For high-performance, visually complex scenes, optimizing both surface shading and transparency is crucial. Techniques that allow the GPU to intelligently reorder shading work and skip unnecessary calculations—like on pixels fully occluded by alpha-tested geometry—yield significant speedups. Both NVIDIA Opacity Micro-Map (OMM) and Shader Execution Reordering (SER) have been extremely useful for optimizing surface shading on the GPU. Some of our biggest optimizations for path tracing resulted from utilizing shader execution reordering.</em></p>



<p>Lastly, Khan noted that DLSS RR really helped surface all the amazing details enabled by path tracing.</p>



<p><em>DLSS Ray Reconstruction added much-needed fidelity to denoising our path-traced results while preserving more detail. It’s a strong improvement in performance and quality over traditional denoising techniques. I’m excited to see further innovation here, which will empower more devices to play games with higher visual fidelity.</em></p>



<p>Did you play DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our game review is here</a>, by the way) with path tracing on? If so, what was your impression of id Software's implementation? </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first episode of Critical Role Campaign 4 is now available, and with it the first episode helmed by Brennan Lee Mulligan, played in by Matthew Mercer and his fellow twelve players, and our introduction to the world of Araman and its people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Critical Role: Campaign 4 doesn't start with a bang. With a fiery explosion or a world on the brink, but with a quiet moment. A moment between brothers, one whose neck is about to have a noose tied around it, and the other who is trying to do what they can to save him.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-character-sheets.jpg?itok=g3TkADRh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-character-sheets.jpg?itok=GLAE1h__ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Liam starts at the table alone as Halandil Fang. For a table that shifts between a dozen characters I was a bit worried going into the season about how disorienting getting introduced to so many characters would be. Getting to meet just one, join them in their hope for a way to save their brother, and then watch it all be for nought what a perfect introduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here we move through an afternoon of mourning at the Fang home as Azure, Luis, brings the body to the wake. Aabria and Alex arrive to confirm Hal and pay respects, and a variety of other colorful (black is a color too) characters that had ties to Thiazi.</p>

<p>I would have never expected for a funeral to be the perfect place to introduce these characters but as ever character filed in we were able to perfectly get an introduction to them from who they are in the context of the city, who they are in relation to Thiazi and each other, what part they had to play in trying to rescue him, and how they're feeling that the plan was not successful…</p>

<p>There was some unavoidable word vomit of noble houses, places within the city and across the land of Araman, and factions but it never felt like knowing or focusing on that was important as you were drawn into such a relatable feeling of loss.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-aabria-and-ashley_0.jpg?itok=6sGwgysk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-aabria-and-ashley_0.jpg?itok=wGNkzUKd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Among the characters introduced, while all were fascinating to watch, Aabria Iengar and Ashley Johnson gave elevated performances.</p>

<p>From the moment Aabria arrived she brought with her the energy of a mother, a friend and partner, and a mentor. Once again playing the ex of another party member this time the relationship isn't a strained one, but one of two people on different paths.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This energy continued to evolve as she had a speedy "enemies to best friends" moment with Tyranny, had nothing but love for Arinessa, and an intense hatred for Sir Julien Davison. I particularly loved the way that Aabria used her druid abilities, creating vines and a beast spirit to continue conferring funeral rights, that she was able to project her characters internal emotions for all to see while not having to resort to soliloquy.</p>

<p>Immediately, I recognized what Sam Riegel spoke to me about last week, that in this larger group it became all the more important for characters to take what time they have and shine bright. Subtlety famously isn't great in actual plays so it's important the audience understands characters relationships and intentions, especially when meeting so many over the house of four hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Johnson's character, an immortal drow still engaged by the loss of their God, was stoic and cold from start to finish. From the moment she approached the table she dominated the scene while remaining cool and collected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it was incredible to see Johnson so deep in her role it was just as wonderful to see Brennan ask her to roll a side and her immediately panic and she attempted to wake her tablet and remember what her Insight bonus is.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-whitney-and-sam_0.jpg?itok=cpwqgfjF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-c4e1-whitney-and-sam_0.jpg?itok=5gtmiVKG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>So far the character that I feel was the least developed in the ensemble was Tyranny. A tiefling rebelling against polite society whose present situation, and notable anecdote include getting drunk and throwing up did feel shallow compared to the other performances. Her and Riegel did have a fun double act between the performative holy man and the devil trying to act better.</p>

<p>Each other character seems established in their roles and who they are, and it's in this way that Tyranny has a serious narrative advantage. Currently she's a blank slate, a character with so much room to grow and hundreds of game hours to develop. Episode 1 might not be my favorite, but I can't wait to see Tyranny in 10, 30, 100 episodes time.</p>

<p>Outside of character introductions, a mystery was being set up, and a macguffin has gone missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following who I assume will be the more soldiery characters of Teor, Azure, Thimble, Kattigan, (and maybe Occtis?) we are presented with a number of unanswered questions: How was Thimble found and attacked? Who got away with the Stone of Nightsone? Is there a traitor in their midsts? If the sigil was still with Thimble, then what was it that Hal detected on Thiazi?</p>

<p>These kinds of questions getting mentioned, but never dwelled on was a perfect way to sew the seeds of intrigue.</p>

<p>We're one episode in, statistically less than 1% of the way into the campaign, but so far it's very promising. In just a single episode I feel that the plot has done an excellent job introducing us to characters and beginning to intrigue the players and viewers as to where this story might be heading next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we continue through the overture, and players play musical chairs diving in and out of scenes I feel that everything is going to continue to be a bit confusing and fast paced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the true strength of the campaign will be seen once smaller groups are made, goals are known, and we're able to really get into the meat of the campaign.</p>

This updated model offers a USB-C connection for compatible iPhone 15 and up, and it's also compatible with Android phones. Some of the noteworthy changes include larger grips with a textured finish, full-sized ALPS analog sticks, Hall Effect triggers, two remappable back buttons, and "carbon-pill" face buttons that are quieter when pressed. All the inputs you'd expect from a modern-day controller are here, so you can jump right into a game of Genshin Impact or Call of Duty.</p><p>App functionality also expands on the functionality of the Backbone Pro, and overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-pro-is-a-larger-more-customizable-version-of-the-best-mobile-controller/1100-6531316/">this model improves</a> on the

<p>Of course, being something of a master builder ourselves <em>*shines counterfeit master builder badge*</em>, we already got our hands on one, and have been busy building away at a set that, for the price of $59.99/£54.99, has provided a whole lot of very nice nostalgia.</p>
<p>Indeed, given that this particular writer is fond of the odd adult Lego set or two, this dinky little gaming delight really has stood out as one of the more fun builds that the company has put out in a while. What grabs you most at first, obviously, is the incredible attention to detail.

<p>The real joy, though, comes in piecing together the layers of history; the Game Boy's little circuit board, those iconic 'A' and 'B' buttons and so on, with each significant part being put together and set to feel just like the real thing in lots of creative ways: a little rubber Lego piece under the D-Pad so it moves around and reacts as it should; the on/off switch is <em>just</em> stiff enough; the volume and contrast wheels move just like we remember, and on and on.</p>

<p>Oh, and you've got to see these little lenticular screens actually moving. There are different qualities when it comes to these things, and these ones are top-notch; the Nintendo Logo, along with the Zelda and Mario Bros. scenes that come with the set, are a lot of fun to lay into the 'screen' inset for display. They've even managed to make loading the carts feel perfect (they click into place very satisfyingly), and the interchangeable screens are easy to remove and replace, meaning we'll actually switch them out from time to time.</p>
<p>There are a few other surprises hidden throughout the build — little attentions to detail all around — but we won't ruin <em>everything!</em> Here are some more shots of our own build:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-loses-out-to-modded-nintendo-switch-%E2%80%9Cpro%E2%80%9D-in-some-backward-compatible-games-comparison-shows.1315585/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is considerably more powerful than its predecessor, but a recent online comparison shows the original Switch could have held its own better against the new console with a few key hardware tweaks.</p>



<p>The video comparison shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">naga</a> compares loading speed, handheld and docked performance in multiple games, and battery life between the current generation Nintendo system and <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-playstation-3-games-rpcs3/">an overclocked modded "pro" version of a Nintendo Switch OLED</a>. The modded system's hardware includes an overclocked CPU (1707 MHz) and GPU (1724 MHz), 8 GB of RAM, an upgraded 8600 mAh battery, and modded cooling to prevent damage to the system.</p>



<p>While loading speed in games such as The Witcher 3, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is much faster on Nintendo Switch 2, the difference isn't massive in other games, such as Hogwarts Legacy. Even in terms of handheld and docked performance in backward-compatible games, the differences aren't huge. </p>



<p>In GRID Autosport in handheld mode, for example, the two systems are an almost complete match, with the Nintendo Switch 2 sporting better frametimes thanks to its more powerful CPU. Docked performance is also impressive on the modded Nintendo Switch, as Zelda: Breath of the Wild runs at close to 60 FPS most of the time, although at a clearly lower resolution than the Nintendo Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>In some unpatched games, however, the performance comparison between the two systems becomes more interesting. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, the modded Nintendo Switch runs the game at smooth 60 FPS, as opposed to the locked 30 FPS on Nintendo Switch 2. The modded system can run Metroid Prime Remastered at 1440p resolution while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. With Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, the modded Nintendo Switch also has no trouble pushing the framerate to a steady 60 FPS, while the unpatched game on Nintendo Switch 2 continues to be locked at 30 FPS.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While comparing how unpatched backward compatible games run on the two systems may be a little unfair, the comparison shows how some design decisions, such as the limited amount of RAM, held back the original Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have similar constraints, and it shows, as it runs some PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S ports surprisingly well, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-better-anticipated-switch-2-footage/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. The new entry in the CAPCOM series, in particular, is setting out to be another benchmark release for the system, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-devs-surprised-how-well-it-runs-switch-2/">even the development team was surprised at how well the game runs on the system.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/megabonk-sales-1m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/3d-survivors-like-megabonk-sells-a-million-copies-in-two-weeks.1315582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher vedinad has announced that their 3D&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque roguelite game&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;has managed to hit a major sales milestone within its first two weeks on sale.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1973773917040111965" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has crossed a million sales since it was released on September 18th. Humorously, vedinad says they'll be "eating spaghetti with EXTRA sauce tonight" as a result of the sales milestone.</p>

<p>The developer also says they "really appreciate" the feedback fans have provided for&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>since its launch, and that there are "definitely a lot of things [they] wanna fix and change". A roadmap could be on the way, but vedinad says they're taking a few days off due to being "a bit overwhelmed and tired", so don't expect it imminently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=CqtAF_0H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/megabonk-sales-1m-running.jpg?itok=QJ9wTizz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>has racked up a million sales since being released around two weeks ago.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Megabonk</em>'s million-sale milestone puts it in the same league as games like Konami's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">Silent Hill f</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></i>, both of which had hit a million sales at last count, although they got there a little quicker (as you'd expect from established franchises).</p>

<p>In indie terms,&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is now on the same page as hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">driving roguelite&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em></a>, so however you slice it, vedinad's game is in some pretty good company.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Megabonk</em>, it's an action roguelite that combines the wave-based combat of games like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>with full 3D movement and traversal, adding another layer to the formula's strategy element.</p>

<p>Just like in&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque games, you'll have to survive against infinite waves of enemies in procedurally-generated maps, but you'll now have to worry about things like verticality and positioning yourself in a 3D space.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll set you back $10 or your regional equivalent. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-voice-behind-mortal-kombats-toasty-is-leaving-netherrealm.1315573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games have given us as many iconic one-liners as NetherRealm's fighting franchise, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat"><u>Mortal Kombat</u></a>, but this week we've learned that the voice behind one of the most famous — "Toasty!" — is leaving the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Audio director Dan Forden worked at Midway and its successor NetherRealm Studios since 1989, most famously on the Mortal Kombat franchise. It's his voice we hear cry "Toasty!" in falsetto when we pull off an impressive uppercut. First appearing in 1993's Mortal Kombat II, Toasty went on to become one of the most recognizable lines of dialogue in all video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, however, Forden is leaving NetherRealm, writing in a heartfelt message on social media that he was "really proud of what [the studio] accomplished."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Wednesday was my last day at NetherRealm. We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff," Forden wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPTnVKxE6Ch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Instagram</u></a>. "There are so many smart, talented people there — look for more great things to emerge over the next several years. I love the little touches that people left around the studio like this little Toasty homage on the bathroom mirror.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wouldn’t have lasted 37 years in the industry if fans weren’t out there playing the games we made. Thanks to all of you for supporting what we’ve done. Live long and… Toasty!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked in the comments why he was leaving now, Forden explained: "I figured I’d been around long enough. Want to reclaim that time for my own interests."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forden's exit comes at an uncertain time for NetherRealm, which is owned by Warner Bros. In May, the studio confirmed what Mortal Kombat 1 fans feared after the launch of the Definitive Edition: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/confirmed-mortal-kombat-1-wont-get-any-more-dlc-characters-or-story-chapters-as-netherrealm-needs-to-shift-focus-to-the-next-project">no new DLC characters or story chapters would be released for the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, development chief Ed Boon said Mortal Kombat 1 had sold over 6.2 million copies. Its predecessor, Mortal Kombat 11, became the best-selling game in the franchise by passing Mortal Kombat X's nearly 11 million units sold worldwide soon after launch. By 2022, Mortal Kombat 11 had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Clearly, Mortal Kombat 1 has underperformed compared to previous games in the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">NetherRealm has said it shifted to "focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can," but it has yet to say what it is. Current speculation points to Injustice 3, a continuation of NetherRealm’s DC fighting game series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what else is happening in the Mortal Kombat world? Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection, developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Atari, launches at the end of October. Movie sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/mortal-kombat-ii"><u>Mortal Kombat II</u></a>  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-ii-movie-delayed-will-release-next-summer"><u>has been delayed from October 24, 2025, to May 15, 2026</u></a>. It's thought Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema believe the movie — which stars Karl Urban alongside Adeline Rudolph, Jessica McNamee, Josh Lawson, Ludi Lin, Mehcad Brooks, Tati Gabrielle, Lewis Tan, and more — will perform better at the summer box office given the wild fan response to the trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/1GWh4H4Xc18?si=SMYBdBX3RhXa_Mlr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Atari / YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all Call of Duty titles, from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to future releases.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision had highlighted its new aimbot detection, which it said is “one of the strongest detection systems we have ever built,” and its new wall hacking detections, “making it harder for cheaters who manipulate the game to see enemies through surfaces harder to escape detection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But a cursory glance at social media shows a number of clips revealing cheaters enjoying themselves in the Black Ops 7 beta.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There are already cheaters in the first hours of the Black Ops 7 beta 🤦‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/oK6hp6C4ki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/oK6hp6C4ki</a></p>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1973854357541290347?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">CHEATER ON DAY 1 OF BLACK OPS 7 BETA LMFAO!!! <a href="https://t.co/KkkW55vZaO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KkkW55vZaO</a></p>— Nicari 🤍 (@Nicari) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nicari/status/1973848298223194383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Call of Duty Updates X / Twitter account</a>, many of the accounts shown to be using hacks in clips like the above have already been banned. The hope is, of course, that data gathered during this beta period will help reduce cheating when Black Ops 7 comes out in November. But publishers like Activision face an uphill battle when it comes to cheats. Indeed EA faces the same problem with rival shooter Battlefield 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cheaters-already-spotted-in-battlefield-6-open-beta-despite-secure-boot-requirement">whose open beta also saw cheaters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the war on cheaters, publishers are starting to force PC gamers to enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot in order to play. EA’s done it with Battlefield 6, and Activision has done it for Call of Duty. More will surely follow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These features block modified hardware and unauthorized software, with the goal of creating a fair, secure environment for all players even as cheaters ramp up their efforts. But it remains to be seen just how effective they will be, with both Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 waiting in the wings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, though, some Call of Duty console players are doing what they always do when a new game in the series comes out: turn crossplay off in a bid to avoid PC players. Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. Earlier this year, Activision added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer"><u>although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to get in on the action, check out our guide to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-early-access-beta-and-open-beta-global-release-times-confirmed">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta global release times</a> to find out when it's playable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

		<p>Playtonic Games has announced that Yooka-Replaylee is Steam Deck verified, so there is now another option to take the game while you are on the move. There is a demo available on Steam for Yooka-Replayee so you can test it out before the game’s full release on October 9th. In a statement on Steam, Playtonic said, <em>“Howdy folks! With only a week to go until Yooka-Replaylee launches, today we’ve gotten the shiny green checkmark from Valve to tell us and you that the game is Steam Deck Verified!<wbr>You can officially enjoy this 3D platforming epic at home or on the go! See you next week”</em><wbr><wbr><wbr></p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1As5O96S4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a>&nbsp;to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

<p>Yooka-Replayee launches on October 9th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2. A physical edition will launch on December 18th, and include a collectible game map poster, and an exclusive character sticker pack. The Switch 2 version will have a physical cartridge.</p>

            <p>Ok, so if you're one of those high-vis types who can be driven up the wall by health and safety code violations, you might want to look away. Crashout Crew, a co-op chaos-generator all about forklifts, has been revealed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> co-developers Aggro Crab, with sights set on a 2026 release preceded by a Steam demo this month.</p>
<p>I told you to look away, high-vis types! Why are you already running to management with a written demand that all heavy machinery can't be drifted around at top speed and slammed into boxes?</p>

<p>Anyway, forget about them, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583210/Crashout_Crew/">Crashout Crew</a> looks like a great laugh. You can up to four mates are strapped into forklifts that can boost and drift, with the mission of grabbing various good strewn around a warehouse, and pushing a big red button to jet them off on the right conveyor belts. Failure to do so results in quotas not being hit, and presumably a telling off. As you progress, you can add extra quirks or wrinkles to the action via safety violations, much like in real life.</p><p>"After the recent cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/going-under">Going Under</a> 2, the studio decided to explore the whimsy multiplayer side of game development," Aggro Crab wrote of how it came to be. "While some of Aggro Crab developed PEAK with Landfall, the rest of the studio locked in to produce Crashout Crew!"</p>
<p>A full release in 2026 is being aimed for, but ahead of that Crashout Crew'll be getting a demo on October 13th, as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest. You'll be able to give the first three levels a go and see if the chaos offered is up to snuff.</p>
<p>Aggro Crab have also made clear that Peak, the co-opper based around going for hikes up big hills developed by themselves and Landfall Games, will still be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-wants-you-to-waste-your-time-on-silly-things-like-basketball-and-chess-in-its-latest-climbing-averse-update">getting updates</a>. The studio plan to dual wield goofy creations in their quest to ensure that every being on Earth must have at least one chuckle with their colleagues while playing a video game.</p>
<p>It's a noble cause, and also a formula that's yielded Peak a considerable amount of success so far. So, let's see if doubling down will rocket Aggro Crab's forklift to even greater heights.</p>

            <p>The forthcoming remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> will be "enjoyable in a new and different way", according to P Studio director Kazuhisa Wada.</p>
<p>Speaking to Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/933/G093322/20250926041/">4Gamer</a> at this year's Tokyo Game Show (translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/p3r-tgs-2025-interview/">Persona Central</a>), Wada discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> alongside its director Shigeo Komori, but also touched on the highly-anticipated Persona 4 Revival.</p>
<p>"Persona 4 already packed a ton of content in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4 Golden</a>, so when it comes to creating the next 'R', it's not just about adding more - we have to create an experience that's enjoyable in a new and different way," said Wada. "And this includes the sheer volume of content, so to be honest, it's a tough challenge. But it's shaping up nicely!"</p>

<p>As with every mainline Persona game, Atlus released a revised Golden version of Persona 4 a couple of years after the original, which added new social links, new scenes, new difficulty levels, and other bonus content.</p>
<p>It's unclear if this version will form the basis of the remake, or if Atlus has gone back to the original release. And just how different will it be?</p>
<p>Indeed, Atlus had a job on its hands with Persona 3 Reload. The original version of P3 was later revised as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a> FES that added a new epilogue, while Persona 3 Portable added a female protagonist option.</p>
<p>When Persona 3 Reload was released last year, it took inspiration from the more modern Persona 5 Royal, but as it lacked all options from previous versions, for some fans it still didn't offer the complete experience.</p>
<p>Still, in an interview with Denfaminicogamer (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/persona-3-reload-devs-havent-changed-their-minds-about-adding-portables-female-protagonist-we-have-a-mission-to-tackle-new-things/">Automaton</a>), Wada stood by the decision not to add the female protagonist to Persona 3 Reload, stating the cost and time needed would've been several times the resources that went into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-gets-the-answer-after-all">Episode Aigis DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Persona 4 Golden is thoroughly beloved by series fans, so with the remake Atlus must be careful to offer something new while still appeasing its harshest critics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumoured-persona-4-remake-officially-revealed">Persona 4 Revival was finally officially revealed at this year's Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June, following multiple leaks and teases.</p>
<p>"We are currently working on this project with all our passion and love," said Wada at the time. "We are confident that this will be a fresh and surprising product for both newcomers and long-time fans and we look forward to sharing it with you all."</p>
