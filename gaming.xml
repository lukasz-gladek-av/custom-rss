			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> is a fantastic game in its own right, as exemplified by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review scores</a> and <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the prizes it's starting to win now</a> that the award season is in full swing, but it's all the more impressive because of Sandfall Interactive's small size. The French studio famously only has around 33 (yes, like the game) developers, and we also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that they made this gem <strong>with a budget of under $10 million</strong>.</p>



<p>As one of the biggest game releases of 2025 (according to the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final 2025 Alinea Analytics report</a>, the game reached <strong>8.6 million players</strong>, almost a million more than Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered), Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly gives the studio the opportunity to scale up in size. However, in an interview <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Knowledge</a>, EDGE's free newsletter dedicated to the games industry, Sandfall Interactive founder, CEO, and Creative Director Guillaume Broche said <strong>there's no such plan</strong> despite the game performing 'a hundred times better' than they had anticipated, and he also explained why.</p>



<p><em>No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves. We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again.</em></p>



<p>It is definitely rare to see a game development studio getting the chance to expand and not take it. It may seem like an unusual choice at first, but it could prove extremely wise in the long run. By staying small, Sandfall won't be forced to follow the 'bigger is better' mentality, and it could also more easily cope with unsuccessful projects if need be. History shows that studios that double or even triple their size after a successful game can get into a lot of trouble if their next project goes wrong for whatever reason.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a substantial free update as a thank-you to the community, adding a new playable environment, new Luminas and weapons, a photo mode, and AMD FSR 4 support on PC, among other things. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-offloads-airtags-at-a-record-low-not-just-airpods-and-macbooks-in-a-surprise-year-end-clearance-2000655042</link>
            <guid>1390006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Why are the stocking stuffers always the last thing on everybody’s holiday list? Small gifts can be the best ones, especially when they’re amazingly useful and at near-all-time low prices,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> like this 4-pack of Apple AirTags that’s on sale at Amazon for 34% off and will still arrive in time for Christmas if you order now.</a></p>
<p>Being stocking-sized is only a small part of the appeal for this deal. Normally a $99 buy, a 4-pack of AirTags for just $65 is a major score, and if you’re a devoted Apple fan or even just an iPhone user, the AirTags are by far the best Bluetooth trackers. They’re compact, exceptionally easy to set up, are powered by an easy-to-find replaceable battery, and help you find lost items with amazing precision.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4-Pack Covers It All</h2>
<p>One 4-pack of Apple AirTags can cover a huge swath of the items you need to keep tabs on. There is a huge range of inexpensive AirTag holders that fit keychains, along with holders for wallets and even wallets and money clips that have built-in AirTag holders. Backpacks and other bags are even easier — just drop in an AirTag and let it do the work for you. With your iPhone or iPad handy, you’ll have a location on your valuables at all times.</p>
<p>AirTags have become indispensable travel accessories too. Most major airlines have some form of luggage tracking app or service, but to be&nbsp;<em>really</em> sure of where your bags are, an AirTag slipped into an inner compartment is the best method. Distance is no issue, since the AirTags connect to Apple’s massive Find My network, which is able to ping off of nearby Apple devices — without compromising your privacy or safety — to locate your item whether it’s tens or thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Finding far closer objects — the wallet or keys that slid between couch cushions or slipped under a car seat — is fast and easy with the Find My app. The app gives you directions and distances down to the inch, and you can also make the AirTag play a chime to help you narrow down the search.</p>



<h2>Tough Little Tracker</h2>
<p>The AirTag is IP67-rated for dust and water exposure, and the outer shell is tough enough to endure the knocks and drops that come with being attached to a keychain or the outside of a backpack. The battery is good for roughly a year, and the FindMy app on your iOS device will let you know when it’s time to get a fresh battery. When that time comes, the CR2032 disc battery is one of the most common and easy to find batteries, and the AirTag is easy to open. A quick few seconds later, your AirTag is ready to go for another year.</p>
<p>Not many people are going to put AirTags on their holiday gift list, but anyone who finds a 4-pack of these top-tier Bluetooth trackers in their stocking will be very pleasantly surprised. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">The 4-pack of Apple AirTags on sale at Amazon for just $65 is a thoughful and exceptionally useful gift idea</a>, and if you order now they’ll still make it in time for Christmas.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ark 2 Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2020</p>
      </div>
<p>Studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.</p><p>Snail Games also confirmed that 4 million copies of Ark: Survival Ascended have been sold in the two years since it first launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>First announced in 2020, Ark 2 was originally scheduled to launch in 2023, but it was delayed to 2024. After missing that date, the studio has largely kept quiet about progress on the game. Vin Diesel is aiding development on the game--and starring in it--under the fancy role of "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vin-diesel-will-not-only-star-in-ark-2-hes-also-an-executive-producer/1100-6485514/">president of creative convergence</a>" at Studio Wildcard.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-animated-series-with-impressive-voice-cast-gets-surprise-release-out-now/1100-6522008/">The game has also been adapted into an animated series</a> that debuted last year without much fanfare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-the-animated-series-part-2-finally-gets-a-release-window/1100-6536005/">and the second part of Ark: The Animated Series</a> will arrive in 2026.</p>

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> released, there has been much discussion about the game's performances. While all are exemplary, and saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Jennifer English and Ben Starr receive nominations for Best Performer at this year's The Game Awards</a>, there has since been debate over what exactly it means to be nominated in this category.</p>
<p>You see, another Clair Obscur actor to receive a nomination at The Game Awards was Charlie Cox, known for the likes of Daredevil and Stardust, who provided the voice of the game's protagonist Gustave. However, the character's motion performance was done by French actor Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Back in November, Cox said while he was of course delighted to see his contribution to Clair Obscur recognised, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-charlie-cox-thrilled-by-game-awards-nomination-but-says-gustaves-mocap-actor-deserves-the-credit">as much of the applaud needed to go to Cazorla</a> as well. "Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process," Cox said. I recently had the oppertunity to sit down and chat with Cazorla about all things Clair Obscur, and of course our conversation soon turned to Cox's comments.</p>

<p>"First of all, it was an incredible honour for me that Charlie spoke publicly and acknowledged my work. I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," Cazorla told me, before he shed more light on the process of bringing Gustave to life.</p><p>"We started by doing the performance capture without any particular constraints, approaching it like a film, learning the lines, playing the scenes, and following Guillaume's direction," Cazorla said. "Once the shoot was done and the scenes were integrated into the game engine by the cinematic team, that's when the voice actors stepped in and recorded their performances."</p>
<p>He added that his part in Gustave's overall character and Cox's "happened at different stages of the process", something that "is very common in game production". Cazorla explained once the physical side of the performance was locked in, Cox then went into the studio to record Gustave's lines. "I only discovered the final result months later, directly in the game," Cazorla shared.</p>
<p>"In the end, it's really the combination of these two performances, along with the incredible writing and development work, that gave birth to the character."</p>
<p>But, how did Carzola feel to not receive a nomination for his part in Gustave's character development? Does he feel awards shows should change how they recognise performances generally.</p>
<p>"When it comes to a potential motion capture category, I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Carzola replied. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors. For example, Maelle with Charlotte Hoepffner and Jennifer English, Lune with Estelle Darnault and Kirsty Rider, Verso with Ben Starr and myself. Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character."</p>
<p>As such, Carzola believes "the fairest way to celebrate performers" is to "celebrate the character" instead.</p>
<p>"That's something the DICE Awards already do, and I think it's a very intelligent approach. If you reward Gustave as a character and his impact on players, you acknowledge Charlie Cox for the voice, myself for the performance capture, but also the writers who shaped his personality, the character artists, and everyone who contributed to bringing him to life."</p><p>Closing, Carzola said: "Video games are, by nature, a collaborative art form, and characters resonate because many artists give them their soul. Celebrating a Best Character category feels more logical to me than isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p>

<p>If you want to hear more from Carzola , my full chat with him is going live in the coming days. Here, the actor discusses how he found out about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, his audition and meeting the team at Sandfall, performing the motion capture for several of the game's characters, and much, much more. Stay tuned!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/22/assetto-corsa-rally-gets-an-ice-cold-update-0-2-in-early-access/</link>
            <guid>1389988</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first content update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-rally">Assetto Corsa Rally</a> has arrived, bringing an appropriate amount of snow and ice to the table for the season, alongside improved physics and performance. Available now, here’s what’s featured in Assetto Corsa Rally update 0.2.</p>
<p>The physics engine within Assetto Corsa has been evolved in multiple ways, with the headline being the introduction of snow physics and support for studded tyres. This allows you to take on ice and snow rallies where grip is at its lowest, and you can test your skill at the new Ghiacciodromo Livigno Circuit, as well as in time attack and free practice for these mountain roads.&nbsp;And what better way to take this on than with the newly introduced Alpine A110 Group 4, which is an icon of rallying in the early 1970s?</p>


<p>More broadly, the physics for gravel and tarmac racing have been improved alongside tyre models, and all vehicles benefit from fixes related to&nbsp;wheel offsets, rim textures, and suspension. The force feedback has also been made more consistent, especially for behaviour under braking. And the sound mix has been refined alongside new audio for snow environments and the A110.</p>
<p>To try all of this out, there’s two new Events groups, so there’s now a total of 25 events in AC Rally.</p>
<p>And then there’s just a litany of quality of life and bug fixing improvements. Here’s the full patch notes:</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa Rally is an exciting addition to Kunos Simulazioni’s sim-racing franchise, especially when rally racing is in flux after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">EA halting Codemasters’ rallying development</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027/">KT Racing is revving back up to resume their WRC series</a>. While Kunos themselves are hard at work on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assetto-corsa-evo">Assetto Corsa Evo</a>, AC Rally is in development at Supernova Games Studios in a technical partnership that builds on Kunos’ exceptional physics modelling. Similar to Assetto Corsa Competizioni, the visuals are then provided with a customised version of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Goes Final Clearance on AM4 Motherboards, ROG Strix B550-F WiFi II (3rd Gen Ryzen) Drops to a Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-goes-final-clearance-on-am4-motherboards-rog-strix-b550-f-wifi-ii-3rd-gen-ryzen-drops-to-a-record-low-2000655008</link>
            <guid>1389982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a desktop PC from scratch, or upgrading your CPU? We’ve found a deal that lets you pick a strong motherboard without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">The Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II – an option that offers exceptional power and great gaming features – is currently available for just $120 at Amazon, down from its usual $180 price.</a> This is one of the lowest we have seen this motherboard drop to, but as you’d expect, the offer wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later, before that happens. Note that the package is likely going to arrive after Christmas. If you were planning to surprise a gamer or a creative in your life with it, keep the shipping timeline in mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Feature-Rich</h2>
<p>This motherboard is an excellent option for AMD Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series, as well as 5000 and 4000 G-series desktop processors. The thoughtful 14-phase VRM design (12 main and 2 auxiliary) lets it handle the powerful options well without overheating, making it great for anyone looking to work with resource-intensive programs and heavier projects frequently. It supports Windows 11, plus allows for up to 128GB of RAM, which is more than enough to handle serious multitasking.</p>
<p>Build quality is just as exceptional, with RGB lighting adding a nice aesthetic touch to the setup. The feature-rich board is also PCIe 4.0-ready, which translates into faster data transfer speeds, especially when paired with a high-end NVMe SSD. You will be able to load games, launch apps, and move files (even the larger ones) around without waiting long. What’s more, WiFi 6E (802.11ax) and Intel 2.5 Gb Ethernet with ASUS LANGuard come together to ensure smooth networking. On the other hand, ports like dual M.2 slots, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, plus HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 outputs make it convenient to connect other devices for a fuller, more productive setup.</p>



<p>The box includes the motherboard itself, an ASUS 2×2 dual Wi-Fi antenna, an addressable RGB extension cable, a user manual, a support CD, and an ROG sticker pack. The bundle also includes a 60-day subscription to AIDA64 Extreme.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a solid motherboard to add to your setup without breaking the bank, the Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II is one of the best options to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">We’d highly recommend it at its full $180 price, but the current 33% discount makes it much more affordable and, honestly, a no-brainer.</a> The $120 asking is nothing compared to all the features it’s packed with. Just be sure to snap it up quickly, because the deal is selling out fast. Place your orders before it expires, or before the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Second Expedition Window Confirmed by Countdown]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-second-expedition-window-confirmed/</link>
            <guid>1389976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has pushed live the Expedition Project window in ARC Raiders <strong>today</strong>, which means that players can finally make good on their efforts over the last few weeks and <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. This is effectively the game’s global reset mechanic, only unlike other extraction games, it’s an optional step.</p>



<p>Users have spotted that the <strong>next </strong>Expedition window should arrive in ARC Raiders from February 22 onwards, if the countdown is anything to go by.</p>







<h2 id="h-one-finished-and-into-another">One Finished and Into Another</h2>



<p>If you’ve completed your Expedition Project today, you’ll be faced with the daunting task of starting from scratch. That means you’ll find yourself at level one with an empty stash, no skills, and empty workbenches, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It also means you’ll be taking advantage of certain temporary buffs, a small stash boost, and an exclusive new skin, <strong>Patchwork</strong>.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition Project have noticed that you can start building your <strong>next </strong>Expedition caravan <strong>instantly</strong>. As soon as you’ve reset that event, you start moving on to the next one. That means that you’ll work through the phases all over again, collecting the resources required to go a second time around.</p>



<p>Now to what’s next.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders players on PC can use a trick to manipulate the game. They do this by changing their system date while <strong>in the game,</strong> forcing the state forward and tricking the game’s internal calendar. By doing this, some users have revealed future map conditions, trials, and other additions.</p>



<p>Those completing the Expedition have been given a fresh timer, but if you just manipulate the game in this way, you could have seen that timer anyway.</p>



<p>Given that each Expedition loop, or ‘season’, lasts two months, this was hardly rocket science.</p>



<p>Unlike the Expedition itself. That’s rocket science.</p>



<p>So, if you’re wondering when the next Expedition hits in ARC Raiders, you’ve got something of an answer. It’s worth stressing that these things are subject to change until the update is firmly delivered, as <strong>the current Expedition </strong>was delayed by Embark Studios.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re going to be hitting the wipe in ARC Raiders.</p>

As translated and reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gamesradar</a>, Kojima teased that the most recent teaser trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released during Tokyo Game Show 2025</a> includes a 'hint' of some kind that players can discover after watching it carefully again and again.</p>



<p><em>I can't say anything else, or Mr Phil will be mad at me. But actually, if you watch the teaser trailer many times there's a hint. I really can't say what it is, but if you watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer, it reads 'for all players and screamers'. That's also a big hint.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the Nikkei Xtrend interview, Kojima also reiterated that it is a 'completely new medium' that his studio built with the help of <strong>Microsoft</strong>, which is publishing OD, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-kojima-partnership-brand-new-game-cloud-powered-xbox-bethesda-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> at the Xbox &amp; Bethesda Games Showcase 2022.</p>



<p><em>I think when you first see OD, it looks like horror. But the system it uses isn't ordinary. Everything is made in a game engine, and a game is a game, but it's still a system like no other. That's why we built a completely new medium together with Microsoft.</em></p>



<p>OD <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is being co-written with <strong>Jordan Peele</strong></a>, a filmmaker known for his horror works, and will feature Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier, who sadly passed away last month before he could complete his motion performance in the game.</p>



<p>We know that it will leverage Xbox's cloud gaming technology, but we don't know how. Last year, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that it was a risky project, and as of two weeks ago, he candidly <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-dont-know-if-this-will-work-out-hideo-kojima-comments-on-the-challenges-od-will-face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commented</a> that he still doesn't know if it will work out or not in the end.</p>



<p>OD is supposed to be the studio's next project after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></strong> and before <strong>PHYSINT</strong>, a new Metal Gear Solid-like stealth IP that will be made <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in collaboration with PlayStation</a>.</p>

            <guid>1389955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to be recognized as a serious creator, it is essential to give your audio the attention it deserves. Whether you’re conducting street interviews or recording reaction videos for platforms like TikTok, your audience will notice the sound quality. Even if it’s on a subconscious level, poor audio can make your content feel low-budget. In fact, I’d argue that audio quality is even more important than video quality in some cases, even though it might sound counterintuitive. Investing in a high-quality wireless lavalier microphone setup can drastically improve the sound in your videos. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">A great option to consider is the DJI Mic 3 kit, which is currently 21% off, bringing the price down from $329 to $259—an impressive $70 discount.</a></p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 kit includes two transmitters, a wireless receiver, and a charging case. All the components come pre-linked, so they’re ready to use right out of the box. The system is also compatible with USB-C and Lightning adapters, which are included in the package, giving you more connectivity options for various devices. You can clip the transmitter to your shirt, your hat, I suppose just hold it between your fingers which is now becoming the norm on TikTok and Instagram.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Intelligent Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>These microphones support intelligent noise-canceling, allowing the them to capture clear vocals in detailed 32-bit audio while minimizing unwanted background noise. These mics can handle unpredictable environments like busy streets or crowded convention halls. Plus, the kit comes with two windscreens to further reduce the interference of wind noises when you’re filming outdoors.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 system provides an impressive wireless range of over 1,300 feet, giving you greater freedom to shoot in various locations without worrying about losing signal. This extended range allows you to move around with more flexibility.</p>



<p>Battery life is another major selling point. Both the transmitters and the receiver can operate for up to 28 hours, ensuring you’ll have plenty of power for extended shoots. The included charging case acts as a portable power bank, capable of recharging the mics when you’re on the go. If you’re only using one transmitter at a time, you can keep the second one in the case and swap it in when the first one runs low on battery. The case is compact, fitting all the components neatly together, making it easy to pack up when you’re done filming.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to upgrade from your phone’s built-in microphone to a more professional setup, the DJI Mic 3 lavalier kit is a solid choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">For just $259, you’ll get two transmitters, the receiver, a charging case, and other accessories—at a significant discount.</a> Don’t miss out on this opportunity to improve your audio and take your content creation to professional levels.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-30-percent-debunk/</link>
            <guid>1389952</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has debunked past claims that it has told its gaming division Xbox that it must target a 30% profit margin.</p>







<p>The debunking came as part of a new <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC report</a> that spoke with Microsoft about multiple issues and reports the company has seen over the past year.</p>



<p>CNBC acknowledges that a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said Microsoft has set its gaming division, Xbox, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ambitious goal of achieving a 30% profit margin</a>, which has led to layoffs and cancelled projects. </p>



<p>According to Bloomberg, the target was set by Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood, who said that the 30% target was “accountability margins” across the company, including Xbox. The report was subsequently backed up by other industry figures, who said that they had heard similar news of the ambitious targets.</p>



<p>The 30% target is much higher than the industry standard, which averages 17-22%.</p>



<p>In response to the rumour, Microsoft reportedly told CNBC that while the company does set ambitious goals, the reported 30% profit margin target was incorrect.</p>







<div><p>Xbox has had a tough year, with thousands of jobs impacted and several projects cancelled, including The Initiative’s Perfect Dark, Rare’s Everwild, and ZeniMax’s MMO under the codename Blackbird. Last week, it was announced that Xbox would not be having an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Xbox Wrapped’ this year due to budget constraints</a>.</p><p>It’s currently unclear whether Bloomberg will redact or offer more insight into Microsoft’s ambitious goals, but should we get more information, we will update this article.</p></div>

The developer patched them out five days after release, insisting they made the cut by mistake. This went under the radar until recently, when comments from Sandfall co-founder and producer François Meurisse reemerged. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El País</a> for an article published in July, Meurisse said: “We use some AI, but not much. The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do and what to invest in. And, of course, technology has allowed us to do things that were unthinkable a short time ago. Unreal Engine 5’s tools and assets have been very important in improving the graphics, gameplay, and cinematics.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meurisse’s comment resurfaced amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">a backlash to comments from Larian boss Swen Vincke in the wake of the developer’s high-profile announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards</a>. The original news came from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Bloomberg interview</u></a> in which Vincke said that Larian was "pushing hard" [Bloomberg's phrasing] on generative AI, even though it hasn't led to big gains in efficiency. Specifically, the studio was said to be using the technology to "explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text." [again, Bloomberg's phrasing].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke later addressed the backlash, and has promised an AMA to answer questions from fans. All the while, a light has been shone on Clair Obscur, which leads us to the Indie Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur had won Game of the Year and Debut Game from the Indie Game Awards, but both awards are now retracted. Explaining the decision, <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Indie Game Awards said</a>:</p><blockquote>The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself. When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination. While the assets in question were patched out and it is a wonderful game, it does go against the regulations we have in place. As a result, the IGAs nomination committee has agreed to officially retract both the Debut Game and Game of the Year awards.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Each award went to the next highest-ranked game in its respective category; Sorry We’re Closed now has Debut Game, and Blue Prince now has Game of the Year.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, El País has updated its original article to include a statement from Sandfall clarifying its use of generative AI in the making of Clair Obscur:</p><blockquote>The studio states that it was in contact with El País on April 25 — three months prior to this publication. During these exchanges, Sandfall Interactive indicated that it had used a limited number of pre-existing assets, notably 3D assets sourced from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. None of these assets were created using artificial intelligence.</blockquote><blockquote>Sandfall Interactive further clarifies that there are no generative Al-created assets in the game. When the first Al tools became available in 2022, some members of the team briefly experimented with them to generate temporary placeholder textures. Upon release, instances of a placeholder texture were removed within five days to be replaced with the correct textures that had always been intended for release, but were missed during the Quality Assurance process.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s Vincke's latest statement in full:</p><blockquote>It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.</blockquote><blockquote>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</blockquote><blockquote>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</blockquote><blockquote>To give you more insight, we’ll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you’ll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!</blockquote><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Excellent, the AI generated textures in Clair Obscur were indeed placeholders and were replaced with custom assets. The other AI generated poster that was present in the starting area (don't have a screenshot of it now) was also removed. <a href="https://t.co/UQbfLuyj8e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/UQbfLuyj8e</a> <a href="https://t.co/5xgqsCmZpC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/5xgqsCmZpC</a></p>— Nyanomancer (@nyanomancer) <a href="https://twitter.com/nyanomancer/status/1917435885429150176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in video game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry.

Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio has said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the debate around the use of generative AI to build video games rages on, Tim Sweeney, boss of Fortnite developer Epic Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-stop-at-ai-use-we-could-have-mandatory-disclosures-for-what-shampoo-brand-the-developer-uses-epic-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-should-ditch-its-ai-generated-content-disclosure">has waded in to call on Valve to ditch its AI Generated Content Disclosure for Steam games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve’s rules mean developers must disclose their use of AI-generated content on a game’s Steam store page. For example, the Steam page for Embark Studios’ Arc Raiders includes a note from the developer on how the game uses AI-generated content: “during the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>New details have been revealed regarding the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-file-class-action-lawsuit-over-cancelled-kotor-2-dlc">Knights of the Old Republic 2 false advertisement lawsuit</a> for Switch consoles. This includes an argument made by one expert brought in by Aspyr who stated that the fan-made Restored Content mod the missing DLC was based on had "no economic value".
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga">This information comes from Game File</a>, which broke down the legal battle between developer Aspyr and an individual who sued the company after DLC advertised in a trailer for the Switch version <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotor-2-switch-dlc-cancelled-after-third-party-objection-says-aspyr">was cut from the full release</a>.</p>
<p>This report claims Aspyr made several arguments in an attempt to curb the lawsuit, which ended in a settlement earlier this year. These include the claim that the tease for the DLC couldn't have been widely seen, as it appeared at the end of a YouTube trailer. Aspyr's own lawyers argued: "Many YouTube viewers skip [videos] after the first five seconds."</p>

<p>Aspyr also reportedly brought in additional documents in April, including expert testiomy from former Blizzard product manager Frank Gilson. He explained the restored content mod the DLC was based on was fan-made and offered for free. It therefore had no "economic value", a belief that stemmed from the fact the community creates these mods and doesn't charge for them. </p><p>The lawsuit would progress further onto even more colourful topics, including accusations of demonic possession, stemming from a claim that an Aspyr attorney yelled at his client: "as if possessed by a demon". This framing was rejected by the attorney in question, who said he raised his voice so he could finish his sentence and return the conversation to "productive discussion".</p>
<p>There was also the claim it could take decades to learn the appropriate email address in order to get the rights to make a Star Wars game. This comes from a redaction of certain email addresses in documents filed this April. These were redacted as: "[...] they reveal a key trade secret; the identities of the right persons to work with at Lucasfilm to secure access to Lucasfilm intellectual property. Those contacts reflect years, sometimes decades, of work cultivating relationships and revealing them would cause Aspyr lasting business harm."</p>

</p>
<p>While this particular chapter in the Kotor saga was a bit of a messy one, there is hope for fans of the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">During The Game Awards, Fate of the Old Republic</a> was revealed, alongside the news that Casey Hudson would be involved. Hudson was famously involved with the original Knights of the Old Republic game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the top eight games have all played a bit of a switcheroo, while the latter two spots in the top ten are taken up by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> continues its descent down the charts to land at number 17, though with sales skewed heavily in favour of the Switch 2, this perhaps suggests that the hardcore crowd are still picking it up in droves.</p>
<p><strong>Mario Kart</strong> continues to demonstrate its widespread appeal, with both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">8 Deluxe</a> once again taking up their positions in the top ten. It'll be interesting to see how long this keeps up as the Switch 2 expands its library further in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ark 2’s release window has been updated again, and the developers are now targeting 2028. </p>



<p>During the latest Snail Games Investor Day (via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>), the co-founder of developer Studio Wildcard, Jeremy Stielglitz, confirmed that Ark 2 is planned for a 2028 release. The game’s release window has changed several times since the title was first announced. It was set for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-2-still-planned-for-late-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">late 2024</a> release, then the developers changed that with no new date. Now, it seems we will have to wait at least two more years before we see Ark 2 in action. </p>







<h2 id="h-ark-survival-ascended-sells-over-4-million-copies-will-get-ark-2-inspired-update-in-2027">Ark Survival Ascended Sells Over 4 Million Copies, Will Get Ark 2 Inspired Update in 2027</h2>



<p>However, players will be able to get their “first taste” of Ark 2 slightly earlier than 2028, but it will still be a long wait anyway. The developers reveal that a significant update is planned for Ark Survival Ascended, inspired by the sequel, which is set to be released towards the end of 2027. Snail Games had another major announcement for Ark Survival Ascended, revealing that the latest version of the game has sold over 4 million copies. </p>



<h2 id="h-ark-lost-colony-to-bring-new-features-and-story-will-be-portrayed-through-mappa-anime">ARK: Lost Colony To Bring New Features and Story Will be Portrayed through Mappa Anime</h2>



<p>As we wait for Ark 2’s release, the next major expansion for Ark Survival Ascended is coming soon. Ark: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a> will introduce a new narrative and expand the title’s scope. The developers have also confirmed that it will include new features, such as the ability to “recruit human characters to your tribe that are controlled by the computer.” Additionally, the narrative of this expansion will be showcased through Mappa anime scenes starring Michelle Yeoh and UE5 Metahuman cinematics featuring Madeleine Madden, Auli’i Cravalho, and Karl Urban.</p>



<h2 id="h-ark-survival-ascended-roadmap">ARK: Survival Ascended Roadmap</h2>



<p>The developers also revealed the following projects we can look forward to before Ark 2 releases in 2028. We will first see the arrival of Ark: Survival of the Fittest, an esports-focused spin-off of the core game, where 60 players battle, culminating in a showdown between dinosaur armies. This will arrive in the first quarter of 2026. </p>



<p><span>In the second quarter of 2026, players will see the arrival of Bob’s True Tales: Tides of Fo</span>rtune, a pirate-themed expansion for the base game and a new map called&nbsp;ARK Genesis. The third quarter of 2026 will see the arrival of ARK World Creator, a new upgrade that helps “turn the modding tools in the game into something more akin to what is seen in&nbsp;Fortnite’s&nbsp;UEFN&nbsp;or&nbsp;Roblox.”</p>



<p>Then, in the fourth quarter of 2026, Ark Dragontopia will arrive, followed by Ark Atlantis in 2027 Q1. The second quarter will see ARK: Bob’s True Tales Galaxy Wars release, which is all about large space ships, space battles, star fighters, and more. Lastly, 2027 Q4 will see the release of Legacy of Santiago, a prequel to Ark 2 that ties into that narrative and tests the game’s mechanics and features. This is “most likely not the last update for&nbsp;ARK: Survival Ascended”, said the devs. </p>

            <p>The rebooted 2013 Tomb Raider made its Switch debut just a matter of weeks ago, and thanks to the "passionate response" from the community, port developer Aspyr may now consider bringing the trilogy's final two entries to Nintendo's platform as well.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy kicked off when the team at Crystal Dynamics dropped an inexperienced and somewhat naive Lara Croft on the storm-riddled shores of Yamatai. Her story then continued in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, which took Lara to Siberia, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, where the trilogy concluded in the sweltering jungles of South America.</p>

<p>Of course, many Switch players are now wondering if these last two entries in the most recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> will eventually make their way to the platform as well, and allow them to finish Lara's rebooted arc.</p>
<p>"We have definitely seen this question," <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/">Aspyr told Nintendo Everything</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-fans-might-get-the-entire-tomb-raider-survivor-trilogy-thanks-to-their-passionate-response">Nintendo Life</a>). The studio added it has already reintroduced Nintendo players to the classic era of Tomb Raider with its remasters of the first six games in the series.</p>
<p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era (1-6) and now the 'origin story' of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," Aspyr said when asked about future Tomb Raider ports of Rise and Shadow.</p>
<p>"We can't announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities," the studio closed. So, would you like to see Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider arrive on Switch consoles?</p>

<p>Along with Tomb Raider 2013 arriving on Switch, this month has been a rather exciting one for fellow fans of Lara's. At The Game Awards, two new games were also announced to be in the works. The first - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">a remake of the original Tomb Raider known as Legacy of Atlantis</a> - is due to be released next year. Then, in 2027, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">all-new series entry known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst will arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Amazon's live-action show still to come, with filming beginning next month. Cast members so far include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as a character called Wallace</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">Jason Isaacs in an undisclosed role</a>.</p>

			<p>Polyphony Digital's <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong> may have been released nearly four years ago, but according to series creator and studio founder Kazunori Yamauchi, it's still doing extremely well.</p>



<p>In an interview with media outlets that attended the Gran Turismo World Series 2025 World Finals in Fukuoka, Japan, the legendary game designer (and racing driver) revealed that the game <strong>is regularly played by over two million players each month</strong>, and perhaps even more importantly, its player base is still growing. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.gtplanet.net/gt7-2-million-monthly-users-20251221/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as GTPlanet reported it</a>:</p>



<p><em>Gran Turismo 7 has been released for several years, but still, the active users are currently over 2 million people, and the new users are increasing. The status that Gran Turismo 7 is in now is probably the best of any Gran Turismo titles that we’ve had in the past. We’ve never experienced this phenomenon before, and neither has PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Polyphony Digital experimented with live service in the previous entry, GT Sport, but it's clear that GT7 has received a much warmer welcome from series fans and continues to keep many players interested through various updates. The most recent one, Spec III (Update 1.65), launched on December 4 and introduced:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight cars (Ferrari 296 GT3 ’23, Ferrari 296 GTB ’22, FIAT Panda 30 CL ’85, Gran Turismo F3500‑B, Mine's BNR34 GT‑R N1 base, Mitsubishi FTO GP Version R ’97, Polestar 5 Performance ’26, and Renault Espace F1 ’95).</li>



<li>Two tracks (Yas Marina Circuit and Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve).</li>



<li>The new Data Logger feature lets players load data from the previous attempt or replays to view and compare data such as racing lines, throttle and brake inputs, speed, and engine RPM, all in real-time.</li>
</ul>



<p>Alongside Spec III, Gran Turismo 7 players can also purchase the new Power Pack for $29.99. This premium DLC adds 50 new races across 20 themed categories, such as 24-hour races, six unique cars specially tuned by Gran Turismo, tail-to-nose battles with <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-sophy-announced-by-sony-ai-and-polyphony-its-an-ai-breakthrough-capable-of-competing-against-top-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo Sophy</a> 3.0, and is bundled with 5,000,000 in-game Credits.</p>



<p>The game's only real downside is the aggressive microtransactions system, which also caused its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Wccftech review score</a> to drop from 9 to 8/10. From the point of view of PC players, there's also the 'downside' that the game still isn't available, whereas most other PlayStation exclusives have already been ported. </p>



<p>Three years ago, a Yamauchi statement about a PC version being considered <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-pc-ports-are-being-considered-by-polyphony-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was widely reported</a> in the press. However, a few weeks later, the founder of Polyphony rectified the statement, clarifying that the possibility was 'not zero' but that there was still nothing being actively done on that front yet. Unfortunately, as of the end of 2025, there are still no updates on the port.</p>

<p>It's no Fiorentina jersey, but it's something</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="26ca35de83f1c"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ca35de83f1c/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has a long history of sponsoring professional sports teams, and one club it's continued to support over the years is the Japanese football side, Kyoto Sanga, which currently competes in Japan's top-flight competition known as the J-League.</p>
<p>Nintendo owns 16.6% of this club, <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/the-story-of-kyoto-sanga-nintendos-favourite-football-team/">and ever since it signed on in 1993</a>, the video game giant's traditional 19th-century kanji logo has appeared on the back of the kit, above the player number. Now, in a slight and subtle update to the shirt for the new season, the logo is surrounded by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin</a>.</p>
<p>So, while the traditional logo might not be quite as recognisable here in the west, you can now at least impress fellow Nintendo fans (<em>and maybe some sports ones</em>) with these colourful Pikmin.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15b9952a8d147"><a title="Pikmin 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15b9952a8d147/pikmin-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: via @Genki_JPN on X / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Again, while it might not be <em>quite</em> as easy to spot as <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2019/09/feature_remember_when_video_game_football_shirts_were_a_big_deal">Nintendo's ACF Fiorentina kit featuring the company's red (and iconic) "racetrack" logo</a>, any fan of Nintendo should definitely notice. As for the rest of the kit, as you can see in the images above, it features the usual purples, white and red colours – matching the club's emblem.</p>
<p>As Nintendo fans should know, Shigeru Miyamoto has a soft spot for Pikmin, and has previously mentioned how he considers them to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/miyamoto-considers-pikmin-to-be-nintendos-most-global-characters">Nintendo's most "global characters"</a>, so it's no surprise they continue to pop up pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>On a <em>slightly</em> related note, Nintendo this week rolled out a new game update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> on the Switch to fix multiple bugs.</p>

<p>"I can't really play it now though"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Hideo Kojima has rightly cemented himself as a legend in the games industry, having created iconic titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">P.T.</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/silent_hills">Death Stranding</a>. Although it probably shouldn't come as a surprise, however, Kojima cites <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> as the reason he started making games in the first place.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA">new interview</a> with WIRED in which Kojima answers questions submitted online, he's asked which game he has played the most. His immediate answer was Super Mario Bros., claiming to have played it for "a year" when he was a college student. He states that "without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry".</p>
<p>Although he alludes to its simplicity (it was, after all, a launch title for the NES), he says that it pushed him to believe in the potential of games, claiming that "this medium would one day surpass movies".</p>
<p>Here's the full quote from Kojima:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Bros., definitely. Played it for a year. I was a college student. I skipped school to play at home. Without Super Mario, I probably wouldn't be in this industry... Yeah... I can't really play it now, though.</p>
<p>"It's a side-scrolling action game. Mario just goes left to right. Basically just jumping. But there's a dash button. Using that and jump subtly changes the jump trajectory to attack or dodge. It has almost no story, but it felt like you were on an adventure. When I saw that, although it was pixel art with no story, I felt this medium would one day surpass movies."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kojima has recently released <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and is currently working on <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/od">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/physint">Physint</a> (working title). The original Death Stranding, initially a console exclusive for the PS5, has since been released on everything from the Xbox to the Amazon Luna, leading many to speculate that it might eventually wind up on the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Blue Prince’s publisher has spoken out against sudden allegations of using Generative AI in the title. The news comes after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had its wins at the Indie Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revoked due to using AI-generated elements</a>.</p>



<p>Generative AI usage in video games has been a hot topic for quite some time. Just recently, Larian Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted to using Gen AI</a> for pre-production purposes and many were displeased with the Baldur’s Gate 3 developer. The conversation on whether it’s ethical or not has been a huge debate, so it only went bigger when The Indie Game Awards revoked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 of its wins for Best Independent Game and Best Debut Indie Game. The winner of the Best Independent Game then became Blue Prince, a puzzle rogue-like and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, allegations of Dogubomb, the creator, using Generative AI in Blue Prince appeared out of nowhere. It went big when The Escapist called out the company in <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news-indie-game-awards-clair-obscur/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a since-edited article</a>. Now, the publisher and developer have spoken up about the allegations.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;<br>There is no AI used in Blue Prince. The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros <a href="https://twitter.com/dogubomb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dogubomb</a> &amp; his team.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/2002748999388844330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement from publisher Raw Fury</a>, the studio defends Blue Prince and its developer, Dogubomb. In particular, it responds to the claims that the game used Generative AI during development. The studio posted on social media the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>For people that need confirmation:&nbsp;There is no AI used in Blue Prince</strong>,” says the statement. “<strong>The game was built and crafted with full human instinct by Tonda Ros (Dogubomb) &amp; his team. It is the result of eight years of development, fuelled by imagination and creativity, and we are extremely proud of what Tonda has achieved.</strong>“</p>



<p>With The Indie Game Awards, the criteria was that no game would use AI, and developers had to verify it in order to be considered. The allegations of Blue Prince using it were baseless, as the article had no evidence to back it up. The crackdown on AI usage in games will likely be ever-present come 2026. Whatever the case, it’s a shame one of 2025’s best titles had to deal with the allegations, especially after a big win.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PIONER Roadmap Reveals Ambitious Few Months Ahead]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pioner-roadmap-revealed-ambitious-few-months/</link>
            <guid>1389892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GFA Games recently unveiled a new roadmap for PIONER following the game’s entering early access on December 16. The post-apocalyptic MMO has started to slowly turn heads on account of how much potential it has wrapped up in a package that’s already evolving.</p>



<p>It’s GFA Games’ first project as a collective, and if the new roadmap is anything to go by, it has a bright immediate future; the long-term prospects are yet to be estimated.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-to-pioner-in-2026">What’s Coming to PIONER in 2026?</h2>



<p>In a roadmap published on social media, the team at GFA Games unveiled what’s coming next for PIONER.</p>



<p>Launched into early access on December 16, PIONER presents players with a gritty, STALKER-inspired rendition of a Soviet-era island, torn apart by cataclysms, anomalies, and bloodthirsty factions. It’s an open-ended, open-world title that has scores of content to uncover and explore, and despite being in early access, it’s pretty well optimized.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re excited to present the PIONER Early Access roadmap for Q1 2026.</p><p>What’s coming:</p><p>– A New Year event featuring a wide variety of themed items;<br>– New story quests, raids, PvP maps, and more <a href="https://t.co/VBP5GOBZ0q">pic.twitter.com/VBP5GOBZ0q</a></p></div>— PIONER (@PionerGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/PionerGame/status/2002061384939618385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Here’s what’s coming in Q1 2026 for PIONER, and in the final days of 2025:</p>



<p><strong>December</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Year Event at Wandering Pass</li>



<li>New World Event</li>



<li>New Themed Items</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>January</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>New Raid Mission</li>



<li>New PvP Map</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>February</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New Main Story Quest</li>



<li>New World Events</li>



<li>TBC</li>



<li>TBC</li>
</ul>



<p>In <strong>March</strong>, the game will get a ‘big update’, the team has teased.</p>



<p>PIONER is ambitious, especially for the size of the studio behind it and the nature of its launch. It obviously takes a lot from other titles, but the delivery feels unique and populated enough to be very enjoyable.</p>



<p>Feedback on Steam is mixed at present, and the stock so far has been collated from just 1,000 reviews. Many of the positive reviews have stressed the fact that this is an early access title and ‘shouldn’t be expected to be perfect’, which is what most of the negative reviews are focusing on.</p>

<p>Riot Games has announced that the teams participating in the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour collectively received over $105 million, marking one of the most financially significant seasons in the game’s relatively short history. VALORANT debuted in the esports space in 2020 and has been steadily growing ever since.</p>



<p>Riot shared the information in an annual competitive recap that revealed a whopping $86 million had been generated through in-game item sales during this year’s tournaments.</p>







<h2 id="h-valorant-hit-milestones-in-2025">VALORANT Hit Milestones in 2025</h2>



<p>The recent recap published by Riot Games revealed stunning revenue that directly lined the pockets of VALORANT teams in 2025, but it went further than that. For instance, VALORANT Masters Bangkok, a tournament that ran from February to March this year, hit a viewership record in the game’s vertical.</p>



<p>From September to October, VALORANT Champs played out in Paris, and one of the most dramatic grand final showdowns in recent memory took place. These events helped boost those coffers immeasurably.</p>



<p>As stated, $86 million of that $105 million cap came from in-game cosmetics, including the yearly Champions Collection. This supersized bundle nearly <strong>doubled </strong>the revenue produced by similar bundles released in 2024. </p>



<p>Fan participation across the broader ecosystem also reached new heights. The Game Changers Pick’Em feature surpassed two million entries. That record is indicative of the growing popularity of the progressive space in VALORANT, which fans <strong>love</strong>.</p>



<p>Those eager to explore their individual performance through 2025 can do so by checking the <a href="https://flashback.playvalorant.com/en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VALORANT Flashback platform</a>. It’s a neat feature created by Riot Games that allows users a visual glimpse at their stats this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fnatic, one of the oldest esports organizations in Europe, is reportedly evaluating a sale that would come with a whopping $100 million price tag. In a report shared late last week, it was suggested that multiple parties are interested in securing the brand, and Fnatic has brought in a consultancy firm to engage investors.</p>



<p>Potential buyers are said to include companies across a broad array of verticals, including traditional sports, media, and entertainment.</p>







<h2 id="h-fnatic-wants-a-full-acquisition">Fnatic Wants a Full Acquisition</h2>



<p>In early reports, it has been suggested that some serious investors are eyeing up Fnatic, one of the most iconic brands in the modern esports space. Fnatic boasts a legacy that few organizations can attest to, and despite having recent drops in revenue, the company is still bursting with potential.</p>



<p>Historically, the organization has been one of the first labels in esports to innovate and expand beyond mere competition. In 2016, the company launched Fnatic Gear, a high-end peripherals division, which went on to sell <strong>one million units </strong>before the brand was sold to Sony’s INZONE label.</p>



<p>It should be stressed that $100 million is one hell of a target. In recent years, esports organizations have been bought and sold for far less, despite being valued internally with much higher price points.</p>



<p>For instance, Luminosity was sold in 2025 for just over $3 million, and FaZe Clan was valued at just $18 million in 2023. The latter organization once peaked with a valuation of $725 million, but the tumultuousness of the company proved too volatile in too short a time.</p>



<p>Analysts have argued that if any organization can command that tag, it’s Fnatic.</p>

<p>A major game update for the free-to-play Switch and mobile title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_unite">Pokémon Unite</a> was released earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, before we get to the end of the year, the development team has added Mega Charizard Y. This follows Mega Gyarados, which joined the fray earlier this month. Before this, trainers got Mega Charizard X and Mega Lucario.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, Aeos coins have also been discontinued in Pokémon Unite. This took place earlier this month, alongside the introduction of License Journeys – giving trainers a new way to obtain Licenses in Unite.</p>

<p>Now, following this, it has provided an update about the lifetime sales of the series – revealing it has now sold over six million copies worldwide. This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/the-hd-2d-series-octopath-traveler-hits-another-sales-milestone">sales update in December last year</a>, when it hit the five million mark.</p>
<p>This latest sales update includes physical copies shipped and each game's digital sales. As part of this, it's also shared some special artwork, and the series will be on sale for a limited time.</p>

<p>Octopath Traveler originally began life as a Switch exclusive in 2018 and now has multiple entries <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/06/octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-pre-registrations-go-live-in-the-west">including a mobile prequel</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't tried out the new game yet, it allows you to be the hero (thanks to the custom character creator) and you're also tasked with restoring your hometown, which requires you to make use of the new townbuilding mechanic.</p>
<p>There is a demo available for this title as well and save data carries over to the full game. This follows an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/octopath-traveler-0-receives-a-small-update-on-switch-and-switch-2">update for Octopath Traveler 0 last week</a>.</p>
