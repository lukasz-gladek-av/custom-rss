            <p>A live-action Street Fighter movie is set to hit a screen near you in 2026.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-release-sony-1235933496/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the new film based on the fan-favourite fighting game is slated to release on 20th March 2026.</p>

<p>We knew a movie was coming - just a day after Legendary Entertainment announced it had secured the film and television rights to Capcom's Street Fighter series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">the company announced plans to create a new live-action movie</a> - but this is the first time production company Legendary, which is running the project alongside Capcom, has shared a release date.</p>
<p>Of course, this won't be the first time Street Fighter has been adapted for the big screen - the 1994 film Street Fighter attracted a star-studded cast with Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue, among others, but it bombed at the box office.</p>
<p>Then, in 2009, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li was released with Kirstin Kreuk in the title role, but that too flopped.</p>
<p>This won't be the only video game adaptation to grace the silver screen in 2026, by the way - the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">The Super Mario Bros. Movie now has a firm 2026 release date</a>, too.</p>
<p>In a "this is Miyamoto" social post ahead of last week's Nintendo Direct, the Mario creator revealed the full release date for the animated film sequel will 3rd April 2026 in the US, 24th April 2026 in Japan, and "other countries and regions" during April 2026.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 is out now across PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-devs-community-manager-apologises-says-fans-continuously-getting-fed-false-hope-of-sequel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The community manager for Days Gone developer Bend Studio has apologised to fans. The reason for this apology? Because they are "getting fed false hope and poor information by people looking for likes".</p>
<p>In a post on social media platform X, Kevin McAllister said this kind of behaviour is "not fair" to fans of Days Gone, who are eager to hear more news about more games in the series. This is something that is not on the cards.</p>
<p>While McAllister did not name any names in his post, earlier this week former studio director <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1805083382327718080">John Garvin</a> said he had written Days Gone with a cliffhanger "with the full intention of there being a trilogy (NOT just a sequel)". This comment was subsequently picked up by fans and outlets.</p>

<p>"All these type of headlines originate from previous developers, which puts us in a bad position," McAllister continued in reply to another user. "Like I said, people need likes. Time to move on."</p>
<p>Garvin has long shared his disappointment that Days Gone was not better received by Sony and critics. In 2022, Garvin controversially stated the reason the game didn't receive universal acclaim was because of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-wasnt-a-hit-because-reviewers-were-too-woke-director-claims">"woke reviewers" and reviewers who "couldn't be bothered to actually play the game"</a>. Garvin also criticised the game's programmers, blaming "tech issues" such as "bugs, streaming and frame rate" for Days Gone's middling reception.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-director-says-local-studio-management-always-made-us-feel-like-it-was-a-big-disappointment">fellow Days Gone director Jeff Ross</a> said "local studio management always made us feel like it was a big disappointment", and called Sony's decision not to greenlight a sequel "weird".</p>
<p>Both Garvin and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-director-joins-tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics">Ross have since moved on from Bend Studio</a> to persue other projects, though both still regularly post about Days Gone on their socials.</p> <div>

<p>As for what Bend Studio itself is up to, McAllister said the team is currently working on a new IP, and when there is more news to share on this particular release, "it will come from our studio".</p>

            <p>The makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> host a podcast every once in a while, in which the studio's developers chat about what's going on in the company. In the latest episode, they're discussing their (relatively new) Boston studio and how it's spearheading the as-yet-enigmatic sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. There's a lot of middle-managey chit chat but one thing that stood out was one developer's earnest remarks about what he considers some of the sci-fi RPG's shortcomings. </p>
<p>"I see that we didn't push the envelope far enough in some places, for instance," said Paweł Sasko, Associate Game Director at CD Project RED.  "Like, let's say the homeless crisis... when I look at it, I'm like, we weren't far enough in '77. We thought that we were dystopian, but... we just touched the surface."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The general hope aired in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo">the podcast</a> is that, now that they have a studio in the US, the creators can make the sequel more true-to-life, and engage more deeply in some issues the first game didn't address. The planned sequel is internally called "Orion" and we don't know much about it yet, except that it has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-and-control-writer-joins-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">the lead writer of Control at its narrative helm</a>. </p>
<p>"I think the really cool thing about Cyberpunk - and the dystopian future that it has - is there's so much relevance to today, of megacorporations, of people on the fringes, you know, of people just being exploited resources, of the wealth gap, of all these things," said Dan Hernberg, Acting Executive Producer on the sequel.</p>
<p>"I think that Cyberpunk allows us to tell these stories in ways where... at the heart of it there's always relationships and people, but we're in a really broken world and that we can call out some of these things.</p>
<p>"I think for me that's what Cyberpunk is about, exploring those themes but in a very poignant way... and I think that's what we're going to try to do with project Orion. Really continue to lean into that..."</p>
<p>It isn't the only way in which the studio claims its new North American home will aid in creating a lifelike world for the sci-fi follow-up. They want to avoid another "manhole debacle".</p>
<p>"I mean, there's this interesting story after the release of Cyberpunk that blew up on Reddit at some point, and it's the manhole debacle," said Sasko. "I remember there was this post [with] the guy saying that there is this immersion-breaking bug in Cyberpunk... that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement. Those are not manholes that you normally [use] in America on the streets."</p>
<p>It's a pretty minor fault, and it reminds me of recent comments by Dragon Age producer Mark Darrah, claiming that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blockbuster-games-are-in-the-grip-of-a-fidelity-death-cult-says-former-dragon-age-producer">blockbuster games are in the grip of a high-fidelity death cult</a> - an exhausting and unwinnable race to be more and more realistic. Personally, I like a broad range of art styles in the industry, and don't want to see games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">opting for hyperrealism</a> disappearing. But we can forgive a manhole cover, surely.</p>
<p>As for homelessness in the US, that's a disaster visible to anyone who sets foot in the country, and won't be solved in an article about video games. It will likewise be a difficult issue to address within the context of an often ridiculous RPG world full of talking vending machines and routinely exploding heads. There's no reason to believe this issue will be a huge part of the sequel's storytelling, to be clear (Sasko doesn't mention it with that significant a tone). The intention may be as simple as including a greater number of homeless NPCs in the sequel. Whatever the case, it is at least something they are thinking about. And considering how closely everything about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-chat-about-the-cyberpunk-2077-demo">Cyberpunk 2077 was watched</a>, and how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trans-representation-in-cyberpunk-2077-matters-but-not-because-its-cyberpunk">fiercely it was interpreted</a>, it makes sense that the company may want to leverage the cultural sensibilities of its US employees in any way that may be helpful. </p>

  <p id="jfe1yl">Publisher Wizards of the Coast has spent the last few years targeting two very different segments of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a><em> </em>audience. On the one hand, you have the multiplayer style of play called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/28/21266763/magic-the-gathering-commander-origins-elder-dragon-highlander-alaska-menery">Commander</a>, arguably the game’s most popular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23643684/magic-gathering-oathbreaker-format-announced">format</a>. On the other hand, you have the ambitious <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24071837/mtg-universes-beyond-two-per-year-lotr-final-fantasy-fallout">Universes Beyond</a> products, designed to turn the heads of lapsed fans and non-players alike with products that support multiple styles of play. Now the trading card game is returning to its roots with a new set called <em>Foundations</em>, a collection of cards and a curated play experience custom-built for newcomers.</p>
<p id="AW1uJb"><em>Foundations</em> launches on Nov. 15, and will have all the trappings of a mainline set release — that includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915789/mtg-draft-boosters-set-boosters-discontinued-what-is-a-play-booster">Play boosters</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23771472/mtg-lotr-collector-booster-box-prices">Collector boosters</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/21/21147560/magic-the-gathering-new-format-jumpstart-boosters">Jumpstart boosters</a>, and Bundles as well as all the same pre-release pomp and circumstance as any other new set of cards. But it will also feature two new-to-<em>Magic</em> products: a <em>Beginner Box</em> and a <em>Starter Collection</em>.</p>

<p id="WHgOSK">Wizards’ game design director Bryan Hawley told Polygon that the <em>Beginner Box</em> will include 10 packets with 20 cards inside each one, with two packets for each of <em>Magic</em>’s five colors of mana. Using a mix-and-match system originally designed for the Jumpstart product line, players will be able to combine and recombine those 10 packets into many different kinds of decks. At least some of those packets will be pre-shuffled, with the intent that players will first open and explore them alongside a detailed, step-by-step written tutorial.</p>
<p id="H2D3Rr">“One of the things that <em>Foundations</em> is really trying to do differently than any of our past attempts at an onboarding experience,” said Hawley, “is to really focus on that full pathway, [taking a new player from] <em>I am interested in Magic, but I don’t know anything!</em> up through <em>Oh, I’ve identified what I like to do and I’m going to do more of that!</em> So the <em>Beginner Box</em> is a significantly more built-out experience that has a lot more content [than previous <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/23766947/magic-the-gathering-tales-of-middle-earth-lotr-deck-analysis-building-photos">starter sets</a>]. You can play dozens of games straight from the box.”</p>

<p id="sIhdQD">Once players have mastered the <em>Foundations Beginner Box </em>of 200 cards, then they can move on to the <em>Starter Collection</em>. That 350-card box will help them to expand on the themes and techniques they’ve already discovered, while also serving to keep them well within the warm embrace of a kind of estuary — a place of calm that should remain stable even as multiple new sets of cards are released year after year.</p>
<p id="hH2ytm">That long-term stability is a new feature for <em>Magic</em> as a whole. When a new set of cards is released it only remains viable — that is, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmagic.wizards.com%2Fen%2Fformats&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24187331%2Fmtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23951372__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24187331/mtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23951372__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://magic.wizards.com/en/formats&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24187331/mtg-foundations-announcement-release-date-price&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">“legal” to play in certain formats</a> — for about three years. Hawley said that cards from the <em>Foundations</em> set will be legal to play until at least 2029, or nearly twice the usual length of time.</p>
<p id="inK96J">“Our hope and intention is that as long as the set continues doing its job,” Hawley said, “helping new players learn the game, get acclimated to the game, and find what they like about the game — <em>and </em>being that foundation for Standard in general — it will continue to remain Standard-legal.”</p>
<p id="3T3hx2"><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em>’ <em>Beginner Box</em> will retail for $29.99, while the larger <em>Starter Collection</em> will cost $59.99. Expect more information from Wizards in the lead-up to the release this fall. </p>

But despite a ‘mostly positive’ Steam user review rating, player numbers were extremely low. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2687970/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Tribes 3 hit a peak of 890 concurrent players on Valve’s platform upon launch, with just 26 concurrent players at the time of this article’s publication.</p><p>Developer Prophecy Games issued an <a href="https://www.tribes3rivals.com/news/tribes-3-player-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">update</a> to say neither Tribes 3 or its prior game, the already shuttered Starsiege Deadzone, saw enough success to justify the team’s continued focus. As a result, it’s giving those who’ve spent money in those games credits towards its upcoming fast-paced 3v3 sports shooter Ultra Strikers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“These credits are meant to give back to players who supported us in early development,” Prophecy Games said. “We’re doing our best to support Tribes 3 with limited updates (along with an upcoming discount sale to bring in more players), and plan to return to Starsiege Deadzone once the company has the resources, but unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now (as much as we love them).</p><p>“Thank you for your support. Going forward, we’ll continue to focus on updating existing games as much as we can, while creating new games players enjoy. We love making games, we love playing games, and thanks again for giving our games a shot and being part of the community!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unfortunately neither game had enough success yet to support the studio and can’t be our main development focus right now.</p></div><p>Over the last few weeks, even before the release of this latest statement, some Tribes 3 players had hit out at Prophecy Games for what they considered to be an "abandonment" of the game. Tribes 3, down to a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam for recent reviews, is not a free-to-play game, although it does feature various microtransactions.</p><p>One player with over 250 hours on Tribes 3 left a negative review that detailed a number of issues with the game and Prophecy’s management of it, hitting out at the lack of updates and various broken promises.</p><p>“Matches are largely against either extremely veteran players clinging to their last laughable hope that this game will somehow become something that the public cares about, or bots, so have fun either being completely stomped, or completely stomping the other team,” the Steam user said.</p><p>It’s a sad end to Tribes 3 after just three months of early access, and a potential death knell for the once-popular franchise. Prophecy Games will of course be pinning its hopes on Ultra Strikers, although after what happened to Tribes 3 it has work to do to win back player trust.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Don't Nod has pushed the launch of its upcoming new IP Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage in order to avoid clashing with the next instalment of Life Is Strange – which was originally developed by Don't Nod.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company said Lost Records had been delayed from a 'late 2024' window to 'early 2025' following "an in-depth assessment of recent trends and developments in the industry."</p>
<p>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, developed by Deck Nine and revisiting characters from the Don't Nod original, is currently set to release on October 29. Don't Nod said the delay to Lost Records should benefit both titles.</p>
<p>"We know that many of our fans are eagerly awaiting this game, just as they are the recently announced next installment of Life is Strange," said Don't Nod CEO Oskar Guilbert. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe that the wait for Bloom &amp; Rage will be worth it. We look forward to sharing this new adventure, which we hope will become another memorable chapter in the Don't Nod universe."</p>
<p>Like Life Is Strange, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is a narrative adventure that follows a group of teenagers caught up in a mystery involving supernatural elements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/alpha-protocol-is-finally-back-on-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>After half a decade in the wilderness, Alpha Protocol is back on Steam.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/Alpha_Protocol/">Sega pulled Alpha Protocol from sale way back in 2019</a> due to the expiry of music rights, and whilst it returned to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-pc-following-2019-licensing-drama">GOG back in March</a>, Obsidian's fan-favourite spy RPG was still curiously missing from Valve's storefront. Until now, that is.</p>

<p>Surprised? You're probably not alone. There doesn't seem to have been a formal announcement anywhere, and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/34010/history/">SteamDB</a>, Alpha Protocol's Steam backend hadn't been touched for months until a flurry of changes in June signalled something was afoot.</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol sees you play as agent Michael Thorton, a "talented young agent cast out by his government". The only one with the information needed to prevent the obligatory international catastrophe, Thorton's forced to "cut himself off from the very people he is sworn to protect" – oo-er – and every choice and action you take will "ultimately transform the type of secret agent Micheal Thorton will become".</p>
<p>If that sounds intriguing, Alpha Protocol is currently available for 20 percent off the recommended retail Steam price.</p>
<p>"The legendary agent whose presence looms over Alpha Protocol's Michael Thornton isn't Bauer, Bourne or Bond - although the game is eager to invite all these comparisons," Donlan wrote in Eurogamers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alpha-protocol-review">Alpha Protocol review</a> almost fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>"Obsidian has borrowed a lot from BioWare, a developer it's always had a close working relationship with, and at times Alpha Protocol can feel a little like a Mass Effect mod as much as an original game in its own right."</p>

            <p>I think I've written about it a bazillion times here on RPS, but I do think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> is a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game that's a bit <em>too</em> large and in charge. I reached the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/n.com/i-have-reached-the-elden-ring-exhaustion-point">exhaustion point</a> once, and now the DLC's come out, I'm scared I'll reach it again despite the fact <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">I think it's very good</a>. It's interesting then, that FromSoftware's president Hidetaka Miyazaki sees Elden Ring as "the limit" for FromSoftware in terms of project scale (cheers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> for the interview, and PCGamer for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-elden-ring-might-be-as-big-a-game-as-he-ever-wants-to-make-where-fromsoftware-is-right-now-in-terms-of-scale-i-would-say-elden-ring-is-really-the-limit/">the spot</a>). I think it's a great thing, personally.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In The Guardian's interview with Miyazaki, he says that Elden Ring is a "turning point" for FromSoftware, referencing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">Armored Core VI</a> as an example of something a bit different from the company's Souls catalogue. "Where FromSoftware is right now, in terms of scale, I would say Elden Ring is really the limit," Miyazaki told the site. "We’ve tapped every resource and talent that we have access to… scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns." </p>
<p>What comes after Elden Ring then? Miyazaki says that he'd love to see up-and-coming developers within FromSoftware take the lead. "Perhaps having multiple projects is the next stage, where some of the other younger talent can have the opportunity to manage and direct game design for a smaller project."</p>
<p>I think Elden Ring and Shadow Of The Erdtree are brilliant, don't get me wrong. But I was worried that massive Soulsly open worlds were like, the <em>only</em> thing they'd do now since they've tasted so much critical and commercial success. It's a relief to know that they're actually thinking of scaling things back, and handing the reins to people with different ideas.</p>
<p>I doubt this is the end for Souls, which makes me happy! Gimme more games with bonfires and skeletons. But also, I'm glad they're looking to foster a culture of experimentation. Hey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-me-hankering-hankering-for-a-tenchu">how about Tenchu</a>? I know that turned into Sekiro eventually, but we could revisit it? Please. PLEASE.</p>

Again, we’ve heard nothing since, but we do know this game is set in Middle-earth and features the stories of The Hobbit and more.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-tomb-raider-lord-of-the-rings-1236046995/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Amazon Games chief Christoph Hartmann said a reveal for either game is not imminent, but is not long away. “It’s not going to be tomorrow, but it’s not too far away,” Hartmann said, before insisting Amazon Games is now “getting into a much more regular cadence of shipping games.”</p><p>“That’s all I’m allowed to tell you right now,” Hartmann added. “It’s all about quality. You don’t want to just be rushed out. That doesn’t work. It has to be triple-A quality, because the bar is so high.”</p><p>Amazon will be keen to capitalize on other Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings projects it has in the works by lining up the TV shows with the video games. Prime Video has confirmed a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-confirms-tomb-raider-series-for-prime-video-with-phoebe-waller-bridge-as-writer-and-executive-producer">Tomb Raider live-action series</a> with Fleabag star Phoebe Waller-Bridge in place as writer and executive producer, although it has yet to say when it will launch.

While that’s worked out well for the Fallout TV show, which is set after all the Fallout video games, Hartmann suggested Amazon’s plan for Tomb Raider is closer to Sony’s with its hugely successful Marvel’s Spider-Man games, which are separate to the Spider-Man movies.</p><p>“You see it with Tomb Raider, where we’re gonna have a Tomb Raider game coming and they’re doing a show,” Hartmann said. “And some people say, ‘Oh, will they be linked together?’ And I give them the example, look at Spider-Man. There’s amazing, amazing games. There’s great animated content, there’s great live-action, and everyone seems to be very happy with that. So it does not need to be always that everything is mingled together, but it’s really one brand, which really just shows for me why transmedia nowadays is so important, and how games is such a vital part.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/even-hardcore-audiences-love-dlc-when-its-done-right-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Bethesda's $2.50 horse armour DLC for Oblivion turns 18 this year – a realisation which made me feel like I was about to spontaneously crumble to dust and be blown away on a breeze.</p>
<p>There's an entire generation of gamers to whom it would be very challenging to explain why the launch of this seemingly innocuous add-on was such a pivotal moment for the industry's development; why for the best part of a decade afterwards, an eye-roll and a snorted exclamation of "horse armour!" was a devastating put-down to almost any DLC plans.</p>
<p>Attitudes have undoubtedly softened over time, especially in younger cohorts who have grown up with most major games having paid-for add-ons of various types, but there is still a conventional wisdom which says that more "hardcore" consumers, and older consumers, really don't like paid-for DLC in general.</p>
<p>That's an oversimplification of the attitudes involved, but it's not entirely unfounded – at least, it's certainly in line with what we see in online discourse around game announcements. If you listen closely you can hear an audible groan rise from the server farms of Discord and Reddit whenever a game is announced alongside details of its add-on content season pass, as has been common practice for the best part of a decade now.</p>
<blockquote>The horse armour won, in the end.

</blockquote>
<p>The assertion made by the loudest detractors – and clearly believed by a not insignificant chunk of the audience – is that complete games are having parts sliced off them and repackaged as DLC, with the true, full game that we "should" have been getting at launch only eventually being sold as some kind of Game of the Year edition further down the line.</p>
<p>It's a narrative that tickles the two foundational prejudices of the internet's self-styled angry and/or bitter gamers – that publishers are greedy, and developers are lazy.</p>
<p>The robust and generally well-founded pushback to this narrative from developers is straightforward – that while they generally have ideas for DLC in mind before a game launches, it's not the case that content which actually exists has been cut out.</p>
<p>There are storylines and scenarios and concept art, yes, but actually building those sections of the game is a task that doesn't get properly underway until after the launch. There's a plan for future expansion, not a chunk of finished content being locked away by greedy business bosses.</p>
<p>An unfortunate wrinkle in the otherwise robust fabric of that counter-argument is that while this scenario is usually the case, there have undoubtedly been situations where DLC planning has been rather less pure-hearted – and it only takes a couple of cases of the DLC model being abused to convince some consumers that a giant business conspiracy to defraud gamers is unfolding behind every launch.</p>
<blockquote>I'm not sure any developer other than FromSoftware could get away with this kind of thing; the fact that they do, and to rapturous praise, is worth looking at</blockquote>
<p>Some high-profile games have launched in pretty awful states – very obviously lacking large amounts of planned content or features, with huge technical issues, and so on – but nonetheless accompanied their launches with expensive season passes and high-profile promotion of DLC roadmaps.</p>
<p>A few bad apples can spoil the whole barrel, and it doesn't take too many of those cases to make a certain segment of the audience – the more hardcore audience that's more plugged into these online discourses – sour on DLC as a broader concept.</p>
<p>Yet even at that, saying that these audiences don't like DLC is a vast over-simplification of a much more nuanced set of views. Case in point: Elden Ring's DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, is arguably the most talked-about game of the month, having earned soaring review scores and fantastic word-of-mouth from exactly the kind of hardcore audience who supposedly don't like DLC and paid add-ons.</p>
<p>By the conventional wisdom, this is an add-on that shouldn't even exist, let alone be so popular. Instead, it appears to have been crafted as a love-letter to the hardcore fans of an already pretty hardcore game; you need to have defeated an optional boss in Elden Ring who is tough to find, let alone defeat, even to access the new content.</p>
<p>I'm not sure any developer other than FromSoftware could get away with this kind of thing; the fact that they do, and to rapturous praise, is worth looking at.</p>
<p>Context matters, of course. Some kind of plan did exist for Shadow of the Erdtree all the way back when Elden Ring launched – there are plenty of loose ends in the original game that are clearly meant to be tied up in a future expansion – but nobody could argue with a straight face that a game of the scope and scale of Elden Ring was incomplete or had seen content sliced off to create a DLC pack.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's taken almost two years for this expansion to arrive, and it's enormous in its own right, essentially the size of a whole new game by itself.</p>
<blockquote>It only takes a couple of cases of the DLC model being abused to convince some consumers that a giant business conspiracy to defraud gamers is unfolding</blockquote>
<p>Those old enough to remember game expansion packs will recognise the Shadow of the Erdtree formula as owing far more to that now-rare approach than to the more conventional modern 'season pass' approach of dropping three or four new pieces of content over the course of a year or so. Much of the positive reaction to this DLC likely owes to FromSoftware having planned it as a full expansion pack rather than as a slice of DLC.</p>
<p>FromSoftware isn't the only company taking this approach of launching large, high-quality DLC packs in the mould of expansion packs, of course. Cyberpunk 2077's equally rapturously received Phantom Liberty DLC is another great recent example. At a little more of a stretch you could point to the extremely positive reception around Final Fantasy XIV's major expansions (notably Shadowbringers and Endwalker), or even to the Miles Morales spin-off from Insomniac's Spider-Man game, as further examples.</p>
<p>The common point between all of these is that they genuinely offer what DLC always claims, but so infrequently delivers. Here is a significant (both in size and scope) and transformative addition to a game that's already thoroughly loved by its players, giving dozens of hours of extra playtime at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>Given that the base game is a known quantity, and of very high quality, it's a no-brainer for many players to buy this kind of DLC; more of something you already know you enjoy is an easier purchasing decision than taking a punt on a game you haven't played yet.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is the gold standard for DLC, and ought to be what every developer planning an expansion roadmap tries to emulate – reaching high, even if many will fall short is likely.</p>
<p>Getting the base game right is absolutely central to this formula; trying to sell players DLC when the original game is still in need of extensive fixing is like trying to hand restaurant customers a dessert menu when the main course wasn't cooked properly and half the dishes never arrived.</p>
<p>Moreover, DLC of this kind needs to be meaty enough to be worth getting back into the game in the first place. By the time your DLC launches, most players have moved on to new games, so you need to be promising them a significant experience – and ideally one that transforms the original game in interesting ways – to convince them to come back and play again.</p>
<p>This is not not, however, the only approach to DLC and in-game purchases, nor is it the only approach players have come to accept. Which brings us back to Bethesda's horse armour, as it prepares to graduate high school and pack its bags for college.</p>
<p>For all the mockery and negativity around the horse armour – which admittedly was a bit daft in a game that had such an extensive range of free community-developed mods – the reality is that for most of the audience currently in their early thirties and below, charging $2.50 for a cosmetic in-game item seems perfectly natural and uncontroversial. If anything, they might be surprised at how cheap that is. The horse armour won, in the end.</p>
<blockquote><p>Trying to sell DLC when the original game is still in need of fixing is like trying to hand restaurant customers a dessert menu when the main course wasn't cooked properly and half the dishes never arrived</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cosmetic DLC – costumes and weapons and fripperies that do little but customise the game experience in various ways – is now an intrinsic part of the business model of many games, and can be surprisingly successful even in single-player titles where you might expect the instinct to peacock by dressing up characters to be minimal.</p>
<p>This kind of DLC approach is still mocked on occasion, especially when developers go overboard with it (and doubly so when the base game is notably barren in that department before you open the store page), but I'd argue that most consumers have come around to the reasoning that these are essentially the gaming equivalent of luxury items.</p>
<p>You don't need them to enjoy the game, but can blow some cash on them if they really tickle your fancy – yet just as the existence of a high-end Rolex doesn't change the fact that a digital Casio tells the time just as well, most cosmetic DLC doesn't detract from the game experience by its existence.</p>
<p>Where this can go wrong is with things like fighting games, where unlocking costumes for the character roster has traditionally been a core goal of progression in many franchises. Consequently, locking up too many costumes behind a paywall really is detracting from the game experience, and goes down like a lead balloon with players (see also: the industry's what-not-to-do whipping boy icon, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/will-players-tolerate-overwatch-2s-broken-promises-opinion">Overwatch 2</a>).</p>
<blockquote>The lesson from the success of expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree is that DLC really can resonate even with the audiences who supposedly resist it the most</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, this kind of DLC occupies the opposite end of the spectrum from the large, expansion-pack style offerings of Shadow of the Erdtree or Phantom Liberty, and it's at those extremes of the spectrum that DLC seems to find the most success and acceptance.</p>
<p>Developers working on post-launch content plans for their games would do well to consider the kind of audience they're working to attract, and pick a lane based on that assessment – either making big, meaningful expansions, or small cosmetic tchotchkes that serve as disposable luxuries.</p>
<p>It's in the middle ground that DLC tends to trip up and annoy people the most – slices of content that aren't sufficiently differentiated from the core game, don't justify either the price of entry, and aren't worth the mental effort of picking back up in a game players moved on from months ago.</p>
<p>The lesson from the success of expansions like Shadow of the Erdtree is that DLC really can resonate even with the audiences who supposedly resist it the most – but if a game doesn't justify an expansion on that scale, it's worth seriously considering whether adding a small zone and a handful of missions is worthwhile at all, or whether simply downscaling to cosmetics is going to be a far better allocation of resources.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-update-adds-options-to-change-console-graphics-settings">an update for Dragon's Dogma 2 was rolled out for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S</a>, including some specific changes for consoles, adding the option for those on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S to change graphics settings to high or low, as well as the option to turn 120Hz output on or off. Capcom said turning graphics settings down to low on consoles should improve Dragon's Dogma 2's frame rates, adding: "Further frame rate improvements are planned for future updates as well."</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 has been a hit for Capcom, with the game selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-sells-25m-as-fixed-frame-rate-arrives">2.5m copies in under two weeks after its release</a>. Back in April, the company actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">revised its full-year earnings forecast</a> following this success, combined with the success of its other popular releases over the last year.</p>

            <p>More information has come to light regarding Twitch's 2020 ban of streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm.</p>
<p>Beahm began making headlines again last week, when Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships Cody Conners stated an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform after they were caught sending sexually explicit messages to a minor. Subsequent reports confirmed the person Conners was referring to was indeed Beahm, something many had already suspected.</p>
<p>Now, a former Twitch employee - who has chosen to remain anonymous - has told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dr-disrespect-inappropriate-messages-minor-twitch-1235048071/">Rolling Stone</a> that the minor had informed Beahm that they were underage, and Beahm continued to send "sexually graphic" messages to them regardless.</p>

<p>"I recall that Dr Disrespect was made aware by the individual that they were underage during the conversation, after which he indicated that this was no problem and continued on," the former employee told the publication, stating "there was no confusion".</p>
<p>"Messages sent after this was acknowledged were no less graphic and in sexually explicit nature than before, and I think more than the categorisation of 'leaning too much in the direction of being inappropriate' might indicate," they continued.</p>
<p>Later in the conversation, the former employee spoke further about Twitch's decision to ban Dr Disrespect. "After viewing the contents of the Whisper conversation, it quickly became clear the egregiousness of conduct and what actions Twitch must take," they said. "The decision to permanently terminate Beahm was relatively quick, due to the severity of the behaviour."</p>
<p>They also added that following a number of sexual misconduct allegations that arose in 2020, Twitch created an incident response team codenamed Gold Sparrow to address concerns. "We wanted to be able to process mounting investigations quicker and with more resources while providing as much support for the victims as possible," they said.</p>
<p>In the time since Conner's initial post last week (which Rolling Stone's source said "got the ball rolling" for others to come forward with information), Beahm has been dropped from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021. Other partnerships have also ousted the streamer, including Turtle Beach, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186936/nba-2k24-will-remove-dr-disrespect-from-the-game">NBA 2K24, and the San Francisco 49ers</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youtube-suspends-monetization-on-dr-disrespects-channel-following-serious-allegations">YouTube</a>, meanwhile, has suspended monetisation on Beahm's channel. Today's report noted Beahm was not offered a contract at YouTube due to the circumstances of his Twitch ban.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm released a statement on social media platform X</a>, admitting to sending messages to a minor which he tried to pass off as "casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".</p>

Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-devs-lost-records-brings-hazy-summer-vibes-and-90s-nostalgia-in-new-trailer">next project from the creative team behind the original two Life is Strange games</a>, has been delayed into 2025.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, the team behind it are keen to avoid the launch window of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">Square Enix's own new Life is Strange game Double Exposure</a>, the latest to be made by the franchise's more recent development team Deck Nine Games. 
</p>
<p>
In a press release today, Lost Records developer Don't Nod said its game would now arrive "early 2025".

"We know that many of our fans are eagerly awaiting this game, just as they are the recently announced next installment of Life is Strange," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert wrote. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built. 
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that the wait for Bloom &amp; Rage will be worth it. We look forward to sharing this new adventure, which we hope will become another memorable chapter in the Don't Nod universe."
</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage had previously been set for a late 2024 launch. Life is Strange: Double Exposure, meanwhile, is set to arrive on 29th October for PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>While the existence of a new project from the original  Life is Strange team alongside a new entry in the actual Life is Strange series is potentially confusing, the matter is perhaps made even more complicated by the fact the upcoming Life is Strange game continues the story of Max Caulfield, the protagonist of the first Life is Strange game that the Lost Records team originally developed. Got all that?</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-discuss-leaving-their-hit-narrative-adventure-series-behind-building-on-it-with-lost-records">I spoke with Don't Nod about creating Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - and why the team had wanted to move on from Life is Strange</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a> fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">via one of those odd promotional things</a> disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?</p>

<p>When asked how he “ensure(s) evolution and innovation with each new game?” Guillemot responded: “Technology is evolving at such a pace that there are limitless possibilities for evolution. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, for example, we have a weather system that will affect its gameplay; ponds that were once swimmable might freeze, for instance.”</p>
<p>In terms of the series’ future, he says that “The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>.” More regularly, you say? Not the same experience every year, you say? To be fair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was quite the departure, I hear, at least from the creeping scale bloat that culminated in Valhalla’s exhaustingly massive world.</p>
<p>When asked what “dismays” and “excites” him most about the games industry right now, Guillemot says that he’s concerned about “the malicious and personal online attacks that have been directed at some of our team members and partners” - which might refer to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">inane backlash against AC: Shadows</a>. He continues that “We, at Ubisoft, condemn these hateful acts in the strongest possible terms, and I encourage the rest of the industry and players to denounce them, too,” which, you know, is fair enough. I mean, I suppose given the above remarks about "limitless" tech, he might have also said something about all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">mass layoffs</a> corporations have carried out while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">investing billions in generative AI</a>, but he’s not wrong!</p>
<p>“If, as game makers, we can adopt and master technological advancements like generative AI and the cloud more quickly, we will be much better positioned to create new, stand-out experiences for players". He says he'd "like it if hardware evolved even faster. The fact that games have, for a while now been compatible with both the current and previous generation of consoles is a fantastic thing for our back catalog and our players, but it's held the industry back a bit when it comes to developing truly new experiences.” Not stagnant, safe design meant to prop up thinly disguised vehicles for unlimited spending on magic purple super trousers then? Nope, it’s the slightly older console owners that are wrong. Fantastic.</p>
<p>This feels like a good moment to bump Mike Cook's article series about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares"> generative AI and its use in video games</a>.</p>

			<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is currently on sale for PC, and for those who want to try out the game first, Capcom is offering a free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial.</p>
<p>The trial is available through July 18 and offers two hours of gameplay. Players can import from the free Dragon's Dogma 2 Character Creator and Storage. If you haven't tried out this gem just yet, this is great way to find out if suits your needs.</p>
<p><em>*Save data from the free trial can be transferred to the full version of the game if purchased.</em><br>
<em>*You can make the most of your playtime by creating your characters in advance using the free Character Creator &amp; Storage tool.</em><br>
<em>*Playable hours will continue to count while the game is running in the background.</em><br>
<em>*Campaign may change or end at any time without prior notice.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-update-graphic-modes-ps5-xsx-120hz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed a new update</a> for the game, packing various fixes, and adding new graphical modes and a 120Hz option on consoles.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Be sure to read our review of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We've included the conclusion of our review below for those who don't want to read it in full:</p>
<p><em>"This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering."</em></p>

        <p>Indie projects between $15 million to $30 million will now be covered by its Independent Interactive Media Agreement</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>SAG-AFTRA has announced a new tier in its Independent Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>As part of this agreement, studios that have a project budget between $15 million and $30 million will benefit from union coverage, provisions against AI, and access to unionised voice actors and performers.</p>
<p>Actors will be provided with informed consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas, and will be provided with additional payments based on the number of units sold.</p>
<p>Unveiled in February, the Independent Interactive Media Agreement initially covered projects across three tiers, between $250,000 to $15 million.</p>
<p>"With this expanded scope of the agreement, even more projects will benefit from the skills and experience of union performers, and performers will have more opportunities to work with the benefits and protections of a union contract, including important AI guardrails," said Sarah Elmaleh, voice actor and chair of SAG-AFTRA's Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee.</p>
<p>"As a union, we are committed to creating contracts and waivers that foster actor-developer collaboration across every budget and scope. Thousands of video games are released every year and each one deserves to benefit from union talent."</p>
<p>Last September, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-members-authorise-video-game-strike">SAG-AFTRA members voted in favour of strike authorisation</a> for video game actors and performers, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-talks-with-game-companies-fail-to-reach-an-agreement">failed to reach an agreement with game companies</a> including Activision, Electronic Arts, and Warner Bros about the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-we-want-to-exhaust-every-option-without-having-to-pull-the-trigger-on-a-strike">spoke to Elmaleh and SAG-AFTRA executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland</a> about the ongoing bargaining, who said the delay in negotiations was a result of talks about AI protection.</p>
<p>"What needs to happen in order for this to move forward and us not to end up on strike against these companies is for them to revisit their resistance and their instance on splitting off our members and protecting some and not others," said Crabtree-Ireland. "That's how this ultimately gets resolved."</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has spoken out to condemn "the malicious and personal online attacks" directed at its developers, in the wake of the online fallout from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' reveal. 
</p>
<p>
Shadows is Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan-set entry in its long-running historical stabathon series. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">Ubisoft revealed its dual protagonists</a> to be Black samurai Yasuke, a notable figure from the period, and a fictional shinobi named Naoe, who happens to be a woman. The internet reacted as normally as you'd expect - and X owner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">Elon Musk also got involved</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Without naming Shadows specifically, Guillemot said he was concerned by the recent spate of "personal online attacks" directed at Ubisoft staff, and called on the video games industry in general to speak out against them.

<p>
"One thing I am concerned about right now is the malicious and personal online attacks that have been directed at some of our team members and partners," Guillemot said as part of a new <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview</a> published on Ubisoft's website. 
</p>
<p>
"I want to make it clear that we, at Ubisoft, condemn these hateful acts in the strongest possible terms, and I encourage the rest of the industry and players to denounce them, too."
</p>
<p>
Reaction to Shadows' announcement has played out against a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-alan-wake-ridiculous-fishing-devs-speak-up-in-support-of-consultancy-studio-sweet-baby-inc">wider backdrop of online backlash</a> to a perceived push towards featuring greater diversity in video games industry-wide.  
</p>
<p>
"DEI kills art," Elon Musk posted on X earlier this month in response to Shadows' reaction, referring to the acronym for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
</p>
<p>
That post was, naturally, seen by Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Côté, who subsequently said in an interview he had to hold back from sending a response.
</p>
<p>
"For me, Elon, it's sad, he's just feeding hatred," Coté told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a>. "I had a lot of three word replies that came to mind.
</p>
<p>
"What Elon says is not the game that we're building," Côté continued. "People will have to play the game for themselves. And if, within the first 11 minutes and 47 seconds, they are not convinced of what we're doing, we can have the discussion."
</p>
<p>
Last night, Guillemot also revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-games-are-getting-remakes">several Assassin's Creed remakes were currently in development</a>. Prior reports have pegged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">fan-favourite pirate adventure Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> as one of the games set to resurface in future.

<p id="rKZAaW">For some players, the option to purchase the “Whispering in the Woods” ticket from the in-game shop is not possible.</p>
<p id="AUL6d6">That’s because this Masterwork Research is only available to those who did not start the “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2020/12/14/22174658/distracted-by-something-shiny-celebi-quest-special-research-tasks-rewards">Distracted by Something Shiny</a>” Research, which previously rewarded shiny Celebi back in Dec. 2020.

<p>Shadow of the Erdtree was released worldwide on June 21, introducing Elden Ring players to an entirely new challenge – one that proved to be too tough for many gamers. It became the highest-rated RPG DLC ever, overtaking The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine by a few points. Following the eagerly anticipated release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring became one of the most popular games in the world, skyrocketing on Steam and content and streaming platforms. </p>



<p>Now, it has been confirmed that Shadow of the Erdtree sold a whopping five million copies in just three days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, FromSoftware revealed the milestone and thanked the dedication of players:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the last few days, Shadow of the Erdtree has been at the tip-top of newsfeeds worldwide, especially on account of how challenging the game is, forcing many players to reluctantly quit their playthrough earlier than they expected. Some streamers – such as Asmongold – have given up while stressing that it’s so tough it’s enjoyable. </p>



<p>To that end, FromSoftware introduced a slight change to make it easier to kill early-game bosses, and there are further plans to ‘nerf’ the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order/">toughest bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree</a> down the line. </p>



<p>It’s not all bad news, though. One streamer managed to defeat a couple of Shadow of the Erdtree bosses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-streamer-brainwaves/">using her brainwaves</a> – so, there’s that. In May, it was suggested that there would be no more DLC lined up for Elden Ring and that Shadow of the Erdtree <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">is the end of all things</a>. That is unless FromSoftware brings about an Elden Ring movie. </p>
