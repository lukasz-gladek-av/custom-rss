            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has detailed the Breakpoint update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, a free major update that will bring systemic ovehauls, quality of life improvements, new content and more when it is released on 29th September.</p>
<p>The core of FBC: Firebreak is staying the same, as a three-player co-op FPS where you dive into missions to tamp down some paranormal threats within the Federal Bureau of Control. After a rocky launch, Remedy has gone back to the drawing board for how to get people into the game and keep them engaged.</p>


<p>The Job Board has been replaced with the Crisis Board, to present missions in a new way, while each mission has been broadened to be less predictable than before. There’s a new playable tutorial called Orientation to get people into the game, which was sorely missed at launch.</p>
<p>There’s also a new Crisis mission (which would previously have been known as a Job), set in the Research sector of the Oldest House, with three new guns, grenades and cosmetics to earn. Speaking of which, a new Gun Mod system lets you modify weapons with three mod slots.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown from Remedy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis Board</strong> – The Crisis Board replaces the Job Board, presenting playable, curated, content in a new way. With this new overhaul, players can easily track the various Crises that appear at different levels around the Oldest House, offering a larger variety of fun gameplay and utilizing level content better than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Loop </strong>– Each Crisis has more variety than what came before, making FBC: Firebreak more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy at the heart of the game.</li>
<li><strong>An Improved Onboarding Experience</strong> – Remedy is making changes to the new player experience, making it easier to understand the core mechanics and to eliminate previous barriers for entry. This includes a new playable tutorial called “Orientation”, an introduction video which helps set the scene and Job overview videos, which helps players learn about each Crisis.</li>
<li><strong>New Content – Outbreak </strong>– A brand-new Crisis (formerly Job), which is set in the Research sector of the Oldest House. Firebreakers must research and contain a dangerous mold cluster, while battling new enemies. The update also adds three new guns, grenades, cosmetics and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Gun Improvements</strong> – A completely new feature in Breakpoint is the Gun Mod system. Gun Mods have modifiers that make guns more powerful or change their functionality. Each gun has three mod slots, giving you new options for customizing your arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>And Much More! </strong>– Players will notice improvements from top to bottom, including the way FBC: Firebreak communicates to players, such as improved visual communication of harmful conditions to help players better understand their surroundings and what causes damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this update, Remedy will be forging ahead with another update set for November, <span>which will add cross-platform voice chat, </span>and then another in March of 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">Catch the full details here</a>.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is an ambitious step into live service and multiplayer gaming for Remedy, taking the setting of the Oldest House from Control and then spinning it out into a rather quirky riff on the form of Left 4 Dead and other co-op shooters. Alas, it didn’t quite strike a chord with gamers when it launched earlier this year, despite being readily available on PS Plus and Game Pass. Teething issues at launch and more systemic complaints had Remedy looking for ways to revamp the game going forward. This is just the first step down that path, hopefully.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">Firebreak review</a>, I said, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

			<p>UK indie developer Playtonic Games is about to launch Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of 2017's platform game Yooka-Laylee, and they have now shared the first gameplay footage and info on the Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>The footage was provided to IGN and you can find it embedded below. As for the Switch 2 port, Playtonic Games <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1971201407001809335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X today</a> that this version will only run at 30 frames per second, on both handheld and TV mode.</p>



<p><em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode. Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch.</em></p>



<p><em>We've also received a lot of questions regarding a playable demo on Nintendo Switch 2. Unfortunately, this is not something we're able to accommodate pre-launch but are planning to release post-launch.</em></p>

<p>Yooka-Replaylee features many changes compared to the original (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yookalaylee-1998/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reviewed on this page</a>):</p>



<ul>
<li>A new storybook-style presentation with new sequences introduced throughout the game.</li>

<li>Collectibles have been rearranged across all levels, and the number of discoverable Pagies has doubled.</li>



<li>The moveset has been tweaked and upgraded to include new moves and combos, and the camera has been refined.</li>



<li>New hidden arcade games are scattered throughout the adventure.</li>



<li>A new collectible currency called Q.U.I.D.S.</li>



<li>An adventurer's notebook to help players hunt down everything hidden in the game</li>



<li>New tonics offer multiple game-changing enhancements to customize and perk up your playstyle.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-wolverine-insomniac-logan-height-short-tall-king-2000628829</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fans-can%E2%80%99t-decide-if-the-new-wolverine-game-actually-makes-logan-a-short-king.1309137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Folks, if I know one thing in this world, it’s the lived experience of being a short king. My 5’3” ass has always seen the world from a lower standing than my peers, and it’s rare for me to come across heroes in media who see the world from that same point of view. Wolverine, the X-Man who has pointy metal claws in his knuckles, is one of the few short kings I have to cling to in popular culture, but a lot of people don’t realize that he’s supposed to be a little guy. In the comics, he’s my height exactly, but so many people know him from the movies where he’s played by 6’2” actor Hugh Jackman. </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>makes a joke about this when, through the magic of filmmaking, Deadpool meets a “comic-accurate” version of Logan who needs a booster seat to sit at the bar. Now, however, Wolfie is getting his own game, and there’s no reason that casting a particular actor has to define the character’s stature. So has Insomniac stayed true to his short king status? Fans can’t seem to agree.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628728"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628728">© Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Strictly eyeballing it, Logan looks like he’s definitely of short stature in the trailer that premiered during the State of Play showcase yesterday. Some fans note that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayWolverine/comments/1nppa0b/looks_like_they_actually_made_him_height_accurate/"><span>he definitely appears significantly shorter</span></a><span> than the enemies he’s slicing and dicing, but some don’t think that’s quite enough.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">my gripe is, why is Logan so tall? He should be short and wide <a href="https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9">https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9</a></p> <p>— ✦ JYDAWN ✦ (@_jydawn) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jydawn/status/1971009918087119247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Sorry, I just took some mild psychic damage at reading someone say that Logan being short would make him a “twink,” and I need people to stop trying to use words they don’t understand. This is an annoying case of both tall people and straight people bastardizing my culture. Anyway, the weird part of the conversation is that people actually somehow think that a short Wolverine would be inherently weird or comical. The Hugh Jackman bit in </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>was a joke because it showed that Jackman himself would look ridiculous if he were made a foot shorter with minimal changes to his proportions, but a 5’3” man can absolutely fuck up some mutant-hunting baddy as well as a man who towers over him.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need to banish the idea of 5'2 Logan from existence at this point. People were seriously saying this sized Deadpool Wolverine should be the MCU one. I get it, it's from the comic, but sometimes comic things need to die <a href="https://t.co/90umBvRLYO">https://t.co/90umBvRLYO</a> <a href="https://t.co/X0AwbiohBA">pic.twitter.com/X0AwbiohBA</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1971197931387785534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolverine being 5’2 is legit the worst piece of character lore of all time ngl</p> <p>— Matt b (@hipppyjump) <a href="https://twitter.com/hipppyjump/status/1971068452585800134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Some of this sentiment is rooted in the fact that many people view shorter men as “less manly” or some such weird, toxic shit, which makes me very glad I opted out of all of that when I became interested in video games as a kid and men in adulthood. When people say that Wolverine should be a hulking beast of a tall guy, it’s usually because it conforms to some idealized image of what a man should look like. But that’s boring, and if that’s your problem, you should grow the fuck up. Wolverine is short in </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">Marvel Rivals</a>,</span></i><span> and it rules, actually.</span></p>   <p><span>But is Logan a proper short king in </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>? That we probably won’t know for sure until the game is out and people can rip the models from the files and properly measure him. Insomniac made a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insomniacleaks/comments/18s4pmr/character_scale/"><span>character scale reference sheet</span></a><span> that was part </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><span>of a leak in 2023</span></a><span>, which shows Logan is noticeably shorter than Mystique, Omega Red, and Sabretooth. So it doesn’t look like the studio is trying to size him up </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> much.&nbsp; Even so, Insomniac seems </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grantpdesign.bsky.social/post/3lzmjn7pdrs2g"><span>aware that not everyone thinks he’s short enough</span></a><span>. But shrinking a character model would have a massive ripple effect on nearly every animation in the game, so I’d be very surprised if Insomniac made a real change this far into development. Maybe as a secret unlockable mode down the line, but for now, the height debate will rage on until </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>launches on PS5 in 2026.</span></p>

<p>"If we had realized the change would be happening so close to the subscription launch, we wouldn't have done it," Nisser said. "In addition, we always aim to communicate upcoming price changes to our community and in this case we missed doing that as well. So basically we messed up in a couple of different ways, particularly both internal coordination and community communication and ... the results speak for themselves. The community has been pretty clear that they felt it looked like we were trying to push people into the subscription, and I completely understand that. For better or worse that's not the case, literally just a mishap."</p><p>To do good by the game's ardent fanbase, Starbreeze has not only apologized but also completely reversed course. The Infamous Collection is back to its original $118 price, with an additional 31% off on top of that, bringing the bundle down to $84.92 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/34119/PAYDAY_2_Infamous_Collection/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>).</p><p>"The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch--and they're not wrong, it's terrible timing," Nisser said. "We definitely didn't handle this right, and we'll be apologising to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake."</p><p>Both the Infamous Collection and the Subscription program are strictly for Payday 2, not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/payday-3/" data-ref-id="5000-455016">Payday 3</a>. That's seemingly because, according to SteamDB data, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Payday 3 doesn't tend to crack 1,000 concurrent players</a> while <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Payday 2 frequently has tens of thousands playing</a> at any given time. The former is clearly more popular than the latter.</p><p>The Infamous Collection (only available for the PC version of the game right now) features over 70 pieces of DLC, including various cosmetics, weapons, characters, and more. You don't have to spend $118 (or $84.92) for any of these packs, though, as they're all available piecemeal and currently discounted on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update and overhaul for the 4X strategy game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been released, with version 2.0, dubbed the Revolutions Update, out now.</p>
<p><iframe title="v2.0 Revolutions Update | Ara: History Untold" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5xFw_o-ANs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This update is when we see the fruits of the new development partnership with Stardock, who stepped into a production role to further the game’s post-launch roadmap earlier this year. The revolutions update has been developed with key community feedback, building in a new culture and influence system, units specific to certain nations, quota crafting systems and more.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture &amp; Influence Systems – </strong>Cities gain a new quality of life category called Culture. Culture generates Influence, a new currency used to acquire cultural traits and expand territory through claims. This creates meaningful alternatives to military expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Agitator Unit – </strong>Introduced with the Revolutions technology at the end of the Renaissance, Agitators can be sent into adjacent foreign regions to stir rebellion and, through Influence, bring those territories into your nation. This unlocks a second form of conquest in Act II: ideological subversion.</li>
<li><strong>Per-Nation Units – </strong>Every civilization now commands unique historical forces, from Mongol Horse Archers to Japanese Samurai, adding tactical depth and flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Leader Redesigns – </strong>Every leader has been reimagined with unique mechanics, traits, and abilities, ensuring more replayability and personality-driven diplomacy.</li>
<li><strong>Priority &amp; Quota Crafting System – </strong>Micromanaged production queues are replaced with smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive AI – </strong>A more dynamic and personality-driven AI responds to player performance, making diplomacy, warfare, and resource management more challenging and believable.</li>
<li><strong>Map Generation Overhaul – </strong>Realistic natural resource clustering plus new exclusivity rules modeling historical trade and competition.</li>
<li><strong>High DPI UI &amp; Visual Update – </strong>A sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Boosts – </strong>Major engine optimizations deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We’re thrilled to introduce Culture as a gameplay element in <em>Ara: History Untold</em>,” stated Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock and Oxide. “The importance of ‘soft power’ is immense. Although military conquest is the most straightforward method for territorial expansion, we aimed to provide players with alternative strategies for asserting their influence over the world. This becomes particularly significant in the late game, when exploration and expansion have already reached their limits.”</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. Now, with Civ 7’s stumbles, there’s a chance to carve out an audience for this game through steady updates and community building. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">pushed to all platforms today</a>, adding an FOV slider for console players, stability and performance improvements for all platforms, UI, audio, visual, gear refinements, and more.</p>



<p>As the latest entry in Gearbox's shooter series, even with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical acclaim from multiple outlets</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">major commercial success right at launch</a>, the story of Borderlands 4 isn't about everyone grabbing their own copies and having a blast. </p>



<p>It's about the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">poor technical performance at launch</a>, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford's bizarre approach of antagonizing players upset at the state of the game</a>, and, as of two days ago, how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game has been indefinitely delayed</a> while Gearbox works on the versions already in players' hands.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today's update, and every update that'll come after it, is slowly trying to chip away at that narrative and turn it around from 'Borderlands 4 is broken but fun' to 'Borderlands 4 is fun.'</p>



<p>Starting with stability updates and performance improvements, which are key elements of today's update, and will likely remain key elements of every update going forward. Character animations have been updated, issues of frame rate hitching and crashes have been addressed, and several issues where players didn't get the rewards they were owed from completing an objective have been fixed. </p>



<p>For console players, an FOV slider has finally been added, and for all players, there's a series of balance changes for each of the Vault Hunters and several gameplay elements.</p>



<p>It's all a start, of course, but the work on Borderlands 4 is far from done. Hopefully, it doesn't take Gearbox too much longer to fix the myriad of issues the game launched with. Though with how many problems the game had, it feels like we're in this for the long haul.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/saros-sci-fi-trailer-returnal-housemarque-ps5-state-of-play-2000628274"><i><span>Saros</span></i></a><span>, the next action game from </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>developers Housemarque, was one of the tentpole games during yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span>. The game stars </span><i><span>iZombie </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Fall of the House of Usher </span></i><span>actor Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a soldier investigating a foreign planet full of vicious aliens who will kill him over and over again. Kohli has starred in a few video games, including </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005"><i><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-gods-review-musical-songs-grace-laura-bailey-1850747942"><i><span>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</span></i></a><span>, but this is easily his biggest game role yet, and the dude seems stoked to be there.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on Bluesky, Kohli laid out how video games have always been part of his hopes and dreams. As a kid, he wanted to make video games. He used to work in a game store, and one of his first acting gigs was in a commercial for </span><i><span>LittleBigPlanet </span></i><span>on Vita. So really, it’s all been leading up to this point.</span></p>    <blockquote><p><span>I know it’s cliche to say “this is a dream come true” but in the case of </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, it really is. My first hobby/love was gaming. Before I left primary school, we were asked in assembly to tell the school what we wanted to do for a career. I played a VHS of video game trailers and said I wanted to make video games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of my first jobs was working as a sales assistant at Gamestation (the UK equivalent of GameStop). One of my earliest paid acting gigs was a commercial for Little Big Planet on the PS Vita – I thought I finally made it. My next gig after starring in </span><i><span>iZOMBiE</span></i><span> was playing Fahz in </span><i><span>Gears 5</span></i><span>, I didn’t think anything could top that… until I was approached by Housemarque to play the lead in </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s been a long journey to get here, each moment along the way was special and the final destination isn’t just a career highlight, it’s one of the best moments of my life. Thank you HouseMarque with trusting me with your character, I hope Arjun is everything you asked for. And for the players, see you on March 20th.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>That’s sweet. I was a big fan of Kohli’s performance in </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span>, so I’m interested to see what he brings to the role of Arjun when </span><i><span>Saros </span></i><span>comes to PlayStation 5 on March 20. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-deus-ex-remaster-is-a-reminder-that-better-isn%E2%80%99t-always-better.1309086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just because a remaster of an old game has improved textures, better lighting, runs at a higher resolution, and features fancy new effects doesn’t mean it’s better. I mean, <em>technically</em> it is, but the end result can often look very ugly and wrong. And sadly, this is the case with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">recently announced <em>Deus Ex Remastered.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Yesterday, during Sony’s short and so-so State of Play, we got our first look at a newly announced remaster of the classic immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283">This new version of Elon Musk’s favorite video game</a> is being marketed as a remaster, with higher resolution textures and fancier lighting. And yes, technically, what is seen in the trailer is “better” than the original release. These are higher-resolution textures with more detail. Models are more detailed and complicated, too. What’s here is better in the sense that it is all stuff that couldn’t have been done 25 years ago in 2000. And yet many online, myself included, aren’t impressed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered’</em>s “improved” visuals. In fact, I think the new game looks really terrible.</p> <p>You would think that replacing the old textures from 2000 with new and higher-resolution textures would make<em> Deus Ex</em> look great. The problem with this new remastered port isn’t that the textures are bad, but that they are being slapped on a very old game. The models, levels, and other parts of<em> Deus Ex</em> were designed 25 years ago, with the tech limitations of the period in mind. The original devs and artists worked within those limits to create art that offered just enough detail and let your mind fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Covering the game in new, sharp textures that don’t seem to take into consideration the art design and intentions behind the visuals of the OG <em>Deus Ex</em> leads to an odd juxtaposition. You have the old game running under this new skin that feels out of place. Add in new lighting that changes the mood and appearance of the characters and world even more, and you end up with this odd plastic-y look that we’ve also seen in other similar remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-trilogys-san-andreas-now-feels-depressing-without-i-1848047292?_gl=1*242l6h*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMS4xNzMxNDQ1MjEwLjYwLjAuMA..">like the infamous <em>GTA Trilogy</em> bundle</a>. It’s also the same look I spotted in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">remastered<em> Tomb Raider</em> games,</a> which were also developed by Aspyr, the same team that’s behind <em>Deus Ex Remastered.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Reactions to the <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> trailer have been nearly universally negative. People have criticized the plastic-like sheen on everything, the way the game now seems filled with <em>Doom 3</em>-like stencil shadows, and the overall vibes of this new remaster being off. One highly upvoted comment on YouTube said: “Upgraded visuals from 2000 to 2005.” In direct comparisons between the two, it’s hard not to see the remastered <em>Deus Ex</em> as anything but an ugly mess.</p>   <p>It seems like the remastered version of <em>Deus Ex</em> will be the worst way to replay the original game, especially considering the fact that for decades, fans have created incredible mods that improve the game in smart ways without altering its overall look and vibes too much.</p>

 <p>And that’s the most annoying thing to me about this remastered version of <em>Deus Ex.</em> There are ways to remaster and modernize old games and make them look great. <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048">Nightdive Studios has done some fantastic work</a> bringing back classic titles, like <em>Dark Forces</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-thing-remastered-2002-ps2-xbox-pc-sequel-4k-120-ps5-1851524769"><em>The Thing,</em></a> without making these games look horrible. I think the key is that Nightdive is very careful with the new art it adds to its projects. They tend to create remasters that perhaps aren’t as “fancy” as some others but which almost always look like you remember the games looking back in the day, despite them very much not appearing that way back in the ’90s. Nightdive also tends to let you turn off many or most of the new visual features, too, which is always an appreciated option.</p> <p>So you can definitely remaster a classic game in a faithful way. It can be done. Sadly, for <em>Deus Ex,</em> it seems that it won’t be so lucky with this remaster, and instead, we are left with an overly shiny and visually jarring port of <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985">one of the best PC games of all time</a>. Ah well, at least it’s easy as heck to play and mod on PC in 2025.</p>

This new season includes a brand-new battle pass with both free and premium items. The Season 9 battle pass contains a host of free and premium items, including many items to fit the spooky holiday theme.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJi0i2SgzuA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RJi0i2SgzuA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Battle_pass_details">Battle pass details</h2><p dir="ltr">The main highlights of the free battle-pass tiers are the World War II-era Sten submachine gun and the Sentry Gun Steadygun scorestreak.

Players can use those Entry Tickets to complete minigames, and the games then reward Smackdown Points used to unlock new items. This includes the "Furious Finisher" weapon blueprint for the CR-56 AMAX and the "Fractured Fiend" operator skin for Minotaur.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also potentially earn WWE operator skins for Alexa Bliss and Undertaker as part of the WWE Draws.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Rock_Rampage_event">Rock Rampage event</h3><p dir="ltr">The Rock Rampage event tasks players with collecting Power Chords to unlock the legendary "Shredder" weapon blueprint for the FFAR assault rifle, as well as other cosmetic rewards.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Halloween_event">Halloween event</h3><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Call of Duty Mobile includes candy-collecting events. The details are scarce, but Activision says two new events will arrive just before Halloween.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574965-codm-s9-announce-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574965" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574965-codm-s9-announce-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574965"></a><figcaption>WWE skins in Call of Duty Mobile</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4574965-codm-s9-announce-009.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Multiplayer_content">Multiplayer content</h2><p dir="ltr">Step Into the Ring is a limited-time multiplayer mode.

Players on a hot streak will transform into WWE operators like Undertaker. Once transformed, they'll gain access to unique finishing moves that can be performed from any direction along with enhanced abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">The Halloween-themed variant of the Hacienda map returns as well as the "Hordepoint" Zombies-themed variant of Hardpoint.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Battle_royale">Battle royale</h2><p dir="ltr">Midnight Rumble brings the nighttime setting back to Call of Duty Mobile's Isolated map. Players must face off against one another in the dead of night. Players are recommended to adjust their loadouts and tactics for the lack of visibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 9: Midnight Rumble arrives just ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">Call of Duty's Black Ops 7 beta</a>.

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Gosh, make up your minds</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="RE Requiem - Game Key Card" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0bd37fe4bea16/re-requiem-game-key-card.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Just recently, the director of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> mentioned that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-director-highlights-the-speed-problem-with-switch-2-game-cards">Game-Key Cards for Switch 2 were somewhat of a necessary evil</a>, stating that load times from a physical cartridge are inferior to that found on an SSD.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-resident-evil-requiem-bosses-talk-leaks-switch-2-and-remakes/">VGC</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> director Koshi Nakanishi has seemingly contradicted this viewpoint when asked about the decision to utilise Game-Key Cards. His response was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s not a development decision for us, it’s more of a sales strategy decision."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Welp. It seems we're not going to get a definitive answer on this, with publishers offering various reasons as to why they're opting to use Game-Key Cards for their Switch 2 games. Nakanishi's statement here lends credibility to the assumption that cost is a major factor, with Nintendo seemingly only offering publishers two options: 64GB cartridges or Game-Key Cards.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this isn't confirmation that Resident Evil Requiem will arrive on a Game-Key Card, but it's about as close as we're going to get. Unless we hear otherwise, we're going to assume it won't be a proper physical release.</p>
<p>Nakanishi also touched on the decision to launch Requiem, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village-gold-edition">Resident Evil: Village</a> on the same day (<strong>27th February 2026</strong>). He said that the team started with Village when looking at development for the Switch 2. When that went smoothly, they moved over to Requiem. In the end, they simply said “well, let’s go the whole hog and add in 7”.</p>
<p>So there you have it! A good day for RE fans, indeed.</p>

The developers put out a new trailer today showing off some of the zany things people can build using Portal, but when Battlefield 6 gets into the hands of a big audience, we can only imagine the kinds of things people will build using the tools.</p><p>Community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1971245786362257645" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "Truly looking forward to seeing this level of power in your hands for the first time in Battlefield." Johnson added that the last iteration of Portal only "scraped the surface," but Battlefield 6's Portal mode gives players a lot more freedom.</p><p>Johnson said it might be a fan who comes up with the next Rush or Conquest, referring to Battlefield's best-known modes.</p><p>As you can see in the new trailer posted today, your imagination seems to be the limit of what you can make in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. As an example, we see tanks falling from the sky to create falling missiles that players have to avoid while riding ATVs. That's just one possibility of what people can make.</p><p>Battlefield 6's Portal mode will also allow players to earn XP, and players will be able to find custom games and modes through the game's server browser.</p><p>A bigger investment in Portal for Battlefield 6 is no big surprise. After all, EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said the company wants to <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/user-generated-content-key-to-eas-growth-strategy-towards-over-one-billion-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lean into user-generated content</a> to fuel the company's growth in the future, and it seems Portal will be part of that.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

Referencing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an August 15 blog</a>, where the team promised that Skate's aesthetic would improve to add "even more detail and personality," Full Circle revealed what this "detail and personality" will start to look like when Season 1 drops on October 7.</p>

      </div>
<p>The change, as part of update .28 arriving on the same day as Season 1, gives San Vansterdam a "more grounded and lived in" feel. What Full Circle showed off was a drop in contrast, washing the world in a golden glow. The team said this is "San Van at 'Golden Hour.'"</p><p>"While this is only Step One of what will be an ongoing development of the game’s visuals, we want to give you a sneak peek today," Full Circle posted on X. "And once this update releases [on October 7], we want your feedback so we can keep improving and iterating."</p><p>That's in the more immediate future. Looking ahead into December and beyond, Seasons 2 and 3 (and...beyond) will introduce new content such as customization items, "legacy game modes" from the Skate franchise, challenges, seasonal events like Skate-o-Ween and the 7 Ply Maple Harvest, and party voice chat, alongside quality-of-life improvements and more additions. That does include new tricks, with Season 2 adding impossible and improved handplants while Season 3 brings darkslides and improved footplants. That's sick.</p><p>What's really sick, though, is that you don't have to pay for them. Yes, Seasons 1, 2, and 3 (and beyond) will always introduce some microtransactions--particularly thanks to the imminent inclusion of the Skate Pass--however, when new tricks drop, your wallet stays closed.</p><p>"You will never have to pay for new tricks," Full Circle reiterated in a Q&amp;A towards the end of its X post. "As we add new tricks to skate., you’ll have access to them as soon as they come to the game (update may be required), and they’ll become part of Challenges to help keep up your skill. Once added, a trick will never go away."</p><p>Still, it's hard to tell if any of these updates will assuage the skateboarding community. The game currently sits at a "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mixed</a>" rating on Steam (with over 22,000 reviews at the time of this writing) and some scathing criticism from gaming outlets like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sports/the-new-skate-feels-like-it-was-made-by-people-in-suits-rather-than-people-with-skateboards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. It might not look realistic, but at the very least, the skateboarding to enjoyable.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/palestinian-voice-in-games-coalition-helps-game-developers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-coalition-seeks-to-help-palestinian-game-developers-%E2%80%98speak-loudly%E2%80%99-through-games.1309041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of more than 50 video game industry professionals announced a new initiative dedicated to amplifying the work of Palestinian game developers last week. The coalition, called Palestinian Voices in Games, is supported by the likes of <em>Reigns</em> developer Nerial, narrative design agency actezéro, <em>Democratic Socialist Simulator</em> maker Molleindustria, and others, <a href="https://palestinian-voices-in-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the group’s website</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The group provides access to volunteers to help with game production for Palestinian game developers. A representative for Palestinian Voices in Games said that economic support is something most requested by developers, but noted the group cannot accept donations or raise funds at the moment, though several members have financially supported the development of prototypes. Palestinian Voices in Games is looking for “sponsors and other institutions” who can help with the financial side.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the volunteer-run network is working with game developer Rasheed Abueideh on <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-podcast-rami-ismail-arabic-palestine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dreams on a Pillow</em></a>, “a pseudo-3D stealth adventure game about a land full of people being made into a people without land,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/504479/dreams-on-a-pillow-palestinian-1948-nakba-game-funded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Abueideh’s description</a>; comic artist Iasmin Omar Ata on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XlIa9Fa1lxJT6jgPrdioMoSrZsT77oAF/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Being 2</em></a>, a point-and-click visual novel set in “a futuristic Palestinian space- colony;” designer Yusra on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riyafagame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>RiYafa</em></a>, a game based on “the story of her family and community based in the West Bank;” and developer Yasmine Batniji on <a href="https://gabbahbaya.itch.io/pomegranates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pomegranates</em></a>, a game in which the player is “tasked with tracing echoes of the current war at the renovated Al-Ahli hospital.”</p><p>“The game industry has often been complicit in the othering of people from the Middle East, by creating and promoting games that depict them as enemies and serving the propagandizing efforts of western militaries to justify their occupations and interventions, a representative of Palestinian Voices in Games told Aftermath in an email. “It has long been time for developers to push back against these narratives and make a change. We are moved to help our Palestinian colleagues and friends in any way we can, so that their voices may be heard.”</p><p>Colonial and military narratives have been a backbone of the video game industry for decades, but indie developers have been pushing to shift that narrative, the Palestinian Voices in Games representative said. Still, Palestinian game developers have not had the same opportunities to share their stories through video games.</p><p>“In such a critical historic moment, in which a genocide is being perpetrated in Palestine in front of all of our eyes and the voice and memory of a people is being destroyed, it is more important than ever for Palestinians to be able to speak loudly, so that their stories can be heard and remembered, and so that their humanity and the injustice of the terrible violence they continue to undergo can be fully recognized,” the representative said.</p><p>Support looks different depending on a developer’s project and needs. <em>Dreams on a Pillow</em>, for instance, is a larger project that’s been in the works with an experienced development team, so the group has focused efforts on recruiting volunteers to assist in production work, like artists and animators.&nbsp;</p><p>“For Yusra's <em>RiYafa</em> we have been arranging sessions with industry mentors from different disciplines (production, game design, etc.),” the Palestinian Voices in Games representative said. “For <em>Pomegranates</em> we had volunteers work on production design and writing.”</p><p>Palestinian Voices in Games is choosing projects and developers that are within their current means. They’ve scaled up their efforts several times already—the representative said the group has been working behind the scenes for years—but are nearly at their capacity; they’re looking for more volunteers to help continue the efforts to support the current group of Palestinian developers and expand the program to more.</p><p>The representative said solidarity has been strong among individual game developers and small studios, but that “no large companies or publishers have taken the time to offer support or aid.”</p><p>“Those with the most power and resources have remained silent,” they said. “We truly hope this changes soon and that larger game companies will have the courage to stand up for Palestinian game developers as well.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-dc-ice"><h3>Playing Is This Seat Taken?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159177/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in May 2014. We're updating and republishing it in honour of the game's arrival on Switch as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-advance-gba-game-ranked">the Nintendo Classics GBA lineup</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Starting life on the PlayStation in 1997, at a time when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> had just brought the gaming world triple-jumping headlong into the era of 3D platforming, Namco's Klonoa series has always done things differently. Klonoa's first outing, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/klonoa_door_to_phantomile">Klonoa: Door to Phantomile</a>, was a pioneering foray into 2.5D, mixing polygonal backgrounds with sprite-based characters, and restricting movement to a two-dimensional path while letting the path itself wind its way enchantingly through a three-dimensional world.</p>
<p>It was breathtaking then and continues to captivate today, as Nintendo gamers discovered with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/klonoa">Wii remake</a> in 2008. But Klonoa's earliest appearance on a Nintendo system was back in 2001, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/klonoa_empire_of_dreams">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams</a> for the Game Boy Advance. Given that one of the series' defining features is its innovative use of 2.5D, does this fully two-dimensional performance manage to capture the charm of Klonoa's original adventures? Absolutely, and in the process, Empire of Dreams delivers one of the finest puzzle-platforming experiences found anywhere.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159187/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Rabbit, cat, or both? Klonoa's species is never really explained, and isn't worth fretting over; in-game, he's referred to simply as a "Dream Traveller". Empire of Dreams' story revisits the series' staple theme this time in the Kingdom of Jillius, where an insomnia-stricken emperor has outlawed dreaming within the realm. Naturally, Klonoa runs afoul of this law and is tasked with ridding the kingdom of various monsters to atone for it. Told through mostly static cutscenes, the story is charming and more engrossing than you might expect, and backed up by wonderfully engaging gameplay.</p>
<p>The main hook of the series is that Klonoa can use a short-range "Wind Bullet" from his ring to lift enemies above his head, inflating them in the process in a visual homage to Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/dig_dug">Dig Dug</a>. From there, he can hurl them at other enemies or throw them towards the ground mid-jump, leapfrogging over them to perform his signature double-jump.</p>
<p>It feels great, and re-imagining enemies as stepping stones rather than strictly obstacles makes for a very different kind of platforming experience. It means that just moving around the levels (or "Visions" as they're called here) involves light puzzling elements, and collecting the three stars, plus 30 optional gems that require creative use of Klonoa's skills and puzzle-solving prowess.</p>

<p>Barring some head-scratchers in the later areas, these puzzles are never difficult. But they're not designed to stump you. Rather, they're meant — like Klonoa's central double-jump mechanic — to engage you in your surroundings, and to encourage full use of the environment. By design, Empire of Dreams is a game that invites you to enjoy the little things.</p>
<p>An array of different foes and environmental elements are introduced as you progress, bringing new puzzle-solving techniques with them and making each world feel fresh in gameplay as well as visual style. The level design is fantastic throughout, and keeps a strong sense of forward momentum even when there's backtracking involved. It's very difficult to get lost, and since enemies and objects respawn automatically, you'll never be stuck having to restart a Vision.</p>
<p>The main puzzle levels are broken up by two faster-paced stage types, with both forced-scrolling platforming and side-view hoverboarding sequences thrown into the mix. Yes, Empire of Dreams hails from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/sonic_adventure_2_battle">Sonic Adventure 2</a> era, when every mammalian mascot worth their salt added some sort of extreme board sport to their résumé, but Klonoa feels like he comes by his hoverboard honestly. These stages are a lot of fun, and collecting all 100 optional gems requires quick thinking, split-second jumps, and likely a lot of replay. The forced-scrolling levels in particular are beautifully designed, easy enough to complete without being frustrating, but with gems placed tantalizingly just out of reach so that you're always tempted to risk squeezing in another double-jump or potentially deadly detour.</p>
<figure><a title="Klonoa: Empire of Dreams Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159184/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Even as an early Game Boy Advance release, Empire of Dreams looks wonderful, making excellent use of the system's impressive 2D capabilities. Sprite scaling and rotation add real personality to Klonoa's foes, environments, and boss battles, while parallax scrolling brings the multi-layered backgrounds to life. Animations are beautiful, the sprites are charming, and the bright colour palette — which thoughtfully lent itself to easy viewing even on the non-backlit first generation Game Boy Advance — shines brilliantly. The visual themes in the different worlds also skip the usual platformer clichés of fire, ice, and so on, and are much richer for it; the opera house-themed second world is a real highlight.</p>
<p>The soundtrack was a standout feature of both Klonoa's console outings, and this portable version lives up to their musical legacy, albeit on a smaller scale. The loops are shorter, but the series' trademark sound is still here in spades, with catchy melodies lilting over the action and often evocative of the wind mentioned in our hero's Japanese name (<strong>Kaze no Klonoa</strong> - "Klonoa of the Wind"). The impressive voice samples included are also a treat, and Klonoa's trademark <em>"Wahoo!"</em> adds a gleeful sense of triumph to every double-jump.</p>
<p>Empire of Dreams has 40 Visions spread out over its five worlds, and while it's not a lengthy game by today's standards (you could easily beat it in a weekend), the focused stages are perfect for quick trips into Klonoa's world. You can return to previously cleared Visions at any time, and there are extras to be unlocked by collecting every gem in every level, which significantly extends the replay value for ambitious players.</p>

<p>The restore points afforded by the Wii U's Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online (plus the latter's rewind function) are largely unnecessary, given the game's save system and relatively short levels, but the emulation extras are handy additions.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Game Boy Advance was blessed with an enviable and nearly endless parade of platformers over its lifespan, and this game stands out as one of the very best. With thoroughly satisfying mechanics and more charm in the opening stages than many games manage by the closing credits, Klonoa: Empire of Dreams is an absolute joy and well worth revisiting.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed Klonoa's big screen adventures, you'll love Empire of Dreams both for the same reasons and for its distinct, pocket-sized personality; if you've never had the pleasure of taking a trip with Namco's fuzzy Dream Traveller, this is a wonderful place to start.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-portal-gameplay-appears-online-shows-just-how-far-the-editor-can-be-pushed.1309014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-debuts-battlefield-6-campaign-trailer/">we got our first look at the campaign mode</a> in Battlefield 6 during Sony's State of Play presentation. Today, gameplay from the upcoming Portal mode in Battlefield 6 has appeared online, and it's a major showcase of just how far players will be able to push this new Portal.</p>



<p>If you're unfamiliar, the Portal in Battlefield 6 is where players can access other player-made game modes and levels that drastically change everything about what it is to play Battlefield 6. It's a full-blown creative mode where you can make seemingly anything you can think of using assets and models already in Battlefield, and this year's version of it seems to be more expansive than ever before.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer for the mode from EA and Battlefield Studios that was <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1971228205387317485">posted to X (formerly Twitter)</a> shows a bit of what this new tier of level-crafting potential looks like, with quick shots of the editor and how granular players can get.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>But a video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6RGo76uyTk&amp;t=5s">YouTuber JackFrags</a> shows off some of the Battlefield Studios-made modes that really show off how you can just create whatever you want in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. Want to recreate Counter-Strike? Check. Want to create your own Battlefield version of Call of Duty Zombies? Check. Want to make a version of Only Up where you're competing against other squads to race to the top and hold that position? Check. Racing F-16s, creating your own conquest maps, re-drawing out-of-bounds lines, adjusting every detail of the gameplay experience? Check.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Portal Gameplay and Impressions..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6RGo76uyTk?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's far more freedom than we've seen in previous Battlefield games, and while the modes created by Battlefield Studios shown in the video are just a few of the more obvious options (like a Zombies mode or racing vehicles), you can only imagine the kinds of modes players will make once they get their hands on it.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to find out, as Battlefield 6 arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming October 10, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ananta-anime-gta-spider-man-rip-off-clone-trailer-2000628763</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/viral-anime-gta-clone-is-ditching-gacha-but-not-being-shy-about-ripping-off-spider-man.1309011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s the saying, “good artists copy, great ones steal.” And then there’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-mugen-ananta-anime-rpg-open-world-gta-trailer-1851714840">whatever <em>Ananta</em> is doing</a>. The upcoming open-world RPG from NetEase developer Naked Rain is going viral again thanks to new footage from Tokyo Game Show 2025. While it might look like the latest round of <em>Genshin Impact</em>-inspired <a href="https://kotaku.com/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverse-rpg-project-mugen-anime-1850772023">mobile anime slop</a>, the developer has confirmed it won’t be relying on exploitative gambling mechanics to earn its keep. It will, however, be ripping off <em>Spider-Man</em> in every way it can.</p> <p>First, let’s start with the new trailer. Released earlier this week, it shows seven minutes of gameplay depicting all the ways you can explore, fight, and hang out in <em>Ananta’s</em> urban playground, and in the process it practically ends up serving as a greatest-hits highlight reel of all the past games the upcoming mobile release is clearly pulling from, including not just<em> Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em> but also<em> Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Sifu</em>, and more. There’s fluid martial arts brawls and smartphone hacking games. And of course, there’s the web-slinging people have been gawking at since the game was first announced.</p>  <p>It looks neat, and it’s impressive this is a game designed for mobile devices and not high-end consoles. Naked Rain is promising multi-level exploration from the ground-level streets to city rooftops, as well as interiors you can explore at different elevations. There are vehicles you can get in and drive, weapons you can pick up off the ground, from guns to golf clubs, and NPCs who will supposedly react to whatever chaos you’re causing while out exploring. “Every choice ripples through the life of the city,” the developers write. We’ll see.</p>

 <p>For some players, this is a win-win-win. Steal one game mechanic and you’re a thief. But take a bunch from all different games, pour them into a blender, see what comes out, and you might be a genius, or at least someone with the potential to make NetEase a lot of money. For others, however, <em>Ananta</em> is a bit too “shameless” when it comes to ripping off the competition. It’s not just that you can web-swing around town like Spider-Man, it’s that you can also use Venom-like powers to smash bad guys with attacks that look straight out of<em> Spider-Man 2</em>. Some of its chase scenes, meanwhile, seem lifted right out of an <em>Uncharted </em>game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Ananta game has no shame 😅<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Uncharted4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Uncharted4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaughtyDog?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NaughtyDog</a> <a href="https://t.co/ly53Bi6Ebi">pic.twitter.com/ly53Bi6Ebi</a></p> <p>— King J 🤴🏿 (@JMaine518) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMaine518/status/1971228406328250840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marvel's Spider-Man 2: The Anime… I mean, ANANTA looks absolutely incredible! It genuinely looks like Marvel's Spider-Man, GTA, Watch Dogs, and Sleeping Dogs all rolled into one stylish open world package! Will definitely be keeping my eyes on this game in the future! 👀🎮 <a href="https://t.co/lEVNgvnDcP">pic.twitter.com/lEVNgvnDcP</a></p> <p>— Evan Filarca (@EvanFilarca) <a href="https://twitter.com/EvanFilarca/status/1970486621100208345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh no, the Playstation supported Chinese game has taken all of the best elements of every game of the last 15 years and put it all in one free to play game!</p> <p>I for one am outraged.</p> <p>— Chríss (@Chriss_m) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chriss_m/status/1971227972226228642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Whether all of this will ultimately make for a good game remains to be seen. <em>Ananta</em> could be a breakout free-to-play hit that makes people rethink what certain genre mashups are capable of, or it could just be a tricked-out car with no gas in the tank. One other big thing going for it is that, unlike a lot of games in this space, <em>Ananta</em> won’t be hawking pay-to-win character loot boxes&nbsp;in order to make money. Naked Rain confirmed <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53241">to <em>Famitsu</em></a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gta-style-open-world-anime-game-ananta-will-not-have-a-character-gacha-system-netease-confirms/"><em>Automaton</em></a>) that rather than these kinds of <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-whales-hoyoverse-gacha-gambling-spending-1849734889">gacha mechanics</a>, the game’s monetization will instead rely on cosmetics and other customizable features ranging from outfits and cars to the player’s house.</p> <p>It’s not the only post-<em>Genshin Impact</em> mobile RPG to be shifting away from gacha mechanics. The makers of<em> Duet Night Abyss,</em> which arrives on mobile next month, announced they too <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/a-gacha-rpg-is-cutting-all-the-gacha-garbage-so-it-can-just-be-a-better-game-were-completely-removing-all-character-and-weapon-banners/">would be ditching</a> the hero loot box grind and getting rid of star ratings for equipment to limit pay-to-win mechanics. It’s also doing away with stamina limits, another popular way of nickel-and-diming players on mobile. “In the last test,” DecaBear says, “[testers] said our gameplay<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->which is built around fast-paced grinding<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->kept getting blocked by stamina limits,” producer DecaBear said. “And that felt pretty bad.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developer Gearbox has released the biggest update to the looter shooter since launch, adding a Field of View (FOV) slider on console, various performance improvements, and various Vault Hunter and gear buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The September 25, 2025 update adds new Weekly Activities, stability and performance improvements, adjustments to some rewards/progression, and further refinements across UI, audio, visuals, and gear. Check out the patch notes, from <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Borderlands website</a>, below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of particular note is the addition of a FOV slider on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-confirms-its-exploring-how-to-add-fov-sliders-to-borderlands-4-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-amid-complaints-from-console-players">something players had asked for</a>. Gearbox chief <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness">Randy Pitchford had responded to the complaints to suggest fairness might have had something to do with the lack of a FOV slider in Borderlands 4</a>, although all that comment did was confuse fans given the PC version has it and there’s crossplay at launch. While its arrival is welcome, Gearbox warned console players that increasing the FOV past the default could cause some dips in performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Graeme Timmins had flagged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions">Gearbox was more interested in buffing than nerfing Borderlands 4 in the short term</a>, leaving broken builds alone for the time being. And today's update reinforces that approach, with no nerfs to speak of. Indeed, Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to say Gearbox had too many buffs to fit into today’s update, so it broke them up into their own balance update that’s due out early next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The update also includes fixes for the high-profile memory leak issue for Borderlands 4 on console, which causes the framerate to degrade the longer you play. But there’s more to come. “We believe we've made significant improvements there, but we're still investigating data to make sure any remaining issues continue to be resolved,” <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971251482692669832" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timmins explained</a>. “We're confident that today's update makes a big difference though, and we're excited to get feedback/data on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance improvements on PC are also welcome. Borderlands 4 is still on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around PC performance. The tech experts at Digital Foundry have said their <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</u></a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><u>which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without an updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 3 is not in any plan developer Arrowhead has right now, the studio’s CEO has confirmed. Instead, it wants <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> to keep going for years and years, like veteran MMO RuneScape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex’s fantasy MMO RuneScape began life as a browser game an incredible 25 years ago. It’s had over 300 million accounts since, and is still going strong today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, rather than follow Helldivers 2 with Helldivers 3, as the video game industry would perhaps expect, Arrowhead wants to follow RuneScape’s lead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-boss-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-a-forever-game-like-runescape-that-can-keep-improving-with-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani clarified the studio’s plans in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420521613207535647" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on Discord</a>. “We have no plans for HD3,” he said, “just HD2 for as long as it can go. Think RuneScape.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of a Helldivers 3 had come up recently when Jorjani said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-a-destiny-style-social-hub-for-helldivers-2-its-on-the-feature-list-for-the-next-one-dev-says">a social hub space like the Tower in Destiny was “on the feature list for the next one."</a> But he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified</a> that he was talking about Arrowhead’s next game, not a Helldivers 2 sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His latest comment is consistent with prior statements on the studio’s plans. Jorjani has in the past said Arrowhead hopes to build upon Helldivers 2 to such an extent that it basically becomes a Helldivers 3, but that was clearly figuratively speaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Myself and the directors agree we would love this to be a forever game,” Jorjani added in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420498034395054172" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another Discord post</a>. “Assuming we get a grip on the performance and dev practices we can keep expanding it for a long time. PlayStation is super supportive.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Helldivers 2 Review Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Jorjani’s comments shouldn't come as a surprise. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab"><u>The studio has indicated it plans to support Helldivers 2 for years to come</u></a>, and only recently launched the Sony-published game on Xbox Series X and S and the Into the Unjust update, which added Hive Worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-wants-helldivers-2-to-be-around-for-years-and-years-and-years-to-come-and-what-about-a-warhammer-40000-collab">Helldivers 2 production director Alex Bolle told IGN</a> "we want it to be around for years and years and years to come."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And it's almost like, how do we stay true to the Helldivers 2 fantasy, challenging enough that we keep making amazing new features and new systems and all that while we stay true to who we are?" he continued. "And I think it's something that is so motivating for the years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The more we figure out how to thrive in a live environment, and we still have a way to go to figure out a lot of things around that, the more we can let creativity loose on new systems that we would've never thought about a year ago when we released. I've worked on live games before and it's where you feel like you have something you can figure out: what if I would do this cool thing I've seen in other games and adapt it to our sauce, that still makes it true to ourselves? I'm looking forward to this moment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while Helldivers 3 isn’t happening, more Helldivers stuff very much is. In January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-helldivers-2-film-in-production">Sony announced that <u>Helldivers 2</u> was being adapted into a film</a> as part of a collaboration between Sony Productions and Sony Pictures. No other details were offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-review-update-now-on-xbox-series-xs"><u>review of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X and S</u></a> to see what we think of the game as it is today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Finally scoring on Switch this November</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It's that time of year again when Level-5 reminds us all that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> is a real game, and this time, there's even a brand-new trailer to boot.</p>
<p>The repeatedly delayed football RPG will <em>finally</em> be arriving on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>13th November</strong>, and today's Tokyo Game Show trailer gives us the lowdown on everything that we can expect.</p>
<p>Now, sure, the footage that we see this time isn't particularly different to that which we've been shown before, but in Level-5's defence, we have been tracking this one for a long time at this point.</p>
<p>The new trailer is only available in Japanese for the time being — the caption states that English subtitles will be added "at a later date" — but there's still plenty of gameplay to check out. We get a good look at the game's OTT training minigames, special-ability-based matches and nostalgic 'Chronicle Mode'. There's even a touch of town building-esque pitch customisation thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>It has been a long time coming, but we'd be lying if we said that we weren't a little bit excited for this one to finally kick off in November. Let's just hope that the release date sticks this time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We still have a few other holidays to get through before the big ones at the end of the year, but you can get excited for them now with this LEGO Star Wars advent calendar. Truly, I can’t thing of a better brand to be making advent calendars for the holidays. Small, surprise LEGO builds are the perfect little toy and activity to be greeted with each day while counting down to Christmas. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4308/">This Star Wars one is normally priced at $45, but for a limited time you can scoop it up for 16% off</a>. That brings the price down to just $38, saving you a cool $7.</p>
<p>This LEGO Star Wars advent calendar is new for 2025 and will transform December into 24 days of fun for any Star Wars fan six years old and up. The set includes a very specific choice of iconic characters across the franchise. You won’t find Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, or Prince Leia here. You won’t even find Rey, Finn, the Mandalorian, or Grogu. Instead you get Babu Frik and a bunch of droids. C-3PO is there of course but you also get droids like R7-A7, BD-72, a scrap battle droid, and a super battle droid. BB-8 is adorably dressed up like a snowman and there is a Jawa that comes with a holiday sweater.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4308/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>There are even more droids that buildable like a Pit Droid, Gonk Droid, Buzz Droid, holiday versions of a Medical Droid and a Mouse Droid, B2EMO, Treadwell Droid, and a Probe Droid. Merry Droidmas everybody.</p>
<p>You also get elements of Babu Frik’s workshop which can be connected together by the time they’re all opened.</p>



<h2>Let Star Wars Make Your Holiday Special</h2>
<p>Maybe sometime along the way of this 24-day countdown with you new LEGO advent calendar, you make some time to checkout the infamous <em>Star Wars Holiday Special</em> of which most involved wish it to go away. The CBS made-for-television broadcast is set after <em>A New Hope</em> but before the yet-to-be-released&nbsp;<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. It follows everyone’s favorite Wookie Chewbacca alongside Han Solo venturing to return to Chewie’s home planet of Kashyyyk to celebrate “Life Day.” After its first airing it had never been broadcast again nor re-released in any official capacity. It’s not good and is the right choice to make this LEGO advent calendar have nothing to do with it.</p>
