<p>Hint: it's the same as Japan!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Clear River Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> will launch on Switch in the West on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. That's the same date as Japan!</p>
<p>Developed by City Connection Co. Ltd, the game will receive a physical edition in addition to the usual digital release on Switch, a whopping 27 years after its original release on the PlayStation in 1998.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta will run at 60fps on the Switch and you'll also have the option to swap between the new HD visuals and the original presentation. A newly arranged soundtrack is also available, while players can tinker around with the game's multiple difficulty settings for the optimum experience.</p>
<p>If you want a taster before launch and happen to be attending either GamesCom or PAX West this year, R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available to try out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the year 2163, having triumphed over the Bydo Empire, the R9 was recovered and stored within a space fortress orbiting Earth. Humanity breathed a collective sigh of relief, but this was short-lived when in 2164 unidentified objects fell from the sky, followed electronic weapons systems running amok, and culminating in an ‘annihilation unit’ stored alongside the R9 suddenly going berserk, descending to Earth and beginning a wave of destruction. To bring the situation under control, the prototype test unit “R9 Delta” is deployed—marking the beginning of a new battle against the Bydo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll keep you up to date on any fresh announcements regarding R-Type Delta as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">announced</a> the games being added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for August 2025, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered headlining the 11-total titles added across the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>Technically, for PS Plus Premium subscribers, it's a full 12 games that they'll have access to thanks to their subscription, but the twelfth title is just a new game trial for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, so it doesn't really count to make this month's catalog additions a full 12, since you only get five hours with it before you'd have to buy the game to play the rest.</p>



<p>This month's additions also include a new day-one release, with Sword of the Sea launching into PS Plus Extra when it arrives on August 19. The game comes from some of the same developers who made Journey, and was showcased earlier this year at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play</a> event.</p>

<p>Other notable inclusions among the nine games entering the PS Plus Extra games catalog, and the two games entering the PS Plus Premium Classic's game catalog include Vanillaware's Unicorn Overlord, and one of 2024's standout indie titles, Indika. And in the case of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, subscribers on PS5 will be able to access the native PS5 remaster, while subscribers on PS4 will get access to the Marvel's Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition, which includes all the DLC released for the game.</p>



<p>And as far as the two classic games are concerned, it's a Resident Evil-focused month, with the original PS One versions of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis being added to the classic's catalog.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games being added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mortal Kombat 1 (PS5)</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Sword of the Sea (PS5) - available as of August 19</li>



<li>Earth Defence Force 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Unicorn Overlord (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Indika (PS5)</li>



<li>Harold Halibut (PS5)</li>



<li>Coral Island (PS5)</li>



<li>Resident Evil 2 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>



<li>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Along with these 11 games, if you're a Premium-tier subscriber, then you're getting a total of 14 games you can try out in August, including the three games previously announced for subscribers on the base Essential-level tier, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-august-2025-lies-of-p-dayz-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">Lies of P and DayZ.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Voyagers Release Date Brings Cute Co-op Fun in September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-voyagers-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-voyagers-release-date-brings-cute-co-op-fun-in-september.1269336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Light Brick Studio and publisher Annapurna Interactive have announced the release date for upcoming cute co-op adventure&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, and it's not too far off at all.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect to play <i>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</i>on September 15th, and it'll be releasing across most current platforms (with the exception of the Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch 2, but you can play the Switch version on the Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, it's a co-op adventure game that was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>. The game is intended for two players, as indicated by its rather adorable little stud characters and emphasis on co-op puzzling.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-train.jpg?itok=jj5x0-f3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-train.jpg?itok=E6ymVuth 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>is set to launch in September.</figcaption></figure><p>Annapurna and Light Brick say that&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>revolves around the journey of two friends, who embark on a mission to "rescue an abandoned spaceship", building their friendship (and a whole lot of Lego structures) along the way.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising a "poetic, non-verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick-built environments" complete with an "atmospheric soundtrack". You'll also find "many challenges" to complete, and you can either play in local co-op or online as well, although it doesn't seem that the game will support single-player.</p>

<p>Much like EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">smash hit&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>will also come <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">complete with a Friend's Pass</a>, which means that if you've got a friend who wants to play it alongside you, they'll be able to do so at no extra cost. It's not entirely clear whether this pass will be cross-platform in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s pass is, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-swing.jpg?itok=nxqIXzXT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-swing.jpg?itok=qukpsPUR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You and a friend can enjoy&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>for the cost of just one copy.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10011346" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lego-voyagers/9NKD66G942R8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Whether or not there's going to be a Switch 2 version appears to be a little up in the air; in the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/june/lego-voyagers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, the Switch 2 isn't mentioned, but the new trailer's description points to "Nintendo Switch platforms", so perhaps a native Switch 2 release is on the cards. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mgs-metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-no-crossplay-nightreign-rematch-ps5-2000617474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-2025-why-are-we-still-getting-multiplayer-games-without-crossplay.1269327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>On August 13, Konami confirmed that <em>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater Delta</em>‘s new multiplayer mode–<a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-online-1851784404">Fox Hunt–</a>won’t support crossplay on PC or consoles. It’s not the only game to lack the popular feature this year. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> doesn’t support crossplay and arcade soccer hit <em>Rematch</em> launched without it, too. But in 2025, it is weird that some games are still lacking what feels like an industry standard for multiplayer games.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462">In a small post on Twitter on Wednesday</a>, Konami announced that its upcoming <em>MGS</em> remake won’t feature crossplay multiplayer in Fox Hunt. It’s the latest bit of bad news about the game’s online mode after Konami confirmed last week that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/metal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode-just-got-delayed/"><em>MGS Snake Eater Delta</em> multiplayer won’t be available at launch</a>. Instead, it will be added to the game via a free update in the fall. Many players are now worried that when Fox Hunt finally arrives, the mode, which was likely to have a small playerbase compared to more popular online games anyway, might suffer from long wait times and will feel dead soon after launch. Crossplay could have united the small groups of players spread across PS5, Xbox, and PC, but now that won’t happen. An upcoming <em>MGS</em> remake isn’t the only big-name game to skip crossplay in 2025.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【ご案内】<br>『METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER』のオンライン対戦モード 「FOX HUNT」につきまして、異なるプラットフォーム間でのクロスプレイは非対応となります。</p> <p>対応機種<br>PlayStation®5、Xbox Series X|S、Steam®<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MGSDelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MGSDelta</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetalGearSolid?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetalGearSolid</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%82%BD%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%89?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#メタルギアソリッド</a> <a href="https://t.co/sGsv3CjyhW">pic.twitter.com/sGsv3CjyhW</a></p> <p>— メタルギア公式 (METAL GEAR) (@metalgear_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> has received rave reviews from players and critics and has consumed the lives of at least five different people I know, including my wife and <em>Kotaku</em> reporter Ethan Gach. But the game launched without crossplay, and FromSoftware is unlikely to ever add it. Sure, some players might be annoyed by crossplay in competitive games like <em>Call of Duty,</em> because it allows PC hackers to screw with console players easily. But in something like <em>Nightreign</em>, that would have been a non-issue. Most people are playing the online, run-based RPG with friends, and the game is all PVE co-op. Another 2025 game that lacked crossplay at launch is the fantastic soccer game <em>Rematch</em>, though it is being added in the near future, <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/sloclap-rematch-dev-update-july-18th-2025">according to the devs</a>.</p>

 <p>It wasn’t that long ago that crossplay was a novelty that we rarely saw in console games. Then, around 2019, <em>Fortnite</em> became mega popular, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/cross-platform-gaming-has-been-great-1845804328">Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo were all forced to play ball</a> as it became clear that players wanted to play with their friends regardless of platform. Nowadays, a game announcing crossplay isn’t news. Instead, it’s only the lack of the feature that catches people’s attention, like <em>MGS Snake Eater Delta</em>‘s announcement.</p> <p>So why are some games still avoiding crossplay? There’s for sure some tech reasons behind the decision. Even if it’s easier today than before to implement crossplay, it’s still extra work for devs and adds more complications to big games that are already complex pieces of software. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/sony-charges-for-crossplay-support-to-protect-psn-revenue-documents-show/">There’s also the claim that Sony is reportedly</a> still charging publishers fees to add crossplay to games ported to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-cross-play-ps5-xbox-borderlands-1848649295">PS4 or PS5.</a> That extra cost might make a publisher pass on supporting crossplay, especially in co-op-only games like <em>Nightreign</em> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-online-mgo-2-rpcs3-fox-hunt-delta-remake-2000616716">niche online modes like <em>MGS’s</em> Fox Hunt.&nbsp;</a> Whatever the reason, it is now very odd not to include crossplay, and it’s only going to get weirder to do so as a new generation of gamers grows up in an era where almost every game supports cross-platform multiplayer action.</p>

To continue on with 2K26's ratings week, the developers have revealed the best rookies in the game at launch. While the first few members of the top 10 rookies are as expected, there are some shifts at the bottom of the list compared to how draft night went earlier in 2025.</p><p>Below, you can see the top 10 rookies in NBA 2K26 according to their ratings at launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh57YWNaQC4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mh57YWNaQC4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>NBA 2K26 rookie ratings</h2><p>We'll count down each of the top rookies by their rating below. There's certainly one outlier on the list, and you can probably guess who that is, but there are some other rookies you'll definitely want to keep your eye on as the NBA season begins.</p><h3>Cooper Flagg - 82 OVR</h3><p>Let's get first-round draft pick Cooper Flagg out of the way. The new Dallas Mavericks forward is given a rare 80+ rating for a rookie, which doesn't often happen unless 2K believes the player is a generational prospect. The jury is still out on Flagg as we haven't seen him in any real action yet, but he has the tools to be an immediate star.</p><h3>Dylan Harper - 78 OVR</h3><p>We're back to reality now, and second overall draft pick Dylan Harper of the San Antonio Spurs comes in at the number two spot on the list. If Cooper Flagg wasn't in the draft, Harper is the first overall choice by a landslide, and the Spurs are certainly building something special between him and Victor Wembanyama.</p><h3>Ace Bailey - 77 OVR</h3><p>Ace Bailey was the fifth overall draft pick in 2025, but he should've been a higher selection under normal circumstances. Bailey had an interesting pre-draft process, to say the least, that dropped his draft stock slightly, but his talent is undeniable. Bailey should be firmly in the running for Rookie of the Year along with Flagg and Harper.</p><h3>V.J. Edgecombe - 76 OVR</h3><p>There's significant hype around what V.J. Edgecombe could bring to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2025 and beyond. Edgecombe is an intriguing prospect with tools to make an impact on both sides of the ball, and could form a lethal duo with second-year player Jared McCain.</p><h3>Kon Knueppel -75 OVR</h3><p>Kon Knueppel was the fourth overall draft pick, going to the Charlotte Hornets. While the Hornets likely won't be in contention during the 2025 season, Knueppel could find his way into the starting roster based on what we saw in the NBA Summer League, where he was named MVP.</p><h3>Tre Johnson - 75 OVR</h3><p>Tre Johnson was considered a fantastic value pick by the Washington Wizards in the 2025 draft. Coming out of Texas, Johnson could have gone as high as third overall, according to some analysts, but wound up in Washington, where he gets to learn from several savvy veterans and showcase his offensive talent.</p><h3>Khaman Maluach - 74 OVR</h3><p>Khaman Maluach is the first player to be rated outside of where he was drafted. Maluach was drafted tenth overall by the Rockets, but he wound up traded to the Phoenix Suns, where there's room for some young talent to shine after the departure of Kevin Durant.</p><h3>Jeremiah Fears - 73 OVR</h3><p>Jeremiah Fears is up next, coming in at 73 OVR after he was drafted seventh overall by the New Orleans Pelicans. Fears will need some time to develop at the NBA level, but he has the potential to make a huge impact on an always-struggling Pelicans roster.</p><h3>Egor Demin - 72 OVR</h3><p>Egor Demin was drafted by the Brooklyn Nets eighth overall in the draft. Demin has the potential to be one of the best passers in the NBA. However, Demin needs to shore up his shooting ability at the next level if he wants to be rated any higher.</p><h3>Collin Murray-Boyles - 72 OVR</h3><p>Rounding out the list of the top 10 rookies is Toronto Raptors draft pick Collin Murray-Boyles. Coming out of South Carolina, Murray-Boyles was renowned for his defense and niche offensive abilities. Comparisons to Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday were made all throughout the draft process, and that's certainly not a bad mold for the Raptors' rookie.</p><p>That does it for the top 10 list of the best rookies in NBA 2K26.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-broke-my-foot-but-the-iwalkfree-gave-me-mobility-back.1269312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The iWalkFree 3.0 is a mobility device that works a little bit like an extension of your leg.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>My foot is currently what the medical profession would call “busted.” This happened due to the structural collapse of a step, and the result was my 4th and 5th metatarsal being broken into two and “multiple” pieces respectively. Like Bart Simpson in the<em> Rear Window </em>parody episode “Bart of Darkness,” I am now forced to spend the remainder of my summer recuperating indoors while friends have fun. But there is one piece of gear that has made my life a little bit easier: the iWalkFree, a mobility aid that does not oversell itself and has helped me get back a tiny bit of mobility.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Uchi-mata - Basic principles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9lpgFLKqvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is not the first time that I have had a bone shattered below the knee. The first time was around 2008, during a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class. I was training with a still fairly new white belt who ominously told me he “had a fight in Long Island coming up” and who had zero experience in standup Judo throws. The class was learning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uchi_mata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uchi-mata</a>, a basic throw that involves lifting your leg between your opponent’s legs and rolling them over your hip. He did not do that. Instead he turned around and pushed into me sideways, causing my left ankle to catch the majority of the force and breaking my ankle. I was young and uninsured and had never broken a bone, and there was an EMT training there who said it looked like a sprain.</p><p>Not knowing what a hospital visit would cost, I stumbled out, iced it with a Diet Coke on the street, hailed a taxi homeward, realized I would not have enough money to get home, staggered down the two flights of the First Avenue L train, got on the train, staggered out of my stop in Bushwick, walked two blocks, walked up three flights of stairs and rested. I walked on it for two weeks before I got an X-ray confirming that it would need to be rebroken and pins and plates would need to be put in (total count was I believe eight pins), but in the meantime I did attend my college graduation ceremony on crutches. This is what it was like to be young and dumb before Obamacare extended the length of time you could be on your parents’ insurance to the age of 26.</p><figure><figcaption>Medical professionals have told me that it should not look like that.</figcaption></figure><p>This time around, I took a spill in my backyard and immediately went to the hospital. For the second time in my life, I have a plate in my lower body, but at least I caught it early. Suddenly being on crutches is not a fun experience, but for me will be transitory. Lower leg breaks are a reminder that every non-disabled person is likely to gain a disability on a long enough timeline, some sooner than others, and what the limitations of the place you live in are (the MTA, for example, <a href="https://dralegal.org/press/mta-subway-elevators-lawsuit-proceeding-to-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is so bad at this they got sued for it</a>).&nbsp; It also requires relearning big parts of your life, and for me the hardest part was not going out and socializing but being able to go to the deli for a soda and putter around my house to do basic tasks. Grabbing several small tools scattered from around my house is like 50 percent of my day when I’m in project mode, and having an impediment slowed me to a snail’s pace.&nbsp;</p><p>Being Aftermath’s resident “<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gear Guy</a>,” I decided to solve this problem with hardware. I had seen those knee scooters people use, and while they appear to be very fast, my understanding is they come with a higher than normal fall risk. They also do not help with my main problem: my home has stairs. This is where I stumbled on the iWalkFree, a hands-free crutch that functions somewhat but not entirely like a prosthetic peg leg. It’s a T-shaped device that you tightly strap your lower leg into and walk around in a way approximating non-disabled locomotion. You can often find them on Marketplace or Craigslist for cheap, but the one deal I tried to get fell apart. iWalkFree is often sold refurbished at a discount on their website (and if you have a health HSA or FSA you can use that) so that’s the path I decided to go down.</p><figure><figcaption>I trust Vibram implicitly at this point in my life. Credit: iWalkFree.</figcaption></figure><p>A minor detail that immediately sold me on the iWalkFree is that it has a Vibram sole. Vibram makes “the good soles,” and most of the shoes and sandals I buy have them. When I see that little yellow octagon logo, I’m confident that it’s not going to slip easily. iWalkFree also apparently sells an aftermarket Vibram sole for snowy weather, which makes sense considering how big a fall risk ice is. iWalkFree also does not oversell their device in videos and advertisements – it has height and weight limits and it isn’t going to be the same as non-disabled walking. They are transparent that the device takes some getting used to and comes with tradeoffs. This is not going to be a full replacement for walking at a rigorous pace, but if you need to stand for long periods where you use your hands or carry something light from room to room, it turns out it’s perfect.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="iWALK3.0 - Setting Realistic Expectations" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lTFemYHUyQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I ordered my refurbished device and quickly assembled it. The instructions on how to fit and use an iWalkFree are hyper specific and worth following in their entirety. You not only have to adjust the three layers of straps to the exact length of your leg in two different color-coded paces, you also have to adjust the top using two thigh support dials to accommodate upper thigh circumference. Getting these settings dialed in for your particular leg and body shape is extremely important, and the thigh supports in particular are going to influence if the sole of the device is going to land squarely on the ground.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="iWALK3.0 First Time Use Instructions" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5KfaPa9Jic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I took to the iWalkFree quickly. Within 30 minutes I had not only <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled a shot of espresso</a>, I had started curing<a href="https://youtu.be/p3gfaq_RYnI?si=VHCMdJI7ccp2aQvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> salmon sashimi</a> for meal prep. The iWalkFree also has a handle at the top of the thigh, which helps for learning and balance and if you need to get someplace quickly, but when you dig into walking you rarely need to balance on the handle.</p><figure><figcaption>There's actually a rotatable 3D model of the device on iWalkFree's website and you can see how the strap system and the thigh adjustment works here. Credit: iWalkFree</figcaption></figure><p>The iWalkFree is not without its drawbacks. You do need to be more cognizant of obstacles and terrain, and it can take a little bit for your other leg to adjust to the added strain of walking. Every time you need to stand up or sit down, you are going to need to strap or unstrap the device. Doing this correctly every single time is vital but can get slightly tedious and requires you to game out the process of sitting down or standing up. But once you have actually gotten up you’re fine for a while. Many people, myself included, also complain about knee discomfort. The rationale iWalkFree gives is that they would rather have a device fit snugly than to have excess cushioning interfere with the process walking. This does not bother everyone, but if it really bothers you due to the geometry of your knee then a knee pad or a piece of memory foam seems to solve the issue fairly quickly. I was also considering throwing myself into a research hole about trekking poles anyway for hiking once my foot healed, so I may bite the bullet on those sooner rather than later</p><p>But despite its minor drawbacks, I’m having a blast. With the iWalkFree, I trip less than I did on crutches, all while being able to use my hands. There are stumbles to be sure, but far fewer than when I was back on crutches. But the part that impresses me almost as much as hands free walking is something much simpler: a company putting out a well made product while being very up front about its caveats and limitations.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-response"><h3>Krafton Responds To Subnautica 2 Lawsuit, Doubling Down On Claims That Executives ‘Abandoned’ Development</h3></a><p>Krafton lawyers say the lawsuit is over ‘a multimillion-dollar payday [the former executives] haven’t earned’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158003/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>There were occasions in 2024 where I wanted nothing more than for the frequency of TMNT game releases to slow down a little. We got <em>three</em> new video game outings, and while some opted for big swings, I couldn't help but feel that the sewer-dwellers' saturation was becoming too much — it's funny how a hit like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_shredders_revenge">Shredder's Revenge</a> and a widely popular movie like <strong>Mutant Mayhem</strong> will do that.</p>
<p>So, it was with some trepidation that I went into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, a turn-based reimagining from developer Strange Scaffold that launched on PC earlier this year promising yet another "new" take on the brothers' beat-'em-up formula. It's a promise that I've been stung by too many times in the past, and I expected nothing but the same again. Dear reader, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Tactical Takedown is a fresh take on what a Turtles game <em>can</em> be. The restraints and rigidity of a turn-based board shouldn't match the fluid motion of a beat 'em up, but somehow, here, they do. It's a bite-sized experience that isn't without flaws, but if you've grown tired of the IP's persistent punching in recent years, this is the reinvigorating pizza slice you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157997/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with that big selling point: yes, it's turn-based. Tactical Takedown takes the Turtles' usual combo-focused combat and translates it into the world of strategy. Each hero has six Action Points per turn, which can be used to move around the arena or take on members of the Foot Clan. With them all spent, it's the Enemy Turn, and you'll see whether your strategic planning paid off, or if your Turtle is going to take a beating.</p>
<p>This format isn't especially new, but it <em>is</em> new for the Turtles. The beat-'em-up trappings are still there (giant 'GO' signs still crop up to guide you through the stages, don't worry), but Strange Scaffold has impressively folded them into the turn-based structure to create something that will feel instantly familiar to Turtles fans, even if you've never touched a strategy RPG before.</p>
<p>Take the brothers' four distinct playstyles, for example. It's a fundamental part of any good Turtles game, and it's well-translated to the turn-based arena. Mikey is all about manoeuvrability, Raph jumps straight into the action and deals heavy hits, Donnie attacks from range and has access to techy traps, and Leo chains together KOs to slice up foes with precision. You can purchase new moves and switch up each Turtle's 'loadout' before each level, but on the whole, Tactical Takedown nails the feel of each character without any tweaking needed.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158002/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, such differentiation has meant there's objectively a 'best' character to play as (and let's admit it, it's Donnie), but the four Turtles feel nicely balanced here, with each level highlighting their pros and cons in isolation.</p>
<p>Wait, "isolation"? Yep. Chalk it up to another method of standing apart from the TMNT big hitters that have come before it, if you want, but Tactical Takedown's four-storyline plot means you'll only ever be controlling one Turtle at a time. I had no issues with this off the bat, where it's handy to play each hero individually to get used to their unique moveset, but the bros are best when they're together, so it would have been nice to see how these different playstyles and strategies could intertwine in later stages.</p>
<p>This is particularly true considering how nice the whole thing feels to play. It took me a couple of stages to get my bearings, but I was soon chaining together combos to get in and out of the action like a true ninja, and I can only imagine how satisfying that would feel if I could set the brothers up to bounce off each other. There's no option for touch controls, which I normally like to see in small-scale strategy like this, but the button inputs are simple enough that I didn't find myself longing to wipe my greasy mitts across the screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157994/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The brothers' separation aside, this is clearly a team that understands its source material. The story itself feels like a classic cartoon plot (Karai and Baxter Stockman are wreaking havoc in the city after Shredder's death, what a shocker!), and the brothers' distinct personalities shine through in the charming writing — Raph's hothead-to-loving-brother arc is particularly well handled.</p>
<p>Visually, it moves things in an interesting direction, too. Perfectly matching the turn-based tone of the gameplay, Tactical Takedown all looks as if it's a tabletop board game. Sections of the city pop up in isolation as you move through the stage (leaving plenty of room for punting enemies off the side of the map), and each character is represented by a miniature standee, which changes its pose based on its last action. Its simplicity feels right at home on Switch, and while the pared-back personality of the Turtles' look might not suit everyone (I, for one, missed a good idle animation), it's nice to see the heroes in a half-shell reimagined in yet another new style.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158000/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's worth flagging that even if these visuals are completely up your street, you don't get to soak them up for all that long. Tactical Takedown is a bite-sized experience (I finished my initial playthrough in around five hours), and while you <em>can</em> head back into the levels with a new loadout or to beat your high score, it's still the same structure with the same difficulty, which is rather easy.</p>
<p>Remix Mode, a new addition for the Switch release, alleviates this somewhat... but only <em>somewhat</em>. This optional extra lets you replay each level at a higher difficulty with more variety in the enemy types. The difficulty bump is a noticeable one — I died once on my initial playthrough, but I was lucky to get through the opening stages unscathed in Remix — and the new enemies bring their own helping of challenges, but it does still feel like the same old level with the same old Turtle. Which, in fairness, it is.</p>
<p>So, replayability isn't the name of the game in Tactical Takedown, and that's okay. I do wish that the main campaign had lasted for a little longer, but I'd always rather be left wanting more than see a gameplay loop outstay its welcome.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The combination of turn-based strategy and beat-'em-up gameplay felt like a bit of a square peg, round hole situation, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown melds the two to deliver one of the freshest takes on TMNT that I've seen in a long time. It's a short-but-sweet experience that might not gel with <em>everyone</em>, but after 35 years of beat 'em ups and brawlers, this showcases the Turtles like you've never seen them before. And come on, that's pretty radical, dude.</p></section>

Two puzzles in, I can already tell you that I like it a lot.</p><p>The rules in <em>Mini Sudoku</em> are quite similar to regular sudoku: you need to fill in all of the blank spots of a puzzle with a number, but a number can’t repeat in a line, row, or box. But the twist with <em>Mini Sudoku</em> is that it uses six numbers instead of nine, meaning the game has smaller puzzles that are a little easier to take in across a mobile phone screen. You can also make notes and ask for hints if you need them.</p><p>The smaller puzzles have also (so far) been faster for me to solve. <em>The New York Times’</em> easy sudoku puzzle usually takes me more than five minutes to finish (could be a skill issue), and the first two <em>Mini Sukoku</em> puzzles have taken me about two and four minutes to complete, respectively. I know that’s not a huge jump, but every minute counts when I’m trying to finish a puzzle before my toddler wakes up in the morning.</p><p>The most annoying thing about <em>Mini Sudoku</em> is that it’s on LinkedIn, so it means I’ve found myself accidentally scrolling my LinkedIn feed. But I might have to learn to deal with that to finish my daily puzzle. I’m even thinking of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">trying LinkedIn’s other games</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/758756/linkedins-mini-sudoku-is-a-clever-twist-on-the-classic-puzzle]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-release-date-explained%E2%80%94possible-start-times-release-date-confirmed.1269279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has an exciting proposition on its hands with ARC Raiders. The multiplayer shooter exudes all the qualities of a well-thought-out and handcrafted extraction game, so let’s check out its release date and potential start times to see when we can get you above the ground.</p>



<p>There’s been serious buzz around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-arc-raiders-pvp-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> since day one. Having Embark Studios behind the project—creators of the chaotic and addictive The Finals—has naturally generated hype. Sprinkle in some fun lore, angry machines, and the constant danger of encountering other real-life players, and ARC Raiders could be something.</p>



<p>Let’s check out its confirmed release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-coming-out">When is ARC Raiders Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The surface isn’t safe. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We have a fixed October 30 release date for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>Once the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-arc-raiders-invite-code-for-tech-test-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders playtest</a> finished, all anyone wanted was a release date. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-players-think-they-found-a-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Players even thought they’d found one</a>, only for this to be false. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> finally answered prayers and gave us a concrete release date.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in the middle of a competitive window. Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 will be waging war on either side of the Oct 30 date. If you’re after a competent, tactical extraction shooter instead of all-out multiplayer warfare, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> might be what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-arc-raiders-start-times">Do we Know ARC Raiders’ Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, it’s too early to give you exact start time for ARC Raiders, but we might be able to hazard a guess based on previous data.</strong></p>



<p>I find that previous betas and playtests can be a good indicator of the final launch times. One particular ARC Raiders playtest started at 1:30 AM PT. Does this mean ARC Raiders will release at 1:30 AM on October 30? We’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<p>The only thing I can do is tell you we’ll be updating this article once we have the accurate start times. The confirmed release date is the crucial aspect for now, and you can see where the game falls in a crowded game calendar.</p>

<p>Based on the playtests and early footage, what is making ARC Raiders so desirable to you? Is there a standout feature, mechanic, or design choice swaying you harder than Escape From Tarkov or Gray Zone Warfare, for example?

                <p dir="ltr">Watch out for the Benzies family in Schedule 1, as the rival cartel has been introduced to the game for players on the beta branch. In addition, the patch notes reveal more that's been added to the drug-dealing title. A vehicle called the Hotbox and a pump shotgun can now be found within the game, too, for instance.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer TVGS announced the rollout of the Schedule 1 cartel update for beta players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. It's noted that you won't interact with the Benzies family until unlocking "a few customers in Westville." After that, expect to make some deals with the family as well as face some ambushes and dealer robbings. After finishing the storyline with the Benzies crew, Schedule 1 players can purchase Hyland Manor.</p><p dir="ltr">The Schedule 1 update also alters how new regions become available to players. The cartel influence level has to be lowered to a certain threshold before moving on to another area, per the patch notes. TVGS apologized to the fanbase that this patch has taken longer than expected, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/">Schedule 1 players voted for the cartel update</a> over other options in June.</p><p dir="ltr">Schedule 1 launched in March, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/drug-selling-game-explodes-on-steam-charts-surpassing-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530401/">seeing huge success on Steam</a> with over 111,000 concurrent players at the time.

<p>"It would be a very good business decision"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tekken 8 Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1ca4b8d5119e/tekken-8-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 release schedule is already home to a bunch of ports that never would have been possible on Switch 1, and we can only assume that this will continue for the years to come. One title that's yet to be eyed for the new hybrid is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a>, but that's not to say that the game's director hasn't thought about it.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">Eurogamer</a>, director Katsuhiro Harada confessed that Bandai Namco's latest fighter on Switch 2 is "an interesting option, and not totally off the table," but it sounds like it would be far from a simple port. "It would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware," Harada continued.</p>
<p>"From a business standpoint, [Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience," the director mapped out, "but the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision".</p>
<p>It's far from any kind of confirmation (Harada even emphasised that there is "nothing to announce" on this front right now), but it's interesting to hear these pros and cons, nonetheless. As for introducing the game to a bigger audience, that can only be a good thing for Tekken 8 at the moment. It's still under some serious heat after its <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/tekken-8-season-2-patch-notes-are-here-insane-buffs-have-fans-asking-if-its-an-april-fools-joke">Season 2 patch</a> resulted in heavy backlash and even boycotts from the fans, and the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/tekken-8-ps5-fans-miffed-by-latest-content-roadmap">latest content roadmap</a> didn't go down much better.</p>
<p>Maybe all that work for a Switch 2 port would be worthwhile, then? We'll just have to wait and see. The good folk over at our sister site, Push Square, gave Tekken 8 a whopping 9/10 in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/tekken-8">review</a>, calling it "the franchise at its bombastic best", so we sure wouldn't mind getting in on that action too...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-franchise-could-bring-back-%E2%80%98social-stealth%E2%80%99.1269243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A popular feature from the Assassin’s Creed franchise, ‘social stealth’ could make its return in one of the next games in the series. </p>



<p>Since Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has now been released, players are already waiting for the next big game in the series. Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to sue</a> the actor of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag over a slip-up with the remake details. Now, the developers have revealed that an old feature hasn’t been ruled out from the franchise, which means we could see it in one of the next games. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-why-it-didn-t-have-social-stealth">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Reveal Why It Didn’t Have Social Stealth</h2>



<p>During a recent AMA segment with the devs on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/assassinscreed</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-explains-why-assassins-creed-shadows-ditched-social-stealth-but-says-its-likely-not-gone-for-good-our-stealth-team-chose-to-put-100-percent-of-their-energy-on-the-moment-to-moment-tactical-shinobi-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), the developers were asked whether “social stealth elements” could make a comeback in the future. Additionally, they were also asked why social stealth was not a part of Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. </p>



<p>The developers responded, stating that for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the stealth team had put “100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience”, which is why there was no room to add social stealth. However, that “does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>



<p>For those wondering, social stealth was a feature seen in previous Assassin’s Creed games, where the protagonist could hide from his enemies and pursuers by blending in with the crowd. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-assassins-vs-templars-conflict-is-the-core-pillar-of-the-ac-series">Assassins Vs. Templars Conflict is the Core Pillar of the AC Series </h2>



<p>During the same AMA segment, the developers added that the Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of the Assassin’s Creed series. With Shadows, they planned to establish their protagonist in the setting before expanding on the conflict. Now that it is done in the main game and through the Critical Role story drop, players should expect “more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p>



<p>In other news, the Claws of Awaji DLC is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release this September</a>. Additionally, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on social stealth returning to the Assassin’s Creed franchise? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

                <p>Developers at Arkane Studios in France have called on their parent company, Microsoft, to stop supporting Israel during its ongoing war in Gaza, which a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UN Special Committee</a> said was "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> published online (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>) is addressed to the "heads of Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming and the overall Microsoft group." It says that the ongoing situation in Gaza and Microsoft's work with Israel could "affect our reputation and work" and asks Microsoft to take the "appropriate measure" to resolve it. It joins the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which has set Microsoft as a priority target of its boycott. BDS specifically mentions Microsoft's gaming division and Game Pass among its boycott targets.</p><p>"We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don't want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza," the letter continues. "Moreover, we think it's our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise.</p><p>"In a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs."</p><p>The letter cites reporting from the <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/" rel="nofollow ">Associated Press</a> showing Microsoft has collaborated with the Israeli military through its cloud and Azure services, as well as its AI systems that have been used to define bombing targets. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" rel="nofollow ">The Guardian</a> also found that Israel's military surveillance agency has used Azure to extensively monitor Palestinians. Microsoft denied any knowledge of this use, and said it did not "build or consult" with Israel surveillance, but has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/09/microsoft-israeli-military-azure-cloud-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">opened an internal investigation</a> regardling the claims.</p><p>Arkane said it is joining an existing petition from Microsoft employees called No Azure for Apartheid, which has laid out specific demands including: termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli Occupation Forces, transparent disclosure of ties to the Israeli military including an independent and public audit of its contracts and services, an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and free speech and safety for pro-Palestinian employees. Microsoft employees and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/microsoft-investors-prod-company-over-work-with-israeli-military?sref=uE15RiYa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shareholders</a> began pressuring Microsoft for increased transparency in spring. In May, an employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</a> during a keynote with a "Free Palestine" protest.</p><p>For its part, in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post in May</a> Microsoft claimed that it conducted both internal and external reviews and "found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." At the same time, though, it acknowledged that it does not have visibility into how customers use its software.</p><p>Since the start of the BDS boycott, the situation in Gaza has worsened. A <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">United Nations report</a> published in late July says that food security experts warn of a "worst-case scenario of famine" unfolding in the region, as "widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease" are driving an increase in hunger-related deaths. Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-leader-claims-no-one-in-gaza-is-starving-data-and-witnesses-disagree" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claimed</a>, "There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza."</p><p>Arkane is the Microsoft studio behind games like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop. Its current project is an adaptation of Marvel's vampire hunter Blade, though we haven't seen much of the game yet. The studio said in 2023 that it was going to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-new-blade-game-wont-be-discussed-for-a-while/1100-6519831/" data-ref-id="1100-6519831">"stay silent for a while."</a></p>

            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, producer of the new<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-6"> Virtua Fighter project</a> Riichiro Yamada revealed that there's an extraordinary level of excitement around the upcoming 3D fighting game at SEGA, especially among the company's older generation.</p>
<p>When asked about the internal mood regarding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>'s revival, Yamada stated (through a SEGA-provided translator): "In SEGA, the upper executives are very fond of Virtua Fighter, they feel it's very special to them because it has a very long history with SEGA."</p>
<p>This extends to the chairman of SEGA Sammy, Hajime Satomi. According to Yamada, he's taken special interest in the project: "He is also very fond of Virtua Fighter. He's very high up in the company and a very important guy, so even though he participates in so many meetings he doesn't really say anything. But when it comes to Virtua Fighter meetings he actually gives detailed comments because he's very fond of the series."</p>

<p>This excitement, according to Yamada, has trickled down to even the younger folks at the company that are unfamiliar with Virtua Fighter: "There are a lot of people in upper management who are really looking forward to this. Thanks to this hype from the upper management people, the younger generation who may not have touched or been handling Virtua Fighter before, a lot of them are very interested in being involved with the new project. [I] feel with SEGA's history, Virtua Fighter holds a very special place in every [developer]."</p><p>This should come as no surprise. Virtua Fighter is a legendary video game franchise that has sadly fallen by the wayside in recent years. It was revolutionary back in the arcade days, pushing the genre forward with a no-frills simulation of hand-to-hand combat. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-in-engine-look-at-next-virtua-fighter-game-revealed">That's why the Virtua Fighter Project reveal was so exciting</a>, a technically staggering in-engine look at a game sticking to its roots.</p>
<p>In fact, Virtua Fighter only really survived in some forms in recent years thanks to the RGG games! In the Yakuza series, Virtua Fighter games could be played within the in-game SEGA arcades. This, according to Yamada, acted as a spark to get a new Virtua Fighter going.</p>
<p>"The RGG team were very good at AMD stuff, and that's why they wanted to implement those elements. But at the time, Virtua Fighter fans were a little bit sad that in order to play Virtua Fighter they had to play an RGG game. So because there was no environment where we could actually provide a Virtua Fighter game on its own to those fans, there was a feeling that we had to provide something for those fans.</p>
<p>This revival has been in discussion for a while within SEGA, but hadn't got the green light until recent years. Yamada elaborates: "The new sequel for Virtua Fighter has come up within Sega many many times, but there was approval or green light to proceed. So as for when we started to think about a new project, it's been a very long time."</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/turning-it-up-jackbox-party-pack-11-is-the-noisiest-bundle-yet/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After taking a year off to do other things last year and really try to find themselves, Jackbox Games is now newly revitalised and transformed with….. well, it’s Jackbox Party Pack 11. Yeah, it turns out they were pretty good already and probably just needed a bit of a break to recharge their creative batteries. Having gone hands on with the collection, Jackbox Party Pack 11 has put the smutty mags back under the mattress and is back to its usual self with five new games and a little bundle of new and experimental ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Party Pack 11 | Coming This Fall! | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/INZkUPwgB6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It starts with Doominate, a game about ruining prompts –&nbsp;think “add butts to a movie title to make it worse” but expanded into a Jackbox game. There’s multiple rounds of back and forth, first with generated prompts, then player created prompts that are passed around, and finally with a reused answer which you then have to “fix”, though you can obviously double down on the joke, because this is a laughter and popularity contest.</p>



<p>Cookie Haus is another riff on the drawing game, though this time with differently shaped cookies as your canvas, and with layers of coloured icing and sprinkles as you paint. What’s nice is that you get a choice in this, so if you’ve got a prompt and idea to paint Batman, and you get a particularly pointy cookie, you’re off to a good start already, and the ability to rotate the cookies can also bring some more creative options. Of course, you can always go route one with line art and words, if you’re bad at art or bereft of funny ideas.</p>

<p>Doominate and Cookie Haus feel like good twists on the traditional Jackbox oeuvre, but from here it starts to get a bit special.</p>

<p>The standout new concept, though, comes in the form of Hear Say. Using the microphones on your devices, it’s all about using your voice and sounds that you make to illicit a laugh from your friends. It starts from the avatar selection screen, where you get to record a little sound for your character, and it’s already amusing to have everyone making little yips, bloops and growls, seeing the duck, cloud, black void and more animate on the TV screen. The game puts a healthy dose of post-processing on any sounds you make, adding reverb, pitch shift and more to make them a little bit abnormal, or even more abnormal than you intended.</p>
<p>That’s then immediately applied to the game itself, where each prompt has you recording sounds and uttering phrases directly into your phone, and at roughly the same time as everyone else. It can lead to an absolute cacophony of sound, or a bit of recognition between people with the same prompts, and befuddlement as you hear something out of context. Voice an unpopular opinion, or shout what you would before jumping into a pool, make the clickety clack of a keyboard, or the buzzer sound for a wrong answer in a gameshow.</p>

<p>Naturally, then it’s off to compare everyone’s answers and get people to vote on their favourites, while little mini-games ramp up the noise-making chaos by having sound and volume be the input that you’re all using, but by far and away this game’s best trick is then taking those sounds and applying them to little video clips. I’ve no idea how the game did it, but seeing “But he’s literally just a dog!” applied to a clip of a lawyer, before shifting to a dachsund in prison garb being locked away saying “Well, I’m off to bed” is just… well, it’s one heck of a coincidence. It’s just as amusing to see duck noises overlaid on a rave, or a buzzer sound for someone clicking on an unsubscribe button.</p>

<p>I get the feeling that Hear Say is going to be the in-person gem of this party pack, but Suspectives is definitely the most personal and intimate, best for a group of family or friends that know each other relatively well. Before the game starts, everyone is presented with a little seven question survey, six of which are multiple choice, while one has a text field.</p>
<p>As a crime is committed, you’re then tasked with figuring out who dunnit, using those survey answers and interrogation sessions between players to try and narrow down the person. That’s best when you might have a little clue about what your playing group might think about theme parks, what their irrational fears are, and personal interests. And it means that, as the interrogation cycles around and more clues are opened up, the criminal needs to be a bit weaselly, bend the truth and answers, where their deceit could potentially be revealed, and other people’s innocence could be confirmed.</p>

<p>Rounding things out is Legends of Trivia, twisting the traditional trivia game into a co-op RPG-like adventure, where you battle enemies, gather loot and go shopping with your gotten gains. You’re off on a gallant quest with turn-based battling, but instead of picking attacks and abilities, you’re answering trivia questions to determine whether you attack or not. It’s an interesting twist, not least because it is so cooperative, where previous Jackbox trivia games have split people up individually or pitted teams against one another. Because of that, there’s more chatter about what the answers might be, strategy over potentially splitting your votes when you’re unsure and more.</p>

<p>Jackbox Party Pack 11 is sure to be on many a friend group’s wishlists for later this year, and after going hands on with the collection, this could be a really special one. There’s good twists on familiar formats, the social deduction game has real potential for close-knit groups, but for me it’s all going to about yipping and making weird noises in Hear Say.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6ceb4229de9c2/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>'s launch tomorrow, reviews for the wheelchair basketball game have dropped, and... they're <em>pretty</em> mixed. Focusing on 3v3 matches and fully controlled using the Switch 2's Mouse Mode controls, Drag x Drive is a relatively unique multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>But, looking over most reviews of the game, that might be <em>all</em> it is. The game is currently sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">60 Metacritic score</a>. That number will likely change over the coming days as more reviews roll in, but from day one, it looks like this isn't quite a slam dunk.</p>
<p>We had a pretty good time with the game, with the indomitable PJ O'Reilly scoring it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">7/10</a>. Essentially, online multiplayer with friends is a great time, but there's not a <em>ton</em> going on otherwise. Here's a little snippet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Taking everything into consideration, though, and for the not-enormous price point, there's more depth here than I expected. Drag x Drive feels like a proper attempt to give us something fresh, in the same sort of vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a> back on Switch 1. If you get into its groove, you will get your money's worth."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186124 @ 1755103283 -->
<p>But we're not the only voice out there, so let's see what others have to say about this mouse-controlled game.</p>
<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/drag-x-drive-ninendo-switch-2-review/">TheGamer</a>, who also scored the game a 7/10 (well, a 3.5/5), the outlet notes that "It’ll take some time to get used to its oddball pacing and unorthodox mechanics", but that it's a good time overall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Short match times, a small court, and precise team composition make every single round a nail-biter, and that’s mostly when playing with bots during the review period. I cannot wait to see what sort of casual and competitive communities form around this game and what tricks they’re able to pull with its mechanics that someone like me could only dream of."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving down the scale a little, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review">IGN</a> awarded the game a 6/10, criticising the game's "drab personality" and aesthetic, but praising the actual gameplay, outside of a lack of variety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I respect the ambition to try something entirely new, even though I recognize the result is definitely not going to be for everyone. But despite its surprisingly good gameplay, Drag x Drive is pretty disappointing in terms of the content outside of its three-on-three online matches, with a lack of variety and enticing unlockables you’d expect from a game like this."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sticking with that lack of variety, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/drag-x-drive-review">Inverse</a> also scored Drag x Drive a 6/10, calling Mouse Mode's implementation "ingenious", but outside of matches, the game is lacking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Unfortunately, this rock-solid foundation is underserved by some dull minigames, bland presentation, and a lack of proper single-player modes. While this dearth of content can be excused by the game’s $20 budget price-point, one can’t help but wonder what could have been."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/drag-x-drive-review/">GamesRadar+</a> feels similarly, but scored the game slightly lower at 2.5/5 — shout-out to those "Drag x Drive jeans". The game is fun, but there's "not enough to keep me competing for the long haul", comparing it (unfavourably) to ARMS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But compare Drag x Drive's fairly featureless, almost Toonami-like customizable characters with the sheer sauce on display with designs like Spring Man, Kid Cobra, or the truly iconic Twintelle and it's no contest. It doesn't help that Arms' fighting managed to carefully balance its control scheme with tactical plays that packed a punch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/drag-x-drive">PCMag</a> also settled on a 2.5/5, highlighting that "How much you enjoy Drag x Drive will come down to how much you enjoy this design decision" and that the gameplay can suffer from "tedium":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a> understands that motion controls shine when you use them to act out dramatic and exciting moments, like swinging your tennis racket or golf club. Similarly, I loved getting nothing but net when shooting the ball with Drag x Drive's motion controls. But the boring, laborious movement mechanics sully the experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of you likely checked out the Global Jam that took place over the weekend, so you likely have a good idea of what to expect when Drag x Drive releases tomorrow. We'll have to see the kind of player base that builds up around the game and its online matches.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're excited to play Drag x Drive in the comments</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PUBG Is Ending Support for PS4 and Xbox One, Will Only Be Playable on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S after November 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/pubg-ending-ps4-xbox-one-support-only-playable-on-ps5-xbox-series-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-is-ending-support-for-ps4-and-xbox-one-will-only-be-playable-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-after-november-2025.1269195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PUBG Studios has <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005">announced</a> that it will be ending support for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of PUBG, as it moves to only supporting the game on current-generation PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles alongside the PC version. </p>



<p>"<em>As mentioned in our 2025 roadmap, we've been preparing to transition PUBG Console to current-generation consoles,"</em> a statement on the PUBG website reads. "<em>Starting November 13, 2025, PUBG Console will be supported only on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</em>."</p>



<p>The studio calls the transition "<em>necessary</em>" as part of its efforts "<em>to provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years. We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together. We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years. This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console.</em>"</p>



<p>The post goes on to explain that players on PS4 and Xbox One will have their accounts preserved and secure after November 13, 2025, ready for those players when they log back in on a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S device. And thankfully, logging back in is all you'll need to do to pick up your account, with "<em>no separate transfer process required</em>."</p>



<p>PlayStation players will, however, have to download the specific, PS5-native version of PUBG to play the game, since the PS4 version will still appear as a separate app and not be playable.</p>



<p>Once the transition has been made to current-gen platforms, players on PS5 can expect to play PUBG at a base 1440p resolution and 60FPS, while PS5 Pro players will get a full 4K/60FPS experience. On Xbox Series S, both 1080p/60FPS and 1440p/30FPS will be supported, depending on the experience you want, while Xbox Series X players will enjoy a 4K/60FPS experience.</p>

            <p>Whack out your not-at-all-weird-to-own spreadsheet of teenagers with incredible left feet, a Football Manager thing has happened. Namely, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 2026</a> has been announced by developers Sports Interactive, with a quick trailer. There's no release date as of yet.</p>
<p>If you recall, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> ended up being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-has-been-delayed-until-march-2025-to-avoid-compromising-our-usual-standards">delayed</a> and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-25-has-been-cancelled">cancelled</a>, the studio admitting at the time that "the overarching player experience and interface is not where we need it to be." Refunds were issued to folks who'd pre-ordered the touchline-prowling sim, and the devs shifted their focus on to Football Manager 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Cue today's announcement and trailer, the latter of which is about a minute of in-engine footage showing people doing foot-to-ball things as a Premier League match gears up for kick off. Amusingly, after multiple shots of Football Manager logos nicely stitched into seats, the various slabs of Premier League set dressing have the logo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC</a> on them. I assume this is just for licensing reasons, but it's still a bit of a funny visual.</p>
<p>Anyway, Sports Interactive say this snippet "gives just a taster of what to expect following the move to the Unity engine", adding that "FM26 promises to take players on a journey to define their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience yet. The potential for storytelling is redefined by taking players closer to the heart of the beautiful game."</p>

<p>That certainly sounds a lot like the sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-will-be-for-the-first-time-in-decades-a-true-sequel-say-sports-interactive">massive overhaul the studio had planned to deliver with Football Manager 25</a>, so here's hoping the extra time has given them plenty of breathing room to get all the crossbars and whistles working as they should.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is stay tuned for more updates Sports Interactive promise are coming down the line. Let's face it, probably via a spreadsheet about a defensive midfielder from the Danish second division.</p>

              <p>Good morning, or good afternoon, or good whenever you are reading this. <em>Kotaku’s</em> Morning Checkpoint is back once more to share some news and other stuff with you. Today, that includes a wild story about a gaming convention gone wrong, more information on maps in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, a new union at Blizzard, a look behind the scenes on <em>Superman</em>, and an interview with the madman who hosts Dropout’s <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>A gaming convention in Tampa, Florida was a complete shitshow</h2> <p>The National Gaming Expo, held last week, sounds like it was a horrible and mostly empty experience, according to a new <em>IGN</em> report. According to many who attended, the convention was poorly managed, had very little to offer, and inside the convention center were animals to pet instead of new games to play. Seriously. <em>IGN</em> reports that fans paid $40 for a single-day ticket or $90 for the weekend, and now everyone wants their money back. Also, the guy allegedly in charge of running the whole event has a history of putting on crappy conventions and recently got out of prison in the Dominican Republic. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-actor-says-disastrous-florida-gaming-convention-put-the-con-in-comic-con">You should read the full report because it’s truly a wild story.</a></p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em> dev says bigger maps are included in the full game</h2> <p>The lead producer on <em>Battlefield 6,&nbsp;</em>David Sirland, <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475?">replied to a fan</a> complaining that the maps featured in the recent beta were too small and confirmed that the game contains bigger maps beyond what was featured in the playtest.</p> <p>“Speed is a factor of map size,” said Sirland on Twitter. “We picked these maps to make sure we hit the full-octane version of <em>Battlefield</em> on the head – and made everyone see we can handle that too. Large maps exist, and the tempo scales accordingly; you’ll be able to see soon enough!” The <em>BF6</em> beta returns August 14 for one final weekend.</p> <h2>Over 900 Blizzard developers are now unionized A new version of the <em>GTA: The Trilogy</em> arrives on Switch</h2> <div role="listitem" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755093591.754199" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755093591.754199"> <div role="document" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true"> <div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team is the latest part of the company to form a union. <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union#:~:text=These%20workers%20will%20be%20the,industry%20after%20Microsoft%20acquired%20Activision">According to a press release</a> from the Communication Workers of America (CWA), Blizzard’s in-house cutscene creators voted “strongly in favor of union representation” with the CWA. Parent company Microsoft has already recognized the union. These devs join over 3,000 unionized workers at Microsoft-owned studios, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">which include the <em>Overwatch 2</em> development team</a>, as well as groups within Zenimax and Raven Software.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> is upgrading to a new version of Unreal Engine 5</h2> </div> <p>On August 12, <em>Stalker 2</em> developers GSC Game World announced plans to update their popular post-apocalyptic open-world shooter to a newer version of Unreal Engine 5, which should help the game run better and be more stable on more PCs.</p> <p>“Our main mission in the near future is upgrading the game to Unreal Engine 5.5.4,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525350789598676383?l=english">said the devs in a Steam post</a>. “This will bring new features and tools to make the Zone an even better place, but more importantly, bringing the latest Unreal Engine 5 optimizations will lead to better stability and performance.” Other changes mentioned in a new road map include tweaks to the game’s “A-life System,” new missions, a reworked stamina system, and new night vision devices.&nbsp; GSC is aiming to bring these changes to <em>Stalker 2</em> by the end of the year, but admits that upgrading to a new version of UE5 could cause some delay.</p> <h2>A new version of the <em>GTA: The Trilogy</em> arrives on Switch?</h2> <p>Rockstar Games may have quietly released a new version of its controversial <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> remaster collection for the Nintendo Switch. Previously, the collection required users to download <em>Vice City</em> and some updates for<em> GTA III</em> and <em>San Andreas</em>. Now, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/gta-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-release/">however, people have spotted what could be a new physical version</a> of the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> that appears to lack any warnings on the front indicating you’ll need to download the games. However, until people actually get their hands on this supposedly new version, we won’t know for sure.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-sam-reich-interview-season-7-comedy-design-2000617191">We interviewed Sam Reich, <em>Game Changer’</em>s host, about how the show creates its games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/aol-dial-up-shut-down-youve-got-mail-sound-internet-2000617225">AOL dial-up is ending, reminding you that, hey, AOL dial-up service was still a thing in 2025</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/chuck-e-cheese-arcade-snow-day-stuck-fire-department-burbank-2000617154">A woman got her arm stuck in a machine at Chuck E.

To me, this is two people who care a lot about what they are making, who don’t agree on a point about it, and both are passionately trying to solve the problem. I love it. In a time when so many movies feel sterile, it’s nice to see some passion behind the camera.</p> </div> </div>

              <p>You can hardly log onto <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-concord-marathon-smoothly-2000616270">your PlayStation 5 or PS4</a> these days without seeing a banner for another massive 75 percent off sale. Sony’s latest discount event is pegged to Gamescom 2025, which kicks off next week, and it has some surprisingly decent deals. If you’ve been pining for a hundred hour RPG to whittle away the final days of summer, you’re in luck. A bunch of them are currently 50 percent off.</p> <p><a href="https://t.co/WRVXMm2mRb">The current Gamescom sale</a> is running through August 27 and, I’m guessing, will probably be refreshed after the expo gets underway, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">starting with Geoff Keighley’s Opening Night Live showcase</a> on August 19.

Is <em>Bloodborne really</em> an RPG? It’s primarily an action game, sure, but you also fight things to level up your stats, so obviously yes. It’s an all-timer and deserves to be in everyone’s library, and this is about as cheap as it gets. Personally, I prefer <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> to <em>Persona 5</em>, though the latter is a bit more dense, fully-featured, and less grindy. <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> is one of my favorite late-night summertime hangs, and <em>The Zodiac Age</em> remaster is excellent. It’s structured very much like a single-player MMO, so you can mostly just run around exploring the beautiful world and its incredible soundtrack while your party does all the tedious auto-battling.</p> <p>Then there are some picks that are more borderline. I wasn’t impressed with the<em> Chrono Cross</em> remaster on the whole, <a href="https://kotaku.com/chono-cross-radical-dreamers-sale-discount-ps5-cheap-1851499822">but some updates improved things since it released</a> and at $8 it’s a perfectly good way to experience a PS1 classic with modern convenience features. <em>Fell Seal</em> is also a bit of an acquired taste. It’s one of many indie clones of <em>Final</em> <em>Fantasy Tactics</em> floating around out there, but arguably the strongest in terms of its deep, customizable job system and actually challenging combat. And at just $15, <em>Soul Hackers 2</em> is also a bargain. While not nearly as good as the rest of the Atlus RPGs on this list, there’s plenty of weird, old-school PS2 charm to admire in it. It’s a sequel to 1997’s <i>Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers</i> and, by God, does it play like it: Archaic, grindy, and repetitive. But if you want a meaty dungeon crawler with unique, stylish vibes, it hits just fine.</p>
