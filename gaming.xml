            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Borderline Justice, and it's ready to dispense some of the titular frontier violence later this week.</p>

<p>Landing on March 30th (that's Thursday),&nbsp;Borderline Justice follows on from recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>, and it's packing a new primary and secondary weapon, a new explosive, and more.</p>

<p>First up, picking up this Warbond will grant you the chance to use the R-6 Deadeye, a lever-action hunting rifle that will carry a lower rate of fire but a deadly kick. It's perfect for single targets, but it might not serve you quite as well for crowds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond-revolver.jpg?itok=BzW_0kn1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond-revolver.jpg?itok=QvvtDEMF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you the chance to be an intergalactic cowboy.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the rifle, you'll also get access to the LAS-58 Talon, which is about as close to a revolver as you're going to get in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s futuristic universe. It may not have a revolving chamber, but it sure does pack a punch.</p>

<p>The new TED-63 Dynamite explosive is also part of the Borderline Justice Warbond, and you can use it either to make yourself feel like an old-timey prospector or just to blow up a horde of bugs. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Of course, like all good cowboys, you can also utilize the LIFT-860 jetpack to put you above the action. Hey, it can't all be Wild West-themed, now can it? You can also look forward to two new sets of armor, both of which have the Gunslinger passive to give you better reload speed and reduced recoil on your secondary weapon.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, back in January, the game's creative lead Johan Pilestedt announced that he would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">taking an extended break from work</a>. When Pilestedt returns, he says he'll be working on the new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Borderline Justice Warbond arrives on March 20th. The game is available right now for PC and PlayStation 5, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/629964/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The failure of the Wii U has turned out to be a big win for the Switch. While Nintendo’s previous console was its worst selling, it was still home to some of its most inventive games. Over the years, Nintendo has steadily brought many of them — ranging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568040/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-switch-review">Captain Toad puzzles</a> to various <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17301860/nintendo-switch-ports-wii-u-obsolete">Donkey Kong</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch">adventures</a> — to a much larger audience on the Switch. In fact, the Switch’s best-selling game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a></em>, is an updated version of a Wii U classic.</p><p>And even now, with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">new-generation console on the horizon</a>, the Wii U still has more to give. This time, it’s an absolutely massive sci-fi RPG — and one that is just begging to be explored.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a> first launched in 2015. The story involves an ark-like spaceship that left Earth after an an alien invasion and eventually crashed on an untamed world called Mira. Your character is a part of the early stages of the settlement process. Much of the planet is unexplored, and the crashed ship has been turned into a city of sorts, dubbed New Los Angeles. <em>X</em> has more of a hard sci-fi setup compared to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23277681/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-nintendo-switch">other games in the series</a>, and it’s also a standalone experience, so you don’t need to have played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16719154/xenoblade-chronicles-2-nintendo-switch">any other <em>Xenoblade</em> title</a> to understand what’s going on.</p><p>The premise is great, though the story gets pretty convoluted in a very RPG way as it progresses. But the main reason to play <em>X</em> is because of Mira. The world outside of New Los Angeles is a sprawling, strange, and seductive place teeming with alien wildlife. You’ll encounter beasts the size of dinosaurs, so gigantic that you can run under them without being noticed. There are angry monkeys that race through the world, and terrors that patrol the skies.</p><p>One of the most compelling things about the creatures in this world is that they feel like wildlife. Yes, some will attack you on sight, but most are content to leave you alone if you do the same. Mira is an incredibly dangerous place, but also one where you have the option to slow down and appreciate its beauty. As I said in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x">my original review</a>, there are areas in the game that look like sci-fi staples from Pandora and Arrakis, and they’re incredible to behold, even if <em>X</em> is a decade old.</p><p>Smartly, most of the missions in the game involve further exploration, and you can expand your knowledge of the world by placing beacons that provide more detailed map information. It’s sort of like searching out towers in <em>Zelda</em>; in fact, <em>Xenoblade</em> developer Monolith Soft helped develop both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>, so the similarities make a lot of sense.</p><p>The caveat is that to enjoy all of the beauty and awe <em>X</em> has to offer, you’ll need a lot of patience. Like every other <em>Xenoblade</em> game, <em>X</em> is filled with complex systems that aren’t always clearly explained, and it can require a good amount of grinding to make your character powerful enough to take on specific missions and enemies. Battles happen in real time, with your character attacking automatically, while you choose between weapons and various special abilities with their own cooldowns.</p><p>There are other things to pay attention to beyond XP, like your affinity with other characters or your proficiency in specific skills; if you ignore them, it’s easy to find yourself in a position where you’re stuck, unable to take on a necessary mission with your current build. The game also starts very slow: the first few hours can feel like an extended tutorial.</p><p>But for a certain kind of player, it’s worth pushing through the game’s fussiness. Because even now, 10 years after it debuted, there’s still nothing quite like the sense of stunning sci-fi exploration that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> offers. You even get a mech suit eventually. The Switch version doesn’t change much, but it does make that incredible world portable, which is more than enough reason to jump in — either again or for the first time.</p><p><sub>Xenoblade Chronicles X <em>launches on the Nintendo Switch on March 20th.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Pokémon Partnership Reveal Appears Online]]></title>

<p>LEGO Pokémon models are seemingly in the works, as a now-removed announcement post was uploaded early to their official LEGO Mexico account on Facebook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO is one of the most popular toy production companies. It is known to collaborate with various franchises, such as Mario, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, and many more. However, one of the biggest franchises has managed to skip LEGO’s grasp for years now: Pokémon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But all that could change, as a now-removed teaser points towards an upcoming partnership announcement. Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1je380o/lego_pok%C3%A9mon_has_been_officially_announced_coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/Legoleak</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1901974339597095025/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), a teaser video for the LEGO x Pokémon partnership was posted early on the LEGO Mexico Facebook account, with a caption suggesting a ‘2026’ release window. The video has been removed from that account; however, you can still watch it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1je380o/lego_pok%C3%A9mon_has_been_officially_announced_coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (at the time of writing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 13-second teaser begins with yellow LEGO blocks coming together to form one of the most iconic tails in Pokémon: Pikachu’s tail. As electricity passes through the blocks, Pikachu uses his electric attack to illuminate two logos—LEGO and Pokémon—before vanishing into the darkness.</p>



<p>The LEGO and Pokémon partnership has not arrived sooner due to the latter’s licensing agreement with Mattel. Mattel, through its Mega Bloks brand, has sold buildable characters, play sets, building blocks, and sets for the franchise, including models for the most popular Pokémon like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and more. However, this new partnership could mean the end of Pokémon and Mattel’s agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokémon TCG Pocket is getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-a-surprise-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new rival in Digimon</a>. Also, Scopely acquired the Pokémon GO developer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.5 billion</a>.

                <p>Hazelight just released Split Fiction, and the game is getting rave reviews and has sold more than 2 million copies so far. Everyone always wants to know what's next, and now director Josef Fares has confirmed Hazelight is already at work on its next project. Fares also discussed Hazelight's partnership with EA, saying the company is a good, respectful partner.</p><p>"Split Fiction is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I'm so fully focused and excited on the next thing," he said on the <a href="https://youtu.be/G9-_n3vqsAQ?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a> (<a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1901801846509072764" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Culture Crave</a>). "We've already started." He also confirmed work began about a month ago.</p><p>Fares didn't share any concrete information on Hazelight's next project--which is "quite early" in development--but he said the mood at the studio right now is very positive and staffers are amped for what's coming next. He said the team is feeling like they can do "way better" with the next game, whatever it turns out to be.</p><p>"It's not like we're feeling now, 'Oh, shit, how will we top [Split Fiction] or do better than this?' We just feel like... just wait until [you see] what we do next. I know it's cocky. But that's how confident we feel in what we're doing," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1882427844" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

including Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (for Starbreeze), A Way Out, It Takes Two, and Split Fiction. It Takes Two has been the biggest success of the bunch, selling <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/03/06/split-fiction-josef-fares-hazelight-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23 million copies</a>. Split Fiction had <a href="https://youtu.be/QQvUgUlknis" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost double the budget</a> and has sold <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1900204006451925484" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2 million copies in its first week</a>.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/split-fiction-review-it-takes-pew-pew/1900-6418341/" data-ref-id="1900-6418341">Split Fiction review</a> scored the game a 10/10. The game is published by EA through its EA Originals program; it's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-is-now-eas-no-2-game-all-time-on-steam-ahead-of-battlefield-and-fifa/1100-6529999/" data-ref-id="1100-6529999">first EA-published game to reach 90 or above on Metacritic since 2012's Mass Effect 2</a>.</p><p>All of Hazelight's games so far have been co-op titles (Brothers was a single-player game with a unique co-op element). Fares said co-op will always be part of Hazelight's DNA, but he didn't rule out the possibility of the studio changing things up. "You never know what happens in the future. It's not impossible we look into single-player as well. But it would be done in a Hazelight way, with a Hazelight twist. It's not going to be your typical single-player game."</p><p>Also in the interview, Fares shed some light on Hazelight's relationship with EA. He confirmed that Hazelight does not pitch to EA. Instead, Hazelight says to EA, "We're going to do this," Fares said. "That's it. They have zero to say about what we are doing next."</p><p>Fares said it might be true that EA is "f**king up" its partnerships with other companies, but not Hazelight. They respect us. They respect what we do. I am very clear with them that they cannot interfere with what we do."</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in March 2025, including promising-looking new British survival game Atomfall - well, if you're a PC or Ultimate subscriber.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions are Mythwrecked, which is the Hades-esque adventure game from the team behind enjoyable indie Röki, and the Blizzard Arcade Collection - which includes a selection of retro classics such as Lost Vikings and Rock &amp; Roll Racing.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late March 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 (Series X/S, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (Console, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 25th March</li>
<li>Blizzard Arcade Collection (Console and PC) - 20th March</li>
<li>Atomfall (Cloud and Console via Game Pass Ultimate, and PC) - 27th March</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tunic, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> and Monster Sanctury meanwhile join Xbox Game Pass Core, the lowest-tier subscription formerly branded as Xbox Live Gold.
</p>
<p>
As ever, as Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Yet more Yakuza titles are getting the chop from the Xbox Game Pass catalogue, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-march">the previous loss of Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 6 earlier in the month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> is also going - presumably Capcom would prefer you now play Monster Hunter World.
</p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 31st March are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>Lil Gator Game (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Open Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 0 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Like a Dragon (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Lamplighter’s League (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Rise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
<p>For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide listing every title available</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Returning to a game that you love is different to rewatching a movie or revisiting a favourite book. The familiar characters and story beats are just as comforting, the emotional moments similarly cherished on repeat visits, but that interactive element, the mechanical interaction between you and the game, can wear thinner as repetitious actions finally find the limit of their interest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>, a game I’ve returned to many times since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">its original review</a>, is a world so expansive, so populated, that it tested the relationship between player and game mechanics the very first time I played it. Fortunately, I’ve never found it wanting, and with this new Definitive Edition release you can finally experience one of the world’s best RPGs in its most complete form.</p>
<p><iframe title="How it all began... – Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCSpEfJy7VA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Xenoblade saga, built on the foundations of the Xenogears franchise, is fundamentally a disparate collection of games, drawn together by shared thematic and narrative elements. With two numbered entries debuting on Switch alongside a Definitive Edition release of the first game in the series, Xenoblade Chronicles X was an oddity stranded on the Wii U. Thankfully it’s now being given a fresh chance to find an audience with the rest of the series on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Set on the planet of Mira, this is humanity’s new home, having fled Earth after their home planet was caught up in a destructive war between two alien factions. The human race escaped on a series of huge colony ships, and while many were destroyed as they left the planet, The White Whale managed to make it as far as Mira, where it was finally brought down. Built from the remains of The White Whale, New Los Angeles is the new home for a race that’s desperately trying to hold onto the trappings of their former lives, despite being surrounded by danger on all sides.</p>

<p>You’re tasked with heading out across the surface of Mira to find other survivors, but before you can explore this alien world, you have to create your player. Chronicles X gives you a significant set of tools to build them, with the character design having a more realistic look than the heavy anime looks that reached their zenith with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a>. Alongside the narrative setup, it lends Xenoblade Chronicles X a completely different feel to the other games in the series.</p>

<p>Your amnesiac character isn’t really the main character though, and beyond the ability to nod and shake your head at points in the story, they are little more than an active witness to the story. However, that story, and the vibrant characters that you meet along the way, remain amongst my favourite RPG experiences. In particular, the affinity quests where you grow closer to your teammates, and the huge number of side missions, are where Monolith Soft have flexed their writing muscles, and they add depth, emotion and often a welcome dose of weirdness to the world while the main storyline hits a cavalcade of bombastic, memorable moments. For the Definitive Edition, Monolith Soft have brought in new characters, equipment and story beats that will serve to make Chronicles X as much of an adventure for returning players as it is for newcomers.</p>
<p>The planet of Mira is the true star of this alien show. Xenoblade Chronicles X features one of the greatest RPG open worlds ever created – I’d have a healthy argument that it is the best, though Breath of the Wild and Skyrim fans are welcome to submit their points. Where this world wins out is in its size, its diverse and vibrant ecosystem, and its playground nature that draws you in and spits you out a hundred hours later.</p>

<p>Just like the other games in the Xenoblade series, you can explore the majority of the world from the outset, but many of the creatures you’ll encounter will annihilate you if you stray into their field of vision. That’s true from the moment you step outside The White Whale, with herds of monsters grazing in the plains, often with an apex creature at the head of them, or it might simply be a giant monster that’s meandering around on its own. There’s an art to playing hide and seek with them, extending your research area as much as possible before a single swipe from a powerful creature sends you back to the last checkpoint.</p>
<p>One of the greatest joys in Chronicles X is seeing how far you can push things. You can run, leap and jump your way up mountains and into situations that feel as though you’ve broken the game, but it’s all part of the intended experience. It’s something that you’ll never get tired of, and just when you might be becoming overwhelmed by the sheer scale of this world, the developers through you a mecha-shaped bone.</p>
<p>Skells are Xenoblade Chronicles X’s mecha suits, and once you’ve gained the Blades’ trust – the organisation you’re working for – you’ll be able to hop in your own and explore further than ever before. These mechanical wonders significantly bump up your combat abilities, but it’s the fact that they can transform into vehicles, as well as eventually flying, that lets you explore the rest of this incredible planet, digging into every single far-flung nook and cranny. Xenoblade Chronicles X is a pure adventure, and few games can match its sense of wonder and scale.</p>

<p>While the Definitive Edition stands as a new start for the game on a console that has a much larger audience than the Wii U, there have been a variety of clear improvements made to the game that make it as much of a treat for returning fans. First and foremost, the visuals have been given an obvious tune up, with character models looking much more detailed here than in the original game.</p>
<p>It’s also so much more vibrant, where the Wii U release now looks incredibly washed out in comparison. Rounding out the most obvious changes, performance is also clearly smoother, though not without some mild hiccups when things get hectic. I do hope that the Switch 2 gives us 60fps patches for all the Xenoblade Chronicles games, but for now, 30fps remains thoroughly usable.</p>
<p>There’ve also been a host of little tweaks made to the game’s underpinnings that all serve to make the experience more fluid, or easier to understand, and the UI changes made during encounters really help to make things as clear as possible, which is especially handy when things are often descending into chaos, with multiple characters shouting instructions while a host of enemies are attacking you at the same time.</p>

<p>The iconic action palette that first appeared in the original Xenoblade Chronicles makes these interactions easier though, and I still love the MMO-like combat setup multiple games and multiple playthroughs later. As with elsewhere, it’s benefited from a little reworking, giving you extra options to heap the pain on the alien threats. If you’ve never played a Xenoblade Chronicles game before, Chronicles X Definitive Edition is an ideal starting point, and as the Switch comes to the end of its lifecycle, this is the perfect RPG swansong to go out on.</p>

						<h5>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</h5><p><span>March 20, 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X has long been the black sheep of Nintendo and Monolith Soft’s ambitious JRPG franchise, partly because it opts for a harder sci-fi setting than the rest of the series, partly because it simply had the bad fortune of being released on one of Nintendo’s least successful platforms. Thankfully for hardcore fans, Nintendo is now crossing off one of the final boxes on their “Wii U ports” bingo card with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Does this tuned-up version of Xenoblade Chronicles X soar to new heights? Or is this Skell destined to crash and burn with consumers all over again? Time to assess this alien RPG once again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X casts players as a survivor of the White Whale, an interstellar ark launched after an alien war forced humans to abandon Earth. Unfortunately, the aliens catch up with the White Whale and it crash lands on the surprisingly lively planet of Mira. After being rescued from your life pod, you soon find yourself in New Los Angeles, a spunky pop-up city built around the crashed ark's habitat unit. You're quickly recruited to join New LA's BLADE military unit under Colonel Elma and tasked with exploring Mira, eradicating threats, and discovering the location of the White Whale’s Life Hold, which is said to contain many more survivors.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X’s sci-fi setup certainly sets the game apart from other entries in the series, and the world of Mira is a rich and interesting one, with a cast of mostly likeable characters (er, and Tatsu). There are even a few decent twists later in the game, which we won't get into here, although admittedly, a lot of XCX’s minute-to-minute storytelling is fairly dry, consisting mostly of characters standing around info-dumping and repeating tired jokes. The story’s pacing also isn’t ideal, with the game often taking lengthy breaks from delivering any meaningful narrative as you’re compelled to explore Mira for hours on end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For the majority of its runtime, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition doesn’t do that much to expand the original game’s storytelling, although there are a small handful of new playable characters and sidequests sprinkled like breadcrumbs to keep returning players enticed. Without giving anything away, XCX Definitive Edition also addresses one of the original game’s most glaring shortcomings – its incomplete, unsatisfying conclusion – by providing a new endgame. While there’s likely to be some fan debate about this new denouement, it’s certainly a meatier story bone to chew on than what Wii U players got at the time.</p>
<p>While Xenoblade Chronicles X’s story can be a bit thin at times, make no mistake, this is a dense game, packed to the gills with interlocking systems. New LA is a sprawling metropolis, consisting of several districts packed with NPCs, playable characters, vendors, and quests. Expanding Mira's map is a matter of installing data probes, which can be managed to passively produce and store various resources. Meanwhile, all your party members can be customized by assigning them different classes, skills, arts, and gear. Around halfway through the game, you’ll also gain access to towering pilotable mechs called Skells, which can be fully customized in their own right. Thankfully, all this complexity is a bit easier to digest this time around, thanks to some well-implemented gameplay updates.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X’s combat is similar to other entries in the series, with a few unique twists of its own. Your main controlled character and AI allies move and select “Arts” in real time, with many of these powerful moves requiring you to do certain things for maximum effect. XCX also introduces the unique and somewhat quirky “Soul Voice” system, wherein your allies shout out various requests ("Use a melee attack!" etc.), and if you fill those requests and properly execute a subsequent quick-time event, you'll get some sort of bonus effect. A major focus of XCX Definitive Edition is making the Soul Voice system easier to grapple with, with additions like a quick cooldown system that allows you to fire off a limited number of Arts whenever you want. This arguably makes battles a bit easier, but it also improves the overall flow of combat and allows players to better take advantage of the Soul Voice system.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately, though, the most important improvement to XCX Definitive Edition’s combat is the game’s slick new UI. In the original Xenoblade Chronicles X, the screen was flooded with hard-to-follow information during combat, but this time around, the UI has been redesigned to be larger, cleaner, and more readable. The Soul Voice system feels much easier to get your head around now, with the game more clearly communicating which Arts your allies want you to use. The improved UI doesn’t just benefit combat either, pretty much <em>anything</em> that involves a menu is more readable and useable now.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another thing that’s much better in this version of Xenoblade Chronicles X is the map. Originally, you could only access the world map on the Wii U GamePad, which was novel I suppose, but really limited the map’s functionality. Now, you can simply access the map on your TV screen, which allows for a much wider field of view and more detail. Other new map features have also been added, including the ability to track key quest-related collectibles.</p>
<p>Monolith Soft also weren’t afraid to take a scalpel to some original XCX systems. Field Skills, which required you to join a BLADE faction and level up in order to access certain treasures and install some data probes, have been more or less excised. Now, when you find a treasure or probe location, you can, 9 times out of 10, just interact with it. Some may lament no longer being able to roleplay as a faction to the same degree, but the Field Skill system always felt rather arbitrary, and removing it mainly just eliminates an extra layer of needless grind.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Don’t get me wrong; there are still a few nagging irritations left over from the original version of Xenoblade Chronicles X. Checkpoints are more sparsely placed in the open world than they ought to be, which means death sometimes sets you back quite a ways. The Skell “insurance” system, which basically gives you a mere three lives for each Skell you buy, also remains intact. That said, a few small lingering frustrations aside, this feels like a much more playable, streamlined version of Xenoblade Chronicles X.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition’s visual upgrade doesn’t deliver quite as strongly as its UI and gameplay tweaks. Most of the game’s character models have been updated, but I don’t know if they’ve been universally <em>upgraded</em> (I honestly prefer Elma’s original, softer character design). Mira itself doesn't look that markedly different, but everything is a bit sharper, and the game looks surprisingly good in handheld mode.</p>
<p>I was also somewhat disappointed that issues present in the Wii U version of Xenoblade Chronicles X, like frequent pop-in, are still present on Switch. Draw distance is definitely improved, but you'll still see enemies and objects blink into existence not that far ahead of you at times. I did also note occasional performance hiccups, although, overall, the game does run better than some other recent first-party Switch titles. Oh, and yes, the soundtrack is still a bit of a dog’s breakfast, mixing some rather good instrumental tracks with some clunkers featuring irritating repetitive lyrics. Now, make no mistake, Xenoblade Chronicles X is still rather lovely at times, with an impressive sense of scope, imaginatively rendered vistas, and some of the game’s better tunes sometimes combining to deliver striking moments.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde15.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And really, it’s always been the world of Mira that makes Xenoblade Chronicles X a standout. A lot of the open-world design philosophies that Nintendo and Monolith Soft would later refine with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild were birthed here, and in some ways, Mira is even more interesting than Hyrule. The world is packed with mind-bending panoramas and getting to your next mission marker often feels like a puzzle to be solved, with players having to think vertically as well as horizontally. The wildlife you’ll encounter is quite the sorted menagerie as well, with not-terribly-intimidating enemies like alien boars and bugs hanging out right next to towering dinosaur-like monstrosities. Just fighting everything in your path isn't an option, and often figuring out how to sneak past a nest of particularly nasty baddies is part of the complex environmental puzzle.</p>
<p>Exploring isn’t always seamless. One of the most important innovations Zelda BotW introduced was the ability to climb nearly everything, while a lot of your time in XCX is spent gormlessly jumping against rocks and cliffs, hoping your feet will find purchase and allow you to scramble to the top. Small complaints aside, though, this is a fantastic world, and the feeling of increasing power you get as you play through the game is really unmatched in a JRPG. You feel amazing once you get your first Skell and start bounding over previously impassable obstacles, and once you gain the ability to <em>fly</em>? Forget about it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WCCFxenobladechroniclesXde16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition’s core campaign is one of the least daunting in the series. If you stay focused, you can get through the game’s original dozen chapters in around 40 to 50 hours, thanks to changes designed to reduce grind. Of course, if you take all the game’s side content and newly added stuff into account, you could easily be playing for hundreds of hours. Perhaps the best testament to how well this Definitive Edition is handled is that I actually enjoyed this second playthrough of XCX on Switch <em>more</em> than my first, despite it being a less novel experience, and I think other BLADE veterans will feel the same way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-jason-blundell-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran Jason Blundell, who's worked on some of the series' biggest games, is now heading up a new studio for PlayStation by the name of Dark Outlaw Games.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in an interview with gaming journalist Jeff Gerstmann (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/75045/call-of-duty-vet-blundell-helming-new-playstation-studio-dark-outlaw-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamesInsider</a>), during which Blundell revealed that he's been "working away in the shadows" on a game that has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Blundell goes on to say that it's a "privilege" to be able to work as part of a first-party Sony studio, although I'm pretty sure that some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent casualties</a> might have something to say about that assessment.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-iiii-jason-blundell-firefight.jpg?itok=6K48jePQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-iiii-jason-blundell-firefight.jpg?itok=ptbBVLn6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jason Blundell has worked on some of the biggest&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Blundell also acknowledges in the interview that Sony "doesn't set up first-party studios all the time" and says he's "excited" to be working on Dark Outlaw's debut project, although he doesn't reveal what that project is.</p>

<p>If Blundell's past experience is anything to go by, however, we can probably assume that it'll be a first-person shooter of some kind, and since he's a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran with experience working on the series' Zombies modes, Dark Outlaw's game could well have live service elements.</p>

<p>Whether or not that's a logical move for Sony remains to be seen; the company's most recent live service shooter experiment, last year's&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, ended in disaster. The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down in just two weeks</a> and its developer was subsequently shuttered for good.</p>

<p>This also won't be Blundell's first foray into development for PlayStation; after leaving Treyarch in 2018, he founded Deviation Games, which was working on a new IP for PlayStation. However, Blundell left in 2022, and the developer then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deviation-games-is-shut-down-before-it-can-ship-a-game-in-its-partnership-with-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">closed its doors last year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Vonderhaar's studio will join the procession of NetEase studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">losing their funding</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laying off staff members</a>.

It was around the time the sigil-ridden corpse hooked up to a breathing tube pooped out a slithering, smiling garden gnome, and shortly after I had to sacrifice my arms, legs, colours and voice to a bunch of hideous trees that I realised that, hang on, this isn't my current lunchtime favourite Bracket City. This is the demo for Moroi, a top-down "dark fairytale" from Violet Saint and publishers Good Shepherd, in which you are a horrible little man in a world of talking meat grinders, plughole maggots, and clamp-faced crawling things. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The friendliest the demo gets is when the duck from Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Laf9vpJMDjA">old Third Place adverts</a> tears out its own chunky molars for you to glue to your sword. Suffice it to say that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> has fresh competition in the subgenre of mutilation-driven action games, though the mechanics and tone are perhaps more in keeping with the venerable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-mcgees-alice">American McGee's Alice</a>. Here's a trailer (it's an older one - there's a newer one but it has a spoilery voiceover).

<p>
The premise here is that you're a prisoner of the Cosmic Engine, "a personalized hellscape designed to distort any semblance of normalcy". You are there because you've done something really rather awful, but the Engine's denizens aren't especially inclined to fill you in. "Your name, your past: gone, but not the record of your misdeeds," explains the Steam page. "Your crimes: beyond comprehension. Your conviction: incontestable. Your sentence: eternal. The need to escape and set things right: undeniable." 
</p>
<p>
Before you can get into all that you'll need to massacre a lot of squidgy medieval thugs. Your starting weapons are a blade with a combo alt fire, and a Gatling nailgun that overheats. Fill up your Execute bar and you can slaughter people for health orbs - I didn't come across any regular healing items in the demo. It feels like a straightforward shmup: backpedal, strafe, and kite until everything is giblets. I'm far more interested in the geography and mythology of this particular nightmare frontier. 
</p>
<p>
In the demo's Sky Prison, there is a pronounced emphasis on eating or being eaten. You meet a fellow who's gnawing on his own arm - he promptly scolds you for not grasping "the beauty of my art". The aforesaid sentient bone-thresher, meanwhile, asks if it can devour you after explaining that it was thrown in jail for guzzling a chef. Being something of a people-pleaser, I said yes, but the meatgrinder spat me out because I tasted bad. Rude. These culinary matters aside, I'm keen to learn more about the opening screen, which shows a hollow-eyed pixie blowing up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophanim">Ophanim</a> like a party balloon.
</p>
<p>
There's a slight sense of filthy-brained writers and artists engaged in ostentatious brinkmanship, striving to revolt each other at the expense of craft. Put it this way, you could upend the contents of the Sky Prison across the whole game and it'd be spilled intestines enough for most players. There's a stop-motion judder and a rotten toybox ambience to Moroi that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-games-you-missed-in-2021-sluggish-morss-pattern-circus">Jack King-Spooner's work</a>, but so far, King-Spooner's games deploy their ugliness more purposefully. At times, this just feels like grot for the love of it, with a predictable heavy metal soundtrack. It's more butchery than surgery.
</p>
<p>
Still, I'm partial to a bit of grot now and then. Even over lunch, though I'm definitely thankful right now that I don't eat meat. Moroi hath yet no release date - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2518410/Moroi/">you can read more and find the demo on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/dawnfolk-review-city-building-game-steam-indie-1851770670<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are so many degrees of scope when it comes to the city building format. The genre, that first flourished in the early ‘90s with <em>SimCity 2000</em> has consistently delivered intricate excellence, with series like <em>Tropico</em>, <em>Frostpunk</em> and <em>Anno</em>, building to the triumph of 2015's <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. But it’s also offered more esoteric takes, with the brilliant <em>Surviving Mars</em>, <em>Before We Leave</em>, and <em>Dorfromantik</em>. But you know what they all lack? A magic light being with a story to tell. So welcome <em>Dawnfolk</em>, a glorious distilling of the genre that  streamlines and simplifies, while weaving its own spellbinding narrative.</p><p><em>Dawnfolk</em> is a wonderfully fresh approach to town-building antics, with small, goal-orientated tiled worlds on which you must create miniature, rural communities, with successful farms, mines, and increasingly more complicated buildings, alongside trade agreements or conflicts with local orcs and elves, all while battling against the forces of darkness. And it’s all with a refreshing, deeply engaging simplicity. And no, that’s not a contradiction, because <em>Dawnfolk</em>‘s genius is to make a huge array of systems extraordinarily approachable, and then doubly-fun by having battles, hunting, fishing and various other aspects play out as the teeniest minigames, taking place literally within the tile.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195301" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>These are very simple, but it adds a surprising amount. You might have a tiny game of catching falling fruit when picking berries, or need to spin a sword in the middle of the tile to fend off invading pixels. There’s a teeny hunting minigame of firing arrows to hit passing deer, or perhaps to save your folk from invading wolves. And no, they don’t grow frustrating, as at a certain point into any level you can put resources into a building that will play them for you.</p><div><h4>  <strong>Buried Treasure Indie Game Reviews</strong></h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

These will dimly reveal what’s on orthogonal tiles that are yet to be lit, giving you an idea of in which direction you might want to expand. There might be a plain field on which you can build tents, the crudest form of home for your people. Or there could be some wild sheep (incredibly irrelevant tangent: did you know that there <em>are</em> wild sheep, called mouflon, and as the dog is the domesticated wolf, the sheep is the domesticated mouflon! Cows, since you ask, come from aurochs), which you could then kill for food, or farm for supplies. Build a farm, then some crops nearby, and perhaps set up a mine on a mountain tile. All through this, it’s about balance. You need homes to have people, but homes need supplies and people need food, and you need people to get supplies and food. Which is standard city-building stuff, other than the threat of the darkness.</p><figure id="" data-id="093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-recommend-id="image://093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A huge spread of tiles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A huge spread of tiles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Astra Logical / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-recommend-id="image://093a6ac4ec4781b55536d99bf7b40b8e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A huge spread of tiles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dawnfolk</em> has a narrative running through the thematic levels of its story mode. You are guided in your game by a little flame character called Lueur, who has no memory of who he is at the start of the game. His antithesis is a similarly-shaped creature of darkness called Nuit, who will occasionally invade your little town with dark storms. You know one’s coming when it starts to rain, at which point you’re going to want to conserve as much light as you can to battle against them. These storms spread onto tiles you’ve explored, and need to be combated with light through more of those little arcade minigames, until eventually the storms weaken enough for you to destroy their cores. Each level has this happen a number of times, another thing to keep in balance.</p><p>Then, beyond this series of scenarios, the game also offers puzzle levels (including daily puzzles), an endless mode (and indeed you can continue playing any scenario for as long as you want after the goals are achieved), a sandbox mode, another series of levels called Curious Expeditions where unique changes are made to how the game plays. Then there are various difficulty levels, easter egg modes, and all of these elements are unlocked by spending a currency accrued by finishing levels and achieving a billion little goals. Oh, and <em>this is the work of one guy</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-recommend-id="image://a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A town built on a small island, surrounded by sea and desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A town built on a small island, surrounded by sea and desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Astra Logical / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-recommend-id="image://a80e54adaf42c5a8f5f3278ad4d7caf2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1095" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A town built on a small island, surrounded by sea and desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is just fabulous. I cannot tell you how much fun I’m having, each level taking just fifteen minutes or half an hour, and each uniquely rewarding as it ups the ante, introduces new elements and new dangers, has me battling ogres or befriending dragons, all while ensuring that core mechanic of balancing light, people, resources and food is maintained. This is properly delightful, with so much to do, and all so satisfying to complete. Also, given it’s best played with a gamepad, this is a perfect Steam Deck game too.</p><p>If you’re not into city builders, play this. It’s nothing like them. If you <em>do</em> love city builders, then you should play this too, because it distils the most pure concepts into a gorgeous, chunky, meaningful game. Which is to say, if you currently exist, I really do recommend playing <em>Dawnfolk</em>.</p><p><em>Dawnfolk</em> is out now. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://darenn.itch.io/dawnfolk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://darenn.itch.io/dawnfolk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The best place to buy it is on Itch</a></span>, where most of your money will directly reach developer Darenn Keller.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/saros-housemarque-budget-alan-wake-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Housemarque's next game, Saros, would never have been possible if the studio remained independent, according to its CEO.</p>
<p>Speaking with Finnish publication <a href="https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000011045895.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helsingin Sanomat</a>, Housemarque CEO Ilari Kuittinen commented on the acquisition of the studio by Sony, saying that it brought some cultural changes to the studio, such as having to conform to Sony's HR practices, but also more financial resources that have allowed the developer to move to new offices, and effectively make Saros possible, as Housemarque would have never been able as an independent studio to invest as much as was needed for the development of the game, which entered full production in 2022. While the game's budget hasn't been revealed, it is, according to Helsegin Sanomat, close to Alan Wake 2's budget of 70 million euros.</p>
<p>Saros was officially revealed during February's PlayStation State of Play with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">cinematic trailer</a> that provided some hints about the game's setting and story. While very little is currently known about the gameplay mechanics, the information provided so far suggests Saros will be built upon the mechanics that power <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">Returnal</a>, featuring a world that is constantly reshaped upon each death but also permanent progression systems that will help players overcome the many challenges ahead of them.</p>
<p>Saros is now in development for PlayStation 5. The game will launch sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>Like General Khazan and the power of the Blade Phantom, you are likely to form a strong connection to The First Berserker Khazan Trophy List. It features a tough and unenviable test of Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> has the makings of a great action game. Khazan’s assortment of reality-defying powers mesh well with the environments and their rich color palette. The action looks intense, and some might say contains a lot of <em>soul</em>. If you’re keen on The First Berserker Khazan, you might want to consider acquiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>—although you might need to know its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-pc-system-requirements-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC requirements</a> first.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s upcoming competitor is none other than its decades-old rival, Digimon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a new post on the digimon_tcg account on <a href="https://x.com/digimon_tcg/status/1901112392492478758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> teased an upcoming digital card game for the franchise. The post includes a short 10-second teaser, where we see Renamon hovering over a smartphone before the Digimon is suddenly sucked into the phone. That’s all that was revealed. However, more information about the game will be shown during Digimon Con on March 20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon and Digimon have been rivals for decades, with the former eventually taking the lead. However, seeing how Pokemon TCG Pocket has amassed so much success within such a short time, earning over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$120 million</a> within the first seventeen days and crossing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30 million downloads</a> within the first nine, Digimon seems to want a cut of that success too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like the Pokemon Trading Card Game, Digimon has also had a card game since 2020, so they already have an established base for the digital version. However, the title’s success ultimately depends on the audience’s reception of another digital trading card game based on a different franchise. However, fans in the r/digimon subreddit seem ecstatic about the new digital trading card game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Niantic, Pokemon Go’s developer, has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-go-developer-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired by Scopely</a> for $3.5 billion. Also, here’s everything we know about Pokemon Champions, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-champions-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its release window, platforms</a> and more.&nbsp;</p>

Developer Arrowhead also increased the number of AI calculations the game can perform, which primarily impacts scenarios with a high number of spawned enemies, improving their response times in those situations. However, this comes with a slight trade-off in game performance, Arrowhead said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of these gameplay changes is that the Automatons specifically will present a tougher challenge as they now have increased reaction speed in large groups. Expect Helldivers 2's already imposing bots to act smarter and make decisions faster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here’s a useful improvement: the stratagem loadout menu has undergone an updated categorization of the different stratagem groupings.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Helldivers 2’s next Warbond, called Borderline Justice. The theme this time is 'space cowboy,' and in keeping with that theme there are new weapons including the R-6 Deadeye lever-action hunting rifle, the LAS-58 Talon "revolver" secondary, and the TED-63 Dynamite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GS-17 Frontier Marshal is space cowboy-themed medium Helldiver set, as is the GS-66 Lawmaker heavy armor, which comes complete with cowboy holster and bandolier. The Gunslinger armor passive gives your secondary increased reload speed, increased draw/holster speed, and reduced recoil. The warbond launches March 20.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/hd2-1742294703651.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2's next warbond adds a space cowboy theme.

Where this is going is anyone’s guess, but speculation points to potentially taking the fight to the Illuminate’s home world, or maybe finally fighting back on Super Earth itself.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helldivers 2 update 01.002.200 patch notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2">Balancing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Primary weapons</strong><br>SMG-32 Reprimand</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 50 to 40</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">SG-8S Slugger</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Spread decreased from 20 to 6</li><li>Damage increased from 250 to 280</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">AR-23C Liberator Concussive</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fire rate increased from 320 to 400</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">R-63 Diligence</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Magazine capacity increased from 20 to 25</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">MP-98 Knight</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 65 to 70</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">STA-11 SMG</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 65 to 70</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">SMG-37 Defender</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 75 to 80</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">SMG-72 Pummeler</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 65 to 70</li><li>Now requires less shots to apply stun on applicable targets, stun value increased from 1.0 to 1.25 per bullet</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">AR-23 Liberator</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 70 to 80</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">STA-52 Assault Rifle</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 70 to 80</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">BR-14 Adjudicator</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 90 to 95</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">AR-61 Tenderizer</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 95 to 105</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">R-36 Eruptor</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Projectile armor penetration increased from Medium (3) to Heavy (4)</li><li>Projectile lifetime increased from 0.7 to 1 sec</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stratagems</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle 110MM Rocket Pods</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Uses increased from 2 to 3</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">EXO-45 Patriot Exosuit</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Uses increased from 2 to 3</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">EXO-49 Emancipator Exosuit</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Uses increased from 2 to 3</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">TX-41 Sterilizer</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ergonomics increased from 5 to 20</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">M-105 Stalwart</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Damage increased from 70 to 80</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved armor penetration across a wider range of angles before transitioning to glancing shots</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A recent software autopsy has revealed an update to the Automatons' situational awareness protocol.
