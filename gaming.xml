Maybe months. When you finally have some free time again, download all the updates you missed, and boot up the game once more, you realize you have no idea what you were doing or why. You’ve forgotten all the controls. Why are you so far away from the objective marker? How the hell do you even kill things in this game? Eventually you give up and just go scroll TikTok for an hour. </p><p>I have no data to back this up, by it certainly feels like this experience is becoming more and more prevalent. In part, that’s because games are getting way more complex than they were in the PS1 or even the Xbox 360 days. For me personally, it’s partly because I’m way older than I used to be and my brain is slowly turning into sludge. Hideo Kojima, the creator of <em>Metal Gear </em>who’s team is getting ready to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-metal-gear-snake-actor-release-date-1851768781?_gl=1*p1p9lu*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMjY5NTYkbzE5NyRnMSR0MTc0NzIzNDIyNiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-metal-gear-snake-actor-release-date-1851768781?_gl=1*p1p9lu*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMjY5NTYkbzE5NyRnMSR0MTc0NzIzNDIyNiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">ship <em>Death Stranding 2</em> next month</a></span>, has an idea to turn this entire cycle of defeat into a game. </p><p>On the latest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRQeB2a-RSs&amp;t=2191s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRQeB2a-RSs&amp;t=2191s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode of his podcast</a></span> (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-an-amazing-idea-for-a-forgetting-game-where-the-main-character-gradually-forgets-important-information-and-abilities-if-you-take-too-long-a-break-from-playing?taid=68247efdc5ec46000109ed66&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-an-amazing-idea-for-a-forgetting-game-where-the-main-character-gradually-forgets-important-information-and-abilities-if-you-take-too-long-a-break-from-playing?taid=68247efdc5ec46000109ed66&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>), the game director mentions a “forgetting game” where players would have to play through quickly to avoid losing ground. The main character would forget information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game. They might not know their role in the story, or even how to fire a gun. Abandon the game for long enough and the character wouldn’t be able to move at all. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima said. </p><p>As many have pointed out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/IGN/status/1922630747497677243/quotes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1922630747497677243/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is just real life for lots of us now</a></span>. Most modern games now essentially have a “forgetting mode” on by default, though some attempt to remedy the issue by providing optional recaps on what players were recently doing, or ongoing tutorials they can easily return to if they forget how to play. Often the friction remains, however. I can’t even imagine how bad it would be if my character was just as lost as I was. We’d be the gaming equivalent of lotus eaters, idly listening to the ambient soundtrack while the clock ticked by. </p><p>It’s hardly the first time Kojima has wanted to mess around with the real-world passage of time inside of one of his games. He explained in the latest podcast that he had thought of making Sam Porter’s hair grow in <em>Death Stranding 2</em> when players are logged off, but didn’t want to make a “big star” like Norman Reedus “look uncool.” Fans of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, meanwhile, will recall the fight with sniper The End. It’s a tough encounter players can completely bypass if they just wait several days in the real world until the enemy dies of old age. It’ll be interesting to see how it’s captured in the <em>Delta</em> remake coming this summer. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is warning against issues with fake merch sales around him, but also teasing an official plush Esquie that's in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> from the official Expedition 33 account, Sandfall Interactive said it has seen a number of "suspicious" websites pop up selling Esquie plushies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be clear: any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed," the studio said. "Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources. They could be scams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To balance out the wheee with the whooo though, as Esquie might say, Sandfall confirms it is looking into making official Esquie plushies, and wants to get them out as soon as it can. "In the meantime, please be patient — and don’t get scammed!" the studio said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played the game probably get why an Esquie plushie might be in high demand. If you haven't gone on Expedition 33 yet, Esquie is a giant helper you meet in Act 1 of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 who becomes both a traveling companion and overworld travel method. He's got the same vibe as Big Hero 6's Baymax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, it's easy to see how an Esquie plush might garner some interest, so it's good to know Sandfall is working on an official solution. A cursory search on Google pulled up both an unofficial site, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kh8sug/esquie_plush_scam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few threads</a> asking about Esquie plush peddlers. If you want the real thing from Sandfall and Kepler, you'll have to wait a bit. No news on whether the real-life plushie will also be filled with wine, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-patch-123-is-a-big-one-nerfs-maelles-game-breaking-stendahl-build">Sandfall Interactive released patch 1.2.3</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, addressing some balance tweaks around Maelle's Stendhal ability. French President Emmanuel Macron also recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/french-president-macron-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-for-creating-one-of-the-best-rated-games-in-history">praised the game</a>, calling its developers a "shining example of French audacity and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

One is that a player might go "all the way in" and dedicate lots of time and money. A second category of players might find the perceived time sink to be too enormous and simply play something else instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>FBC aims to be a game that people can pick up and play in short bursts, at a modest price point ($40). The game is also included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">PlayStation Plus</a> from day one, which in theory should help it reach a potentially larger audience.</p><p>"The game is made by middle-aged dads for middle-aged dads," Remedy's Anssi Hyytiäinen told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/with-fbc-firebreak-remedy-says-its-made-a-control-shooter-for-dads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "That was something that we talked about a lot. We wanted to make the game easy to pick up and throw yourself in there and have fun with your friends."</p><p>Kayatta, meanwhile, said FBC's session lengths were deliberately designed to be played in as little as five minutes. Even for a completionist, the game might take 30 or 40 hours to play as opposed to "thousands of hours."</p><p>"So we're not like Monster Hunter for sure. And that's been conscious decision also in that this we don't want it to be like almost predatory design practices of trying to suck all of your time out of your life," he said.</p><p>Kayatta told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-modern-games-says-remedy-director-of-fbc-firebreak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that FOMO design concepts have "infected a lot of modern games," and that Remedy intentionally tried to reduce FOMO with FBC.</p><p>On the subject of FOMO, former Call of Duty veteran developer Mark Rubin recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-cod-dev-laments-the-series-leaning-so-heavily-into-fomo/1100-6531275/" data-ref-id="1100-6531275">Activision is resorting to manipulation tactics</a>, including FOMO, to encourage people to play Call of Duty.</p><p>FBC releases on June 17 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Players can do all kinds of extreme sports in the game, including biking, snowboarding, skiing, wingsuit flying, and more. Given the movie’s logline features the snowy slopes of the Alps, it seems the film will be centered on winter sports.</p><p>While waiting to learn more about the movie, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/riders-republic/riders-republic-review-a-missed-opportunity"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Riders Republic review</a>.</p><p>Are you excited about a Riders Republic movie?

            <p>Sony has revealed the next round of additions to its PS Plus Catalogue for subscribers, which will be added on 20th May.</p>
<p>The following games will be available later this month for Premium and Extra subscribers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sand Land | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Soul Hackers 2 | PS5</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted - Full Time Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Battlefield 5 | PS4</li>
<li>STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Humankind | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life | PS5</li>
<li>Gloomhaven Mercenaries Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Premium subscribers will get access to PS2 classic Battle Engine Aquila on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sand-land">Sand Land</a> was released last year and features designs from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama - this was his last game before he passed away. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-gives-posthumous-praise-for-sand-land-game">posthumously praised the game</a> in a statement shared after his death: "I haven't watched through all of the gameplay yet," he said. "However, it greatly expands the worldview of the original manga with many new exciting elements. It is high-quality as a stand alone game and I can tell it is a highly satisfying action-RPG game!"</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-getting-an-enhanced-edition-upgrade-on-ps5-series-xs-and-pc">GSC Game World announced a free Enhanced Edition upgrade for Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy</a>, which combines the first three games in the series. It includes a visual upgrade and other improvements, but it's unclear if PS Plus subscribers will have access following its inclusion here in the subscription.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Soul Hackers 2 is a 2022 RPG from Persona-maker Atlus that, confusingly, is the fifth installment in the Devil Summoner series, which is part of the Megami Tensei franchise. If you like anime RPGs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus">Granblue Fantasy Versus</a>: Rising is probably also worth a shot, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is a more relaxed farming experience.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Are you excited to play any of these? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These Catalogue games are in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-may">free monthly games also available this month</a> to those on the Essential tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ark: Survival Ascended | PS5</li>
<li>Balatro | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>New additions mean some games will likely be leaving the service this month too, we'll update once we know more.</p>
<p>More details on this month's games can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-sand-land-soul-hackers-2-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-battlefield-v-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/666867/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Square Enix has announced that it is cancelling the mobile spinoff <em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>. In <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/">a statement on the game’s website</a>, Square Enix apologized to fans who were anticipating the game. The announcement also mentioned that Square was still hard at work on <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> perhaps to allay fears that this cancellation might indicate problems for other games in the sprawling Disney video game series.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link</em> <a href="http://v/">was announced in 2022 alongside <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em></a><em>.</em> It was billed as a mobile action game that made use of GPS technology to give players the ability to “travel the world without stepping outside,” according to one trailer. However, apparently that goal was a bit too lofty as Square Enix wrote, “We determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.”</p><p>Square Enix’s statement provided insight as to the reason for a game’s cancellation – something most game studios do not often offer. And while making any game is a miracle, making a successful live-service game is like asking for lightning to strike the head of a pin in a forest. After all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">how</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">live-service games</a> (some of them <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on">even made by Square Enix itself</a>) were released only to die shortly thereafter while the concurrent player counts for <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> remain largely unmoved. So it’s a rare and refreshing bit of honesty, especially in an industry as opaque as game development, that Square Enix was willing to name the reason for cancelling <em>Missing-Link</em> and I hope more studios follow suit in the future. </p><p>But it’s not all bad news for Square Enix. As reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/square-enix-and-tbs-television-announce-collaboration-to-develop-original-ip-game"><em>Gematsu</em></a>, Square has also started a new partnership with the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television. Known as TBS, it’s a Japanese TV and media company which produced <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/takeshis-castle-reboot-amazon-prime-17048691.php"><em>Takeshi’s Castle</em></a> – an internationally popular physical competition show known in the US as <em>Most Extreme Elimination Challenge</em> or <em>MXC</em>. TBS started its own games division in 2023 and with Square Enix, the two companies will work on a new gaming property.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' first "special collaboration" will be a crossover with survival horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, set to arrive on 27th May. 
</p>
<p>
"Step into The Fog," reads a post on social media by the Assassin's Creed account this afternoon. "A new Dead by Daylight quest begins. Slip through the shadows. Survive the ordeal."
</p>
<p>
An accompanying teaser video shows Naoe and Yasuke resting by a campfire, while a figure with glowing red flames around their arms and feet faces them. Exact details on what the crossover will contain are presumably set to arrive at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft revealed that Shadows would get multiple "special collaboration" updates as part of its free post-launch content roadmap</a>. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Today's announcement appears to put a date on Shadows' next big update, in which this first collaboration is included. Other additions expected on 27th May include improvements to the game's photo mode and additional flashy parkour moves.
</p>
<p>
This update will then be followed by at least one further update in June, where a second free story mission will be added. This will feature a new ally that can come hang out at your homebase. June's update is also set to feature new difficulty options, and the ability to wear headgear in cutscenes (a highly requested feature by fans).
</p>
<p>
Beyond June, Ubisoft has said it has plans to add a New Game Plus Mode, additional story missions, and more "special collaborations". 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Assassin's Creed has provided optional post-launch content crossing over with other games, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Final Fantasy's Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, while multiple Assassin's Creed heroes have themselves crossed over into the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

Then, in April 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://archive.is/2023.07.03-160323/https://www.gq.com/story/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-tcm-max&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://archive.is/2023.07.03-160323/https://www.gq.com/story/david-zaslav-warner-bros-discovery-ceo-tcm-max" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB Discovery CEO and dingus David Zaslav</a></span> announced that it was dropping the HBO branding from the service and it would just be called Max. After the announcement, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)#cite_note-62&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(streaming_service)#cite_note-62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WB’s stock dropped by six percent</a></span> and people mostly laughed at the new name and kept using the old one. Then, in February, WB rebranded Max’s logo from blue to black, seemingly signaling a return to the HBO branding. And now here we are. HBO Max is back after millions of wasted dollars. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/warner-bros-discovery-announces-max-become-hbo-max-summer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 14, WB Discovery announced</a></span> that it was bringing back the HBO Max name this summer because “consumers” now demand “better” content, not just “more” content. Fun fact: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23673475/warner-bros-discovery-max-new-name-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2023</a></span>, after dropping HBO from the brand, the reason given was because they wanted people to not assume it was just premium adult content. Anyway, here’s some corpo blabble that will make you roll your eyes so hard they might fall out of your head. </p><p>“Returning the HBO brand into HBO Max will further drive the service forward and amplify the uniqueness that subscribers can expect from the offering. It is also a testament to WBD’s willingness to keep boldly iterating its strategy and approach—leaning heavily on consumer data and insights—to best position itself for success.”</p><p>Ahh, yes, what a bold strategy! Taking a name that was popular, recognized, liked, and successful, and tossing it into the bin because you completed a big merger and suddenly had new execs wanting to shake things up and be a part of the process. Then, after that new name flopped and everyone mostly igorned it anyway, you sneak back out to the garbage, clean up the old name, and bring it back with a big press release that touts how HBO is a brand connected to quality and prestige. Makes you wonder why you ditched it to begin with? </p><p>Now, let’s all think about how much money was spent on this stupid process and how the richest people in the world running these companies aren’t good at their jobs. Welcome back, HBO Max. You shouldn’t have been killed in the first place. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I am told, by just about every single person in my life, that I should be using a mechanical keyboard, with removable switches, clickity-clackity sounds, and probably enough neon lighting to open a nightclub. I do not. I use a Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A, with a blob of Blu-Tac over the Num Lock LED, and I have done so for as long as I can remember. And as of today, I’m down to my last one. When this one goes, that’s it. I’m done.</p><figure id="" data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-recommend-id="image://e919d42bb401a06493cea7a3fded7e08" data-format="jpg" data-width="967" data-height="544" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead keyboard, lying on its belly on a towel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m not ashamed, and you’re not going to make me ashamed. The Microsoft MultiMedia Keyboard 1.0A is the best keyboard ever made. First created in 1997, its keys press with a whisper-quiet “shddd” and that is perfection. Yes, it has the most ludicrous array of “media” buttons across the top in a fancy arch, and no, I’ve never pressed one of them once in the twenty-ish years I’ve been using this keyboard. And no, this isn’t the “Natural” ergonomic version, it’s the regular-shaped one. I’m not a sicko.</p><p>I have had friends and co-workers react with genuine horror upon hearing of my use of this device. To not be part of the mechanical cult is, apparently, shun-worthy, and I accept that you too, reader, are now thinking even less of me. But worry not, for of the pile of six of these keyboards I bought when I heard they were no longer going to be manufactured, the one I’ve attached via its PS/2 cord to my PC today is my last. And after this one dies, I feel like retirement is my only option.</p><p>You know those authors who say that they write their books out long-hand, using the fountain pen they inherited from their great-great grandmother, and then some poor lackey has to type them up for the publisher? Or the writers who insist on using a 1930s Royal P typewriter, because they’re incapable of composing their prose on anything else? That’s me. Pretentious, dumbass me. The magic’s not in my heart, it’s in the Microsoft MultiMedia 1.0A.</p><p>(Look, I know, there’s controversy here that I’m not addressing. The official Microsoft data sheet for the keyboard calls it a “1.0a,” but the device itself says “1.0A,” and I won’t be budged from that capitalization. Sorry, you’ll just have to be offended.)</p><p>This is the keyboard on which I’ve composed my greatest works.

It’s the keyboard on which I finished <em>Dishonored 2</em>, and the means by which I conquered <em>Titanfall 2</em>. I’m far better at <em>Fortnite</em> on these keys than I am on my Xbox. This is how I spent those billions of hours in <em>Skyrim</em>. This keyboard is vital to my gaming life!</p><p>Over the years, I’ve been through so many makes of PCs, mice, monitors and speakers, but the keyboard has always remained the same. For years, I had to use a USB adaptor to plug the PS/2 cable in, although right now (because fate knows best) my current PC actually has a classic purple port right on the motherboard. I have literally no idea why. Surely there’s no one else this stupid?</p><figure id="" data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-recommend-id="image://f5a2623becea03076327bdf1913928c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1042" data-height="587" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A new keyboard in its cardboard box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it feels right! Maybe you have a favorite make of running shoes that you insist on buying, because everything else makes your feet feel funny. (You should try barefoot shoes though, trust me.) Perhaps there’s a cushion you put on the driver’s seat of every car? A favorite pillow without which going to sleep is significantly harder? That’s my 1.0A. It feels exactly the right shape under my fingers, the keys are perfectly spaced apart for my hands, and the wrist rest clips on the front in a way that makes all other keyboards feel like a form of gentle torture.</p><p>Time is certainly not on my side. Despite the mysterious PS/2 port, Windows doesn’t like this keyboard very much any more. The first thing I do each time I crack open a new one (usually because either the one I’m using has become as clickity-clackity as your ghastly mechanical setup, or because—as with today—I’ve murdered the last one with liquid) is fix the crummy delay when holding down a single key. Except, in the ten minutes I spent looking before I started writing this, I have been unable to find the key delay settings in Windows! They’re gone! I just misspelt “They’re” and when I held down Backspace to fix it, it took a near interminable half a second to begin clearing the mistake. I’m searching on Google for a solution, and most of the results are, “Are you OK? Do you need anything?”</p><figure id="" data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->John Walker / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-recommend-id="image://e5a829273329b1a945225e2f2c0f82b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1128" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The new keyboard in all its glory, complete with Blu-Tac over the light." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“So just buy a new one,” you might say, before realizing that it’ll only encourage me to keep working. Oh, poor sweet fool, if only it were that simple. When these things were new, they cost like $20. They were so gloriously cheap. When I bought that batch of six in 2013, it cost me $40 (plus $25 shipping!). That’s the greatest bargain of my life. Less than $11 a keyboard, and they’ve kept me going for 12 beautiful years. But right now, when I look on eBay, I’m finding <em>used</em> ones for $90! <em>USED! </em>(And to make matters worse, it’s listed as “Vintage.” It’s not fucking vintage! It’s as old as <em>Fight Club</em>. That is not a vintage film.)</p><p>In the last couple of years, when looking to find more back-ups, I’ve never seen a new one on sale for less than $100, which is ludicrous. Today, however, the best price for a new, unused version I’ve found <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/235994418826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is £32</a></span> ($43) and maybe I have to pay that? What’s that—a quarter of the cheapest mechanical keyboard you’d consider buying? <em>Outrageous</em>. Is my career worth this much?</p><p>OK, fine, I just bought it, alongside a second one I found for $20 that claims to be unused, but I’m suspicious. And with that, I’ve bought <em>all</em> the “new” 1.0As available on UK eBay. (PayPal was so suspicious of this activity that on buying the second one it sent alerts to my phone to make sure my account hadn’t been hacked by a deranged, 150-year-old criminal.) I refuse to believe there aren’t Microsoft warehouses filled with forgotten pallets of these things, lurking in a dark corner behind the crates holding Arks of the Covenant. Honestly, at this point I should be part of some ambassador program, appointed by Microsoft to herald the greatest moment in the company’s history, before it got distracted all over again by being evil.</p><p>And I still don’t care what you think. It’s so lovely to be on a brand new one of these lovely keyboards, the keys especially thuddy, the gaps between them not containing concerning amounts of fluff, and the insides entirely free of coffee and soda. I just need to figure out how to let it let me delete my mistakes more quickly, and I’m a happy boy. Until they’re all gone, that is, although I somewhat suspect that’ll be more than the universe can take, and everything else will go with it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A little over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-makes-its-way-to-xbox">its arrival on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, the original Stalker trilogy is getting an Enhanced Edition, bringing upgraded visuals and more to the post-apocalyptic shooter series on current-gen consoles and PC.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>'s newly announced current-gen update promises a range of additions and optimisations to all three bundled titles - 2007's Shadow of Chornobyl, 2008's Clear Sky, and 2009's Call of Prypiat - alongside a number of platform-specific features.
</p>
<p>
All platforms get visual upgrades, for instance, including enhanced lighting (GSC specifically mentions godrays, screen space reflections, and global illumination), advanced shaders for water and wetness effects, upgraded skyboxes, upscaled textures, and improved 3D models for NPCs, weapons, and environments. That's in addition to improved weapon field-of-vision, and 4K pre-rendered cinematics for a bit of extra storytelling pizzazz.

<p>Playing the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/">Wreckfest 2 Early Access</a> at its initial release, with its very limited content, I said, “At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-confirm-cpu-gpu-max-clock-speeds-available-ram-for-games-multiple-nvidia-dlss-options.1189119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The full Nintendo Switch 2 system specifications have been detailed today, providing a better idea of what the system may be capable of and revealing some of the limitations developers will have to work around for their games.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">Digital Foundry</a> provided a full run-down of the system specifications for the next-generation Nintendo console, starting with the CPU. The ARM Cortex A7BC runs the ARMv8 64-bit instruction set with cryptography extensions enabled, with no support for 32-bit in the SDK, and features 64K of L1 instruction cache and another 64K for L1 data cache. Each of the eight cores has 256K of L2 cache, sharing 4MB of L3 cache. Like the original Nintendo Switch CPU, not all cores will be available for games, as two will be reserved for running the operating system. In terms of CPU maximum clock speed, the CPU can reach as high as 1.7 GHz, a lot higher than the figures of 1100 MHz for handheld mode and 998 MHz for docked mode. According to Digital Foundry, the max clock speed is a theoretical maximum that could be reached in specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU, Digital Foundry confirmed the specs leaked before the system was revealed. The console's GPU is built on the Ampere architecture, which powers the RTX 30 series GPU, has 1536 CUDA cores, and runs at 561 MHz in handheld mode and 1007 MHz in docked mode. The GPU can run as high as 1.4 GHz, but it's not clear if developers can push the GPU higher than the values indicated for handheld and docked modes. Additionally, developers won't be able to use all the GPU resources, as some are reserved for the system. The 3.072 TFLOPs figure was also confirmed by Digital Foundry, but it has become somewhat irrelevant to gauge the system's performance. Regarding the console's ray tracing capabilities, the Nintendo Switch 2 is rated for around 10 gigarays per second, 20 in docked mode.</p>
<p>Much like the CPU and the GPU, not all of the Nintendo Switch 2's 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM will be available for games. Besides confirming that the RAM comes with two 6 GB modules and its 102GB/s and 68GB/s bandwidth for docked and handheld modes respectively, Digital Foundry confirmed that 3 GB of RAM will be reserved for the operating system, which is a much bigger chunk of RAM reserved for non-gaming functions compared to what was reserved for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Via the system's SDK, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm how the Nintendo Switch 2's custom-made FDE, File Decompression Engine, should allow for faster and more power-efficient decompression, and how VRR is only available for the system's screen, and is not currently supported over HDMI. It was also confirmed how Game Chat may have a certain performance impact on the system, so much so that a tool to test the function without an active session is being provided to developers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Digital Foundry was also able to confirm that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support multiple NVIDIA DLSS options—DLAA, 1x, 2x, and 3x options. While details on these options are not available, it is speculated that they could be equivalent to the Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes available on PC.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for select regions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-teams-up-with-bad-boys-for-life-directors-to-make-a-riders-republic-film-adaptation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Another video game-to-film adaptation is in the works, and this time it's Ubisoft's open-world extreme-sports multiplayer game Riders Republic being made into a movie, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> reports.</p>
<p>The studio has teamed up with Bad Boys for Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah to direct the project, with Noé Debré signed on to write the script. Ubisoft and Gaumont will develop and produce the film.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/riders-republic-beautiful-rocky-road/">Riders Republic</a> was a flawed but solid game for anyone who just wanted to jump on a bike and ride down the side of a mountain, hop on a snowboard, or just as quickly jump into several other sports of the extreme variety. It launched with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riders-republic-fixes-achievements-matchmaking-mass-races/">bunch of issues</a>, like most modern multiplayer games, but what it definitely wasn't known for was its rich characters and story.</p>
<p>Which means that, for now, it's anyone's guess as to what this movie will be about. The only note about what this movie will actually be about in Deadline's report says that the movie will capture the action of the extreme sports "<em>with humor and spectacular stunts on the snow-covered slopes of the Alps</em>."</p>
<p>We've been enjoying a renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations with some standout successes, like HBO's The Last of Us, Amazon's Fallout, the Sonic movies, and the Super Mario Bros. movie. But there have still been some big misses, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-tv-show-is-canceled-but-is-being-shopped-around-while-fallout-ramps-up-season-2-and-earns-emmy-nominations/">Paramount's Halo TV show</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-movie-handed-to-tim-miller-for-reshoots/">Borderlands</a> movie, which both showed that you can't just adapt any video game into a film and walk away with $1 billion.</p>
<p>If Ubisoft hadn't already tried to make a big blockbuster hit out of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-review/">Assassin's Creed</a> years ago, it would definitely have tried that in this current landscape before trying to make a Riders Republic movie. Perhaps casting and the 10 million player base that Deadline's report says Riders Republic has will help make the movie successful. But right now, that feels difficult to imagine.</p>

        <p>Finally, a relatable main character</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hideo Kojima is his own Peter Molydeux, in that he's forever out there pitching Kojima-like ideas for games he might make. Hideo Jokima? On a recent episode of his Japanese radio show, KOJI10, the designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> pitched a few ideas he had for games based around time. The best of the bunch: a game in which your character gradually forgets information if players take too long a break from playing.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-an-amazing-idea-for-a-forgetting-game-where-the-main-character-gradually-forgets-important-information-and-abilities-if-you-take-too-long-a-break-from-playing">Ian Games Network reports</a>, the "forgetting game" is one that players would have to "play through quickly".
</p>
<blockquote>In this concept, the main character gradually forgets important information and abilities if you take too long a break from the game. For example, if you don’t play every day, the main character will gradually forget things such as “how to fire their gun or what their job is.” This forgetfulness builds up until finally the player is unable to move. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima laughs.</blockquote>
<p>What's that, you say? You already have to play through games quickly lest you forget what the heck is going on when you return to them? Yes, everyone everywhere has already had that response. I, too, can't remember the buttons anymore when I take a break from a game. I do like the idea of a Memento-style game where you have to leave notes for your in-game character before you save and quit, though. Make a wee polaroid of Peter Molyneux and write "don't believe his lies" on it.
</p>
<p>Kojima's other two concepts were: a game in which you start as a baby and gradually age over the course of playing into an old man, with an arc that includes worsening eyesight and so on (yes, yes, me too); and a game in which you're creating something that takes time to mature, such as wine or cheese, which sounds a lot like an idle game you can probably already play on Steam.
</p>
<p>Apparently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> almost had a time mechanic of its own. The protagonist was going to grow a beard that players would have to shave lest they become unkempt (YES, ME TOO), until Kojima decided that Norman Reedus was too big a star and he "didn't want to make him look uncool." You'll be able to play Reedus's statically stubbled face when On The Beach releases next month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We’ve noticed a number of suspicious websites popping up, claiming to sell Esquie plushies," the post begins. "Any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed. Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources."</p><p>However, don't let the bad news get you down too much, as the thread continued with the reveal that the team is looking into making our dreams come true with licensed plushies.</p><p>"We are looking into making official Esquie plushies, and we want to bring them to you as soon as we can," a follow-up reply states. "In the meantime, please be patient — and don’t get scammed!"</p><p>Though the team didn't elaborate on timing for any potential plushies, it's great to see Sandfall Interactive working on continuing to bring fans what they want.
