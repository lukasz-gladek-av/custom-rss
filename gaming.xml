		<p>CCP Games has shared a big update on the future roadmap for their online FPS EVE Vanguard, their latest attempt at creating a counterpart to the long-running MMO EVE Online, as the in-development game shifts from the ‘First Strike era’ to the ‘Solstice era’.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vanguard in Focus | A Future Vision" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1wrjMwUrwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>EVE Vanguard boils down to being CCP’s take on the PvPvE extraction shooter, with players dropping into the world of New Eden, scrounging for loot drops, and then trying to get out before other players steal their stuff – or trying to grab the loot that others have collected. That’s then wrapped into an overarching meta game to determine control of New Eden for factions, and with teams able to take on jobs put out there by other players.</p>
<p>The game was opened up to with private Founders’ Playtests through the First Strike era, with plenty fans of CCP’s last FPS attempt, Dust 514, getting to sample the action. The transition to the Solistice Era was marked with the introduction of a new map, the adaptive weaponry system, new tools and gadgets, new objectives and activities, and more. Through the second half of the year,&nbsp;there will be regular dev diaries and AMAs, as well as a more focused testing and development approach through the second half of this year. These efforts will culminate in a major feature update in November.</p>

<p>The aim is to gradually deepen and grow the gameplay loop within the ethos of EVE Online, to which Vanguard is an additive experience as opposed to a standalone shooter as Dust 514 was. To that end, they’re trying to deepen that link between Online and Vanguard.</p>

<p>In the fullness of time, EVE Vangard will launch into Steam Early Access, though the timing of this will be announced at a later date, and likely won’t come this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elex-and-gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down.921549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Risen&nbsp;</em>developer Piranha Bytes appears to have been shut down by parent company THQ Nordic (itself owned by Embracer Group), if a new report is to be believed.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-closed-the-end-of-the-studio-behind-gothic-risen-and-elex" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by Polish gaming news platform CD-Action</a>, the developer, which is known for mechanically clunky but ambitious RPGs like&nbsp;<em>Risen</em>,&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Elex</em>, was shut down towards the end of last month.</p>
<p>The report claims that Piranha Bytes was expecting funding to arrive from an investor for its latest project, which CD-Action says would have been a&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>-style dark fantasy RPG created in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/piranha-bytes-shut-down-rumor-elex-2.jpg?itok=DrhWH6Hr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/piranha-bytes-shut-down-rumor-elex-2.jpg?itok=usRf3ByS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect any more&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>games any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that CD-Action simply cites an anonymous "source" who is supposedly a Piranha Bytes employee, but since that employee isn't named, make sure to take this report with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>It does, however, line up with what we already know about Piranha Bytes' situation. Back in January, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-rumors-difficult-situation">described its situation as "difficult"</a>, imploring fans not to "write us off yet" with regards to an unannounced project.</p>
<p>Piranha Bytes said at the time that it would "do whatever it takes" to find a publishing and funding partner for the project, but it seems that if CD-Action's report is correct, those efforts sadly haven't borne fruit.</p>
<p>Additionally, Piranha Bytes creative director and longtime staffer&nbsp;Björn Pankratz <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced earlier today</a> that he has founded a new indie studio, Pithead, along with his wife Jennifer, although <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bj%C3%B6rn-pankratz-4b926a5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his LinkedIn page</a> still lists him as a current employee of Piranha Bytes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/thq-nordic-gothic-remake-piranha-bytes.jpg?itok=tAhUiG5h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/thq-nordic-gothic-remake-piranha-bytes.jpg?itok=1_KzQ68m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake is in the works, but it's nothing to do with Piranha Bytes.</figcaption></figure><p>If Piranha Bytes has indeed been closed, then that means the studio's final project was 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elex-2-review"><em>Elex 2</em></a>, an action RPG very much in the Piranha Bytes tradition. There are worse ways to go out, eh?</p>
<p>Of course, this won't impact the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>remake. Although Piranha Bytes was the developer for the original&nbsp;<em>Gothic</em>, the new project is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-thq-nordic-studio-alkimia-interactive-to-develop-gothic-remake">being worked on by an internal THQ Nordic studio</a> and doesn't involve Piranha Bytes.</p>
<p>We contacted THQ Nordic for further information on this story, but they refused to comment on the situation. Watch this space for more info.</p>

While we only saw about 90 seconds, fans are already incredibly stoked about what was shown and are feeling more confident in Sega’s direction for Shadow than they’ve been in over a decade.<br></p><p>The panel took place at the Los Angeles-based convention on Saturday, July 6, and was about an hour long. The presentation walked through Shadow’s history since his debut in 2001’s <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>(though it weirdly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheMrPasquale/status/1809674272765276441&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheMrPasquale/status/1809674272765276441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glossed over the series’ notorious low point</a></span>, <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Charriii5/status/1809690086218346815&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Charriii5/status/1809690086218346815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did not go unnoticed by fans</a></span>), discussed how the antihero Spawn served as an early inspiration for the character, and interestingly enough, had Thornton saying he’s learned more about Shadow in the past year than he had in the previous 14 years he’s spent playing the hedgehog.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,195207,196742" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“I’m seeing different sides of Shadow,” Thornton said. “But as far as [<em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>] goes, the cool, unflappable side [of him], there’s always been something underneath it and finally we’re starting to pull out all those things and figure out what is driving that cool, what’s driving that unflappable, what’s brewing under the service. So that’s what we’ve been getting with this game. The team has decided to let a little bit of that emotion out at times. So it was a lot of fun doing this game because playing down and then being able to erupt and let some of that emotion out that’s been brewing underneath all this time.”</p><p>Thornton took over the role of Shadow in 2010, which was long after the character’s major roles in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, <em>Heroes</em>, his self-titled game, and <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, all of which had him as a major player in the story and lore. In nearly 20 years since, Shadow has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/shadow-the-hedgehog-wasnt-an-edgelord-until-sega-made-him-one&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/shadow-the-hedgehog-wasnt-an-edgelord-until-sega-made-him-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely relegated to a side character</a></span> almost exclusively portrayed as an edgelord, with much of that complex backstory ignored. So it makes some sense that Thornton is getting the bigger picture now with <em>Sonic X Shadow Generations</em>, which Iizuka says is meant to reintroduce the character by revisiting his past ahead of the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>movie premiering on December 20.</p><p>Hearing that Thornton is getting a better understanding of the character after all this time is exciting because that gives fans hope that Shadow may once again be the antihero fans fell in love with, rather than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flanderized</a></span> caricature he’s been for more than a decade. If that testimony wasn’t enough, the clip the team showed of the <em>Dark Beginnings </em>animated miniseries sparked a lot of confidence in Shadow the Hedgehog’s future. The 90-second snippet shows what seems to be Emerl, a robot who debuted in <em>Sonic Battle</em>, attacking the space station Shadow and Maria lived on. We’ll have to wait for the series to launch later this year before we get more context, but the animation is pretty incredible, and the dialogue and cinematography are dripping with angsty melodrama. Shadow’s interaction with Maria in the clip has been especially resonant with fans, as it manages to marry his brooding demeanor with the heartfelt core that has been missing from the character for some time. The folks from Studio Giggex say the series was inspired by legendary anime like <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>,<em> </em>and will draw heavily from the established Shadow lore.</p><p>Though it was barely over a minute, the preview and panel were enough to get fans pumped up for the future of a character who has largely been done dirty for over a decade.</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on October 25. The <em>Dark Beginnings </em>animated series will be released online, but those who pre-order the game on PlayStation consoles will get extended versions of the series, as well as deleted scenes.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The most notable feature about him is his two heads, each with their own personality, so Bakool Ja Ja is sort of a two for one deal. Maybe that’s part of his charm?</p><p>In any case, Bakool Ja Ja has become the unexpected darling of <em>Dawntrail</em>—hough maybe that’s not really the best way to put it. Wuk Lamat is probably the darling of <em>Dawntrail</em> because of just how loveable that silly cat girl is, Bakool Ja Ja is the object of players’ most carnal desires. Yeah, players want him bad. Thus they have taken to social media to express their…affection for the two-headed Mamool Ja. </p><p>A common thread amongst many is just how understandable the thirst for Bakool Ja Ja is. “I can’t even judge people who want to unironically fuck Bakool Ja Ja,” writes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/lilirulu/status/1810074411627663613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/lilirulu/status/1810074411627663613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user</a></span> on X.

Here are some more thirsty posts about Bakool Ja Ja, be warned, some of these may not be strictly safe for work. Enjoy!</p><p>In summary, people are horrendously down bad for Bakool Ja Ja. If you too want to see Bakool Ja Ja in all his glory (as like a joke not because you are a monster fucker ha ha) then all you have to do is dive into the new adventure that awaits Warriors of Light in <em>Final Fantasy 14:</em> <em>Dawntrail</em>.

<p>In a new official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">blog post</a>, EA announced an extensive overhaul for the Apex Legends Battle Passes, which now abandons the in-game currency pricing option. </p>



<p>According to the post, EA says that “the decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly.” It also states that “it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.”</p>



<p>The new real-world currency pricing option for the Premium Track will be $9.99 USD. The new Premium+ Track will cost $19.99 USD.</p>



<p>Previously, players could use Apex Coins (AC) to purchase Battle Passes each season. Fans could also potentially earn enough Apex Coins in a season to pay for the next. </p>

</div></figure>







<p>Apex Legends’ Battle Passes will also be broken down into one for each seasonal split. As a result, EA plans to decrease the required level to earn all rewards, down to 60 from 110. </p>



<p>EA says this change “allows us to align seasonal progression more closely with Ranked while also increasing the value for your time.” It also means that players will need to invest real-world currency for a new Battle Pass for each split.</p>



<p>All of these updates will go into effect beginning with Season 22. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-new-season-new-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest season is Upheaval</a>, which reintroduced Solos mode and added the new legend Alter. </p>

<p>With less than 10 days until players finally have a new college football game to play in 11 years, EA Sports has released its first full look at gameplay from College Football 25.</p>



<p>Over the last several weeks, EA Sports has shown short clips of gameplay here and there. However, nothing has been clear cut as what fans got on Monday morning. </p>



<p>The video is over 20 minutes long and features a look at Michigan versus Texas as well as Michigan at Penn State. Controlling the teams are Donovan Edwards (Michigan), one of the game’s cover athletes, and creator Bordeaux (Texas &amp; Penn State). There’s also a breakdown throughout from the game’s developers.</p>



<p>You can check out the first look gameplay in College Football 25 below, and let us know your comments. Of the highlights, Edwards showed he’s just as good on the sticks as on the real field with his ability to run the ball. He ran for 160 yards on 14 attempts, scoring three times, in the first game.</p>



<p>College Football 25 launches on July 19 for Xbox Series X|S  and PlayStation 5. Those who pre-order the Deluxe edition get access three days early on July 16. If you missed it last week, EA Sports released a full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-drops-massive-deep-dive-into-dynasty-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the game’s Dynasty Mode</a>, featuring 17,000 words of information.</p>

                <p>Disney has announced a new game for iOS and Android called Disney Pixel RPG that's seemingly being released on September 9, according to the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney-pixel-rpg/id6502584695" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store's page</a>. It's a free-to-play game but in-game purchases will be available.</p><p>The story follows various Disney characters and their worlds suddenly being invaded and broken down by gooey monsters. It's up to the player to trek across these worlds and connect these worlds again. So far, the characters that have been confirmed to be in the RPG are Maleficent, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Ariel, Baymax, Genie, Aladdin, Winnie the Pooh, Aurora, and Stitch.</p><p>The gameplay itself looks like it'll have a turn-based battle system, complete with simple touch controls and an auto-play function. Additionally, players can send out their characters on expeditions while they're away from the game and bring back items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329742-pixel5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329742" data-ratio="1.3345690454124" data-width="1079" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329742-pixel5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329742"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329742-pixel5.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329743-pixel4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329744-pixel3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329745-pixel2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329746-pixe1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329743,1300-4329744,1300-4329745,1300-4329746" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4329743-pixel4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4329744-pixel3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4329745-pixel2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4329746-pixe1.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329743-pixel4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329744-pixel3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329745-pixel2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4329746-pixe1.png"></figure><p>The game's App Store pages also mentions that other Disney characters and properties will make an appearance. These include Mulan, Peter Pan, Zootopia, and The Aristocats.</p><p>The premise of Disney Pixel RPG sounds a lot like the Kingdom Hearts series, but it's a more casual and family-friendly take. However, fans of the series might have to wait as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-4-might-be-releasing-in-2025-insider-claims/1100-6523028/" data-ref-id="1100-6523028">Kingdom Hearts IV is reportedly aiming for a 2025 release</a>.

            <p>They get knocked down, but they get up again, and you’re apparently never going to keep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">Eve Online</a> studio CCP Games from trying to make an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the universe of their Excel(lent?) MMO happen. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-vanguard">EVE Vanguard</a> - the studio's admirable fourth crack at it - was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-vanguard-is-a-pvpve-shooter-set-in-the-eve-online-universe">last September</a>. Since then, it’s had several open betas and, according to a new and rather vague roadmap, should release sometime post this coming November. Here’s said infographic - more pork scratching-stained napkin scrawl than sat-nav.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>CCP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As you can see, the roadmap as it stands is effectively a yawping gap charting the time between now and the last open beta event, although there are a few details for plans (though not dates) moving forward. The wishlist includes establishing more economic links between the shooter and their long running MMO, which I still find very cool conceptually despite having no real interest in either. Also planned are more weapon customisation options, “diverse environments”, more progression options, and “expanded gameplay elements” which, y’know, you’d hope so yeah.</p>
<p>The intervening time between now and November-ish will also host a bunch of closed founder tests, culminating in a major update on the 16th of November, and dev diaries such as the below "future visions" trailer, which makes a few comparisions with CCP's previous FPS Dust 514.</p>

<p>As noted, EVE Vanguard is only the latest in a series of attempts at grafting a standalone shooter to the wildly successful and undeniably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-accidental-jump-later-one-of-eves-biggest-battles">storied</a> MMO. Dust 514 launched in 2013 for PlayStation 3, and shut down a few years later. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eve-legion-fps-announced">Project Legion</a> was announced in 2014, but never saw the light of day. In 2018, CCP were kind enough to fly me to Vegas to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-project-nova-2018">show off Project Nova</a>, but that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ccp-cancel-project-nova-but-havent-given-up-on-an-eve-online-shooter">canceled in 2020</a>. Vanguard has neither numbers or the words ‘Project’ in the title, so maybe it’ll fare better?</p>
<p>Last October, Julian Benson wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-ccp-havent-stopped-trying-to-make-an-eve-online-shooter-for-15-years">why CCP haven't stopped trying to make an EVE Online shooter for 15 years</a>. “I can’t say if Vanguard will be what the team’s looked for for so long, but it has two things going for it that give it a greater prospect of success,” wrote Benson. “EVE Vanguard is described by CCP as a module of EVE rather than its own game, not because they run in the same engine but because you launch both through the same client. CCP are trying hard to make sure even if Vanguard develops its own player base, they will be well aware of its ties to EVE Online. Secondly is the ‘vE’ in Vanguard’s PvPvE’s pitch. Even if you were the only player in the world who booted up Vanguard, there would be a game for you to play.”</p>

            <p>
Piranha Bytes, the Embracer-owned German studio behind the Gothic, Risen and ELEX series, has reportedly shut down. 
</p>
<p>
The embattled publisher Embracer had been seeking a buyer for Piranha Bytes as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">vast and brutal swathe of cost-cutting</a> that saw multiple studios shut and more than 4500 people lose their jobs - though ultimately was unsuccessful. 
</p>
<p>
Job losses at Piranha Bytes were first reported at the end of last year and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-owned-studio-piranha-bytes-acknowledges-difficult-situation-as-it-faces-potential-closure">company acknowledged earlier this year "a difficult situation"</a> as it faced potential closure. Now a fresh report today by German website <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/piranha-bytes-zukunft-bjoern-pankratz-pithead-studio,3416007.html">GameStar</a> has confirmed the studio formally shut at the end of June, with its leaders now founding a new indie studio.

<p>
Pithead Studio, as the fresh indie outfit is named, has been founded by Piranha Bytes' Björn Pankratz and Jennifer Pankratz to continue their former studio's focus on role-playing games. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, Pithead Studio officially announced its existence with a post on X, and released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCOIsrbctNM">YouTube</a> video discussing what's next.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
"We founded a new studio last Thursday named Pithead Studio," they say, explaining the name as a nod to the mine shaft entrances found in their local region. 
</p>
<p>
Details on what exactly happened in the final weeks and months of Piranha Bytes are thin on the ground, though the pair promise to explain more in further videos, set to be published on their YouTube channel each Monday.
</p>
<p>As for Embracer, meanwhile, in April the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">announced its plan to split into three companies</a>, including "Middle-earth Enterprises and Friends".</p>

			<p>A PlayStation 5 dev kit was sold online for a rather high price, and the seller had to be clever to avoid having it delisted by Sony.</p>
<p>As reported by Consolevariations on<a href="https://x.com/consolevariant/status/1808894091784245252"> X/Twitter</a>, a dev kit was recently sold for the whopping price of $6000. To avoid the item from getting delisted, the seller disguised the system as a PizzaStation 5 development kit, making fun of its V-shaped design, which was also picked on by many when the first images of the dev kit surfaced online in 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Someone sold a PS5 Dev kit as an "PlayStation Pizza kit" and it worked.. it was sold for 6K</p>
<p>High likely to avoid being delisted from Sony from selling his development kit</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PizzaStation.png"></a></figure>

<p>— consolevariations (@consolevariant) <a href="https://twitter.com/consolevariant/status/1808894091784245252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite being available only for developers, multiple PlayStation 5 dev kits have made it into the hands of regular users. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-dev-kit-design-and-features-showcased-in-new-video/">2022</a>, we also got a good look at the dev kit's unique features, which are obviously not available on the retail system.</p>
<p>Considering how many looks we have had at the PlayStation 5 dev kit, it wouldn't be surprising to get more than a few of them at the PS5 Pro dev kit. The mid-generation hardware refresh from Sony, which will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">enhanced specs, better ray tracing performance, and support for the Playstation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>, is said to be released between the end of 2024 and the first few months of 2025. With rumors abound of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-september/">PlayStation Showcase planned for September</a>, it is very likely we will finally learn more about the system in the near future.</p>

<p>Deliver Us Home is getting a new chance at life.</p>



<p>KeokeN has announced that the game, which was in development at the studio before all of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deliver-us-mars-developer-keoken-lays-off-all-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees were laid off</a> in April has been restarted. The development is being done by a “group of volunteers” with the support of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keoken/deliver-us-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">backing on Kickstarter</a>.</p>



<p>“Taking matters into our own hands again after years of pitching feels very liberating,” CEO Koen Deetman said via release, “and it has motivated us to work extremely hard over the past few weeks. We’ve been running on all cylinders to orchestrate the campaign, the trailer, and the demo that backers get to play. It truly is a token of our love and dedication to science-fiction and the craft of making video games.”</p>



<p>To go along with the Kickstarter, the team also released a prototype demo of Deliver Us Home. The Demo will become available to players in the near future after the campaign concludes.</p>



<p>As of posting, the Kickstarter, which runs until July 11, has raised $88,775 with a goal of $108,315. </p>

I am here to tell you that you should make your own pizza, even if it will never look like the ones on the cooking blogs or the ones you can buy literally everywhere, because when you make your own pizza, you can make any kind of pizza you want.</p><p>Case in point: I had to get up at 8am on a Sunday because I decided I was going to make a sourdough pizza crust and top it with squash blossom pesto, cherry tomato confit, and burrata. Sounds fancy, doesn’t it, like something you would pay a lot for at some fancy bistro. But the ingredients were easy to source at my local farmer’s market and not notably costly–burrata was even on sale at the grocery store. The only reason I had to get up so early was that the <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sourdough crust</a> takes a while to rise, but I blitzed up the <a href="https://therunawayspoon.com/2011/07/squash-blossom-pesto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pesto</a> and prepared the <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/salt-fat-acid-heat-excerpt-samin-nosrat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomatoes</a> while it rose, and then went on with my day until the pizza was ready to cook.</p><p>How was it? Well, I lost track of time during the crust’s second proof and was worried I’d ruined it, but it came out with a crispy exterior and soft interior that was a bit like focaccia, with just the right sourness. The squash blossom pesto is a great orange color, with a vegetal note that makes the pizza–dare I say–intriguing, and the tomato confit adds a bright yet tempered burst of flavor. Between the burrata and the oil from the confit, things are a bit wet; I wish it were less soggy in the middle, but I figured this would happen. (I’m not above admitting that I blotted the pizza with a ton of paper towels before putting it away.) Is it restaurant-quality? No. Is it pretty? Nope. But is it good? Yeah, man! Look how I just described a pizza I made! Who cares what it looks like?</p><p>Here is where the first barrier to homemade pizza comes in: you are probably not going to be able to make a pizza as pretty as the ones they make at restaurants. Despite considering myself a pretty solid baker, I am <em>abysmal</em> at anything involving shaping a dough. I tend to make my pizzas square, using a half sheet pan, because it’s more forgiving shape-wise. I almost <em>never</em> get it even; some spots are always too thick, and some are always too thin, and I can never figure out how far toward the edge to spread the toppings. But whatever! I have a theory that regular people, like you and me, tend to feel bad about how our cooking looks because we only see images of food made by professional chefs or bloggers. What does a pizza <em>actually</em> look like? It looks like whatever pizza you made.</p><p>The other, more challenging barrier, is that you will <em>never</em> make a pizza in your home oven as good as the ones in restaurants. Your home oven does not get hot enough evenly enough, and its actual temperature is a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2021/10/18/oven-temperature-calibrate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total mystery</a>. You could buy a standalone pizza oven, or a pizza stone, and I will totally support you in doing those things and be a bit jealous of you. But what I do is: I just cook the pizza. I know my oven’s quirks, and I’ve found that my sweet spot is to cook my pizza near the bottom of the oven at about 475 for somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes. I throw some cornmeal on my pan to keep the bottom from sticking, and I keep an eye on things near the end, sitting on the floor and staring through my oven window like I’m watching a cooking show. It doesn’t always work; bits burn sometimes, and it will never have the blistered spots and evenness of a professionally-made pizza, but these tradeoffs are worth the benefit.</p><p>And what is that benefit? It’s that you can make <em>any kind of pizza your heart desires, any time you want</em>. I cannot overstate how this will change your life. Imagine something, anything, that could conceivably be good or at least interesting on a pizza. Before, you might have scanned the menus of restaurants near you, or sighed wistfully at your dream pizza, never to be. But now, here in this blog, I give you the permission–nay, the <em>order</em>–to just go make the damn pizza. Get the ingredients, try it out, see if it works.</p><p>My very first pizza, with wild mushrooms, was a damp, tasteless disaster. But it taught me a couple things: one is that if you have wet ingredients, like mushrooms, you should cook them first. The other is to be very judicious with your cheese and sauce; you need way less than you think. You’ll feel weird about this when prepping your pizza, thinking it will be dry and dissatisfying, but trust me, it’ll be fine. Too much cheese and sauce will make your pizza a soggy bummer. Exercise restraint.</p><p>Since that first failure (which wasn’t really a failure; I ate it the next day for breakfast and it was cold breakfast pizza, God’s greatest gift), I’ve gotten better. If I’m not doing sourdough, I usually use <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-pizza-crust-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this dough recipe</a> from the ever-reliable Sally’s Baking Addiction, which has the benefit of making two crusts, so you can freeze one for later. I prefer to make my own pizza sauce, with canned tomatoes or fresh if it’s the summer, but you can also just buy some. (Bonus tip: <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/is-there-a-difference-between-pizza-sauce-and-pasta-sauce-hell-yes-257877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza sauce is different than pasta sauce</a>!) You’re also not bound by sauce: you can do pesto, as I did yesterday, or jam, or harissa, or curry, or no sauce at all.</p><p>Here are some pizzas I have made, dreamed up from the fertile wilds of my heart and the occasional recipe for inspiration:</p><ul><li><span>Brussel sprouts and veggie bacon&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Duck confit with homemade cherry barbeque sauce</span></li><li><span>Whole squash blossoms, zucchini ribbons, and burrata</span></li><li><span>Fig jam, prosciutto, and gorgonzola&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Corn and blistered shishito peppers</span></li><li><span>Mixed summer squash and heirloom tomatoes</span></li></ul><p>Do they sound good? Do they sound like folly? They are both! Not all of them were successes (the veggie bacon was a bad choice, though it was offset by the crispy brussel sprouts), but I was very happy to eat them all, because a mediocre pizza you pay for is an indignity, but one you make yourself is elevated by your labor and ambitions. Each one was a learning experience, opening the door to even bigger pizza dreams. All of them were ugly as sin, but that only matters when I post them on social media, and <em>you do not have to post photos of your pizzas on social media</em>. They can be your private pleasures; maybe ugly, maybe weird, but unique. They are <em>your pizzas</em>, invented and brought into being by you, because pizza does not belong to the fancy pizza place or the greasy dollar slice store that doesn’t sell pizza for a dollar anymore anyway. It belongs to us all.&nbsp;</p><p>Let go of your preconceived notions of who is worthy of making a pizza and who is not. You are a living being on this earth, with as much right to make a pizza upon it as anyone else. Make manifest pizzas humankind has not yet dared to dream of. The power is within you.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, director Hideki Kamiya has said. Had it been more successful, its developer Clover "would have probably continued" - rather than shutting down the following year.
</p>
<p>
Kamiya discussed the development of Okami with Ikumi Nakamura for the YouTube channel of her new studio Unseen. The pair worked together for the first time on the Zelda-like adventure game.
</p>
<p>
Okami has received plenty of cult acclaim since its release on PS2 in 2006, but was one of only a handful of games made by the Capcom-owned studio before it was dissolved.

<p>
Discussing his recipe for success, Kamiya said in the video: "There is no secret recipe". The pair agreed they haven't succeeded purely in terms of sales.
</p>
<p>
"Even Okami, did it make 150,000 units?" asked Kamiya. "The initial shipment was 90,000. It was a huge failure. If it had been successful, Clover would have probably continued."
</p>
<p>
He admitted: "For us who made it, it turned out something we can be proud of."
</p>
<p>
The pair chatted further in the video about working together, with plenty of banter and anecdotes between them.
</p>
<p>
Nakamura, for instance, recalled a party near the end of Okami's development where Kamiya said: "This team was the worst!"
</p>
<p>
Kamiya then elaborated further, explaining how Okami's development team was meant to be a "dream team" and Okami "Clover Studio's signature title". However, he described the team as a whole as "weak", due to different levels of passion from staff. Nakamura agreed and Kamiya stated he can be honest "because we're friends".
</p>
<p>
Later Kamiya said: "If [enthusiasm] had been a bit higher, Okami would have been even better. So to be honest, I'm a bit torn by the voices saying that the game is amazing."
</p>
<p>
"We could have done more," agreed Nakamura.
</p>
<p>
In another anecdote, Kamiya said Okami was originally intended to be photo-realistic, instead of the traditional Japanese art style eventually used.
</p>
<p>
"At the very beginning before you joined, we were trying to use a photo-realistic style," Kamiya told Nakamura. "But it became clear that it was impossible to create this vast natural environment on PlayStation 2."
</p>
<p>
Later in the discussion, Kamiya said he was inspired by the GameCube remake of Resident Evil Capcom was working on at the time. "When I saw that I thought the sense of realism was amazing," said Kamiya. "The level of photo-realism was very high. I thought it could be nice if we used that for something more light-hearted instead of horror."
</p>
<p>
However, once character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura created the Celestial Brush, the pieces of Okami's style and gameplay fell into place. "That Japanese touch struck a chord," said Kamiya, "so we decided to completely change the entire game."
</p>
<p>
After its initial launch in 2006, Okami was ported to the Wii with motion controls, before a HD version was released across PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC. It's become a beloved game, despite its seemingly troubled development.
</p>
<p>
Having moved on from Clover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">Kamiya left his next studio Platinum Games</a> late last year due to "issues of trust". It's unclear what he's working on next.

</p>
<p>
Nakamura, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ikumi-nakamura-unveils-first-independent-project-kemuri">unveiled her first independent project Kemuri</a> around the same time, though it's currently without a release date.

<p>There’s yet another controversy surrounding a recently released game as The First Descendent is accused of copying certain icons and even a weapon design from Destiny 2. </p>



<p>The kicker is that it’s not a clear 1-1 copy of any thing, but more of a case of making a slight change to try and make it look different.</p>







<p>The icons, which you can see courtesy of Forbes’ Paul Tassi all look a bit too similar to be merely a coincidence. On top of that, there’s also a weapon that seems to be, at the very least, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">inspired by</a> Destiny 2. It’s unclear if there are any more examples of this as only a small amount of assets have been compared. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Bungie and Nexon for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p>I’m going to be honest; I didn’t expect to enjoy Zenless Zone Zero as much as I have over the past week. I’m playing it on PC, but I thought about booting up my Xbox Series S to download the game there. Like many of you, I’m wondering whether the game is available on Xbox and, if not, then when. Is Zenless Zone Zero coming to Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-xbox">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Currently, you cannot play Zenless Zone Zero on Xbox. Unfortunately, developer HoYoverse does not officially support Xbox for any of its games. They’ve promised the community in the past that titles such as Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail would launch on Xbox Series X|S, and that day never came. Some fans continue waiting, rather impatiently, for the console launch. But it’s unlikely ever to happen.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the same is likely to occur with Zenless Zone Zero. While the studio did not state they would launch ZZZ on Xbox, it’s best not to hold up hope.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-ever-coming-to-xbox">Is Zenless Zone Zero Ever Coming to Xbox?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, there is no word on whether the gacha game is coming to Xbox Series X|S. We must assume that it’s never happening. If you’re keen on playing Zenless Zone Zero, you can do so on PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS.</p>



<p>I completely understand that, for many, a PlayStation 5 is out of the question. Even this late into its lifespan, it’s rather expensive. But there’s a chance if you have a laptop or a smartphone. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-pc-requirements-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s system requirements</a> aren’t too demanding!</p>



<hr>



<p>Most impressively, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-crosses-50-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenless Zone Zero recently crossed 50 million downloads</a>! If you’re one of those players waiting for the download to finish, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

We expect to receive a new RC, which will undergo a thorough review in August. This evaluation will determine whether we can begin the submission process and provide a solid release date, or if further issues need to be addressed.</p><p>“We understand this is disappointing, and it’s not what we had hoped for either. However, we are committed to keeping you informed throughout this development process, even if the updates aren’t always what we’d like.</p><p>“Thank you for your understanding and support.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We understand this is disappointing, and it’s not what we had hoped for either.</p></div><p>Colossal Order’s troubled city-builder sequel launched in October 2023 on PC via Steam and immediately ran into a number of issues. But Cities: Skylines 2’s problems began before its launch even arrived. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-admits-performance-issues-will-launch-the-game-anyway"><u>Colossal Order had warned players</u></a> the game would release with performance issues a week before it came out. In IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-review"><u>Cities: Skylines 2 review</u></a>, which returned a 6/10, we said: “Cities: Skylines 2 is an ambitious sequel that might have bitten off more than it can chew – be prepared to do a lot of terraforming if you don't want your metropolis to look like a nightmare.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-cities-skylines-2-players-turning-on-the-game-ceo-reveals-biggest-regret"><u>Colossal Order CEO Mariina Hallikainen later admitted</u></a> the lack of modding support was the developer’s “biggest regret.” Then, in April, Paradox was forced to offer refunds for the latest DLC, with Hallikainen and Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO of publisher Paradox, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-refunds-dlc-admits-it-rushed-it-out-and-apologizes-to-disgruntled-players">admitting the heavily criticized Beach Properties DLC was rushed out</a> in a bid to improve sentiment around the disastrous launch of Cities Skylines 2. At the time of this article's publication, more people are playing the first Cities Skylines game than its sequel on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for the console release, the plan was to release it in the spring of 2024 after missing last year's launch, but it was was delayed to October. There is no new release window. Back in April, Colossal Order and Paradox insisted that the team working on the console release operates separately from the PC development team, “so it will be progressing without splitting our focus or time.”</p><p>Missing October 2024 means Cities Skylines 2 will now launch on console over a year after it came out on PC, which was clearly not in Paradox or Colossal Order’s original plan. Meanwhile, both companies are battling a disgruntled player base by releasing updates aimed at improving the core PC version.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches with no new features or content.</p><p>“As such, I've put the game aside and don't expect to look at it again for another six months, at which point I'll probably be focused on playing something else. It's really hard to get people's attention back once you've lost it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Manor Lords Early Access Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Bender responded directly to this post by calling it “exactly the kind of distorted endless growth/burden of expectations/line must go up perspective that causes so much trouble in the games industry.”</p><p>Bender said Manor Lords sold 250,000 copies in the last month after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-sells-2-million-copies-in-just-three-weeks-exceeding-publishers-wild-hopes">selling over two million copies in its first three weeks</a>, and pointed to its ‘very positive’ Steam user review rating of 88% and its median playtime of eight hours and 48 minutes per player.</p><p>“Players are happy, the developer is happy, and we as publisher are thrilled beyond belief,” Bender said. “And yet here we are — Manor Lords is apparently a ‘case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access’ because the ‘game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches’ (one of the patch notes being called 'small' here runs over 3,000 words and over 10 single-spaced pages) leading to "concurrent users have plummeted since launch" (yes, we didn't maintain the 173,000 concurrent player peak) and the apparently dark reality that some people, after enjoying their purchase of a premium, single-player title, might decide to go on and play another game (The horror! The horror!).”</p><p>Solo developer Greg Styczeń, aka Slavic Magic, debuted Manor Lords on Steam priced $39.99 and straight into PC Game Pass in Early Access form on April 26. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-review-early-access"><u>Manor Lords Early Access review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Manor Lords is a gorgeous medieval city-builder that kept me occupied for hours building my perfect, cozy hamlets, but it definitely feels very early in its Early Access development.”</p><p>Manor Lords hit its impressive Steam peak concurrent player count two month ago, and is now sitting on 10,671 peak concurrent players in the last 24 hours. That’s not enough to make Steam’s top 100 most-played games list, but it’s not far off.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust.</p></div><p>Bender said that before Manor Lords came out, he told Styczeń to expect “all sorts of commenters talking about missed opportunities because he failed to grow as fast as they wanted, and judging the game a failure by some kind of expectation they formed.”</p><p>“I told him to ignore all that — to focus on his core vision for the game, and to keep in mind that the Early Access road is long and that he should not feel any sense of pressure from the expectations of others — for both his own health and stress levels over the coming years and for preserving the state of calm and peaceful mind that supports his creative vision.</p><p>“If this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like the below. Success should not create an ever raising bar of new growth expectations. Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust. And a release should not begin an ever-accelerating treadmill on which devs are forced to run until their mental or physical health breaks down.”</p><p>Bender’s comment drew praise from Pocketpair community chief Bucky, who called it “a fantastic response.” Pocketpair’s controversial ‘Pokémon with guns’ survival and crafting game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has itself been accused of becoming a “dead game” after peak concurrent player numbers on Steam fell dramatically following the game’s record-breaking launch earlier this year. Palworld, incidentally, is currently Steam's 14th most-played game with 110,182 peak concurrent players in the last 24 hours following the Sakurajima update in June 2024.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tim Bender, CEO of Hooded Horse, with a fantastic response to someone saying “Manor Lords is a pretty interesting case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access”.</p><p>I didn’t think Hooded Horse could get any cooler but here we are 👑 <a href="https://t.co/Rrff3UrIww" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Rrff3UrIww</a></p></div>— Bucky 🔜 BitSummit | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1810098209945166032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The “dead game” moniker is often used to describe games that have seen a fall in player numbers, but it’s also often used without context or the understanding of a developer or publisher’s metric for success. Arrowhead’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, for example, has been called a “dead game” in recent weeks because Steam peak concurrents are not what they were in the months after the game came out, but it sold well enough to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all-time.</p><p>While the live service ‘numbers go up’ burden is one that all publishers and developers who dare to enter this most crowded and competitive of markets must shoulder, when it comes to premium, single-player Early Access games made by a small team, perhaps, as Bender suggests, a new way of thinking is required.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release&nbsp;has once again been delayed, so you won't be playing this one on consoles this fall.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/console-development-status.1694383/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Paradox forums</a>, the studio says that it has "not yet met the stability and performance targets" internally set for the game's console release, which means it'll miss its previously-mooted October release window.</p>
<p>The publisher says it's making "slow but steady progress" on&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;for consoles, but that "unresolved issues" which "harm the player experience" are still hanging around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-series-release-date-delayed-greenery.jpg?itok=RoLqSJSS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-series-release-date-delayed-greenery.jpg?itok=yUpxsHCM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to arrive on consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>If all goes well, a new Release Candidate build, i.e. a build that could be suitable for release on consoles, will be submitted soon and will be reviewed in August.</p>
<p>Assuming that build is up to scratch, then the submission process will begin and a "solid release date" can be provided, but if the build doesn't pass muster, then there's a good chance the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>console release could take a while longer yet.</p>
<p>This is far from the first time&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game was originally due to arrive alongside its PC counterpart in October last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay">pushed back to spring 2024</a>&nbsp;shortly before release.</p>
<p>Following that, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">delayed further back in April</a>, and at that point, Paradox tentatively suggested that October could be the console versions' release window. However, an October release was never officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Paradox has since released a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-update-dlss-super-resolution">number of updates</a> intended to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-20-patch">address these problems</a>, although the publisher has also acknowledged that many issues remain and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">has a "mountain to climb"</a> before they're all fixed.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>won't be landing on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S any time soon, unfortunately. Until we hear more about that, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also available as part of a PC Game Pass subscription.</p>

			<p>While the Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin Lighting Engine mod has been developing since 2023, it now has <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/">NVIDIA DLAA</a> and AMD FSR Super Resolution support. Over time, it has added improvements by adding volumetric fog, ground truth ambient occlusion, and many more graphical updates to make Dark Souls 2 a more visually enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Utilizing NVIDIA DLAA or AMD FSR Super Resolution significantly reduces the number of visual artifacts (specifically, aliasing) that a player might see when exploring the Kingdom of Drangleic, making it look prettier. The author admits DLAA is the superior solution for those who can enable it (owners of RTX 20/30/40 Series GPUs).</p>
<p>The mod created by Ganaboy now has many toggle-able features to create the visual dynamic you want from the game. Whether you want the screen to be brighter or dimmer or you want to turn on HDR Monitor support, the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine Mod has plenty on offer.</p>
<p>This mod is still listed as being in the Alpha stages of creation, meaning there is plenty more on the horizon regarding technical changes to ensure the best possible environments in Dark Souls 2. However, it has already added many new fixtures to the lighting systems and better shadow casting from environmental objects.</p>
<p>This update's main focus was adding DLSS and AMD FSR Super Resolution support, which is a game-changer for many players who utilize it. However, it's also added preset selections, a huge reduction in dithering and fixing God Rays throughout the game.</p>
<p>For a full list of changes that have been added in the latest update to the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine Mod, check out <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/1146?tab=description">the Nexus page</a>, which lists all of the changes listed for each mod version.</p>
<p><iframe title="Antialiasing - LightingEngine UX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P8QdyhRvbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don't wish to utilize the DLSS/DLAA feature, even a measly GTX 1050TI graphics cards run the mod. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin is widely seen as one of the most unpopular games in the franchise, but using this mod may make all the difference and allow players to have an enjoyable experience, as the world won't seem so massively outdated.</p>
