              <p>A computer is not just a bright new device: it’s also an entrance to your entire digital life. But with that entrance comes the <strong>threat of dark unseen dangers</strong>: hackers, scams, and viruses just waiting to leap at the most inconvenient time. And with Labor Day weekend and back-to-school season already upon us, there’s no better time to lock down your digital life with strong protection that works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast is offering a fantastic deal with up to 60% off its security products</a>, making it easier than ever to secure your devices without stretching your budget. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast Premium Security is available for just $31.20 for the first year</a> ($2,60 a month) for one device. But if you’re looking to protect the whole family or all your gadgets, their 10-device plan wraps your laptops, phones and tablets under one simple subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Premium Security</a></p>

<h2>Protects Your Digital Life</h2>
<p>So, just what does Avast Premium Security do, then? It’s a lot more than your average antivirus: It prevents viruses, malware, and ransomware from causing harm. It also catches phishing scams that want you to give up sensitive information. And it blocks remote access attacks and keeps would-be digital hijackers at bay. <strong>Whether you’re buying online, streaming, banking, or just browsing</strong>, Avast Premium Security operates behind the scenes keeping everything private and secure.</p>
<p>If you desire the ultimate peace of mind, Avast Ultimate is where it’s at – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">and it’s currently on sale at $3.67 per month (60% off)</a>. You get all Premium Security features, plus Avast SecureLine VPN which keeps your internet connection safe and your identity hidden (just the thing when you’re browsing public Wi-Fi). And then there’s Cleanup Premium which streamlines and optimizes your PC by deleting junk files and speeds things up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Ultimate</a></p>
<p>So the choice between Premium Security and Ultimate ultimately comes down to what you’re looking for: For superb malware, ransomware, and phishing protection, Premium Security is sufficient. But if you also want extra privacy, advanced device cleaning, and VPN protection, Ultimate offers those extras in one powerful bundle. No matter your choice, Avast is a security leader you can trust and protects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. Those days of the “free antivirus” are over—it’s an entire suite of tools for today’s world of connectivity.</p>

Autumn approaches, but we have one more summer month to look back on in this edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a>!</p>
<p>August has been a bountiful one, with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-august-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Indie World</a> dropping some surprise hits and announcements. So there's been plenty to chew on alongside a couple of Nintendo highlights.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, let's remind you of the rules: Nintendo Life writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop exclusives for the month, from a list of games that we've reviewed. Afterwards, those games are scored (1 getting the most points, 3 the least) and tallied to determine the top three for the month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067sihvnl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We've got a lot to get through, so let's not dilly-dally any longer.</p>

<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>We've got a familiar story again this month: a certain ninja is missing in action. This time it's Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, as Switch codes were only sent out on the game's release date. You'll have to stay tuned for the verdict on that one.</p>
<p>Still, we have <em>14 games</em> to choose from in total — an Indie World will do that to you! All of the below scored at least a 7/10 with us, so let's have a look at what just missed out on the top three.</p>

<p>Just one of the many shadow drops we saw during Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> sees you as the manager of a dinky little bookshop on wheels by the ocean. Pure bliss, right?</p>
<p>Well, because you're on wheels, you can park your little store wherever you want around the town of Bookstonbury. You get to decorate your wagon and choose just what books you can sell — oh, and every single book in-game is a real novel, so it might even inspire you to read.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop">We scored Tiny Bookshop a nice 8/10</a> — it's extremely satisfying, pleasant, and just a feel-good game all-round.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">2nd Place - Roadwarden</a></h2>
<p>Well, this one crept up on us out of nowhere. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a> was announced just a week ahead of its release, and this award-winning text-based RPG lived up to the hype. It launched on PC back in 2022 and fans have been raving about it ever since. We can see why.</p>
<p>Incredible writing and lovely, simple pixel art help to illustrate a beautiful journey to the peninsula, layered with mysteries and choices that shape your experience. If you love storytelling, this is a must play.</p>
<p>We're so glad more people can experience this one, so check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/roadwarden">our 9/10 review</a> to see why we loved it so much.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">1st Place - UFO 50</a></h2>
<p>When Mossmouth's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> shadow-dropped at the end of the Indie World Showcase earlier in August, we were elated. We'd been asking for this one since we played it at Summer Game Fest 2024 and we watched longing as the game racked up rave reviews on Steam. Fortunately, we had to wait less than a year.</p>
<p>UFO 50 is magical and a must-play experience for anyone who's grown up with video games. The craft and curation that's gone into the whole experience, from the variety of games the fictional story of UFO Soft. And yes, there really are 50 individual games in one package here.</p>
<p>So, congrats to Mossmouth — and UFO Soft — for winning eShop Selects with UFO 50 this month! For those who have yet to dive in, have a read of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/ufo-50">our glowing 9/10 review</a>.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-august-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/heres-morrowind-running-elden-ring-engine/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-morrowind-running-in-the-elden-ring-engine-because-why-not.1285050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Here's something I really wasn't expecting to write about: YouTuber and modder InfernoPlus has successfully ported The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine.</p>



<p>Originally, InfernoPlus had planned to port Morrowind to Dark Souls 1, then shifting to Dark Souls 3 and eventually to Elden Ring. Not only is FromSoftware's latest game a better title in every regard, including fidelity and gameplay, but its (entirely unofficial and user-made) modding tools have also greatly matured to the extent of making even such a gargantuan undertaking possible.</p>



<p>InfernoPlus said he has been working on the project for quite a while and is now roughly halfway done, but also admitted it's hard to say with any accuracy at this point. The modder said world generation is finished, and lighting and world effects are nearly there, although some lighting processing is still needed.</p>



<p>Interiors are also basically finished, while dialogue generation still must have its scripting data loaded. Voice acting will be added toward the end of the mod's development. However, NPCs, be they animals or humanoids, still have to be properly converted: right now, they're either Elden Ring's default girl (for humanoids) and goats (for animals).</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="I ported Morrowind to Elden Ring" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n89NFtIUWDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the video, InfernoPlus also touches on the inevitable copyright question, stating that the project cannot possibly violate any laws, as it does not include any Morrowind data. It requires the user to have that Morrowind data installed with a legitimate copy of the game, similar to A Tale of Two Wastelands, which combines Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in a single game while requiring both games. This Morrowind port to the Elden Ring engine is also open source, by the way.</p>



<p>The modder then requested the community's help to keep going. InfernoPlus has a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/infernoplus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon page</a> where fans can support his work, but beyond that, the project could also use more expertise in certain areas. Between this and <a href="https://wccftech.com/skywind-gets-new-gameplay-demo-and-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skywind</a>, Morrowind fans have two total conversion mods to look forward to. There's also the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind-path-tracing-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Morro RTX mod</a> that aims to take the original game and significantly boost its visuals with the help of NVIDIA RTX Remix. This mod is, however, still in its infancy.</p>

<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7ac80d9c62954/harvest-moon-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Last time</a>, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chibi_robo_park_patrol">Chibi-Robo: Park Patrol</a>, in celebration of the launch of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">original game</a> on NSO for Switch 2. And let's be honest, we all knew which would win this one. Yes, with 77% of the vote, the far superior US variant won in a landslide. Good job.</p>
<p>This week, we're going all the way back to the SNES to check out the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/harvest_moon">Harvest Moon</a>. Released in 1996, it would go on to spawn an enduring franchise that, since 2014, is now known as Story of Seasons. Yes, Harvest Moon still exists, but it's a whole different thing now... Long story.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6rwhqmo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Anyway, it's a three-way brawl this week between North America, Europe, and Japan, so strap yourselves in folks; it's gonna be a belter.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:33221 @ 1756644620 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/399e3e3ee4df2/harvest-moon-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/1821-harvest-moon13-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Natsume / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so this first one seems to be your pretty traditional Harvest Moon box art, showcasing the protagonist over on the right surrounded by a bunch of adorable creatures, and a typical farmyard setting in the background. It's simple, effective, and just... nice!</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a7a751d2f63f3/harvest-moon-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/1821-harvest-moonils/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Natsume / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ooh gosh, this is a real vibe, huh? Ditching the cartoon-y aesthetic for a slightly more realistic take, we've got a lovely landscape image of a farmer with his trusty doggy along with a cow and a horse. The figures look almost silhouetted against the gorgeous moonlight, and we love the blue/purple gradient used for the night sky.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Harvest Moon - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1e23ec56f90f1/harvest-moon-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/images/1821-harvest-moon">Natsume / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach is similar to North America's, utilising the same main image of the protagonist and surrounding animals, albeit flipped. The portrait orientation means this can be placed front and centre with the game's title sitting just above. The background is gorgeous too! Man, this will be a tough one...</p>

<p>Gearbox has shared a roadmap of what's coming to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in the "first few months" of its life.</p>
<p>This includes free and paid DLC content. After the launch, there's going to be some free content featuring new weapons, cosmetics and more, and then there'll be the first paid Bounty Pack. This follows with another dose of free content and after this in Q1 2026, there'll be <em>another</em> paid Bounty Pack DLC.</p>
<p>From here, there's a paid Story Pack, and beyond Q1 2026, there'll be more Bounty Packs, another Story Pack and "more". There'll even be weekly challenges along the way. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The team at Gearbox is already hard at work on a Vault-load of post-launch content—including lots of new story content and two new Vault Hunters—and in-game events that will keep your adventures on Kairos going strong!</p>
<p>"For now, as we prepare to wreak havoc against the tyrannical Timekeeper as one of four badass new Vault Hunters, we hope the roadmap above offers an exciting sense of what's incoming after launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launched a few days ago on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Developed by Virtuos, the remake of MGS3 is powered by Unreal Engine 5 but lacks a few features that PC gamers have come to expect lately.</p>



<p>For example, the game uses Software Lumen for global illumination, but there's a way to enable Ray Traced Lumen for better visual results, albeit at a performance cost. YouTuber MxBenchmarkPC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF8w8pkeaw4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided the guide</a> on how to:</p>



<p><em>Go to AppData\Local\MGSDelta\Saved\Config\Windows and open the Engine.ini file. Then, add the following commands to the bottom of the Engine.ini file:<br>[SystemSettings]<br>r.Lumen.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.ScreenProbeGather.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.LumenScene.DirectLighting.HardwareRayTracing=1<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.MaxRoughnessToTrace=0.6<br>r.Lumen.Reflections.MaxRoughnessToTraceForFoliage=0.6</em></p>



<p>For even better ray tracing fidelity, Ray Reconstruction can be enabled with:</p>



<p><em>r.NGX.DLSS.denoisermode=1</em></p>



<p>To get NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation, add these commands:</p>



<p><em>r.Streamline.DLSSG.Enable=1<br>t.Streamline.Reflex.Enable=1<br>t.Streamline.Reflex.Mode=1</em></p>



<ol></ol>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Delta Hardware RT Lumen vs Software - Ray Tracing Comparison | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QF8w8pkeaw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It is indeed a bit weird that all these commands just work in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, and yet there is no way to enable them through regular settings. </p>



<p>Anyway, the game does take a slight hit (around five to six frames per second on an RTX 5080) when enabling Hardware RT Lumen, though DLSS Frame Generation more than makes up for it. With DLSS set to Performance, the RTX 5080 used in the test runs around 105 FPS. Of course, having access to Multi Frame Generation would accelerate performance even further. It is likely modders will find a way to get it working soon. By the way, you will need the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-mod-critical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frame rate unlock mod</a>, as Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is by default locked to 60 FPS on PC.</p>



<p>Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our PS5 review</a> to find out what Kai Tatsumoto thought about this remake:</p>



<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the de facto perfect way to experience the rise and fall of Big Boss. Each detail has been meticulously refined and brought to modern standards while leaving nothing behind in the past. While this also means retaining both the campiness and jank, there’s no better way to experience the first Metal Gear Solid title in the timeline.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/donk-elo-might-not-matter-cs2-esports-pros/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cs2%E2%80%99s-donk-explains-what-gets-esports-players-into-the-pro-leagues.1285011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets is one of the most popular Counter-Strike players in the world right now. His meteoric rise to fame began just a couple of years ago, and in the last 18 months, he has become one of the winningest players in the CS2 space.</p>



<p>Recently, donk offered up a home truth, explaining how esports players are more likely to ‘make it’ if they have the right attitude. He stressed that Elo isn’t the best representation of a pro player’s stature, and it shouldn’t be relied on when making decisions as a scout.</p>



<h2 id="h-elo-might-not-matter-in-cs2">Elo Might Not Matter in CS2</h2>



<p>In a statement captured by <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/71528-donk-getting-into-esports-directly-depends-on-dedication-and-persistence-not-on-some-metrics-like-elo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a>, Team Spirit’s Danil ‘donk’ Kryshkovets explained what it takes to get into the pro leagues as an esports competitor:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The chances of getting into esports directly depend on dedication and persistence, not on some metrics like Elo. You can have a lot of Elo at 13, but stagnate and not develop for four years. Then no one will need you.&nbsp;Zweih&nbsp;had two thousand Elo in 2023, when I had 5k. Two years later, we ended up on the same team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an earlier interview, donk revealed that his Counter-Strike approach is built mostly around instinctive actions, which require a high level of self-trust and confidence in decision-making.</p>



<p>It’s certainly something to take away for the average esports aspirant, as donk has had a staggering year in the Counter-Strike 2 space.</p>



<p>Since early 2024, donk has exploded, picking up wins at various top-tier tournaments:</p>



<ul>
<li>February 2024 – IEM Katowice</li>



<li>June 2024 – BLAST Premier Spring Final</li>



<li>September 2024 – BetBoom Dacha Belgrade</li>



<li>December 2024 – Perfect World Shanghai</li>



<li>January 2025 – BLAST Bounty Spring</li>



<li>May 2025 – PGL Astana</li>



<li>August 2025 – IEM Cologne</li>
</ul>



<p>He’s fast becoming one of the most recognizable names in Counter-Strike, and he insists that players should stop focusing so heavily on Elo. It was mere weeks ago that he secured MVP in Cologne at one of the most prestigious events in the business, so he knows something.</p>



<p>Do you think donk is right? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-champions-2025-bundle-revealed-riot/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Riot Games has unveiled the VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle, including skins for the Vandal and a gorgeous Butterfly Knife. For the first time, the VALORANT Champions bundle will feature a Flex item, which is a neat replication of the VAL Champs trophy that is believed to interact with the leaderboard for each match a player appears in.</p>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle also includes, as expected, a spray, player card, and gun buddy.</p>



<p>Check out the entire bundle below and find out when it’s coming to the VALORANT store.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-valorant-champions-2025-bundle-coming-to-the-store">When is the VALORANT Champions 2025 Bundle Coming to the Store?</h2>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle will be added to the VALORANT store on September 4, and the bundle will remain live until October 9, 2025. This is a long enough window for any VALORANT esports fans to show their appreciation for the tournament by securing the bundle.</p>



<p>But how much will the VALORANT Champs bundle cost this year? The price hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s <strong>expected </strong>to cost around 6,100 VALORANT Points (VP). That’s around $65 USD in real-world money.</p>



<p>True esports fans will recognize that a portion of that price tag goes to the team partnered with Riot Games in the VCT circuit, so it might seem like a lot, but you’re paying a little something in the pockets of the players you love.</p>



<p>The VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle was revealed by Riot Games with a short, one-minute trailer on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Both the VAL Champs Vandal and the Butterfly Knife look fantastic in the new bundle, boasting exclusive gold trim that shimmers and shines as you dominate the game.</p>



<p>This year’s VALORANT Champions tournament will take place in Paris from September 12 to October 5, and it’s toting a $2.25 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Do you think you’ll part ways with $65 to secure the VALORANT Champions 2025 bundle? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eric ‘ConcernedApe’ Barone has confirmed that Stardew Valley will get a 1.7 update, even as he works tirelessly to bring Haunted Chocolatier to life. This announcement came on social media with a charming graphic, and while it was revealed, Barone stressed that there’s ‘no release date, no estimate’ for the 1.7 Stardew Valley update.</p>



<p>It has been more than a year since the 1.6 update for Stardew Valley, which introduced new items, festivals, and various graphical improvements, was released on all platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-stardew-valley-getting-any-more-updates">Is Stardew Valley Getting Any More Updates?</h2>



<p>The running belief was that Eric ‘ConcernedApe’ Barone was <strong>finished </strong>with Stardew Valley updates as he started work on Haunted Chocolatier, his first new game in <strong>years</strong>. Following the rampant and wildfire success of Stardew Valley, one of the highest-rated and best-selling indie games of all time, Barone is looking to move to pastures new.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, Barone confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat’s out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update. No release date, no estimate. But it’s happening.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The image he used for the announcement was fantastic:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Stardew Valley has been around since 2016, and in July, it shattered a Steam record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-smashes-steam-record-portal-2/">held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years</strong></a><strong> </strong>by becoming the platform’s top-rated game. As I write this, 98% of the nearly half a million reviews of Stardew Valley are positive, which effortlessly dominates every other game on the Steam platform.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, Steam hosts more than 130,000 games.</p>



<p><span>Currently, we have no information&nbsp;<strong>on&nbsp;</strong>what the Stardew Valley 1.7 update will entai</span>l. Given the track record for ConcernedApe, it’s safe to assume it’ll be sizable, but the solo developer is tied up with Haunted Chocolatier, so who knows?</p>

<p>Although there's currently "no release date" and "no estimate" about when it could arrive, and it's not been revealed what will specifically be added to this next major update, this news already has the Stardew Valley community buzzing.</p>
<p>The last big update for Stardew Valley was the 1.6 update (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/stardew-valley-version-1-6-is-finally-out-now-on-switch">which arrived on the Switch in November last year</a>). It added multiple new festivals and events, a new farm type, and much more content and improvements. Following this update, multiple other patches were also released, improving and adding to the overall experience.</p>
<p>In an interview earlier this year, Barone was asked about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/stardew-valley-creator-open-to-sequel-but-admits-updates-are-much-easier">chances of a sequel to Stardew Valley</a>, and admitted at the time it was "much easier" to just update the existing gameplay and systems.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-has-a-huge-surplus-of-bose-tv-speakers-so-its-selling-them-now-for-peanuts-2000621690</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-a-huge-surplus-of-bose-tv-speakers-so-it%E2%80%99s-selling-them-now-for-peanuts.1284888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is shaking things up this Labor Day weekend, going after all the big names – and Bose is no exception. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your audio setup, now’s a great moment to jump in: The Bose TV Speaker, which <strong>works as both a soundbar for your TV and a simple living room speaker</strong><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">, is down to just $163 on Amazon (41% off)</a>. Considering that it normally retails for $279, that is a huge discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is designed to<strong> improve the audio from your TV without the bulk of standard soundbars</strong>. It’s simple to hook up with HDMI-ARC, so installation is fast and hassle-free. The HDMI-ARC (Audio Return Channel) permits the soundbar to both transmit and receive audio via the same cable as video, less cord clutter and neater installation. <strong>And it has Bluetooth</strong>, so listening to music or podcasts from your phone or tablet is ridiculously easy and wireless.</p>
<p>Another of the first things you’ll notice about this soundbar is just how evenly balanced and clean-sounding its sound is. Bose engineered it to maximize conversation clarity which is a big plus if you catch yourself from time to time having trouble hearing every word or being drowned out by other sounds when you watch TV. The speaker’s voice-centric design is made to prioritize voices without comprising the depth of your go-to TV movies or shows.</p>
<p>The speaker uses proprietary drivers and proprietary digital signal processing to deliver clear sound that fills the room beyond your TV’s built-in speakers. Bass is unexpectedly strong for something this compact, providing kick to action flicks and music rhythms without distortion, making it a more immersive experience. You feel the actual sense you’re bringing your entertainment to the next level without complicated setups or humongous speakers.</p>



<p>Compact and slim, the Bose speaker just sits on a shelf or TV stand without wasting space or being in the way of your room’s decor. Its black veneer adds a touch of modern sophistication. It can also sit flat on your TV or be mounted on the wall using the included mounting bracket with some adjustability to fit your living room.</p>
<p>The <strong>attached remote control</strong> is another thoughtful touch: It allows you to easily control your sound level, bass, and whatnot, without having to search through a bunch of devices just to get your sound in balance.</p>
<p><span>This is a great opportunity to treat your home audio to an affordable boost this Labor Day weekend.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Post-Launch Roadmap Reveals The Return Of Something Fans Loved From Borderlands 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-the-return-of-something-fans-loved-from-borderlands-2.1284876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a couple weeks before launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> has announced its post-launch roadmap for free updates and paid DLC throughout the next six months and it’s a lot. But one of the smaller details fans were surprised to see is the return of Pearlescent weapons and shields from <em>Borderlands 2</em>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/post-launch-roadmap/?linkId=856235028">rundown of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s end-game</a> arrived alongside a developer panel at PAX West walking fans through how the XP-based loot grind will work this time around. The game’s first paid bounty pack arrives in the fall with new missions, a new boss fight, and a slew of Legendary gear and fresh cosmetics. There will also be Vault Cards that let players grind to unlock extra rewards, including gear that can keep being re-rolled until players find the version that fits their build.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000621710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621710"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621710">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>But the big update is <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s first paid Story Pack coming in early 2026. It’ll feature a new Vault Hunter, a mini-story campaign, new area to explore, and another trove of collectibles. It’s a cosmic-horror-themed expansion based around Mad Ellie, a Pandoran mechanic who happens to be Moxxi’s daughter. Some other past characters will be returning as well, with a second Story Pack following later in the year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em>‘s Pearlescent drops are back</h2> <p>There are plenty of free updates sprinkled in between each DLC, but the biggest will arrive alongside Bounty Pack 2 in early 2026. It adds the Pearlescent rarity to the game, something fans have been begging to be brought back from<em> Borderlands 2</em> after it was dropped for <em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p> <p>These drops are essentially like ultra-rare drops with unique gimmicks. When they arrived in <em>Borderlands 2</em> they didn’t make or break builds. There were more like Shinies from <em>Pokémon</em> than <em>Diablo’</em>s Uniques, sought after as prizes rather than the deadliest tools in the game. <em>Borderlands 4</em> might change that this time around, however. “Pearlescent gear drops will be incredibly difficult to find, but their power level will match their coveted rarity,” writes Gearbox.</p>

 <h2>Where are <em>Borderlands 3</em>‘s Takedowns?</h2> <p>A returning feature the studio hasn’t mentioned yet are Takedowns. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3s-next-big-expansion-will-be-a-western-1843586642">These free updates for <em>Borderlands 3</em></a> were raid-boss-adjacent endgame modes that were designed to push squads of players to the breaking point with their difficulty. Gearbox hasn’t mentioned them by name yet, thought it has mentioned Invincible Bosses coming in a future free update for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>“Think of them as bosses on steroids: new unique mechanics, massive health pools (not literally invincible, but close to it), extremely lethal attack damage, and other new modifiers that can make quick work of any unprepared Vault Hunters,” the new announcement reads. The first of these will drop before the end of 2025. Weekly big encore boss fights, wildcard missions, and Maurice’s Black Market Machine are all coming after launch as well.</p> <p>If <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s base campaign can deliver a better story than <em>Borderlands 3</em> and make good on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064">promised variety, variability, and build-crafting depth</a> of the new Vault Hunters, the post-launch roadmap definitely looks like it will be showering players with all of the content they’ll want in the endgame. Those are two big ifs. But with <em>Destiny 2</em> currently spiraling and <em>Diablo 4</em> still awaiting its next big expansion, I’m as primed for some fresh, smooth-brained loot chasing as I’ll ever be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-battlestate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-by-battlestate-games.1284873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games, the developer behind the legendary extraction shooter, Escape from Tarkov, has teased the game being released on Steam at some point. The thinly-veiled nod came from Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, as well as the official BSG social channels earlier today.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov: Arena came to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Epic Games Store</a> earlier this year, but Escape from Tarkov has never been accessible anywhere other than directly from Battlestate Games and through a proprietary launcher.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-tarkov-coming-to-steam-soon">Is Tarkov Coming to Steam Soon?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Nikita Buyanov, arguably the face of Escape from Tarkov, posted a cryptic GIF of a man jetting ‘steam’ from an iron. This was followed up by the Battlestate Games team publishing a simple post featuring a single emoji – <strong>a steam cloud</strong>.</p>











<p>One social user noted that the above GIF appears in the top five listed when you search for ‘Steam’.</p>



<p>It’s entirely open to interpretation and conjecture, but it’s almost certainly not anything other than a Steam release. In November, Escape from Tarkov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">will graduate to a 1.0 state</a> after being in a beta state since 2017. It’s the ultimate step for Escape from Tarkov, and it’s one that Battlestate Games has spent a decade preparing for.</p>



<p>It makes complete sense for Escape from Tarkov to diversify its reach and deploy on other launchers and storefronts moving forward, especially as it’s finally being released as a ‘full game’.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this is completely unconfirmed at present, and I’ve reached out to Battlestate Games to try and get a little clarification on what the posts might mean. Stay tuned!</p>



<p>Would you like to see Escape from Tarkov on Steam? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Just months after revealing there'd be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more Stardew Valley updates until Haunted Chocolatier released</a>, creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has confirmed that another update is coming to the fan-favourite farming sim.</p>
<p>Addressing fans at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">Stardew Valley Symphony of Seasons concert</a> in Seattle, Barone himself took to the stage and revealed a "secret" to the excited attendees.</p>

<p>As posted to TikTok by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jillbobagginz/video/7544281610573630734">jillbobagginz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-another-update-is-coming-symphony-of-seasons-concert/">FRVR</a>), Barone said: "After that [last 1.6] update, I was thinking, 'I don't know if I’m going to make another update'. But I wanted to share something with you tonight, it's kind of a secret… there's going to be another update."</p><p>We don't know any details yet, of course, let alone timescales, but it's great news to Stardew fans nonetheless, given Barone revealed in April that Stardew "pulls [him] away from devoting all [his] time to Haunted Chocolatier," the follow-up game he's also currently working on. Quite how this new update will impact the development of Haunted Chocolatier – if at all – remains to be seen, though.</p>
<p>Pixelated farming sim Stardew Valley first debuted almost a decade ago, and has since gone from strength to strength. Last year, Barone released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status, introducing a vast number of features to the base game such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations, and turtle pets</a>.</p>
<p>As of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales and though there's been a handful of crossovers with other games during that time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creator-of-stardew-valley-doesnt-charge-for-collabs-with-other-games-does-it-to-please-players">Barone recently revealed he's never made any money directly from in-game collaborations</a>.</p>

              <p><em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2-karl-urban-johnny-cage-first-trailer-1851786495">was set to hit theaters</a> on October 24, just a week before Halloween. It seemed like good timing for a hyper-violent video game classic about warriors fighting horrors from other dimensions. Apparently Warner Bros. disagreed. The studio has now delayed the sequel by nearly seven months because it thinks the corny fist-fest can make more money in the spring.</p> <p>That’s according <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">to <em>Deadline</em></a>, which reported the news late on Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend. It claims “research screenings have been strong” and that Warner Bros. didn’t want to bury its latest video game adaptation in a “crowded late October frame” between<em> Springsteen Deliver Me From Nowhere</em> and <em>Regretting You</em>.</p> <p>So instead, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> will now come out on May 15, 2026.<em> Avengers: Doomsday</em> was originally set to open that month but was pushed back to December of next year. The only real competition will be <i>The Mandalorian and Grogu</i>, which arrives at the end of next May. So even if <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> ends up having a surprisingly long tail, it’ll probably get kicked out of most theaters by<em> Star Wars</em>.</p> <p>The sequel brings in<em> The Boys</em>‘ Karl Urban as the shade-wearing, split-kicking Johnny Cage and its July trailer looked decent. If it has the budget to double-down on some of the big spectacle fight sequences the 2021 reboot was missing, it could be fun, though I still think its cheesy gore-fest sensibility was a great fit for Halloween. I don’t usually like slasher movies but I’ll make an exception if Scorpion’s the one doing the impaling.</p>

As expected, the leaks are coming thick and fast. The most recent leak is of Operation Firestorm, a map that was first featured in Battlefield 3.</p>



<p>You can watch some of the gameplay footage below:</p>

<p>Operation Firestorm is currently the only named remade map to be featured in Battlefield 6, but other maps, including the highly popular Operation Metro, are most certainly going to make a return during the game’s life cycle.</p>

<p>Other leaks from the Battlefield Labs playtests are also coming in thick and fast, including the addition of the server browser in Battlefield Portal. As of the time of writing, the developers have only committed to bringing the server browser to Portal and will leave standard multiplayer for standard matchmaking. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-with-silksong-more-questions-than-answers.1284819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has a lot in common with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> Fans have been waiting on it for years. Each new crumb of information is quickly devoured. Competitors are <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">scrambling out of the way</a>. And after years of fermenting hype, the most wishlisted game on Steam now has to deliver something bigger than the all-consuming cultural distortion field surrounding it. No small task. I’ve now played 15 minutes of the final demo and I still could not tell you which way it’s going to go. That’s because everything that can make a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em> truly pop is precisely what Team Cherry is keeping most under wraps.</p> <p>I played the Gamescom 2025 build of <em>Silksong</em> on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld during a PAX West-adjacent event at Microsoft and it felt like eating a Dunkin Donuts Munchkin: easy, sweet, and over way too soon. That’s by design. Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">said in a recent interview</a> that the game took seven years to make because of all of the new areas, characters, and secrets it wanted to pack into the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel. And it also clearly didn’t want to ruin any of those things by actually talking about them before the game’s September 4 release date on PC and console, or by showing them off ahead of time in the demo.</p> <p>The only portion of<em> Silksong</em> that anyone has played so far takes place near the beginning of the game. Hornet, the new protagonist, awakes in an underground glen full of bright moss and easy enemies. A short platforming section introduces players to the familiar <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired combat (you need to deal damage to get health back) and the game’s exploration which has you exhausting dead-ends until you find the path forward. It wraps with a simple mini-boss fight that’s intent on scaring any newcomers away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000621699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621699"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621699">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second section takes you to smoldering caverns with more deadly enemies to navigate. Ensembles of flying, fire-ball-spitting wizards and knights with big shields make you work to survive and gesture toward the ambient, elevated threat level that fills each path you choose to go down with just the right amount of tension.</p> <p>This is all classic <em>Hollow Knight</em> so far. The only thing that really sets<em> Silksong</em> apart in the demo is Hornet. The character’s a bit faster, has a down diagonal attack to speed up aerial recoveries, and can heal more quickly but only after more energy is gathered from dealing damage. It’s a different, more aggressive flow than the original game’s, and could take on an even more distinct identity once players start unlocking their full arsenals.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> really cost $20?</h2> <p>All of which is to say that while there were certainly no red flags in my brief hands-on time with <em>Silksong</em>, it’s impossible to know from the 15-minute demo whether <em>Silksong</em> can deliver on what fans have been hoping for over the last eight years. It’s slick and prettier than the original, but what will ultimately matter is the cleverness of its secrets, exploration, and later-game boss fights. One other bit of potential good news ahead of the game’s launch next week is that it might not be very expensive either.</p> <p><em>Hollow Knight</em> launched for just $15 back in 2017. You can currently buy it on PC for just half that price leading up to the sequel’s release (act now and you&nbsp;<em>might</em> be able to beat it in time). <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">A leak yesterday</a> on the GameStop website suggested <em>Silksong</em> will be $20, only $5 more than its predecessor at a time when Team Cherry easily could have charged $30 or more. The store listing has since been taken down and might have just been a speculative placeholder.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">According to <em>Dealabs</em>‘</a> own leak, the $20 price for <em>Silksong</em> on PC is accurate. No physical editions of the game have been confirmed yet, however.</p> <p>All eyes will be on Steam for when the actual price drops. So far Team Cherry hasn’t actually confirmed how much it will cost. Like almost everything else about the game, the small indie team is keeping that close to the vest. Not that it will matter. Just like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">lack of reviews ahead of launch</a>, <em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have to play by conventional rules. It’s in a league of its own. In less than a week we’ll finally know if it truly belongs there.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg.1284792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played more than a few role-playing games, you’ll know how your hero's journey typically plays out. In the prologue, a terrible thing will happen – an event that demands you move quickly to prevent an apocalypse or defeat an all-encompassing evil. In the following hours, you’ll spend 90% of your time completely ignoring that impending threat, instead helping randomers you met in the pub and collecting loot from dungeons. That’s okay, though, because the big bad will always wait for you. The world perpetually teeters on the brink of extinction until you’re ready to fix it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not so in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, the first RPG from Rebel Wolves, a new studio founded by former CD Projekt Red staff. Its campaign puts you on a clock: you have 30 days and 30 nights to save your family from evil vampires. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That hold-on-while-I-do-a-thousand-side-quests meme “was definitely one of the reasons” for this interesting approach, creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz says with a smile. “I wouldn't say it was the sole reason, but I would say this was definitely a starting point for a conversation.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To properly understand that time pressure system, it’s best to start with how The Blood of Dawnwalker’s campaign is structured. Dubbed a “narrative sandbox,” it doesn’t follow a linear sequence of events. There’s no quest one, quest two, quest three and so on.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After the prologue, you can go directly to the castle. You could try to rescue your family immediately,” explains Tomaszkiewicz. “There's a variety of quests you can participate in. You can ignore them, or you can do them. There are a lot of activities that are directly targeted against [main villain] Brencis that will weaken him, for example, and make the attack easier. But at any point you can decide, ‘Okay, I've got enough, I'm going to the castle, I'm going to do it.’” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If The Blood of Dawnwalker was a book, then, you’d read the first chapter and then would be free to skip directly to the end. As for the optional chapters between those two points, you can read them in any order… but you’ll need to find the pages first. “You are not railroaded into these plotlines,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. “You have to find them [in the world] on your own. We do leave breadcrumbs of course, but we want to make sure that it doesn't feel like ‘These are the three plotlines, do them and then go there,’ right? We wanted to enhance the feeling of exploration and finding these stories in the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to the time system. You have 30 days and 30 nights to explore Vale Sangora, a 14th-century kingdom nestled in the Carpathian Mountains, and undertake as many (or as few) of those plotlines as you want. That time element evolved out of Dawnwalker’s protagonist, Coen. A man suffering from both silver poisoning <em>and</em> a vampiric curse, he lives as a mortal during the day and becomes a blood-sucker at night. “The time passage was kind of central to the character,” Tomaszkiewicz notes, especially since your vampiric abilities allow for a very different, more supernatural playstyle after dark. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Blood of Dawnwalker - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A Clock That Never Ticks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most important thing to know is that there is no real-time ticking clock in The Blood of Dawnwalker. The minutes do not start counting down from the moment you start a new game. This is not Majora’s Mask or Outer Wilds. “We were thinking that if time would flow naturally, it might be quite unpleasant. The playstyle would change on the go [from human to vampire and back to human] constantly without your input,” explains Tomaszkiewicz. “So that's where the time as a resource idea came in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s best to think of time in The Blood of Dawnwalker as a currency rather than a stopwatch. A bar, split into eight sections and displayed in the upper-right of the screen, represents your daily allowance of that currency. Performing significant actions marked with an hourglass icon, such as completing objectives or engaging in certain conversations, will “spend” a section of the bar. Similar to Deathloop, then, simply exploring or completing lower-level tasks will not progress time. Theoretically, you could stay in the noon period of the seventh day for dozens of in-game hours, provided you don’t do anything marked with that hourglass symbol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rebel Wolves is very excited about the way time has shaped The Blood of Dawnwalker’s choices and quest design (of which you can learn more about in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-offers-2-very-different-rpg-playstyles">our recent preview</a>), Tomaszkiewicz is aware that many people will be skeptical of the system. “I know there are a lot of players that are afraid of missing out, so we definitely tried to not cut off too much content,” he explains. “We are aiming, at least in a normal, average playthrough, for you to be able to do 80% of the content.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You may have a time limit to save your family, but there is no time limit to complete the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Wolves has twisted temporal rules to deliver on that goal, particularly when it comes to how time-sensitive events are handled. For example, one storyline involves a burning house, but the flames will blaze indefinitely until you actually discover the building. Only then will you need to act before you spend too many sections of the time bar. There’s no chance of you turning up one day to find a house you never knew even existed is now a pile of rubble and ash. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, regardless of how quests and time are handled, there’s always that looming pressure: 30 days and 30 nights to save your family. But there’s unwritten nuance in that deadline. “Don't think about it as a game over thing,” Tomaszkiewicz hints. “It's more like a choice and consequence thing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the vital takeaway: you may have a time limit to save your family, but there is <em>no time limit to complete the game. </em>You can continue to play indefinitely after that point. And who is to say that saving your family will even be the most important part of your story? The Blood of Dawnwalker’s Steam page states: “Embark on the quest to save your family, or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way.” Perhaps that tale of revenge will provide an alternate journey for the main campaign? I ask Tomaszkiewicz to elaborate, but he refuses. That Steam description is already more than enough, he says. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Control Your Dark Urge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to see time, even when it only moves during specific actions, like sand slipping through your fingers. As something you lose. But it’s important to remember that progressing time brings you closer to one of The Blood of Dawnwalker’s most exciting features: Coen becomes a vampire at night. When the moon rises, you unlock the ability to walk up walls and along ceilings, and to teleport to rooftops and out-of-reach balconies. Such skills unlock a variety of opportunities, not to mention a stealthier play style. And so, if you want, you can skip the days and play only during the night. It’s a “totally viable way to play,” Tomaszkiewicz confirms, albeit with a warning that ignoring the day also means missing quests only available during the waking hours.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A vampire’s supernatural strength and skills come at a price, though, and it’s one we all know: gulping down vast quantities of blood. You’ll need to satisfy Coen’s hunger regularly, and the only truly gratifying meal is found in the neck of a human. You can opt to ignore that hunger, or feast on much less-satiating animals, but there are consequences to such a lifestyle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you starve Coen, if you don't feed him enough, and if you go into important conversations, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Wolves isn’t unique in creating a game in which you can kill significant characters, but it’s doing so in its own way. You can’t just stride up to someone and cut them down with your sword, for instance – it’s always to do with your vampiric urges. But you do have a choice. “You can decide to give into your vampiric nature whenever it comes knocking,” Tomaszkiewicz explains, describing it as “the whispers of your dark nature.” But that’s only possible if Coen is merely hungry. If you <em>starve </em>him, then every conversation is a roll of the dice. The hunger could seize control, and you’ll have no option but to watch him chow down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you starve Coen, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This system is possible thanks to that aforementioned “narrative sandbox” campaign structure. “In a game that has more of a strict core narrative, you couldn't kill off a character that is pivotal to the story, right? Because the story would fall apart,” notes Tomaszkiewicz. Since all quests in The Blood of Dawnwalker (aside from the first and last) are essentially optional, it means anyone can be killed without derailing the story. Instead, those deaths <em>become</em> the story. You can punish characters you hate, or be caught off-guard by surprise slaughter.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bloodlust is part of a wider set of overlapping systems designed to make the kingdom of Vale Sangora feel alive. NPCs have routines, and they’ll raise the alarm if they see you stealing or feeding on their neighbours. Rival factions will brawl each other in the streets. And the evil Brencis watches you from afar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As you gain more notoriety in the valley, as you do these acts against Brencis, he won’t stay passive,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. “He will enact these edicts that will hamper your progression. So he might send out more soldiers into the streets, or patrolling the roads, or enforce a curfew. So now it's more difficult to feed at night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notoriety initially sounds like GTA’s wanted level, or the escalating response of Metal Gear Solid’s guards. But it’s actually more complex than a simple difficulty spike. “Sometimes it can actually be a boon,” Tomaszkiewicz explains. “It's not just Brencis and his soldiers [who react to your notoriety,] it's also the people in the valley. They will recognize you and be afraid of you. So in some quest situations it actually might be helpful. There are some factions that fight against Brencis, they don't like him. So building up notoriety is actually a good way to gain a good standing with them.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The End and Beyond</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The narrative sandbox approach means Rebel Wolves has had to pay close attention to how the story ends. The ability to skip over every major quest, or kill off significant characters, means every player will hit the finale with different levels of knowledge. Some may not even know what a Dawnwalker is, while others will have found solutions to all the major problems. And so when I ask how many endings the story has, Tomaszkiewicz doesn’t have an easy answer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is a very complicated web of connections,” he says. “I can tell you the designer working on the endings is… let's say <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the meme of [It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s Charlie Day] with the red tape</a>. That's him basically. It is a lot of fun, but it's a lot to keep track of.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the only thing the story team needs to consider, either. The Steam page claims that this project is “the beginning of a brand-new saga built with love for the role-playing genre,” and so The Blood of Dawnwalker is just chapter one. The Rebel Wolves team may be building a game, but they are also building an entire universe that they plan to explore in subsequent games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have ideas for the overarching story of Coen,” reveals Tomaszkiewicz. He says sequels are, of course, not guaranteed, but the team has ideas of where to go should this first game be a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is much more in the IP than just vampires, let's say,” he teases. “There is this whole hidden world that we are not exploring on purpose in this first game. We want to leave a lot of fuel for the sequels and so on. But we do leave breadcrumbs and hint at these things. So yeah, we have a general idea of where we want to take Coen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such sequels and grander saga ambitions are beyond Rebel Wolves’ grasp for now, just as The Blood of Dawnwalker is beyond our own – at this year’s Gamescom, we were only able to watch a demonstration rather than go hands-on ourselves. And as exciting and promising as that demo was, it’ll take first-hand experience of the narrative sandbox to truly tell if the studio’s bold approach to RPG design has paid off. But just as Coen thirsts for the blood of mortals, I hunger to taste more of this fascinating, risk-taking Slavic fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Drag X Drive Miis" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca5f41e28f0e2/drag-x-drive-miis.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>August is nearly over, and we've had two first-party releases this month: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Long Title Nintendo Employees Are Obliged to Say in its Entirety</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>The Kirby revamp just came out (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">and it's very good</a>) while Drag and Drive (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-need-to-talk-about-x-games">yes, this one's definitely an 'and'</a>) hit the courts back on 14th August. Are you still playing it? I'm willing to bet <em>dozens</em> of you are.</p>
<p>Ah, what a shame. For a game that demonstrates some genuine originality, it just throws up too many roadblocks for the average player, whether it's the novel but uncompromising Mouse Mode controls, the dreary presentation, or the restrictive online team options. It makes for an intriguing pitch — and it really is a blast in <em>exactly</em> the right circumstances — but will anyone be playing this come Christmas? Is anyone playing it now?</p>
<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d7a0d5a6202e/joy-con-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I found myself wishing I could just control the thing with standard stick and button inputs. I know that would circumvent the game's USP and introduce a skill gap, as people using buttons would quickly and easily (I imagine) outperform players sticking to motion controls, so you'd need to split the playerbase via control scheme.</p>
<p>And for a game that's designed to show you the real gameplay possibilities of Mouse Mode beyond the obvious (and beyond the minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>), optional button inputs would be tantamount to admitting defeat. "Yeah, this is <em>our</em> Mouse Mode showcase! But you don't <em>have to</em> use them.<sub>..and it's easier and better if you don't.</sub>"</p>
<p>I reckon Nintendo could frame it as an accessibility win without losing too much face. Ironically, players with any sort of movement impairment in their upper body will likely struggle the most playing Drag x Drive. And given the game's muted debut, alternative control schemes would likely draw in a far larger player base. It's not too late if Nintendo just swallowed its pride.</p>

<p>It's an odd one, because I admire the boldness of the idea and the mechanical execution. Only Nintendo would do something like this, but it's looking like a one-and-done affair for all but the most devoted players with the optimal setups (3v3 over LAN at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience).</p>
<p>I had a great time with it back in April, and really hoped that would translate to the game proper, which I assumed would have more meat on the bone beyond the demo I played. Bolstered by Nate Bihldorff's comments in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-really-want-to-future-proof-the-nintendo-switch-2-interview">our interview</a> that, "in typical Nintendo fashion, there's more game beyond that," I assumed we'd seen only a small slice of the pie.</p>
<p>But no. Beyond the minigames, it's pretty much exactly what I played in April ad infinitum. Can you imagine what a difference a simple change of scenery would make? An outside court by the beach or up a mountain wouldn't fundamentally change anything, but would <em>drastically</em> improve the pervading presentational drabness. Perhaps Nintendo didn't want to distract from the novel mechanics with any trademark colour, but jeez. After half an hour you're jonesing for something beyond Burnished Black, Weathered Chrome, Medium Grey, Metallic Grey, Dark Grey, Dark Sea Grey, Neutral Grey, Grey Grey...</p>

<p>Or how about an injection of personality with some characters? Nintendo's got a few of those, right? <em>Something</em>. I thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Switch Sports</a> was bland, but Drag x Drive is crying out for some <em>verve</em> and charisma beyond the mechanical thrills.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a sensitivity and reluctance on Nintendo's part to sitting Mario and co. in wheelchairs, and I understand that a whole other, valid conversation around representation would come from just slotting in Mushroom Kingdom characters that demonstrably, famously, have zero mobility issues. But featureless robots with customisation that extends to a splash of colour and some cat ears? They won't cause offence, sure, but they aren't a satisfactory solution. You can't even make them look like Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Just adding Miis would give the game 1000% more personality. You still wouldn't want to be stuck with it at a party, but right now it feels like a brick wall in the presentation department - a complete turn-off. That is, if the controls didn't make you <a href="https://c.tenor.com/yTxA7WgkBEUAAAAd/tenor.gif">Abe Simpson outta there</a> beforehand.</p>

<p>Before launch, we'd worried that DxD might turn out to be Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, a game we loved and which still sold multiple millions of copies, but which didn't capture the audience it arguably deserved. Drag x Drive, though, feels like it ground to a halt almost immediately, not even able to sustain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo</a>-levels of novelty. It's got my respect, but the surprise and delight was incredibly fleeting with this one. Imagine if it had an ounce of ARMS or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a>'s style to go with the game.</p>
<p>Is there a way Nintendo could pivot and pull it back? Could Miis or regular button inputs change things for you? Would you be upset if they added DxD as a free-to-play perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers? Let us know in the polls and comments.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie was set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">hit cinemas on October 24th</a>, but it has now been delayed by several months to May 15th, 2026.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">Deadline</a>, test screenings have been "strong", but a busy October schedule is likely behind the decision to push back the release date to a more favourable mid-year position.</p>

<p>A follow-up to 2021's live-action Mortal Kombat movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">announced back in January 2021</a>, with Jeremy Slater - head writer on Disney+'s Moon Knight series - confirmed to be handling the script. Simon McQuoid remains on directing duties after helming the first movie. To date, New Line's three Mortal Kombat-flavoured movies have generated $257.8m (£190.9m) collectively, with its Red Band trailer – embedded above – racking up a record-breaking 106.8m views in just 24 hours.</p><p>Mortal Kombat 2 stars the likes of The Boys star Karl Urban, who's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-reveals-best-look-yet-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">stepping into the high-kicking boots of series icon Johnny Cage</a>.

<p>It also stars Jessica McNamee as Sonya Blade, Adeline Rudolph as Kitana, Ludi Lin as Liu Kang, Mehcad Brooks as Jackson "Jax" Briggs, CJ Bloomfield as Baraka, Tati Gabrielle as Jade, Chin Han as Shang Tsung, Hiroyuki Sanada as Hanzo Hasashi/Scorpion, and Max Huang as Kung Lao.</p>
