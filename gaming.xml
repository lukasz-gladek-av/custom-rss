It was seemingly embraced by players, as the game's Steam numbers jumped significantly following the debut of Siege X.</p><p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/359550/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Data from SteamDB</a> shows a massive spike in players on June 10 with the Siege X launch, peaking at around 142,000 concurrent players on Steam. It's still below Siege's all-time peak of 201,933 achieved on May 17, 2024, but it's an impressive gain all the same as people returned to Siege or tried it for the first time to check out the Siege X update and all of its new features and functionality.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9fgQY0d5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Siege is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top five best-selling Steam games</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top 10 most-played games.</a> Steam shares this data publicly, but Microsoft and Sony do not share similar sales or engagement data for the Xbox and PlayStation stores.</p><p>The Siege X update gives the game a makeover, of sorts, with better-looking graphics and improved sound.

                <p>Epic Games wants to enhance Fortnite's appeal in Korea and announced multiple collaborations, including a new skin for South Korean soccer star Son Heung-min in Fortnite. Heung-min was also added to PUBG Battlegrounds a few years ago and featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>The Son Heung-min bundle will be released in the game store and includes his official uniform, the Forward Edge accessory that changes style according to time, the Goal Getter wrapping sheet with a soccer motif, and his iconic Snap Ceremony emote.

            <p>Developer Build A Rocket Boy has shared details on an upcoming hotfix for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>Admitting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">game's launch "hasn't been without its challenges" for many players</a>, the studio now says "game performance" is its top priority. As such, a patch is planned for the end of this week for those playing on PC, while the team hopes to roll it out for those on consoles "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>This upcoming hotfix for MindsEye will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimisations</li>
<li>Reduced difficulty for the CPR mini-game</li>
<li>A new setting to disable or modify Depth of Field</li>
<li>A fix for an issue with missing controls for the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games</li>
<li>Pop-up warnings for PCs that have Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling disabled, and PCs with CPUs that have potential crash issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy said this fix will be the first of a series of updates for MindsEye. Future updates will be aimed at "enhancing your experience," the developer said, promising to keep us up to date with information on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Patches will need to have the internet to load, the team reminded players, asking them to "please ensure [the] game is updated regularly to enjoy the benefits of the latest improvements".</p>
<p>The studio additionally added that Build.MindsEye - that is to say, the game's creation platform designed to help creators share interactive experiences - is now "fully accessible" for those on Steam.</p>
<p>"Thank you again for your incredible support. This is just the start of a long-term vision to make MindsEye the best possible game for you," the team closed.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced publicly it has filed a lawsuit against an individual it alleges has developed and sold cheats for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>This latest venture in Epic Game's ongoing war against those who create, sell, and use cheats was announced via <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1932485822445666348">the company's own Twitter account</a>. There, the company posted:</p>
<p>"We filed a new lawsuit against an individual who developed and sold cheating software that helped players see through walls and auto aim. We're also going after people who helped sell this software. Creating and selling software to help others cheat is against the rules and we'll keep fighting to keep it out of Fortnite."</p>

<figcaption>A new Fortnite season was revealed recently. Check it out!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zzh-g2a4M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/606086/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker">According to Polygon</a>, the lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina where the company is headquartered. It alleges Ediz Atas, also known as  Sincey Cheats and Vanta Chearts, has been making and selling cheats since "at least January 2023".</p>
<p>Epic alleges in the lawsuit that after DMCA takedowns were issued to YouTube videos featuring these cheats, "Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to 'formally reverse [its] claim of copyright infringement'" by using fake Epic Games email addresses.
</p>
<p>Epic also claims its has issued tens of thousands of bans against Fortnite accounts that used cheats from Sincey Cheats since 2022, including over 15,000 bans on US-based Fortnite accounts.
</p>
<p>The lawsuit is also asking for compensation for damages from five unnamed individuals who distributed these cheats over platforms like Discord and Telegram. The amount is unknown.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Epic Games has proven especially litigious when it comes to Fortnite cheaters.  In 2022 Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-cheater-forced-to-pay-up-after-epic-lawsuit-damages-will-go-to-charity">forced a cheat creator to pay up in Australian court following a legal victory</a>, donating the winnings to charity.</p>

<p>The company is not alone in its struggle against cheats. Activision has also been fighting against cheats, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-wins-113m-in-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-maker">winning £11.3m in court against a Call of Duty cheat maker</a>. Bungie has been in those trenches too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-44m-lawsuit-against-destiny-cheat-seller-aimjunkies">winning a $4.4m lawsuit against Destiny cheat seller Aimjunkies</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The moon has always been a spot of interest and wonder that humankind has dreamed about reaching and finally setting foot on, if briefly. Establishing moon bases and creating a permanent foothold on the barren landscape is something that humanity still has not completely mastered in this day and age. In science fiction, when you leave Earth and set up a colony elsewhere, there’s probably a good reason for leaving God’s green Earth. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">PRAGMATA</a>, the journey is about doing the exact opposite: escaping the confines of the lunar stations and returning to Earth, not just by yourself but with a young girl/android named Diana along with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">PRAGMATA</a> is much more than an escort mission. While the playable astronaut controls all of the movement and offensive capabilities, the young Diana riding piggyback along the way has some serious hacking prowess. As players dodge and shoot their way through autonomous death machines and androids, Diana can simultaneously hack through the enemy’s defenses. On paper, this sounds arduous with having to juggle between moving on one analog stick, aiming with another, firing with the shoulder buttons, and trying to navigate through a hacking minigame with Diana on the face buttons. In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core. In practice, the earlier hacking segments only took a second or two to move your little avatar around and collect the requisite nodes in order to disable the enemy shields.</p>
<p>There is a few weapons at the player’s disposal in PRAGMATA early on, each having its own mechanics and capabilities beyond just shooting and dealing damage. The player’s signature pistol has infinite ammo and takes time to recharge, while other weapons picked up off the ground might only have a clip or two before they’re discarded and replaced with something else. There’s a variety of energy weapons, and I leaned more into the energy shotgun type when it came to blasting my way through the brief demo.</p>
<p>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time.</p>
<p><iframe title="PRAGMATA - First Contact Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idx9z6ke3tc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that Capcom has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal <a href="https://youtu.be/xoxCboik0Is">five years ago today</a>. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</p>
<p>There’s still some time to go before this adventure is ready for players’ hands as PRAGMATA will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Embracer says that Wingefors' departure and Rogers' appointment are both part of the "transformation process", which will see Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">becoming three separate entities</a> in charge of different aspects of the current company structure later this year.</p>

<p>That ongoing process also saw Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain" rel="nofollow">renaming itself to Fellowship Entertainment</a> last month, with current subsidiary Coffee Stain also due to spin off into its own entity sometime later this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group_0.jpg?itok=l--LqEHi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group_0.jpg?itok=-mrteLVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain, publisher of games like&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, will spin off from parent Embracer Group later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Wingefors says that while Embracer's "road has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">not always been straight</a>", he's "incredibly proud" of the company's achievements under his direction. He then says his move away from the CEO position will allow him to focus on "strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation", which I can't imagine was his response when asked what he wanted to be as a child.</p>

<p>Despite his departure, Wingefors won't be completely absent from Embracer (or Fellowship Entertainment, as it will be known by the end of the 2025 calendar year). He'll take the position of the board's executive chairman, with current chair Kicki Wallje-Lund moving to the deputy chair role.</p>

<p>Changes in Embracer's management come after a fairly turbulent time for the company. As part of a company-wide restructuring effort, Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter" rel="nofollow">laid off hundreds of employees</a> last year, additionally closing studios like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Agents of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, Embracer has enjoyed a couple of recent successes, most notably Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">managed to sell three million copies</a> in its first three months on sale.</p>

In 2020, BioWare pivoted back to the single-player RPG that would eventually launch on Halloween 2024, but according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s story, the developer was forced by EA to restructure the live-service version of the game into a single-player, story-driven RPG, rather than being able to go back to the drawing board and start fresh.</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>says that early playtesters lamented a lack of distinct choices and consequences in earlier builds, and this led to the late implementation of key moments like choosing between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168">saving either Minrathous or Treviso</a></span> from a dragon attack, leading to the other metropolis being overtaken by the Darkspawn’s blight for the remainder of the game. Another collection of substantial and consequential choices appeared in<em> The Veilguard</em>’s finale, where the player’s decisions can possibly result in the deaths of their entire party. Apparently, this segment came after BioWare brought in the studio’s <em>Mass Effect </em>team to help get the game across the finish line, which resulted in an “overhaul” of the game’s final missions.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>As the Mass Effect directors took control, they scoffed that the Dragon Age squad had been doing a shoddy job and began excluding their leaders from pivotal meetings, according to people familiar with the internal friction. Over time, the Mass Effect team went on to overhaul parts of the game and design a number of additional scenes, including a rich, emotional finale that players loved. But even changes that appeared to improve the game stoked the simmering rancor inside BioWare, infuriating Dragon Age leaders who had been told they didn’t have the budget for such big, ambitious swings.</em></p></blockquote><p>This aligns with previous reporting and statements from BioWare veterans, who have stated that the <em>Dragon</em> <em>Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> teams <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055">had a tense relationship,</a></span> and the fantasy team felt it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">didn’t receive the same level of support</a></span> as the sci-fi team from BioWare and EA leadership.

                <p dir="ltr">The next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone will boast a larger world than the one in his farming simulator. But you don't have to take our word for it; Barone himself made this specific comparison for Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Barone stated that: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley." He would know, since in December, Barone noted he was creating Haunted Chocolatier similar to Stardew Valley. "I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," Barone said after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">reconfirming he resumed development on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The world of haunted chocolatier is larger than stardew valley</p>  — ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It seems like Barone is slowly but surely opening up more about his next game.

There is no release window for the RPG, with Barone saying earlier this year that he hopes it comes out in the next five years. That would take us through the rest of this decade. Afterward, Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">"might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</a></p>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced PlayStation handheld will feature AI upscaling, and some of its specs will address the lower memory bandwidth compared to the base PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, well-known AMD leaker KeplerL2 revealed some additional information about the handheld that's been rumored to be in the works for a while, revealing that the AMD APU that will power the system will be the only one from the company to have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-announced-coming-this-holiday-2025.1685066/page-5#post-270507134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI upscaling</a> in the near future. The leaker also added that the handheld will come with <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498839">16 GB LPDDR5X RAM</a> despite launching in a few years, as LPDDR6 is still away, and that it will have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1/3 of the base PlayStation 5 memory bandwidth</a>, although with more cache and improved memory compression. Clarifying the cache the system will feature, the leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will come with 4MB of L2 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, which the current generation systems don't have. Regarding the architecture of the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 reiterated that both the handheld and the PlayStation 6 will be based on a fork of the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gfx13 (RDNA5/UDNA) architecture.</a></p>
<p>While the PlayStation handheld has been rumored to be in the works for a while, Sony has provided no indication that such a system exists. Still, last week, it was revealed that the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro will soon get a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low energy mode</a> that will reduce performance to save power, which is believed to be a performance profile for this yet-to-be-detected handheld, so it seems increasingly</span>&nbsp;likely that a handheld system is indeed in development.</p>
<p>While Sony has yet to confirm if the PlayStation handheld is indeed in the works, Microsoft made part of its plans for the handheld market clear during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, a handheld gaming PC coming in a clear Xbox flavor. The company was reportedly also working on a full-blown handheld system, but plans were reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/">halted</a> to focus on improving the Windows 11 handheld gaming performance, which is lagging behind the performance offered by SteamOS.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom%E2%80%99s-lineup-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-mix-of-bold-and-boring.1215636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Capcom had an interesting showing at Summer Game Fest with three titles that will carry the developer into 2026 and beyond: <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and <em>Pragmata</em>. I got hands-on previews with both <em>Requiem</em> and <em>Pragmata</em>, and a hands-off presentation for <em>Onimusha</em>. Across the three games, I saw a mix of fresh ideas with <em>Onimusha</em>, some stale ones with <em>Requiem</em>, and some weird but interesting choices with <em>Pragmata</em>. </p><p>Of the three games, <em>Pragmata</em> represented the biggest tension between what I liked about it and what I didn’t. In the game, you play as Hugh, an astronaut stranded on the moon who is aided by a small, child-like robot named Diana. To be frank, I’m utterly exhausted by the trope of a big, gruff dude protecting a small, innocent child. Enough! It’s 2025, we have plenty of dad games at home, Capcom, there has to be a more interesting way to do this.</p><p>That said, I was impressed by <em>Pragmata</em>’s combat. What I thought was a straightforward shooter was still mostly that but with a complexity that dramatically changes the calculus of how you fight. Enemies in <em>Pragmata</em> are shielded and take little damage from Hugh’s weapons. To fight effectively, you must use Diana’s hacking skills, represented via a minigame that’s basically a stripped-down version of <a href="https://youtu.be/u7UKP3QN4HA?si=V_ZBIUAMYbpEODfw">the hacking minigame from <em>Bioshock</em></a>. </p><p>What’s most interesting about this is that it all must be done mid-combat. Time doesn’t stop as you’re building a circuit to the end goal in order to stun your enemy. It meant I had to juggle hacking effectively with dodging enemy attacks in a way that felt fresh and exciting for what I thought would be a simple action shooter. I just wish they had applied that innovation to some of the game’s narrative elements.</p><p>For <em>Onimusha</em>, Capcom revived a long-dormant series in a big way, first with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/606269/you-know">a remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em></a> and now with this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody">new entry</a>, the first in almost 20 years. During the hands-off presentation, all I could think was, “This is Capcom’s take on a soulslike.” Some of that is in the aesthetics. The world is dark, overrun by grotesque-looking demons who brutally cut down fleeing peasants before turning their swords on Musashi, the protagonist. In other ways, it’s the combat. Enemies have stagger bars you deplete through deflecting and parrying attacks. In boss fights, as you slowly wear down your enemy, you can choose which part of the boss to damage to produce a certain effect. I did not get to play <em>Onimusha</em> myself, but I’m intrigued to see if any more soulslike elements are embedded within the game.</p><p>Finally,<em> Requiem </em>stole the Summer Game Fest show as Geoff Keighley closed the keynote event with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681325/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-date">surprise reveal of the game</a> and its February 2026 release date, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682006/and-the-award-for-biggest-tease-of-the-night-goes-to">previously teasing that we wouldn’t see it for a while</a>. Later during Play Days, Summer Game Fest’s in-person media event, I was treated to a short gameplay presentation and demo that offered a brief glimpse into the harrowing experience of Grace Ashcroft as she tries to escape an abandoned hospital. </p><p>During the gameplay presentation, Capcom emphasized that Grace would have to rely on her wits to survive rather than any kind of training as a soldier or law enforcement like the Leons, Adas, or the Chrises of that T-virus infected world. I liked that approach and how it was reflected in both the presentation and the demo. Since Grace had no weapons to protect herself, I had to find clues in the environment that would help me survive. That meant paying attention to my surroundings and reading everything I could find, landing on the one tip that got me through my time with the demo.</p><p>On the other hand, my brief look at <em>Requiem</em> felt like Capcom was tapping into old routines instead of doing something truly innovative for the ninth mainline entry in the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. Yes, the big monster lady was scary, and that delicious tension was heightened by the fact that I had no guns to shoot my way out in case my wits failed me. But there are only so many times I can be chased through hallways by a slowly plodding monster before it gets to be old hat. I’ve seen that not just in other <em>Resident Evil </em>games but in horror games in general, and I’m bored by it.</p><p>I understand that I’ve only seen the tiniest sliver of what the full game represents, but I hope when <em>Requiem</em> comes out in February next year that I see more new ideas than old ones. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A group of prominent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> modders will be livestreaming the creation of a big mod over a single weekend later this month. It's part of a charity drive led by voice actor Wes Johnson, probably most famous for providing the dulcet tones of mad Daedric prince Sheogorath in Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>.</p>
<p>The gang - led by Kinggath and the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> - will be letting viewers decide the specifics of the mod via a stream this weekend, with the actual mod creation streams then taking place on Twitch across June 28th and 29th.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">The modathon</a> is part of this year's edition of Voiceapalooza, an annual charity drive in aid of the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> that sees Johnson and community-run charity initiative <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/">Fallout For Hope</a> organise a bunch of streams to raise funds for the cause.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-mod-sheogorath-actor-charity-2024">Last year</a>, this time-limited modding element of it saw a similar group of modders create a Fallout 4 questline called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84389">Shady Motives</a>, raising over $30,000 in the process. In addition to a story starring Johnson, who's also voiced the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s Fawkes and Oblivion's Lucien Lachance, that mod included a player home, custom weapons and armour, and a fully-voiced companion.</p>
<p>So, basically a mini-DLC worth of stuff that was then uploaded to Nexus Mods and <a href="https://mods.bethesda.net/en/fallout4/mod-detail/4364063">Bethesda.net</a> once any kinks were ironed out for anyone on PC or Xbox to give a go. This year looks like it'll produce a fresh mod of a similar size and scope, with modders Kinggath, Elianora, Neeher, Jazzhands, Otellino, Sagittaurus, Niero, Erika Ember Studios, Veta Phoenix, and greenFoxel all set to stream themselves creating and working on different aspects of it.</p>
<p>Interesting to check out if you've ever been curious about how the modding sausage is made, or you can just keep an eye out for the mod going live once it's done. There's also a stream on Kinggath's Twitch that'll see watchers vote to decide the details of the mod that the group'll be building - that takes place this Saturday, June 14th, kicking off at </p>
<p>You can find all the timings for the different streams that make up this modathon in <a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">this Tweet</a>, and find all the streams that'll be going live on mod-making portion on June 28th <a href="https://simsettlements.com/charity/">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a> has revealed new insights into the goings on at BioWare during the making of The Veilguard, revealing exactly why it ended up disappointing some fans with a lack of meaningful choice and consequence — key qualities BioWare’s best games are best-known for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Schreier revealed that many of The Veilguard’s issues were a hangover from the pivot from multiplayer back to single-player RPG, including its tone, dialogue, and lack of tough choices for the player. One tidbit stands out: BioWare was spooked by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-forspoken-sales-were-lackluster-and-its-reception-challenging">the failure of Square Enix’s Forspoken</a>, worrying The Veilguard’s now out of fashion snarky tone would fuel a similar fate. So a “belated rewrite” of the game’s dialogue was ordered to “make it sound more serious.” This, in turn, resulted in tonal inconsistencies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were also internal concerns about how The Veilguard was being marketed (“an initial trailer made the next Dragon Age seem more like Fortnite than a dark fantasy role-playing game, triggering concerns that EA didn’t know how to market the game”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA declined to comment to Bloomberg on the piece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of The Veilguard’s failure is that a small team is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, but there are concerns about BioWare’s future. Dragon Age appears dead following the failure of The Veilguard, which when counting Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem is BioWare’s third flop in a row. Could EA close it down?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg quoted TD Cowen analyst Doug Creutz as saying that while EA needs more than sports to be successful, “if they shuttered the doors [of BioWare] tomorrow I wouldn’t be totally surprised. It has been over a decade since they produced a hit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg's piece</a> for the full story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-impressions-preview-souls-orbs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, our own Chris Person asked a question that sent readers, listeners, and game designers of all stripes spiraling: “<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games used to have more orbs. What happened?</a>” Chris concluded, ultimately, that gaming’s glorious, firefly-like orb swarm dissipated after being shooed away by the heavy hands of loot and other, more modern upgrade mechanics. Good news, however, for Orb Aficionados, who make up 99.9 percent of Aftermath’s readership: One of orb history’s all-time greats, <em>Onimusha</em>, is back, and it’s got the juice, by which I mean orbs.&nbsp;</p><p>During a hands-off presentation at Summer Game Fest’s Play Days event in Los Angeles, I got to see an early section from <em>Onimusha: Way Of The Sword </em>in action, and I’m pleased to report that this long-awaited series revival is looking solid. While Capcom isn’t quite giving us a <em>pure </em>survival-horror-inspired character-action game – there’s a <em>Souls</em>-inspired stamina meter, for example – the game’s look and vibe feel in line with the series’ legacy. So far, at least, <em>Way Of The Sword </em>does not strike me as a cheap excuse to dredge up a nostalgic name, but rather a reasonably reverent reinvention. Orbs are a big part of that.&nbsp;</p><p>There are three types of orbs, which are known as “souls” in the game’s parlance: blue, yellow, and red. These correspond to skills, health, and experience, respectively, which is not too far of a cry from how they functioned in earlier games. Most importantly, you can hold down a button to hoover them up – again like in previous games – which becomes a crucial part of your mid-and-post-combat rhythm. Also, it just <em>feels </em>satisfying. Modern action games, which often force you to run around manually picking up loot and resources, have nothing on the elegant simplicity of the Orb Vacuum.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword World Premiere Trailer | Summer Game Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4ee6REzoGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Most of the demo, which saw new main character Miyamoto Musashi slice and dice dudes and demons while untangling the mystery of a Japanese folklore-inspired temple stage that villagers were being hurled off, proceeded about as you’d expect. Combat was suitably flashy, with an omnidirectional guard and a parry-powered redirect ability setting the player up for powerful “Issen” attacks that absolutely wrecked enemies’ shit. These could also be chained together to take out multiple enemies at once by, for example, tricking one enemy into stabbing another. Casting your Issen net wide, our presenter said, results in “a ton” of orbs, and it’s good for crowd control to boot.</p><p>As Musashi doled out damage, orbs flowed like red, blue, and yellow wine. Occasionally, after temporarily sating his orb lust, Musashi would unleash a flashy, yellow-hued special attack during which he performed something akin to a dance, except with two knives. But that’s not orb (all). Musashi also wore a magical golden gauntlet with a blue orb in its center that could absorb masses of dark magic – orb-shaped as well – that granted him the ability to briefly gaze into the past. This, I imagine, will serve as one of the game’s primary storytelling devices.&nbsp;</p><p>However, only toward the end of the demo did things get truly interesting on the orb front. Once Musashi reached the aforementioned temple stage, he got ambushed by Sasaki Ganryu, a cackling, sadistic sword boy with an orb gauntlet of his own. During the ensuing boss fight, Ganryu sprouted a stamina meter, and when Musashi deflected attacks, it took a big hit. Eventually, this staggered Ganryu, allowing Musashi to execute a Break Issen, in which the player selects a specific portion of a boss’ body to attack, each with different effects.&nbsp;</p><p>First our presenter targeted Ganryu’s head, which resulted in “big, big damage.” After a little more skirmishing, Ganryu’s meter plummeted again, and this time our presenter went with a body shot, which sacrificed damage in favor of “a ton of souls,” allowing the player to “charge up our health bar and the attacks we’re using here, which helps spawn even more souls that help heal us over the fight.” The arm was also a target, and I’m not gonna lie: I don’t remember how many or which type of orb that Issen attack produced because Musashi broke the fuck out of Ganryu’s arm, and it was gnarly.</p><p>But basically, victory in boss fights is a byproduct of smart orb management.&nbsp;</p><p>“Depending on where you’re at – whether you’re just about to finish him or you need a bit more health – you can choose the way you want battle to flow,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after dispatching Ganryu (who <em>will </em>return, our presenter was careful/excited to emphasize), Musashi came face to snout with another boss, a talisman-covered beast called Byakue. After bringing him down, we were told that it was of crucial importance that Musashi close the rift from which the monster emerged, to prevent more freaky dudes from coming out. The rift was orb shaped. Then the demo ended, and the audience went wild. For orbs, obviously.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I had all these ideas," he said. "So I wrote them down and passed them to my PA, as if it were my will. I kind of understood why people commit suicide. It was the end of the world."</p><p>Kojima also developed serious eye pain that prevented him from going outside or watching movies or TV. He opted to have eye surgery, and this ended up damaging the optic muscles that allows a person to focus. "The doctor kept saying that the brain would adjust. I was not convinced," Kojima said.</p><p>Following his illness, Kojima said he now feels "nervous" and "rushed."</p><p>"I still have a lot of things I want to do--that I need to do. I thought I could do anything if I was independent, but the reality is that I can't," he said. "I always think of other, more weird stuff to make. But if I do that, and it doesn't sell, my studio will go bankrupt. I know all the staff. I know the families of the staff. I have this burden on my shoulders."</p><p>Kojima's next release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which releases this month on PS5.

The Hitman series is all about embodying a man of mystery who uses his cunning along with an array of weapons and gadgets to complete missions, so seeing the devs at IO Interactive apply their slick, open-ended balance of action and stealth to James Bond seems like we're in store of an evolution of the Hitman structure on a grander scale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the opportunity to speak with IO Interactive Chief Technical Officer Ulas Karademir about the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In addition to giving some details on the upgraded engine that IO Interactive made for their dive into Bond, the CTO explained why he returned to the company following his departure to lead the upgrade of IO Interactive's Glacier engine, and why their Bond game offers a greater degree of freedom than the Hitman series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I left in 2014 [to work as the VP of engineering at Unity] during the development of Hitman 2016, but in the last year, I had come to the office to see what they were doing, and the first thing that Hakan B. Abrak—CEO of IO Interactive—showed me was the James Bond game," said Karademir. "He knew that I really wanted to work with this franchise, so he showed me the game, and then he asked me, "Do you want to come back?" and I was like, "Yeah, I think so." With everything we have planned [with the scope and increased agency], yeah, I think this is the right game for us."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-i-learned-during-a-marvellous-meeting-with-to-a-t-creator-keita-takahashi" target="_self" data-discover="true">What I learned during a marvelous meeting with To a T creator Keita Takahashi</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on the origin story of James Bond, who appears as a 26-year-old recruit from the Royal Navy into MI6.

The core gameplay is very much in line with Hitman's immersive sim approach of exploring clockwork levels where players take advantage of NPC behavior to accomplish missions.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers told us the title leans even further into the agent fantasy than Hitman, all with the intent to highlight Bond as a multifaceted secret agent who can adapt to different situations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-remedy-entertainment-built-fbc-firebreak-around-the-player-s-schedule-not-the-other-way-around" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why Remedy Entertainment built FBC Firebreak around the player's schedule, not the other way around</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a [lot] more options in this game compared to Hitman," Karademir said. "You can play the game with a stealth approach, or you can do social interactions with Bond trying to bluff his way out of situations, which creates situations with humor and interactions like that. Of course, you can go in guns blazing sometimes, but this game is about giving a lot of opportunities in the game when you play it. There are so many different approaches in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and it's way more than what we had in Hitman."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The discussion turned to the topic of the Glacier engine, IOI's proprietary technology that powers the recent Hitman: World of Assassination games. The upgrade to Glacier 2 for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was motivated by the increased scale of the game's levels and the greater degree of options that players would have in exploring the game.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;At IO Interactive, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what is fun&quot;">"At IO Interactive, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what is fun"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have this understanding of the agent fantasy and the freedom of approach, which is what Hitman was all about," said Karademir. "At IO Interactive, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what is fun. We tend to really obsess about gameplay, and once we figure it out, the production is quite easy. We know how to produce games, and we have been doing this for 25 years, but it always was that kind of iteration speed that we have with our engine when trying to figure out 'is this fun?' and [consider] what kind of a game we are building."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/in-skin-deep-cartoon-logic-helps-players-understand-complicated-gameplay" target="_self" data-discover="true">In Skin Deep, 'cartoon logic' helps players understand complicated gameplay</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be a more fleshed-out and sprawling adventure that goes further with non-kill options, the developer insists the Hitman DNA is still clear and present. This game just goes further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Yeah, there is an inspiration from Hitman within our version of Bond—It is the same type of fantasy, right?" said the CTO. "But we also try to make it as unique as possible. Our designers spend a good amount of time figuring out what makes Bond unique, what kind of situations this character finds themself in, and how they can go about solving it. As the CTO, what I can tell you from the engine perspective is that just about anything in the game is made of entities, so it's like building blocks."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is kind of a very flexible environment for designers to work and try different things with the amount of approaches you can have. They can create set pieces, they can handle character interactions, and that gives them a kind of creative freedom to build what they would like to achieve in the games. From a technical perspective, there is a lot of trying, a lot of iterating, but we still have the key learnings as we build our take on the Bond IP."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p><span>No other game developer dared to reveal their newest game at Summer Game Fest by teasing players three times with an anniversary message, followed by a sale announcement for previous titles in the series, and then ending the two-hour showcase with an actual world premiere look at their latest survival horror game. While Resident Evil Requiem’s initial reveal may have been cheapened by all the teasing beforehand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">the reveal</a> was worth it.</span></p>
<p><span>Following our&nbsp;</span><span>brief look</span>&nbsp;at <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, we were greeted behind closed doors with another look at the trailer, announced earlier in the week, along with the first sneak peek at gameplay for the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p><span>While Resident Evil VII: Biohazard’s connections to the Resident Evil universe were muted early on and left players wondering how it was connected to the legacy of S.T.A.R.S. and the Umbrella Corporation, Requiem starts by introducing the player character as Grace Ashcroft, a young FBI investigator and daughter of the late Alyssa Ashcroft, one of the varied protagonists from the Resident Evil Outbreak series (and eagle-eyed fans might recognize the byline as one of the reporters of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dulvey_Daily">The Dulvey Daily</a>, a newspaper for the local parish where the Baker family resides in Resident Evil VII Biohazard. Capcom aims for a “fresh, vulnerable perspective” on the Resident Evil series by introducing a character already haunted by a major family tragedy, yet not a fighter in the traditional sense, but rather a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span>The demo opened with Grace Ashcroft being suspended upside down on a hospital gurney with an IV in her right arm. The developers made a point to highlight Grace’s training in the FBI to try and stay cool under pressure through breathing techniques and self-talk to cool down. She then tries to tip the stretcher over to stop the blood from rushing down to her head, and uses the shards of a broken glass vial to cut her bindings free, all through an in-game cut scene before the gameplay transitions into a first-person perspective as Grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This section of Resident Evil Requiem takes place in an abandoned hospital, although it only appears to have been abandoned somewhat recently. There are still a bevvy of locked doors that mark a series’ long-running tradition, both ones with broken handles and others with elaborate door handles or stone carvings to indicate which key is needed. And it wouldn’t be a Resident Evil game without needing to replace fuses in a fuse box to turn on the lights or open an electronic shutter, so I’m proud to say that these puzzles are back once again. Grace isn’t one to have deep pockets on her, so she only has a modest eight-slot inventory to hold onto these key items, at least to start.</span></p>
<p><span>Grace Ashcroft doesn’t have the same combat training that Ethan Winters underwent between Resident Evil Biohazard and Village, so she instead will have to rely on more practical weapons, such as throwing empty bottles. A small UI tip showed both a power and radius for the bottle, so I would assume there would be a variety of these weapon types at her disposal. To navigate the darkened halls, Grace picked up a lighter with the same ornate emblems as one of the gates around the hospital, although we couldn’t make out what that symbol was.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of Resident Evil Requiem was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>In a scene that will be all too familiar as players experience the horror for themselves, Grace is slain by this hulking monster as the screen fades away. The audience is reminded that this was merely the overture to their darkest symphony to date. Resident Evil Requiem's demo session ended with a quick continue back to moments before disaster and a cheeky peek at the options to turn on a third-person camera mode. Yes, while Capcom is leading with the first-person perspective of the past few titles, third-person gameplay will be available from the start, and you can even spin the camera around and see Grace’s face, unlike the enigmatic Ethan Winters for most of his adventures.</span></p>
<p><span>Resident Evil Requiem will be available on February 27th, 2026, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/onimusha-way-of-sword-preview-miyamoto-musashi-mayhem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just recently, I had the chance to review&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2</em>'s new remaster, and less than an hour in I was sold on this franchise. Since my passion for&nbsp;the series is so new, I am greatly anticipating the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>.</p>

<p>Even better, we had a chance to see a hands-off gameplay demonstration of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. It's bold and action-packed. It's the series you know and love, redefined for the modern age.</p>



<h2>The Legendary Swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi</h2>

<p>Producer Koichi Shibata was playing the live demo for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>. The setting appears to be largely in Kyoto. Our protagonist is one of Japan's most legendary historical figures: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>

<p>This is Musashi in his younger years, so he's more concerned with training with the blade, rather than the Oni Gauntlet attached to his arm.</p>

<p>Fans familiar with the series will recognize the Oni Gauntlet. It's the means by which our protagonist absorbs the souls of Genma, the enemies of the series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gauntlet appears to have a personality, so we see a bit of banter between Musashi and the feminine voice residing inside of it. This dynamic is intriguing, and Musashi seems like a silly fellow in this one.&nbsp;<em>Onimusha</em>&nbsp;is already a quirky series, so there's great potential in the storytelling.</p>

<p>In this demo, the players works their way through the grounds of a shrine or temple, called Kiyomizudera Shockingly, Genma are attacking people and Musashi is ready to dive into the action.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Return of the Issen</h2>

<p>Returning players will find many familiar elements from the series return in this installment. Musashi can hack and slash away with his sword as a basic attack. Enemies, of course, drop colored souls which are absorbed in the gauntlet.</p>

<p>He's able to parry, and in one instance of combat, we see&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;leverage its next-gen capabilities. Musashi parries a blow from a Genma and redirects the enemy into a flaming torch. The enemy takes extra damage, so environmental damage adds a bit more depth to the combat.</p>

<p>In another instance of combat, an archer draws its bow and aims at Musashi. It's inside a small building, so Musashi grabs the tatami mat, blocks the arrows, then throws the mat at the Genma. This makes the Genma vulnerable to your attack and stuns them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps the most iconic element of&nbsp;the series, the Issen counter, also makes a return. Attacking an enemy right as they are about to hit you allows for a cinematic attack that usually one-hit kills lesser enemies. The hands-on demo makes it look easy, but I imagine that's from many hours of practice.</p>

<p>We saw Musashi use an Issen on multiple enemies at once; essentially, you can chain together an Issen attack on foes in close proximity to one another. This allows for you to take out multiple foes in quick succession, like the badass that you are.</p>



<h2>Terrifyingly Good Graphics</h2>

<p>Flying Genma -- the annoying little buggers that they are -- make a return and absorb souls from fallen foes. The way Musashi attacks and defeats these enemies are especially cinematic.&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;is a seriously gorgeous game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, this might just be Capcom's best looking game yet. The forest surrounding the temple is gorgeous. Capcom uses light fog and lighting to create an astonishing view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite enemy we saw were these crow-like humanoids. They're swift and can evade attacks. There's this doppleganger-like effect where you try to hit them, but the real one comes just out of reach. It's a tricky fight for Musashi!</p>

<p>We carry on through the shrine grounds, this time coming across a dark mass. Musashi can absorb these masses and get a glimpse into the past. It seems like absorbing these might be a main objective of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Absorbing the mass shows dark, shadowy figures on the shrine grounds. We reach a larger building in the shrine and see the Genma are throwing peasants over the edge of a railing, down a cliff.</p>

<p>This is actually inspired by real folklore of the area, something I was vaguely familiar with. But our trance is soon interrupted as Musashi's longtime rival, Ganryu Sasaki, appears. He has his own Oni Gauntlet and, apparently, fully embraces its power.</p>



<h2>Battle of the Oni</h2>

<p>An exhilarating sword fight ensues. This battle really seems to really capture the feeling of a duel, with the warriors trading blows, parrying and the like. We also noticed that Ganryu has a health and stamina gauge, giving me vague hints of&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>&nbsp;inspiration.</p>

<p>The battle is flashy. Ganryu's helmet breaks off from your fight. Depleting his stamina gauge also allows you to do a targeted strike; you can actually choose where on his body to attack. These are color-coded and give you orbs of a particular color.</p>

<p>So if you need health during a boss fight, targeting the corresponding color will give you orbs to heal. Stabbing Ganryu in the head or abdomen were choices here, adding a little strategic element to combat.</p>



<h2><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>We also look at one final boss encounter after Ganryu. As if reality itself is shattering like glass, malice starts to ooze out of a fissure and out comes Byakue, a large, axe-wielding Genma boss.</p>

<p>This fight features more and more parries and clashes. The parrying of attacks really stands out hear, and there seem to be so many different animations. It's quite exciting to watch, so I can only imagine how fun it is to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;had an impressive showing, and is perhaps my favorite game of the show. It's a game that shows so much dedication to the craft and doesn't deviate from what&nbsp;made&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>such a coveted IP in the first place: some good ol' action-packed demon slaying.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the largest surprises of the Summer Game Fest Showcase was the announcement and debut of a <em>Resident Evil 9 Requiem</em> trailer. Shortly after the public trailer was released, we got a chance to visit the Capcom theater to see not only live Onimusha gameplay but also a segment of gameplay from <em>Resident Evil 9</em>.</p>

<p>The gameplay segment opened with Grace hanging upside down and strapped to a hospital gurney. This scene was&nbsp;<em>tense</em>. Lingering on Graces face, and the subject of her attention, while she didn't say anything there was a clear conveyance of everything that was going through Grace's mind as she planned her escape.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-demo-start.jpg?itok=oFgfXfsq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-demo-start.jpg?itok=r4bHeKtl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grace waking up, strapped to a gurney upside down, and hooked up to an IV slowly taking her blood</figcaption></figure><p>This portion of the cutscene was so precise. By pulling on the line from the IV drip in her arm, she was able to tip over and break the glass that was collecting her blood. Using the line again, she gathered up shattered glass to cut her wrists loose. Another free hand and a quick topple of the gurney, and Grace was free.</p>

<p>At this point, the experience shifted into a first-person view. Turning around, Grace began to make her way through a series of corridors. They were filled with the stable <em>Resident Evil</em> fare, tight corners, a door with a sigil that needed a key of the matching design, and a 16-foot monstrous woman that stalked Grace through the halls.</p>

<p>For many in the room the introduction of this monster was quite the jumpscare. After opening a door, Grace had a dead body collapse onto her, inspecting it on the ground a large hand quietly reached out of the darkness and with no effort picked up the dead body before raising it to her mouth and biting the head clean off. Grace's non-reaction through this process is a mix of panic and awe (much like those watching) as she's just trying to take in the abomination in front of her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-hallway.jpg?itok=dtT_Z7hg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-hallway.jpg?itok=y2iYz97p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This section of the demo shown was structured in equal parts puzzle, as Grace tried to escape this portion of the building she was in, while also doubling down on the idea of wanting to escape from the daunting and monstroust figure that was stalking her.</p>

<p>Within the same diverting hallways, with 3-5 rooms adjacent we got to see Grace find a locked door, return with a key, locate a fuse trapped behind a locked case, obtained a screw driver, unlocked the fuse, and then made her way to a gate that is in need of a fuse.</p>

<p>While there was a lot of movement to and from the different rooms within this portion of the building, each time Grace made it to a key objective, she would be faced with a small challenge, or she would only reach the location while trying to steer clear of the monstrous woman.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-monstrous-woman.jpg?itok=ApwAR4I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-monstrous-woman.jpg?itok=MJj5u4bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Resident Evil 9's Mr X?</figcaption></figure><p>We didn't get to see Grace do much to mitigate the oncoming threat, but for this segment of the gameplay, it seemed the idea of Grace's character was to not be the most competent when it comes to combat, but to be able to nimbly escape.</p>

<p>There were a number of cuts between footage while viewing this <em>Resident Evil 9</em> gameplay, the key information that was missing from the footage was things like the location of the key for the locked door, or when there was some repetitive backtracking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-key-door.jpg?itok=BYlBC4oJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-key-door.jpg?itok=aPW7C7w2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A key was obtained, but it's location obscured</figcaption></figure><p>There were a few moments when it did seem that there were some selective cuts around some additional context. Grace entered a room filled with medical equipment and while she was standing still there were some additional squealching noises. They didn't seem like they were coming from here, but they also seemed too frequent and light, they weren't coming from the giant humanoid creature.</p>

<p>This section had unsettling moment, some of the darkest corridors I've seen in games, and a plethora of jump scares as your way would get blocked by the monster.</p>

<h2>Resident Evil Requiem has First Person Mode and Third Person Mode</h2>

<p>A very interesting aspect of the gameplay clip, and one that was heralded by applause in the small showing room, was that by entering the pause menu and going to options the gameplay was able to be shifted to third person mode.</p>

<p>Once in third person and running from the monstrous woman Grace found her way to the fuse box, placed it inside, and was able to escape as the demo came to a close. The last thing that remained on the screen was "This is merely the overture to our dark symphony".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace.jpg?itok=fTMXSXk2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace.jpg?itok=hFMZsGp6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grace in the hallway with the locked door, just around the corner to the left is where the fusebox can be found</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay made me think of early Ethan Winters style gameplay for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a560db9-346a-4407-98cb-00ff8b36ed59" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a>. There was a lot of need to avoid combat, knowing that whatever it was you weren't going to want to take the face on. Grace, with her experience in the FBI, definitely has a lot of knowledge and skill under her belt, but a Resident Evil outbreak is definitely out of her comfort zone.</p>

<p>While we didn't see too much of the menus or additional mechanics when approaching the door without the key we got to see an empty inventory screen that looked like the ones being used in recent <em>Resident Evil</em> titles, and the one time that Grace was hit by the enemy a pulse meter in orange appeared in the lower left.</p>

<p>It looks like the UI will be aiming to be a light as possible, only showing relevant elements when necessary.</p>

Despite obvious comparisons to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, given the large map and third-person view, its more akin to a <em>Mafia</em> game in that if you go off the beaten path you will not actually encounter all that much.

But more recent years have blessed us with a far better hit ratio of movies and TV series. With <em>Mr Mercedes</em>, <em>1922</em>, <em>Gerald’s Game</em>, <em>The Outsider</em>, <em>Castle Rock</em>, <em>11.22.63</em>, just television adaptations alone have been incredibly good over the last decade. So, will MGM+’s <em>The Institute</em> continue the trend?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197583,197582" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The book certainly seemed to set out with that intention! Of all of King’s recent works, nothing has read quite like it was created with its TV adaptation in mind. A peculiarly derivative work, of both King’s own oeuvre and so many other kids-with-telepathy endeavors, at times it felt like reading a pilot pitch more than a novel. (Know that I say this as a lifelong massive fan, who cannot get enough of the author’s other recent fascination with recurring character Holly Gibney.) Now we get to see if that will work out.</p><p><em>The Institute</em> is about a deeply unpleasant facility hidden deep in the woods of Maine. Children who demonstrate telekinetic or telepathic powers are kidnapped and held hostage there, where they’re experimented upon and tortured, in efforts to embolden their powers, for mysterious ends. As you might expect, the story is mostly about a group of children banding together in an attempt to revolt and escape.</p><p>Like <em>From A Buick 8</em>'s strange similarity to possessed car tale <em>Christine</em>, <em>The Institute</em> had far too many overlaps with King’s superior novel, <em>Firestarter</em>, and suffered by comparison. I mean, it was fun! King’s never a bad writer, and as ever, the relationships between the characters still shine. But it always felt too constricted.</p><p>Meanwhile, MGM+ (formerly Epix) has been fairly hit and miss itself with original TV shows of late. While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337">it offers the best thing on TV, <em>From</em></a></span>, it’s also guilty of last year’s unwatchably awful <em>Earth Abides</em>, so it’s really hitting the extremes. The trailer for <em>The Institute</em> feels very stilted and cliche-ridden to me, but I have reason for hope. Take a look:</p><p>First of all, while we see glimpses of core character Tim Jamieson in the trailer, the emphasis is almost entirely on 12-year-old Luke Ellis and the institute’s monstrous director, Mrs. Sigsby (a perfectly cast Mary-Louise Parker). And that’s important, because the novel splits its tale into two interweaving parts. While here we see flashes of Ben Barnes as the former cop, it doesn’t show us how this is the far calmer, less melodramatic aspect of the story, betraying the trailer’s biases as unlikely to be reflective of the final show.</p><p>Secondly, the program is being directed by Jack Bender. That’s <em>Lost</em>’s Jack Bender, and the director behind most episodes of the stunning <em>From</em>, suggesting that <em>The Institute</em> is in very safe hands. The script has been adapted by Benjamin Cavell, best known as the creator of <em>Seal Team</em>, and who also wrote an awful lot of the ridiculously good <em>Justified </em>(although he was also the main writer on the damp squib that was 2020's version of <em>The Stand</em>). </p><p>As an aside, I must mention that when <em>The Institute </em>was first in development in 2019, Bender was still directing, but David E. Kelley was scripting. Given the legendary TV writer’s most recent works have been a huge deviation from the genteel dramas that made his name, and indeed that he was showrunner on the fantastic <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>, I would have loved to have seen that version too.</p><p>I’d love for this to work out, not least because the ending of the novel really underlined how much it felt like a setup for an ongoing series—a series that I’d like to know more about. There’s potential for this to deal with the book’s entire plot in its first season, and then have huge scope to explore more widely should it succeed. We get to find out on July 13 on MGM+, which you obviously don’t subscribe to, but thankfully is easily accessed via Amazon Prime.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
