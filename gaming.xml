			<p>Project Titan, the codename for the next game from Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, appears to have been cancelled. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lwgzeh/titan_project_of_striking_distance_from_the/">Reddit</a>, a senior technical artist at Striking Distance Studios, which was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield as a subsidiary under Krafton, listed Project Titan as a cancelled game that they worked on. They listed their tasks on the project as character, weapon, and prop setup and rigging, which were also tasks they did when working on The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>When Striking Distance Studios (SDS) was first announced as a new team with Schofield leading the way, there were a lot of reasons to be excited about the new studio. It was a team of veteran developers, all coming together to leverage what was at the time the next generation of consoles, and though we didn't know it for sure at the time, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-to-glen-schofield-about-striking-distance-cinematic-narrative-experience-set-in-pubg/">Wccftech spoke to Schofield</a> about the "<em>cinematic narrative experience</em>" they were creating at SDS, we could only hope that the team was making a game akin to Dead Space.</p>



<p>Fans of horror games, like myself, got their wish when The Callisto Protocol was revealed. It was billed as a 'spiritual successor' to Dead Space, and with Schofield directly behind the project, it felt like there was potential for a new series of horror games. </p>



<p>Obviously, that is not how things panned out. The Callisto Protocol seemed to have a myriad of issues even in development, as Schofield publicly discussed what appeared to be a pretty<a href="https://wccftech.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-crunch/"> awful period of crunch that the team went through.</a> Then, when it arrived, it did so to middling reviews across the board, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">including from us here at Wccftech</a>.</p>



<p>It didn't help that EA released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">stunning remake of the game that</a>, for all intents and purposes, launched Schofield's career to a new level a month after The Callisto Protocol failed to impress, but the success of EA Motive's Dead Space Remake is hardly what stopped The Callisto Protocol from taking off. Schofield later revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-was-released-too-early-admits-glen-schofield/">the game was launched too early,</a> and that part of the crunch issues the team suffered came from Krafton not giving the team approximately three to four more months to complete their work on the game that they thought they were going to have.</p>



<p>SDS suffered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-layoffs-future-projects/">multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">layoffs</a>, and Schofield ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">left the studio</a> less than a year after the game's launch and subsequent failure. Last year, we learned that the team was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">working on a new game, </a>which was presumably the now-cancelled Project Titan. It's unfortunate that a team with such high hopes has had such a tragic journey. Hopefully, there's a better chapter to come for the team with their next project, and the next time we hear about Striking Distance Studios isn't to find out that they've been shut down.</p>

Ahead of San Diego Comic-Con 2025, IGN can exclusively reveal the next chapter in the Cult of the Lamb Saga, Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb: Schism Special #1 is a one-shot, 48-page comic that reunites the creative team from The First Verse, including writer Alex Paknadel (Red Goblin) and artist Troy Little (Rick and Morty vs. Cthulu). This new issue is again a collaboration between comic book publisher Oni Press, game publisher Devolver Digital, and development studio Massive Monster.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed15-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Peach Momoko.

More potential followers are rescued by the day, but with no one to indoctrinate them, Lamb’s power stagnates and The One Who Waits becomes weary of his earthly vessel’s resistance to the full power and responsibility of the Red Crown. When famine strikes the cult, a challenger to Lamb’s mantle emerges, and a new struggle begins...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let me just clear the air here: I’m not a gamer. At least, I thought I wasn’t until this extraordinary story landed in my lap," Paknadel told IGN about The First Verse. "A perfect innocent – a sacrificial lamb - is given the means to avenge themselves against the tyrannical system that threw them under the bus for a paltry superstition. It’s a classic revenge fantasy, but it also contains the seeds of truly epic tragedy.Get ready to experience the events of the game from the Lamb’s perspective – their fall and rise and fall - and see why the tragedy of The One Who Waits’ anointed avenger only began with their death."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed16-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Troy Little.

Its combat is immensely satisfying even if its short runs and the relative lack of variety between them doesn’t give it the lasting appeal of other action roguelikes, and building my very own cult base and tending to a flock of followers was just as fun as any swing of the axe. I may not revisit it now that the credits have rolled, but Cult of the Lamb is something altogether different that I had an absolute blast playing."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cult of the Lamb: The First Verse Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cult of the Lamb was recently updated in August 2024 with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cult-of-the-lamb-official-unholy-alliance-launch-trailer">the DLC expansion Unholy Alliance</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

<p dir="ltr">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," Yoshida told <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" rel="nofollow ">Anime News Network</a>. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based."</p><p dir="ltr">Mainline numbered Final Fantasy games also tend to have completely different settings, characters, and gameplay systems, as well as work done on by different teams, with Yoshida emphasizing the latter. "[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 released on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-final-fantasy-xvi-finally-coming-to-xbox/1100-6532259/">Xbox Series X|S</a> last month, following its original launch on PS5 in 2023 and then its release on Steam last year. It marks a shift in Square Enix's strategy to move away from console exclusives, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-announcement-trailer/2300-6466048/">Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles</a> releasing in September for multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Primarily, the unlocked frame rate rarely manages to hit that 60fps sweet spot, resulting in some horrible stuttering that's far more prevalent in docked mode thanks to the VRR technology in handheld mode. Thankfully, developer IO Interactive is aware and is looking to address these issues very soon.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3wjklvg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>, IO is hoping to issue a fix for the performance issues "over the Summer". Bit of a vague timescale, we're sure you'll agree, but it gives the dev some wiggle room if it needs a bit of extra time. It didn't elaborate on exactly what the fix would entail, but a spokesperson said that "the team is working on some of those performance issues right now", suggesting that the frame rate issue specifically would be high up on the team's list of priorities.</p>
<p>It also stated that these learnings would be applied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, which is scheduled to launch on Switch 2 in 2026. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/007-first-light-official-game-reveal-launching-on-switch-2-in-2026">official announcement</a> for the game arrived last month, with a full gameplay reveal scheduled to take place this Summer.</p>
<p>Whatever comes from the planned update, we're excited to see what kind of improvements it brings. We don't know about you, but we're eager to dive back into Hitman: World of Assassination. The only thing holding us back right now is that darn frame rate.</p>

        <p>Arch-tempered monsters to be permanently available</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom are fine-tuning the live service of livestock-murdering game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> by making the Arch-tempered monster hunts a permanent fixture, rather than time-limited seasonal content quests. It's a bid to address the FOMO element that has dragged the game down to an Overwhelmingly Negative <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam user review consensus</a>, though there are other things to blame for that, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">dodgy performance</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>One Arch-tempered munster, Rey Dau, will return on July 23rd, after the currently available event quest ends on July 16th. (If you're unfamiliar, Rey Dau is a big golden Tesla dragon.) Arch-tempered Uth Duna will debut on the same date, a week ahead of schedule. (If you've yet to have the pleasure, Uth Duna is a flouncy alligator that loves to sneeze on itself.)</p>
<p>These may not be the first permanently available Arch-tempered monsters. "We are considering making the event quests for the upcoming Arch-tempered monsters and other event quests permanently available as well," Capcom comment via <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1943582546886889868">MechaHitler.com</a>. More details are to follow.</p>
<p>Going by the responses to this announcement, I gather that the limited-time quests in Monster Hunter Wilds have been causing a lot of ruckus. Some players object that the previous major series iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak">Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</a>, did not have these stressful features, while others point out that they were present in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, the last game from the Wilds team specifically.</p>
<p>My only, rather disingenuous thought here is that it's a bit rich for so-called "hunters" to be complaining of FOMO. Hunting is supposed to be about identifying and accommodating the prey animal's schedule, isn't it? Pretty dang sure the pre-Neolithic tribes weren't out there review-bombing the skygods because the herds kept moving south for the winter. Actually, that probably explains the formation of many organised religions.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered just not telling people when Arch-tempered monsters are present in the game. Foster the element of curiosity! I'm sure that would in no way increase the quantity of hatemail they're receiving. Capcom have recently <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">put out a statement</a> addressing the harassment of staff, which has been widely interpreted as a response to the ruckus over Monster Hunter Wilds.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo]]></content:encoded>

But this needs to be made right.<em> Subnautica </em>has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds was sold to Krafton in 2022 for roughly $500 million. If the studio hit revenue targets this year, the founders were on track to get an additional $250 million payout, with a percentage of that going to the rank-and-file developers on the studio floor. But delaying<em> Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access launch to 2026 makes hitting that goal basically impossible. Krafton says it didn’t fire them to avoid the payout, but because the founders failed to deliver a launch-quality version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> as promised. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has for his part clamed the game was ready. </p><p>There are now also alleged leaks of an internal May 2025 milestone review <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating around online</a></span> that paint a messy picture of the game’s development timeline. It includes an assessment that <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access version was too content-light to “drive IP growth and expansion” and calls for 30 percent more content, including additional biomes, creatures, and narrative chapters. If accurate, it would lend credence to Krafton’s recent claims, though for now the alleged leak remains unsubstantiated. </p><p>This would hardly be the first time that studio founders got into a messy and drawn-out fight with their parent publisher over debates about scope, timelines, and bonus payouts. The most notorious version of that was Infinity Ward leaders Vince Zampella and Jason West’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw">high-profile 2010 lawsuit against Activision over <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </em>royalties</a></span>. The litigation went on for two years before it was settled, filled with tons of wild revelations about everything from corporate espionage to Activision’s then-unannounced plans for the first <em>Destiny</em>. </p><p>We’ll see how long this lawsuit lasts and what it eventually reveals. Hopefully, Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 employees are able to still ship a good game and get what they’re owed in the process. “As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue,” Cleveland wrote in his latest update. “I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbi-seizes-popular-nintendo-switch-rom-site.1241508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The FBI has seized and taken down one of the more prominent Nintendo Switch ROM sites, Nsw2u. First reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site was seized earlier this week on Thursday, though according to some of the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/new/">Switch Piracy Reddit page</a>, the site remained up for a few hours before being entirely taken down. If you try to visit the website now, you'll be met with a splash screen from the FBI notifying that the site has been seized "<em>in accordance with a seizure warrant</em>."</p>



<p>The splash screen also includes a logo from the FIOD Tax Administration, a Dutch agency that was involved in investigating the site and having it taken down. Nintendo has not commented on the takedown, but it's clear that this is a part of the company's more aggressive effort to combat piracy on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices. </p>



<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">ability to brick Switch 2 devices</a> is something that's been widely reported by now, another sign of just how serious Nintendo is about players using their devices in what the company deems to be an "<em>unauthorized</em>" way, even if they are being fought<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/"> by regional government agencies</a>. After all, it didn't take very much for players to be able to jailbreak Switch devices at launch. All it took to open the door to a jailbroken Switch was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip,</a> before Nintendo had released revised models of the console to nullify the popular method. </p>



<p>That didn't stop players from jailbreaking the device, however, and the battle against piracy is one Nintendo continues to fight. </p>

The full list of guidelines is as follows:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center to discover if visits are possible.</li><li>Contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center for details on the times of visits.</li><li>Follow the instructions provided by the staff working at the stables.</li><li>Do not enter stable buildings or grazing land without permission.</li><li>Do not shout or make loud noises.</li><li>Never touch the horses.

                <p dir="ltr">The unique hook to the anime horse girls of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> is that the characters are each based on actual famous race horses. With the sports sim's surging popularity in North America, this may be seeing an interest among new fans to visit the real horses themselves. With that in mind, the game's developer Cygames has <a href="https://umamusume.com/news/200003/" rel="nofollow ">published</a> guidelines for people wishing to visit stables.</p><p dir="ltr">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has already been a hit in Japan since the original mobile release in 2021, spawning manga, anime, and even a stage adaptation. But since its global release last month, strong word of mouth, including streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce, has helped catapult it to widespread attention, where earlier this week it hit its all-time-peak of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-is-galloping-up-the-charts-on-steam/1100-6533094/">just over 50,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That seems to have also prompted more enquiries from fans who want to actually visit the real-life race horses the titular Umamusume are based on, as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" rel="nofollow ">BlueSky user</a> has noted that appointments to visit Haru Urara, a race horse beloved for her long losing streak, has already been booked out for the month. Their post also included a screenshot from a Twitter user urging fans to "please be respectful and follow the rules".</p><p dir="ltr">Those rules are now available on the Umamasume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" rel="nofollow ">website</a>, and they advise prospective visitors to contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center rather than the stables directly for a visit. It also warns, "Horses are extremely sensitive to their surroundings. Even what seems like a small change to a person could be a shocking, scary, or stressful event to them. For the safety and well-being of the horses, we ask all Umamusume fans to follow all rules and practice good etiquette when visiting stables in Japan."</p><p dir="ltr">The guidance is only for when visiting stables in Japan, but fans are advised to check local resources for information and rules if they wish to visit stables outside of Japan.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has commented on the possible turn-based future of the series, following the recent success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, Final Fantasy games have moved away from classic turn-based battles and progressed towards the all-action gameplay of 2023's Final Fantasy 16, which disappointed some long-term fans.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur, released earlier this year, features an action twist on turn-based battles and has become something of an exemplary talisman for RPG fans hoping <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s series will return to its roots.</p>

<p>Now, in a recent interview at the Anime Expo 2025, Yoshida (also director and producer of MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>) was asked what the success of Clair Obscur could mean for the future of Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," he told <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405">Anime News Network</a>. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel.</p>
<p>"It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based."</p>
<p>He added: "[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail."</p>
<p>While I personally enjoyed the ambitious, cinematic storytelling of Final Fantasy 16 and its Game of Thrones inspired setting, I can understand why some felt its action combat was a big departure from series tradition. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, for instance, more readily blurred the boundary between turn-based and action battles.</p>
<p>Yet when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">I interviewed Yoshida ahead of Final Fantasy 16's launch</a> about the essence of the series, he responded: "I think, for me, that Final Fantasy is all about making that cinematic experience. You think back all the way to the original Final Fantasy on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, you start out, you play the game a little bit, you get to a certain point, and then you finally get that opening scene. And that truly cinematic experience, it separates itself from other games and makes it like a movie."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-discusses-the-essence-of-the-series">Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the series, stated in an interview with Yoshida</a> at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in London 2023 that Final Fantasy is all about taking risks.</p>
<p>"I think with Final Fantasy you always want to take a challenge, to take an adventure into building a new system for the new installment, that courage to be able to take that risk," he said.</p>
<p>"Of course it's a very hard job and a very large undertaking, but with a series that has continued for this long sometimes people might think, 'Why don't you just make more of the same thing?'. I think that shouldn't be the case in Final Fantasy."</p>
<p>I agree that what makes the series special is how unique each game is and how daring its developers have been in trying something new with each installment. It's a series about pioneering new ideas, not following trends. I would love to see that continue with Final Fantasy 17.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>A return to the tradition of turn-based battles would look like a step backwards for the series, and a white flag from Square Enix it's resigned to compete with Sandfall (and, really, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Atlus</a>) in the turn-based stakes instead of looking forward.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Square Enix admitted sales of both Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a>, so perhaps it's time for a rethink for the next mainline entry.</p>
<p>What's more, that celebration of tradition certainly worked for Final Fantasy 9. And perhaps that rumoured remake could satisfy long-term fans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrates-final-fantasy-9s-25th-anniversary-so-wheres-the-rumoured-remake">if, in fact, it's ever released</a>.</p>
<p>Until then, Yoshida has assisted with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">forthcoming remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, that's due out in September. It might also be turn-based, but as a strategy tactics game it's yet another example of the combat variety the Final Fantasy series offers.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success]]></content:encoded>

<p>Well, that escalated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Repair firm iFixit has performed a full teardown of the Switch 2's Pro Controller, delivering a scathing review of the repairability and potential durability of the accessory. Ultimately, it calls the Pro Controller a "p**s-poor excuse for a controller".</p>
<p>But why? Well, watching the video reveals just how tricky it is to actually get into the Pro Controller, with Nintendo applying adhesives to the front faceplate, lots of hidden screws, and thumb-grips that need "an uncomfortable amount of force to remove". Essentially, iFixit believes that the work required to simply reach the controller's battery for potential replacement is far too difficult for the average consumer.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we have the potential issue of stick drift. iFixit believes the potentiometer stick technology used in the Switch 2's Pro Controller means it will likely still be prone to drifting. That said, it says that the sticks themselves are slightly easier to remove than that of the original Switch Pro Controller.</p>
<p>As for the good news (if you can call it good news), the headphone jack is fully modular and easily removable. In fact, iFixit says that this is probably the only positive that it can muster when it comes to assessing the Pro Controller.</p>
<p>In conclusion, iFixit points to cheaper controllers such as the <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1443193.html">Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit</a> as accessories that accomplish much more at a lower price, including the additions of TMR and Hall Effect sticks.</p>
<p>Now, in practice, the Pro Controller for the Switch 2 is astoundingly comfortable to use, with excellent-feeling sticks and a strong d-pad. However, as time goes on and more folks find the need to repair their controllers, it seems Nintendo has made it about as difficult as possible to actually get into the bloomin' things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just over 3 years ago, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">current 2-player starter set</a> for <em>Bushido</em> Risen Sun. That set introduced 2 rival families, which could be included as ronin across all factions. Civil Hands Unclean, which adds new ronin sent in support of the families, is releasing soon as an expansion to the 2-player starter set. In this article, we'll have a look at the new fighters and which factions can use them. We also have a preview of an upcoming card that's currently in playtesting at the end of the review.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>In the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set, the&nbsp;Hozumi and the Kiyozumi family are at war, framed by the Romeo and Juliet love story of Koga and&nbsp;Hinadori. Civil Hands Unclean is a 2-Player Starter Set Expansion, and while the <em>Bushido</em> 2PSS isn't required to use this product (the minitures it contains are Ronin and can be used by a variety of factions), it continues the story, and the contents add directly to the original box, taking both forces up to the full 100-rice warbands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-2.jpg?itok=bEOTaQqx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-2.jpg?itok=foeJViio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclear 2-Player Starter Set Expansion adds new fighters to both families.</figcaption></figure><h2>Old Reinforcements</h2>

<p>Hozumi Daihanji, the senior Hozumi, has called on warriors from his past to assist in the feud. The first of these is Gocho, a battle-tested warrior, summoned back from retirement. While not a dangerous fighter, Gocho does well in groups of Ashigaru, with a ki feat that can grant other ashigaru within its aura a fear stat equal to the number of friendly ashigaru within it, and while Gocho has a Frightened marker, which his steadfast trait negates a lot of, other friendly ashigaru gain fearless.</p>

<p>Gocho can join Prefecture of Ryu, Minimoto, and Shiho warbands, and his Permission to Speak unique effect means that he can be included in themes for those warbands as if he were friendly ashigaru.</p>

<p>The second fighter Daihanji summoned is a former bandit leader who, after being defeated, swore to aid Daihanji when needed. Tozoku has some history with&nbsp;Kenmeina from the opposing family, which is demonstrated through the Hatred trait. In offence, Tozoku has a Bandit Blade ki feat that can remove enemy dice from a melee exchange, with the option for your opponent to transfer ki to Tozoku to keep the dice.</p>

<p>Tozoku also comes with a Hozumi Introduction enhancement that can be purchased, allowing them and other Hozumi models to be included in themes as if they were faction models. Tozoku can be taken by Ito, Silvermoon, Descencion, Jung, and Shiho warbands.</p>

<p>To aid their cause,&nbsp;Kiyozumi Sadaka has called upon a distant cousin from the great Ito clan, Ito Saiaku. Although Ito in name, Saiaku's profile is a ronin profile, and they deploy with their 2 servants. Saiaku is an interesting unit. He can sacrifice either of the 2 servants to prevent damage and has a melee of 3 with Prowess (1), which allows him to reroll a dice during the exchange. He has to use fortune each turn, which is a coin flip to gain 2 or zero ki a turn. Saiaku and the 2 servants must also use leech each turn, which they can't do off each other, so you'll need to keep other fighters nearby, or risk them all gaining control markers and your opponent getting an action out of each of them.</p>

<p>Saiaku does have some solid ki feats, including a once per game that can stop your opponent outright winning the tactical roll that turn and also negating the tactician trait from the unit using it for the rest of the game. An aura ki feat that increases the cost of ki feats and ki boosts from all units within the aura by 1, and my favorite, Inflated Reputation, which gives Saiaku Fear (6) until the end of the turn, unless he has 3 marked wound boxes, as his facade fails.</p>

<p>Saiaku can also have any number of Enhancement - Equipment cards, and one of the servants, Tahei, has a ki feat that can add any permitted Ronin Enhancement - Equipment card to Saiaku. If this ability isn't used each turn, Saiaku and both servants are removed from play. So you will want to bring a stock of permitted equipment cards to throw on Saiaku throughout the game, gaining him more abilities with each turn, along with making sure Tahei has ki to spend and is nearby Saiaku to use it.</p>

<p>Ito Saiaku comes with the permanent unique effect of allowing themselves and Kiyozumi models to be taken in themes as if they were faction models, and can be taken as standard by the Cult of Yurei, Ito Clan, Silvermoon Syndicate, and the Shiho Clan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=0sBSswhf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=4MayuTFI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ito Saiaku drags his 2 servants, Tahei and Matashichi in support of the Kiyozumi clan in <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches Boon</h2>

<p>GCT Studios have kindly offered us a preview of an upcoming card for the next cycle deck that's currently undergoing playtesting, so is subject to change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jade Witch</strong> <em>Enhancement</em></p>

<p>When the Attached model Targets a Soulless model with a Ki Feat, the Ki Feat loses {Opposed Ki}.</p>

<p>When the Attached model performs a Simple Ki Feat Action, this model gains a Spell Token.</p>

<p>The Attached model may remove 2 Spell Tokens to gain a third Activation Counter that turn but it must perform a Simple Ki Feat Action during that Activation.</p>

<p>For effects that count number of Shisai, this model counts as 2 Shisai. (it does not count as 2 models for any other purpose).</p>

<p>Requirement [Ayako] Rice Cost: 1 Max: 1</p>

<p><em>A messiah may draw the attention of the people, but the priestess has the notice of the kami.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This enhancement card, for the Ito Clan, means that Ayako's ki feats all become regular tests against soulless models, rather than opposed tests. All 3 of her ki feats are also simple, meaning that she can essentially use 2 ki feats a turn and still take another action. The final part of the enhancement, making Ayako count as 2 Shisai, means that for her own unique ability, she grants herself Resistance (2) and Willpower (2), giving her an advantage of opposed ki tests.</p>

<p>GCT will be revealing more cards from the upcoming cycle as it approaches release.</p>

<p>Civil Hands Unclean includes some incredibly thematic new units that play into their lore very well. It expands the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set perfectly and adds interesting dynamics to the game. Not all factions can use the units in this set, Savage Wage, Shadow Wind, Temple of Ro-Kan, The Awoken and&nbsp;Kinshi Temple are locked out, but if you have the 2-Player Starter Set, you can build 2 100-rice warbands under the Kiyozumi and Hozumi themes, and add these units to any factions that allow their use.</p>

<p>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean 2-Player Starter Set Expansion will be available soon as a Retailer exclusive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one knows how it started, but everyone knows that they are here. The Savage Wave of oni, demons from myth and legend, and waves of goblins, has descended on the Jwar Isles. Before they fully become oni, there is a rite of passage, and the onisho need to pass through the ring of fire to prove their worth or perish in the attempt. You might think that not being full oni means they're not as powerful, their rage not as all-consuming. You would be wrong. In this article, we'll have a look at the new Ring of Fire themed warband for the Savage Wave. We'll talk about the new and returning fighters, and where you can go next.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Savage Wave is a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and The Ring of Fire is a theme card that restricts you to onisho, but gives them some incredible benefits that play into their theme.</p>

<p>Using the theme, all friendly onisho gain the last stand trait, which means that if they're reduced to 0 wounds, they're not removed from the battlefield until the end of the turn. Normally, units with last stand can't heal, but onisho can still heal using their consume soul or soul thirst abilities. For every onisho that's removed from play during a game, when an onisho uses oni rage, consume soul, or soul thirst, they gain ki and heal an amount equal to the number of friendly units removed so far.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire themed warband includes 5 onisho for the Savage Wave, 3 new models, and 2 returning models with updated sculpts. All of the onisho here have the consume soul ki feat, which is a once-per-turn instant use, that allows them to heal wounds equal to the ki stat of an enemy model removed from play within 3 inches of them.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is led by Junec, who comes armed with Brutal (1), +2 damage swords, along with armor 2 and tough 1, making them difficult to damage, and even more difficult to remove with their healing through enemy removal and last stand ability with the theme. They also have ki feats that let them use banzai to charge for 1 activation (rather than 2), and add +1 to their brutal trait.</p>

<p>Backing up Junec are Jokash and Kuroko. Jokash comes armed with the pole-armed style agoniser, which is only +1 damage (most of the onisho have +2 damage weapons), but it does have reach to allow them to go first in combat if they're not in base-to-base contact. Their indomitable trait means they ignore small and tiny enemy models they're engaged with for penalties and have their melee stat ki boost reduced by the number of them they're engaged with. With armor 3 and tough 1, throwing them into hordes of smaller enemies only benefits them.</p>

<p>Kuroko is armed with a +2 damage ranged arbalest to hit targets you can't reach in melee. The onisho don't benefit from killing targets at range, and with reload 1 and 2 ammo (which can be replenished by taking no actions for a turn), you will want to throw Kuroko into the fray and use the arbalest stock in melee, unless you need to use the arblast to get past armored and tough foes.</p>

<p>Boba and Kano are two older sculpts who have received updated models and retained the same stat cards. Boba likes to throw +2 damage iron skulls, with ki feats to increase the attack range and gain rapid fire 2. Kano likes to dish out stunned markers with their batter ki feat and +2 damage club.</p>

<p>The rice cost of the included onisho in Ring of Fire is 87, and you can easily make up the rest of the 100-point rice cost with the 17 enhancement and event cards included in the set. Each fighter has a unique card enhancement for them, and the rest are generic enhancements or events. My favorite is the There Can Be Only One event, which means that if there is only 1 friendly onisho remaining, it doesn't remove activation counters while enemy units have activation counters, so they can continue to activate multiple times until your opponent finishes their activations. You're going to be extremely aggressive with your onisho, so it's a great just-in-case card to mean you can dish out some insane damage in a phase where you only have 1 onisho left, especially when combined with the last stand ability.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is extremely aggressive, allowing you to throw your fighters into combat, knowing that they can heal and are difficult to remove because of layers of armor and tough. They have abilities that allow them to come out on top in combat and deal massive damage when they do. The themed last stand ability means that even if your opponent takes them out, they're still dangerous until the end of the turn, and can still heal and keep going.</p>

<p>On top of the previous 2 onisho who've had updated sculps for this pack, 3 other onisho are available, and another is releasing alongside The Ring of Fire. Goro is a huge onisho, on par with Junec in damage-dealing terms. Tsuta and Yasei are slightly cheaper onisho, with Tsuta having ranged options and the only support ki feat out of the whole group with Idolize that can boost another onisho's melee pool. Yasei deals damage with only their fists, with +2 damage wrestling, and a unique ability that always adds another wound to damage rolls in melee.</p>

<p>Releasing alongside The Ring of Fire is Merlek, an onisho shugenja, or magic user. They still have a +2 damage staff, but also a short-range black magic attack that increases in damage for each enemy they damage. They have a Fall into the Ring ki feat, which gives all oni and onisho in the aura strong, making damage tests easier, and all other models in the aura weak, making damage tests more difficult for them. They also have the most thematic of ki feats for the warband, Ring of Fire, which puts a 4-inch aura in the centre of the battlefield, and units within it can't allocate dice to defense.</p>

<p>This is my first experience with the Savage Wave, and they do exactly as you would expect. There's something freeing about throwing your fighters entirely into combat, knowing that your opponent will be on the defensive, and even if they're not, they will struggle to even damage your fighters and, almost impossible to remove them. I love the fact that there is also always the risk of you dropping There Can Be Only One when you've only one fighter left, for an insane final turn with your fighter rushing to deal as much damage as possible while your opponent tries to avoid them. Someone said something about victory points, but I was too busy smashing their forces into the dirt.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/original-subnautica-director-sues-krafton-after-dismissal.1241463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>creators Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill have announced that they're suing Krafton, the parent company of his now-former studio Unknown Worlds, following his dismissal from the company.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Cleveland, along with fellow co-creators McGuire and Gill, was ousted from Unknown Worlds earlier this month. Krafton initially didn't provide a reason for their dismissal, but in a <a href="https://bleedingcool.com/games/krafton-addresses-subnautica-2-changes-while-devs-issue-lawsuit/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequent statement</a>, the company alleged that after what it calls the "failure" of Unknown Worlds' game&nbsp;<em>Moonbreaker</em>, Cleveland "chose to focus on a personal film project" rather than resuming&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>development.</p>

<p>However, as you might expect, Cleveland <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disputes</a> Krafton's version of events. He says that he "would never willingly abandon [<em>Subnautica</em>] or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it", reiterating that he and his team believed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>&nbsp;was ready for release in 2025 and that the situation "needs to be made right".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit-fish-scanning.jpg?itok=jXWn_Ml8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit-fish-scanning.jpg?itok=PHCvdirn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>co-creator Charlie Cleveland is suing Krafton after his dismissal from Unknown Worlds.</figcaption></figure><p>As a result, although Cleveland says he and his fellow&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>creators would rather not engage in a public battle with Krafton, they feel it's a necessity to make the situation right.</p>

<p>Cleveland also references the $250 million employee bonus that was reportedly to be paid to employees upon reaching a certain revenue goal in 2025 (which the release of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>would obviously have greatly helped).</p>

<p>He says that he, Gill, and McGuire will "continue with the earnout/bonus" and that Unknown Worlds employees "deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands".</p>

<p>As with many corporate lawsuits, this one is likely to run and run, so it's probably going to be quite some time before we hear the result of Cleveland's efforts. He does, however, say that the details of the lawsuit "should eventually become (at least mostly) public", so that information will be revealed in time.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently slated for an Early Access release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in 2026, although whether this lawsuit changes that or not remains to be seen. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The character from the Arnie film I watched far too many times with my friends as a teenager, and then quoted from for the rest of my silly little life? “I’m luuuking fah Reeed Saaaarrrrrnyah!” Yup. It’s that one. Except, in what looks like quite a twist since the 1985 film, the new trailer suggests this one might actually be <em>about</em> Red Sonja.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,196406,197589" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Movies go through all sorts of strange phases—strings of cartoons about sentient fish, for instance—but resurrecting classic Arnold Schwarzenegger movies from the 1980s, but without Arnold Schwarzenegger, is one of the weirdest.</p><p> First we have (the truly soulless-looking) <em>The Running Man</em> coming from Edgar Wright later this year, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD18ddeFuyM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD18ddeFuyM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently released a trailer</a></span> showing the empty frame of Glen Powell blandly running and ducking while the direction declared “THIS IS EXTREMELY FUNNY,” and yet at no point was there the appearance of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2SPgPBSrFZ0?si=TZ5M9tJ9gVNA7gge&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2SPgPBSrFZ0?si=TZ5M9tJ9gVNA7gge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a man dressed as a Christmas tree</a></span>. And now we have <em>Red Sonja</em>? It was weird enough in 2012 when the never-climactic Len Wiseman (<em>Underworld</em>, <em>Ballerina</em>) thought it a good idea to try to remake perfect cinematic classic <em>Total Recall</em>, with a stunningly miscast Colin Farrell playing Douglas Quaaaaaiiiiid.</p><figure id="" data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Millennium Films / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-recommend-id="image://6da195fce6cf753fff6972cc139745dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1707" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sonja looks up after plunging a dagger into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>The Running Man</em>, which has a big-name director and main star, <em>Red Sonja</em>’s 2025 revision is perhaps a little more low-key. It’s directed by M. J. Bassett, who has a healthy credit sheet when it comes to directing solid television shows (including four episodes of the wonderful <em>Ash Vs Evil Dead</em>), but she perhaps has a slightly less impressive record on the big screen. Remember 2020's Megan Fox vehicle <em>Rogue</em>? No? How about 2021's <em>Endangered Species</em>, starring Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell? That slipped by you too? But even critics didn’t see those films, so what about a movie that did get reviewed? 2012's <em>Silent Hill: Revelation 3D</em>? That had Malcolm McDowell, Sean Bean, Carrie-Anne Moss and Kit Harrington! And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/silent-hill-revelation-3d/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Metascore of 16</a></span>. Ouch.</p><p>It’s not exactly an all-star cast, either. Sonja herself is played by Matilda Lutz (<em>Rings</em>, <em>Magpie</em>), and the only other names I recognize are Trevor Eve and Rhona Mitra, and that’s because I’m British. Meanwhile, Arnie’s character from Richard Fleischer’s 1985 movie, Kalidor, doesn’t appear to be in the film at all!</p><p>You know what, that’s probably a good thing. As hilariously dreadful as Arnie was in absolutely everything, seeing someone else trying to reprise one of his roles is always so awkward. It was very much his scenery-chewing, bicep-popping, terrible-acting ways that made him so completely charming, and everyone else just seems like a cardboard cutout when stood in his shoes. And, rather crucially, a film about Red Sonja really ought to have been about Red Sonja, but even as early as then, Arnie’s star power made him the focus throughout. Things look very different this time out.</p><p>And yes, sure, it looks like absolute gibberish, but I’m totally here for it. There is perhaps rather a lot of “BUT SHE’S DOING IT EVEN THOUGH SHE’S A GIRL!” energy throughout the trailer, but that’s still better than Brigitte Nielsen fighting to ever actually appear on screen as the main character. </p><p>The source material was written by Robert E. Howard, he of <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> fame, and while he was a giant old racist, he was also an advocate of presenting powerful female characters. That leaves me hopeful that under M. J. Bassett’s helm, we can at least see Sonja be a more significant brute.</p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that Fleischer’s version was absolutely bloody awful! He may have given us <em>Soylent Green</em> (1973) and <em>Fantastic Voyage</em> (1966), but they couldn’t all be bangers. It was deservedly mauled on release, with Gene Siskel handing it a single star in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. But try telling that to teenage me, watching it with mates, swigging from painfully cheap two-liter plastic bottles of cider.</p><p>The new movie doesn’t have a release date yet, beyond being some time this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/red-sonja-arnold-schwarzenegger-bassett-movie-trailer-1851786097]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">When Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4's roster was first revealed, one notable name was conspicuous in its absence: Bam Margera, one of the most famous skaters of the era who appeared in multiple Tony Hawk games, was the only one from THPS 3's original roster missing from the remake. Margera was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bam-margera-officially-returning-for-tony-hawk-pro-skater-34/1100-6531423/">eventually added to the game</a> in the 11th hour, and in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-return-of-bam-margera-iconic-skate-star-talks-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-thug-and-more/" rel="nofollow ">new interview with VGC</a>, Margera says a chance encounter with Tony Hawk in Los Angeles is the reason he's back in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Margera says that he was in LA at a time where he hadn't spoken with Hawk in about a year, when Margera "wasn’t doing too good." After a phone call and an invitation to the Hawk's Nest skate park, Margera says Hawk was impressed with his progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxow97z1h_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uxow97z1h_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I grabbed my skateboard, put on some knee pads, and we wound up ollieing over each other on the big channel," Margera said in the interview. "He’s like, 'What is going on? You are back.'" Margera explains that he recently married a stretch coach who has helped him improve his physical health, which has allowed him to return to skateboarding full-time.</p><p dir="ltr">"He was pretty blown away by that," Margera said. "And I think that, you know, really provoked him to make a call to Activision, knowing that there was already a deadline, but to see what kind of strings he could pull to get me back in it. Just from that special little visit."</p><p dir="ltr">Bam Margera joins a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 roster that also includes a mixture of new and legendary skaters, with names like Zion Wright, Margie Didal, Bob Burnquist, and Tony Hawk himself included in the mix. A few guests also appear as playable skaters, including the Doom Slayer from id Software's first-person shooter Doom and Michaelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p dir="ltr">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The week has built itself into another UK heatwave, and while I know some people will be loving all the sun, I’m honestly a little bit over all the heatwaves we’ve had this summer. I wouldn’t mind getting back to a bit of slightly drizzly misery for a few weeks. Either way, we’ve been able to stay out of the weather and play plenty of games.</p>
<p>Since previewing the game a little while ago, I’ve been continuing my ground-slapping adventure in Donkey Kong Bananza, which you’ll hear all about when the review embargo lifts before launch next week. I’ve also joined <strong>Miguel</strong> for some tactical SWAT action in Ready or Not… which you’ll also hear about when embargo lifts next week.</p>
<p>So let’s move on rather swiftly from all that secretive stuff and pay a visit to <strong>Steve’s </strong>den of gaming. He’s been playing FromSoftware classic Ninja Blade, initially starting with a German edition of the game before finding the German text unworkable and switching to an English version. “It’s not a good game,” he says, “but by God its one of the most video gamey games to ever game. You haven’t lived until you’ve played a FromSoft game in which a ninja called Ken pulls off a sick kick flip on a missile in mid air.”</p>

<p>He also played through all the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/gex-trilogy-review-the-joy-of-gex/">Gex Trilogy</a> games, dabbled with ReCore to meet his Xbox Rewards box-ticking, and started Space Marine 2 with his co-op buddies, which is “satisfyingly visceral”.</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> journey into Switch 2 gaming has seen him playing more Mario Kart World and being impressed by the update to Pokémon Violet – “I can’t stress enough that it’s still not a great game, but at least it works now.” That really was one of the most transformative free Switch 2 patches, I agree.</p>
<p>For <strong>Aran</strong>, he’s been finding Wild Hearts a more relaxed take on the Monster Hunter formula, while Ade has been playing some Eternal Strands, with awesome boss battles wrapped up in by-the-numbers exploration and combat. Oh, and he’s started to review Wuchang: Fallen Feathers which, true to its name, has an awful lot of feathers in it.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> game Blue Prince a try, but “while I like the concept there’s a bit too much cerebral busywork going on. My current casual gaming habits don’t exactly dovetail with roguelike puzzlers that require a healthy attention span and copious notetaking.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been enjoying Islanders: New Shores, which is a city-builder that’s brought some zen state relaxation to her life. “I’ve never reached the top of a gaming leaderboard before so I felt I’d achieved a (slightly sad) life-goal by becoming no.1 on the Islanders: New Shores worldwide leaderboard. It only lasted so long as I was competing with the small number of other pre-release gamers, but I’ll take it!”</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has had a bundle of very different games on the go, with the rhythm-action warfare of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a> getting that game’s chanting lodged in his game once more, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/">Ra Ra Boom</a> having some real beat ’em up potential.</p>

<p>And we’ll wrap things up with <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who played Chains of Freedom and then waves his arms around for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/maestro-review/">Maestro’s</a> review. He’s also played “an ungodly amount of Terraria with three mods that are so big I needed a fourth mod to get them to work together. And then twenty more mods. Then two more mods to improve storage and expand my inventory because there’s so much loot. It’s fantastic.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this past week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the pleasant surprises of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2 launch</a> was how well the hardware managed big games <em>not</em> made by Nintendo. It’s something the company’s underpowered consoles have often struggled with, but the Switch 2 is a good place to play technical showpieces like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> — though that originally debuted in 2020. <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4,</em> which is launching simultaneously on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and both versions of the Switch, makes for an interesting test case of what’s possible on the Switch 2 with a <em>new</em> game. I’ve been playing it on both the PS5 and Switch 2, and from what I’ve seen, the remake bodes well for the future of Nintendo’s newest console.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the latest <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> is a sequel of sorts. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21419054/tony-hawk-pro-skater-1-2-review-xbox-pc-ps4">In 2020, Activision released a remaster of the original two games in the iconic series</a>, maintaining the tone and structure but also modernizing the experience with updated graphics and controls, online features, and an expanded cast featuring the current generation of skateboarding stars. It did a remarkable job of keeping the best parts of the games while also making them feel current. <em><em>THPS3+4</em> </em>does the same thing, but for the third and fourth entries in the series. There aren’t too many surprises if you’ve played the original, though <em>THPS4</em> has a more rigid structure compared to the open-ended nature of the original version.</p><p>Performance is an important aspect of any skateboarding game. These titles are all about linking tricks together in creative ways, which can be hard to do when the game chugs or the frame rate stutters. So the thing that struck me the most with the Switch 2 version is just how smooth it is. It may sound boring, but the best part about it is that it just works. I haven’t experienced any technical issues in handheld mode, and that’s true whether playing in a simple indoor stage or something more elaborate, like the light-up show that is the Tokyo course from <em>THPS3</em>.</p><p>It seems that the developers at Iron Galaxy — who have taken over the series after the original studio, Vicarious Visions, unceremoniously became a Blizzard studio — prioritized substance over style, and it was the right choice. <em>THPS3+4</em> looks fine on the Switch 2, but the main difference you’ll notice on a platform like the PS5 is how much more detailed everything is. The backdrops feel more lively, though you might not notice it so much as you’re speeding through levels. The biggest difference is the characters. On the PS5, skaters like Tony Hawk and Aori Nishimura look like themselves; on the Switch 2, they’re slightly blurry approximations of their real-world counterparts.</p><p>The differences between platforms are largely cosmetic, though, which makes them much easier to tolerate, even in a genre where style is an incredibly important part of the experience. I’ll note that the various decks and clothes you can unlock still look pretty good on the Switch 2, so it’s not like you’re totally sacrificing the cool skater vibes. More importantly, <em>THPS</em> has always been an excellent series to play on the go — the Game Boy Advance iterations of the franchise have no right being as good as they are — and that remains true here, where the short runs are perfectly suited for portable play.</p><p>That being said, while <em>THPS3+4</em> is a good showcase for the Switch 2, it’s not exactly a “next-gen” game. It’s a rare experience that was built to span multiple generations of hardware from all the major platform holders. So it’s not exactly a sign that <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> or other tentpole blockbusters will make their way to the Switch 2. But the latest <em>Tony Hawk</em> game at least shows that the console won’t always be left behind when it comes to the newest releases.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/704560/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-nintendo-switch-2-comparison]]></content:encoded>

                <p>While it might be tempting to immediately load up Road to Glory or Dynasty when you first download <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, going to the settings menu is the best decision you can make. This allows you to customize every gameplay option in the game and learn about some of the new features that EA has added this year. One of the most important sections of the settings menu in College Football 26 is called "Passing Mechanics," and you'll want to ensure you pick the right options here.</p><p>These settings determine nearly everything about how passing works in CFB 26. However, some of the settings can be a little confusing, so we're going to break down the best Passing Mechanics to use.</p><h2>Best Passing Mechanics in College Football 26</h2><p>To get to the Passing Mechanics settings, all you have to do is load up the main menu of CFB 26 and look at the tab bar at the top of the screen. Here, you'll see the "Settings" tab near the end of the list. Scroll to Settings and then select "Gameplay Settings." In the Settings menu, scroll down in the "Game Options" tab until you reach Passing Mechanics.</p><p>As you'll see, there are a few different passing settings to tinker with, with the most important being "Passing Type." This setting can completely change how passing works in CFB 26, so you'll want to understand which one you're picking.</p><p>If you want a rundown of the best Passing Mechanics settings to select, take a look below:</p><ul><li><strong>Passing Type</strong>: Placement &amp; Accuracy</li><li><strong>Passing Slowdown</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Pass Lead Increase</strong>: Small</li><li><strong>Reticle Speed</strong>: 12-14</li><li><strong>Reticle Visibility</strong>: User Only</li><li><strong>Meter Visibility</strong>: User Only</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022"></a><figcaption>The Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg"></figure><p>For starters, the <strong>Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to be the best overall Passing Type</strong> you can use in CFB 26. The other options are: Placement, Classic Passing, and Revamped Passing. By default, you'll have Revamped Passing selected, which is a new spin on Classic Passing that allows for more control over the arc of passes. If you have an accurate quarterback, you can more accurately place balls where a receiver needs them to be to make a catch.</p><p>While you can stick with the shiny new Revamped Passing setting, Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to give you the most precision when it comes to throwing the ball. This adds a timing element to passing that allows you to make perfectly accurate passes on bullet passes. You'll also see some visual aids on screen that make it simpler to control a ball's placement and power. Placement &amp; Accuracy makes it easy to throw every kind of pass in CFB 26 as long as you understand how to use it correctly. If you want a new experience compared to CFB 25, though, you can stick with Revamped Passing and learn the new form of passing that EA's introduced.</p><p>Moving on, <strong>Passing Slowdown should always remain off</strong>, as there's no real need to have a slowdown during a pass. You'll also want <strong>Pass Lead Increase set to "small."</strong> What this does is give you a smaller window to lead receivers, which is what you want. You don't want to lead receivers too much when throwing a pass, as this can result in the ball getting outside their catch radius. If that happens, the pass will either fall incomplete or head the other way in a defender's hands.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Reticle Speed option</strong> is a personal preference: We found the <strong>12-14 range to be a sweet spot</strong>. However, if you want the reticle to move slower or faster, you can adjust it accordingly. The last two settings, <strong>Reticle Visibility</strong> and <strong>Meter Visibility</strong>, don't matter much; you can just leave them set to User Only.</p><p>That does it for the Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26. There's not much to them, but subtle changes can have a massive impact on your gameplay.
