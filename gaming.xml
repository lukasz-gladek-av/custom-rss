Though it retails for a fairly lofty $180, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14066852%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-controller-elite-series-2%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-elite-series-2-controller-receives-massive-discount-will-likely-sell-out%2F1100-6519463%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2 is currently on sale for only $108 on Verizon's online store</a>. You don't need to be a Verizon subscriber to take advantage of this deal, and it comes with free two-day shipping. Since this is the best Xbox Elite Series 2 deal we've seen in 2024, we don't expect this to be available for very long.</p><p>Verizon also has great deals on the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-14066852%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-controller-robot-white%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-elite-series-2-controller-receives-massive-discount-will-likely-sell-out%2F1100-6519463%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Robot White Xbox Wireless Controller ($36)</a> and the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-14066852%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-controller-pulse-red%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-elite-series-2-controller-receives-massive-discount-will-likely-sell-out%2F1100-6519463%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pulse Red edition ($39)</a>. Those controllers typically go for $60 and $65, respectively, and we rarely see them discounted to less than $45.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 offers the same great ergonomics as the standard Xbox Wireless Controller, but it has a better build quality, a textured grip, and some awesome customization features. Inside the box, you'll find four removable back paddles, an extra D-pad, and four additional analog stick caps that can be swapped on the fly. All of the extra components are neatly stored inside the included hardshell controller carrying case.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 also has trigger locks that reduce the pull length of RT and LT, which can be useful for certain types of games like first-person shooters. You can use the Xbox Accessories App on console and PC to save profiles to your controller and remap inputs.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14066852%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-controller-elite-series-2%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-elite-series-2-controller-receives-massive-discount-will-likely-sell-out%2F1100-6519463%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller</a> -- $108 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-14066852%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-controller-robot-white%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-elite-series-2-controller-receives-massive-discount-will-likely-sell-out%2F1100-6519463%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wireless Controller - Robot White</a> -- $36 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-14066852%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-wireless-controller-pulse-red%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-elite-series-2-controller-receives-massive-discount-will-likely-sell-out%2F1100-6519463%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wireless Controller - Pulse Red</a> -- $39 ($<del>60</del>)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4225600-eliteseries2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4225600" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4225600-eliteseries2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4225600"></a><figcaption>Xbox Elite Series 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4225600-eliteseries2.jpg"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-ipad-pro-ipad-air-2024-preorder-guide/1100-6523258/">Preorder Apple's 2024 iPad Pro And iPad Air - How To Get The Best Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorders Are Selling Out Fast</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (3)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-7-awesome-dungeon-crawlers-for-only-15/1100-6523253/">Grab 7 Awesome Dungeon Crawlers For Only $15</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal-saves-you-over-50-for-12-month-membership/1100-6523230/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Deal Saves You Over $50 For 12-Month Membership</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-star-wars-and-marvel-disney-plus-blu-rays-have-arrived-but-you-may-want-to-order-soon/1100-6521604/">New Star Wars And Marvel Disney Plus Blu-Rays Have Arrived, But You May Want To Order Soon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cast your minds back a month and you might remember Take-Two announcing <a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-layoffs-strauss-zelnick-gta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of layoffs and the closure of two studios</a>, not long after CEO Strauss Zelnick said the company had no plans for layoffs. Today, bizarrely, the man is claiming that the studios haven't been closed.</p><p>The two studios<a href="https://aftermath.site/kerbal-space-program-2-olliolli-rollerdrome-roll7-take-two" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that were reportedly closed, with everyone laid off</a>, were Intercept Games (<em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>) and Roll7 Studios (<em>OlliOlli</em>, <em>Rollerdrome</em>). But<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in an interview yesterday with <em>IGN</em></a>, when Zelnick was asked why he "shuttered" the two companies, his response is a weird one:</p><blockquote><p>We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>When<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN's reporter Reb Valentine pressed Zelnick to explain just what exactly was going on</a>--not a single person has appeared to have disputed the closure reports over the past month, including <em>anyone who worked there</em>--a "PR representative for the company stepped in" and said "we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what [our layoff count] looks like".</p><p>For context (and to support<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> his original reporting of the closures</a>), Bloomberg's Jason Schreier posted on Twitter a reminder that Zelnick has a history of doing this, dating as far back as 2K Marin's closure in 2013:</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact: In 2013, Strauss Zelnick’s company shut down BioShock 2 developer 2K Marin but wouldn’t acknowledge it, and acted in press releases as if the studio still existed when it in fact did not <a href="https://t.co/Jp2ZTsJDgA">https://t.co/Jp2ZTsJDgA</a></p>— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1791221008470278554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Confusing! What <em>appears </em>to be going on here is that regular human beings have looked at huge numbers of people being laid off from two development studios (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official notice of the layoffs at Intercept said the reason was its "closure"</a>), ending those studios’ ability to create video games, and are going forwards under the assumption both have been shuttered. The tech CEO Zelnick, meanwhile, is probably looking at some legal definition of a business closure--with both brands still on the books in <em>some</em> capacity--and thinks that means something!</p><p>If I turn up outside a restaurant I used to like and find the place empty--no chairs, no chefs, no waiters--then it's closed. I am not being fed tonight. To pretend it's still open just because there's a sign above the door is some real bullshit!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One is based around physical building blocks. The other is based around digital building blocks. And now, we have physical blocks of those digital blocks. So If you're a digital builder who's looking to branch out into the physical world, Minecraft LEGO provides an easy gateway for that transition.

            <p>
Wayfinder, the free-to-play online action-RPG from Darksiders developer Airship Syndicate, has been reworked and reannounced as a single-player paid title following Warframe developer Digital Extremes' decision to hand back publishing rights late last year.
</p>
<p>
Wayfinder released into early access last August as an online fantasy action-RPG with a free-to-play monetisation model similar to Warframe. This initial version combined small-scale dungeon crawling for up to three players with larger open zones accommodating 30-40 players.
</p>
<p>
However, after difficult year - Wayfinder amassed thousands of negative Steam reviews at launch as it battled with servers issues, then faced uncertainty after Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-confirms-a-number-of-layoffs-as-it-shuts-down-publishing-arm">closed its publishing arm</a> and handed the rights back to Airship - it's now received a significant overhaul.

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>This is what Wayfinder looked like when it was originally revealed.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYFU7jrMAIM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Airship's new version, titled Wayfinder Echoes, is a paid release with no monetisation and no online requirements. That's because it's been reimagined as a single-player game, albeit one that supports optional peer-to-peer three-player co-op. "We realise this is a big shift," the studio writes in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1171690/view/4174350531696890458?l=english">announcement post</a>, "but a necessary one to guarantee that the game is around forever."
</p>
<p>
Airship claims it's "touched every major system" for Wayfinder's re-release, and these changes include "all weapons becoming randomised drops with various slots, armour now having stats and being collectible, thousands of cosmetics and housing items available to collect, the removal of the grind to get new characters, eased requirements for awakening characters, increased housing item limits, adding four difficulties to choose from, incorporating traditional RPG talents into your progression, and much more."
</p>
<p>
Echoes will replace the previous version of Wayfinder when it soft-launches on 31st May for all existing players on Steam, adding a new Wayfinder (Grendel), new Hunts, and a new Overlands zone. It'll then return to the store as an early access title on 11th June, costing $24.99 USD - although that price is expected to rise come its 1.0 release on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation this "fall". As for the current PlayStation early access version, that'll transition to Wayfinder Echoes sometime this summer, albeit only on PS5 - the PS4 version is being discontinued, but there's a free upgrade to the PS5 version for players who can make use of it.
</p>
<p>
"We know that the path to get here hasn't been easy, and the game has had a rocky past," Airship writes. "We also know that this wasn't the original game that we envisioned or that our fans bought into. When faced with the reality of where we are, we saw our options as shuttering the game fully as other online games have done before or making this pivot and releasing the Echoes Update... We have ideas for additional characters and new content, and we have the intent to do so if the players demand it and Wayfinder finds a new audience."
</p>
<p>
Airship's announcement has been met with a mixture of understanding and disappointment over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayWayfinder/">Wayfinder's subreddit</a>. There's frustration that the game originally promised and paid for no longer exists (last year's early access release required players to purchase a Founder's Pack, ranging from $19.99 to $149.99), but the community also seems sympathetic to Airship's plight after losing Digital Extremes as a publisher.
</p>
<p>
The response on Steam is currently somewhat less forgiving, however. 136 negative reviews have been posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1171690/Wayfinder/">Wayfinder's Steam page</a> since Echoes' announcement versus 39 positive reviews, resulting in a Mostly Negative recent rating. Airship will be hoping to win those players over and nudge scores back into the blue once Echoes launches on 31st May.

at $60 for the essentials kit--or "0.0000000085642857% of the annual defense budget," according to Dbrand's math--and $75 for the travel kit, this bundle also includes an optional skin for customization.</p><p>The screen protector can also be added to either bundle for $20 extra. Dbrand says the cover has a precise fit over an ROG Ally, and the kickstand comes with built-in microSD card storage. This isn't the first time the company has made cases, as it has a line of Steam Deck accessories available as well. If you prefer console gaming, the Darkplates for PS5 consoles are also pretty great.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fsteam-deck-cases&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrand-project-killswitch%2F1100-6523392%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dbrand Steam Deck cases</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fspecial-edition%2Fps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdbrand-project-killswitch%2F1100-6523392%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dbrand PS5 Darkplates</a></li></ul><p>Now could be a good time to consider getting an ROG Ally, as with a mid-gen refresh on the horizon, prices could drop soon.

            <p>
Take-Two Interactive chief exexutive officer Strauss Zelnick has claimed the publisher has not shut down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games, despite reports and evidence to the contrary earlier this month.
</p>
<p>
Word of Intercept Games' demise - and the loss 70 jobs at the studio - came via a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">Washington state closure notice</a> submitted by Take-Two itself, and was corroborated by affected employees on social media. Later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported Roll7's closure after reviewing an internal email breaking the news to Take-Two staff.
</p>
<p>
It's somewhat surprising, then, that Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick is claiming, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">conversation with IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, "We didn't shutter those studios."
</p>

</div><figcaption>Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign Game Pass publishing is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear," Zelnick told the publication. "And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165m in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything."
</p>
<p>
When IGN asked Zelnick if he was denying the reports of Roll7 and Intercept's closure, a Take-Two Interactive PR representative stepped in, saying, "In the 8-K filing that we put out we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5 percent reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like."
</p>
<p>
Following IGN's third attempt to determine if the studios still existed, the PR responded, "We have not provided any additional colour beyond what I just said."
</p>
<p>
It's a bewildering assertion, then, and hard to square with everything that's come to light since the reports of closures first broke - but hopefully Take-Two will offer more clarity on Roll7 and Intercept's status as confusion over Strauss' claims inevitably grows.
</p>
<p>
"Roll7 wasn't just a company making games, it was a no-crunch-toting, skateboarding, down-to-earth collection of people creating things only it could create," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goodbye-roll7-you-deserved-so-much-better">lament for Roll7</a> earlier this month. "What's galling is that it's this kind of game, and the perceived value of it, that Private Division and Take-Two are apparently OK with sacrificing. Of all the games and studios on their books, these are the ones that can go."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</a> is available on PC as of today, and it offers the full suite of upscaling options, including DLSS 3, FSR 3, and XeSS (check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-gpu-80-fps-native-4k-ghost-of-tsushima-over-200-fps-dlss-3-rtx-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game’s performance with DLSS 3 here</a>). Interestingly, Ghost of Tsushima also offers something other games don’t – the ability to combine DLSS upscaling with FSR 3 frame generation.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this? Well, DLSS 3 frame generation is locked behind RTX 40 Series cards, while the open-source FSR 3 has no such restrictions. So, Ghost of Tsushima’s setup allows somebody with, say, an RTX 3090 to take advantage of DLSS upscaling <em>and</em> FSR 3 frame generation for a sort of “best of both worlds” situation. Certain mods make this possible in other games, but Ghost of Tsushima seems to offer the option <em>without</em> mods. A user on X reports playing at 4K with 170fps with an RTX 3090.</p>

<p>AMD had previously announced FSR 3.1 would decouple frame generation from other FSR features, but this seems to be the first game to actually usher that in. At the very least, it’s a nice way for AMD to market FSR to NVIDIA-owning folks who want frame generation, but aren’t up for buying an RTX 40 card yet.</p>
<p>The PC version of Ghost of Tsushima has generated some controversy for requiring PSN for its Legends multiplayer mode (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-psn-account-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it's not needed for single-player</a>) particularly since that means it's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-delisted-steam-psn-despite-singleplayer-not-needing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delisted from a long list of countries that don’t support PSN</a>, but thus far there doesn’t seem to be the same level of backlash there was with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a>. The game currently has an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">81 percent “very positive” user score on Steam</a> and logged a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2215430/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy 57,000+ concurrent users on its first day on PC</a>.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut can now be played on PC, PS4, and PS5. Are you picking up the game? Planning to do a little DLSS+FSR wizardry to blow out the game’s framerate?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/x-men-97s-astonishing-ending-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=x-men-97s-astonishing-ending-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<figure data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false"><strong>‘Tolerance is Extinction—Part 3’ brought the first season of Disney’s <em>X-Men ’97</em> to a finale that was as emotional as it was epic. </strong>While our titular heroes send Bastion and his army of Prime Sentinels to the scrap heap, the rest of the world assumes that Charles Xavier and his students sacrificed themselves to save them.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Of course, this is a Marvel series, and the final moments of <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s finale reveal that the X-Men are alive. The episode also hints at where the show’s already-confirmed second season may be heading. There’s a lot to discuss, so let’s break down the final episode of <em>X-Men ’97</em> and what its many revelations and cameos mean for the series’ future.</p>
 <h2 id="h-x-men-97-s-finale-ends-one-story-and-begins-a-few-more" data-injectable="false"><strong>X-Men ’97’s finale ends one story and begins a few more</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">To say that things don’t look good for the X-Men at the start of ‘Tolerance is Extinction—Part 3’ is quite an understatement. By the end of the previous episode, a Bastion-possessed Cable had dealt a seemingly fatal blow to Jean Grey, and Xavier was locked in a psychic duel with Magneto, who was trying to send Asteroid M crashing down to Earth.</p>
 <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, the tides of battle soon turn in the X-Men’s favor. Xavier convinces Magneto to let go of his pain and fight for a better future. At the same time, a Phoenix-Force-empowered Jean slaps a power-dampening collar onto Bastion, cutting the Prime Sentinel threat off at its source. Refusing to accept defeat, Bastion forces Asteroid M to continue its collision course, driving the U.N. to initiate the “Magneto Protocols” and send a wave of warheads toward the meteor.</p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">Pulling together as a team, the X-Men fight as one and bring Bastion to his knees, allowing Magneto to stop Asteroid M’s descent with his magnetic powers. Unfortunately, Asteroid M explodes, and the X-Men and Magneto are caught in the blast, leaving Juibille, Sunspot, and Forge as the only apparent heirs of Xavier’s dream. However, six months later, a despondent Forge is approached by the X-Men’s time-traveling ally, Bishop, who reveals that the team is alive but scattered across time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-past-and-future-of-the-x-men-is-apocalyptic" data-injectable="false"><strong>The past and future of the X-Men is apocalyptic</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">One group of time-displaced X-Men, consisting of Beast, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Magneto, and Xavier, finds itself in ancient Egypt. They quickly run to the aid of a chalky-skinned mutant menaced by soldiers. After Xavier smooths things over with his telepathy, the mutant reveals his name is En Sabah Nur, which X-Men fans will recognize as <strong>the original nom-de-plume of the iconic X-Men villain Apocalypse</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As this happens, Cyclops and Jean awaken in a distant, barren future, where they encounter a clan of robed, tattooed warriors known as Clan Askani, another Apocalypse-related name that comic fans might have clocked. The clan’s leader, Mother Askani, arrives to question the pair, accompanied by a preteen version of their son Nathan Summers. Nathan, born in the series’ second episode, had to be sent to the future after the Techno-Organic Virus infected him, and it looks like this is where he ended up.</p>
 <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">On top of all this, a post-credits scene confirms almost beyond a doubt that Apocalypse will be the big bad of <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s second season. Surveying the ruins of Genosha, the mutant nation that went up in smoke in <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s fifth episode, the present-incarnation version of Apocalypse muses on the sorry-state mutantkind is currently in, scooping one of Gambit’s charred playing cards out from the ashes before smiling ominously.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-x-men-may-be-about-to-enter-the-age-of-apocalypse" data-injectable="false"><strong>The X-Men may be about to enter the age of apocalypse</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">If the hints are anything to go on, <em>X-Men 97</em>‘s second season will be a mash-up of several X-Men storylines centered around Apocalypse. While Apocalypse was one of the main villains of <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em>, the series never explored the origins of the first mutant. With members of the X-Men face-to-face with the man who will become Apocalypse, <em>X-Men ’97</em>‘s second season is perfectly positioned to adapt 1996’s “The Rise of Apocalypse,” which followed <strong>En Sabah Nur’s rise from rebellious slave to tyrannical villain</strong>.</p>
 <p data-characters="605" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">On the opposite end of the spectrum, Cyclops and Jean’s bleak future shares more than a few elements with t<strong>he one featured in the infamous “Age of Apocalypse” storyline.</strong> This crossover event depicts an alternate timeline created when Xavier’s time-traveling son, Legion, accidentally kills his father before he forms the X-Men, allowing Apocalypse to conquer the world. Since the first season of <em>X-Men ’97</em> focused on villains who wanted to exterminate mutants, it would make sense for the second season to pit the team against a foe who seeks to bring about mutant supremacy.</p>
 <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Apocalypse’s interest in Gambit, who gave his life to end the massacre of Genosha, might be the subtlest nod of them all, but it’s one fan of the Cajun card-slinger (like me) who was happy to see. During the “Blood of Apocalypse” storyline, <strong>Gambit joined the ranks of Apocalypse’s guard, the Four Horseman, specifically occupying the seat of Death</strong>. With Wolverine, who also became a Horseman, MIA, there’s plenty of reason to worry that some of the most powerful X-Men may not be fighting on the side of justice in <em>X-Men ’97</em> Season 2.</p>
 <h2 id="h-x-men-97-sets-the-stage-for-an-epic-extended-animated-universe" data-injectable="false"><strong>X-Men ’97 sets the stage for an epic extended animated universe</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Disney+</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="799" data-injectable="true">If there’s one thing that X-Men ’97 made clear throughout its ten-episode run, it’s that the X-Men aren’t the only superheroes in this animated reimagining of the Marvel Universe. <em>X-Men: The Animated Series </em>aired alongside a few animated Marvel shows, <strong>including <em>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</em>, <em>Fantastic Four</em>, and <em>Incredible Hulk</em></strong>. Characters from one show would regularly cameo in another, and <em>X-Men ’97</em> proved that it was ready to continue that pattern very early on.</p>
 <p data-characters="570" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">While Captain America’s surprise debut in episode 7, “Bright Eyes,” was a delightful surprise, small potatoes compared to the array of cameos that crop up throughout the final three episodes. Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther are just a few of the heroes who show up to lend a hand in the fight against the Prime Sentinels. Perhaps the most surprising was the appearance of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-marvels-spider-man-2/">Spider-Ma</a>n, who appeared both in costume and as Peter Pakerer, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mary Jane Watson and Flash Thompson as Asteroid M closes in on Earth. </p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">With most of the team on opposite ends of history and an increasing focus on non-mutant heroes, it looks like <em>X-Men ’97</em>‘s second season plans to build on everything that made the first season great while expanding the series’ scope to greater heights. Now that the stakes are higher than ever, only time will tell what the future holds for the X-Men.</p>

                <p>Mojang, the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft,</a> has teamed up with Google for the game's 15th anniversary on May 17. The collaboration adds an Easter egg to the Google search engine, allowing users to start mining like they would in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">To get the Easter egg to work, users must search for Minecraft, Minecraft Bedrock Edition, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Steve, or any other version of the game. After doing that, a small Minecraft icon will appear as a button on screen. After clicking it, a hand will appear allowing users to break off specific parts of the page.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4304296-minecraft-googlesearch-googlechrome5_16_20241_13_10pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304296" data-ratio="0.56263421617752" data-width="1397" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4304296-minecraft-googlesearch-googlechrome5_16_20241_13_10pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304296"></a><figcaption>Here's how it looks in action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4304296-minecraft-googlesearch-googlechrome5_16_20241_13_10pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As they break off more pages, different biomes will be revealed, including places like The Nether and The End. To exit this feature, all users have to do is click the X on the bottom of the screen.

            <p>
2K Games is poised to reveal the next game in one of its "biggest and most beloved" franchises, with the grand unveiling set to happen in June.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the big reveal is scheduled for Friday, 7th June, and will take place during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">big Summer Game Fest live event</a>.
</p>
<p>
News of 2K's impending reveal came via <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718">Summer Game Fest's official social media account</a>, but details remain vague. It offered no hints as to what might be coming, leaving everyone to speculate what, exactly, that "biggest and most beloved" franchises could be.

</div>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>
BioShock is an obvious candidate, given 2K <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">confirmed a new series entry was in development</a> all the way back in 2019. Little has been revealed about the project since then, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">report in 2021</a> claimed the title - which is being developed by new studio Cloud Chamber - would be set in an Antarctic city sometime during the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, it's possible 2K Games' big reveal will be a new Mafia title - Mafia 3 developer Hangar 13 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">confirmed it was working on one</a> back in August 2022.  As with BioShock, little is known about this latest Mafia project beyond reports it'll be a prequel to the existing trilogy. However, a 2024 reveal might be a little premature given it was still "a few years away" when it was announced in 2022.
</p>
<p>
So what else? It's always possible Gearbox - which 2K parent company Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">acquired from Embracer</a> earlier this year - will have something to show. References to Borderlands 4 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland 2 both surfaced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-and-tiny-tinas-wonderland-2-have-popped-up-on-a-linkedin-profile">on a former Gearbox technical director's LinkedIn profile</a> late last year, even though neither has been formally confirmed.

A Borderlands announcement would arguably make the most sense, however, seeing as 2K and Gearbox will almost certainly want to push something out to coincide with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-first-look-shows-red-haired-cate-blanchett-staring-into-a-manhole">Borderlands movie</a>, which is currently due to hit cinemas in August this year. Thankfully, it won't be long until 2K puts all this specualtion to rest, given 7th June is just three weeks away.
</p>
<p>
News of an impending 2K Games reveal arrives alongside word Take-Two and Rockstar are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">gearing up to launch Grand Theft Auto 6 in "fall" next year</a>. Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">recently laid of 550 employees</a> and cancelled multiple in-development projects - reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">shutting down Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games and OlliOlli World developer Roll7</a> in the process - as part of a major restructuring programme.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Earlier this month, Take-Two announced a cost reduction plan that included project cancellations, the layoffs of 5% of its workforce, and other spending cuts. Amid this announcement came<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> reports based on internal documentation</a> that seemed to confirm Take-Two was closing OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games.</p><p>But when I asked Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in a call today why these closures happened, he told me, "We didn't shutter those studios":</p><blockquote>We didn't shutter those studios, to be clear. And we are always looking at our release schedule across all of our studios to make sure that it makes sense. So we are being very judicious because we are in the middle of a cost reduction program that we've already concluded and are now fully rolling out. We've announced that we're saving $165 million in existing and future costs, but we haven't shuttered anything.</blockquote><p>The reports, which came both from a WARN Act notice <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-confirms-kerbal-space-program-2-is-safe-despite-seattle-layoffs#close-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out by Game Developer</a> and internal documentation seen by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, seemed pretty definitive, so this was a surprising response. [<strong>Update</strong>: Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has since <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791236904580436176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a snippet of the document on Twitter/X</a> as well.] I followed up by asking Zelnick if he was denying the reports, at which point a PR representative for the company stepped in with the following:</p><blockquote>What we've said is, in the 8-K filing that we put out we talked about the cost reduction plan is approximately 5% reduction in headcount worldwide, but we did not give a label-by-label breakdown of what that looks like.</blockquote><p>I tried one more time, asking if the studios existed or not. PR reiterated that "We have not provided any additional color beyond what I just said."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today.</p></div><p>If you're wondering what to make of all this, you're in good company. The WARN Act notice for Intercept Games in Seattle specified a "closure" as the reason for the layoffs of 70 people, which is roughly the entire total of all the employees there. It does seem possible Take-Two has somehow folded both of these studios into Private Division, given that the label will be taking up maintenance of Kerbal Space Program 2 going forward. I asked Zelnick if we should take these reports as a sign that Private Division itself is in some kind of trouble:</p><blockquote>I don't think so. I think, as I said, we're reviewing all of the projects company-wide, and sometimes we do have to make hard choices. We just tend to leave those announcements to the label, we don't tend to talk about them, so we're not trying to be cute or difficult today. It's just that we don't tend to bring those discussions into these meetings.</blockquote><p>In a follow-up email, Take-Two PR clarified that the "entire organization" contributed to cost-saving efforts, and that Private Division was still planning on supporting games such as Moon Studio's No Rest for the Wicked, and upcoming games Tales of the Shire and an unrevealed Gamefreak project the publisher announced last year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On our last few calls, Zelnick had told me that the company was in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-publisher-is-in-growth-mode-in-wake-of-gta-6-announcement">"growth-mode"</a> and, as recently as February, that it had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-they-have-no-current-plans-for-layoffs-amid-cost-reduction-program">"no current plans"</a> for layoffs. He's spoken before about the state of the industry post-pandemic, noting that other companies undergoing layoffs had gotten "a little fat and happy during the pandemic" and had overspent as a result. But now, he's admitting that Take-Two is, at least to some degree, in that some boat:</p><blockquote>We were very fortunate during the pandemic, we did really well as did many of our competitors. But I said, when asked during the pandemic, that we expected post-pandemic demand to be below that of the pandemic demand, but above pre-pandemic demand, and that's exactly what did happen. That said, I think we did get out over our skis a little bit, and I think we were overly ambitious in terms of building a fixed overhead. We have this three-part strategy to be the most creative, the most innovative, the most efficient company in the business, and I'm not sure we were delivering fully on the promise of efficiency.</blockquote><blockquote>The hardest thing I do as a chief executive is part ways with friends and colleagues, and that's always the last choice we make. We always try to find efficiencies elsewhere, through vendors, the way we structure, through operations. At times, though, it's unavoidable, and this is one of those moments. So we are reducing our headcount by about 5%. It doesn't feel good to do it, but it is our obligation to be a really efficient business, and the good news is we do feel like we're structured really well going forward and we have the right amount of operating leverage, so as we bring this new pipeline to bear, we will generate the results that reflect that.</blockquote><p>As for Intercept Games and Roll7, the prognosis still doesn't seem great. What's even stranger is that this isn't the first time Take-Two has done something like this to a Kerbal Space Program developer in particular. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/star-theory-reportedly-shutters-after-take-two-takes-over-kerbal-space-program-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2020</a>, a studio called Star Theory was making Kerbal Space Program 2 before Private Division took the game away from them. While some employees were moved to Intercept Games, the rest were left adrift to desperately pitch new projects to save the studio...only to have the COVID-19 pandemic cut off their pitching opportunities and lead to the studio's closure. 2K Marin was similarly closed quietly, without Take-Two formally acknowledging the change.</p><p>Today, Take-Two Interactive reported full year net revenue of $5.35 billion, and a net loss of $3.7 billion. A significant portion of the reported loss is connected to impairment charges and business reorganization charges related to the company's cost-reduction programs, leading to operating expenses that were up 69% year-over-year. Take-Two also announced it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive">expects to release Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall of 2025</a>, while Grand Theft Auto 5 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold">surpassed 200 million units sold life to date</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review.873558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>It’s safe to say that Gray Zone Warfare isn’t trying to be an accessible extraction shooter like Call of Duty Warzone’s DMZ mode, but rather one for the hardcore realism set who want to feel the thrill of high-stakes victory and the agony of bleeding out after getting shot in the leg as you try to limp toward the chopper. Not everyone wants to fuss with deciding between 7.32 parabellum vs full metal jacket rounds, or dealing with the fact that 5.56x59mm rounds don’t fit in a magazine for 5.56x72mm. But for those who do, it serves that audience fairly well in its early access state – at least, when it isn’t crashing, failing to register clear hits, or making you and your friends wait in line for your ride home. </p><p>You and your four-person squad undertake very basic missions into hostile territory, completing tasks, clearing AI enemies, and gathering gear or quest items to take back with you. Dying on the battlefield means any equipment on you is lost, as you respawn empty handed back at camp, which does a great job making every death feel consequential. It is often possible to find your corpse and retrieve your lost gear, but you run the risk of others scavenging your goods, or dying on the retrieval attempt, and having your body despawn, which is effective at reinforcing an exciting sense of tension. That loop of deploy, fight, and extract is engaging thanks to challenging combat, and the irresistible pull of new and better equipment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Gray Zone Warfare Early Access Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The battlefield and equipment strongly resemble the Vietnam war era, and in keeping with that setting, surviving out there is appropriately tough. Enemies, be they AI combatants or humans from opposing factions, are observant and accurate enough to pump rounds into you with lethal efficiency if you give them the chance. The sense of danger is palpable and exciting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The sense of danger is palpable and exciting.&nbsp;</p></div><p>They are also durable, capable of shrugging off a surprising amount of gun shots and stab wounds. Some of that can be attributed to Gray Zone Warfare’s ambitious realistic damage system. There are no “hit points” per se; instead, bodies attempt to simulate the actual effects of wounds. You won’t be able to instantly take down a bad guy by shooting them in their limbs or much of their torso, but shots to the right part of the chest or head can do the job. It elevates the importance of very accurate shooting in a way that I really like: it’s more challenging and more rewarding when you lock into a John-Wick like Zen state and decimate your adversaries with deadly precision. If it catches on, this could forever end the “LOL I killed you by shooting your foot” phenomenon of video game shooters.</p><p>However, when you’re on the receiving end it’s a great example of where simulation and fun are often at odds. Sure, you can often shrug off incoming non-lethal damage and fight a bit longer. But those wounds still exist, and eventually bleeding out after a firefight you “won” is pretty common. There are field medical options like bandages, splints, and medicines, but even if you successfully keep the looming specter of death at bay, your wounded warrior is extremely compromised and a lot harder to enjoy. It’s frustrating and anticlimactic to gear up with a squad for a deep incursion into enemy territory, only to have to limp back to extraction after the first time bullets fly because you took a few unfortunate hits. If I wanted to suffer the consequences of my sloppy mistakes in battle, I’d enlist.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If I wanted to suffer the consequences of my sloppy mistakes in battle, I’d enlist.</p></div><p>But of course, the most frustrating times are the too frequent occasions when the damage system just doesn’t work because hit registration is unreliable. Shots that appear to be on the mark do no damage whatsoever. </p><h2>Tickets to the Gun Show</h2><p>Not every bullet is realistic, but the weapons sure are – to a fault, sometimes. Take one of your starting guns, for example: the M4 rifle. While it’s hard to find a military shooter that doesn’t use the M4A1 carbine, often with a few choices of optional accessories, GZW drills down to its individual parts to an impressive degree. Want to trade in the better handling of your short barrel for the great accuracy of a longer one? Sure. Interested in that scope? Better grab the mount first, because it won’t just clip onto the weapon’s frame by itself. It’s impressive that you can buy and swap in over a dozen parts to essentially build your own M4 from scratch, transforming it from a compact and lightweight gun for close-up fighting into something longer with powerful optics to use as a versatile sniper rifle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It’s fascinating how in-depth it is… and what an absolute pain in the ass it can be to figure out if you aren’t already a walking encyclopedia of gun parts. You can either just guess and check which parts fit together through trial and error, or jump online and learn about how it all assembles in real life. Being dense isn’t necessarily a bad thing – it’s actually one of the things I really like about GZW – but the lack of any sort of tooltips or tutorialization stands out as a big miss because it turns away people who would be interested to learn about how these guns work if it would bother to teach us. Even if you know the broad strokes, such as how hollow point rounds are a better choice for unarmored enemies because of the size of wounds they create, figuring out how to use them is way too cumbersome. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s fascinating how in-depth it is… and what an absolute pain in the ass it can be to figure out.</p></div><p>But assuming you can get over that hump, once you are geared up it’s time to head out into the field. The options here are pretty limited in the current early access version, however. You can either run around the open-world map getting into fights and gathering loot off of fallen enemies, or work through a list of tasks handed out by vendors in your camp who generally send you out into the world to find or kill something. They do a good job pushing you to interesting areas, like new towns or enemy hideouts, and the loot that you’re rewarded with at the end is often excellent. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>Justin's favorite military shooters</h3></p></div><p>This issue with tasks comes primarily from the shared-world nature of GZW. With multiple squads all spread around the map shooting at anything that moves, it is all too common for targets to be dead before you arrive, so you have to twiddle your thumbs until the enemies respawn. That can take around 15 minutes, and hiding in a corner somewhere waiting, hoping no other squads come through in that time to take the kill, isn’t much fun. There are also frequently objectives that’re literally locked behind doors, and the keys to open them are painfully infrequent random drops from enemies. Each key only works in one specific lock, and it’s a common enough problem that players have built coordinated key exchanges. It’s testament to what I’ve found to be a very helpful and supporting player base, but it’s ultimately a community driven Band-Aid for an unnecessary self-inflicted wound.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The map is really effective at using geography as an almost natural level-select tool.</p></div><p>At least you’ll have some sights to take in while you’re waiting around, because GZW is already a very good looking game. It’s genuinely impressive how lush and full the more than 40 square kilometers of jungles, towns, and rice are on this vaguely Southeast Asian island. Dense foliage reaches far and wide and character models look great, as does the equipment, whether it’s the lovingly recreated weapons or the ‘90s-style fannypack you “liberated” from its former owner. It would be easy for that much landmass to feel empty, particularly with the lack of drivable vehicles, but here it’s really well laid out: There’s enough space between fights to take a  breather, but it’s dense enough that action is never far away. Towns near starting areas are crawling with lightly armored AI enemies, but the troops you encounter become more dangerous the farther you push. Finally, there’s a bigger focus on PvP in the zones where the player factions intersect. The map is really effective at using geography as an almost natural level-select tool, and I appreciate the sense that I was in control of what sort of challenge I was in the mood to take on. </p><p>But, unsurprisingly for an early access game, it doesn’t run well right now. I had squadmates with solid PCs that would struggle with low framerates much of the time. Even my beefy RTX 3090 dips down into the 20 frames per second range when moving quickly through the jungle, which is not great when accuracy matters so much. Similarly, you need to be prepared for crashes to desktop, items disappearing from your inventory, and character models missing their heads (without having been shot there yet), to name a few issues my squad and I encountered. At this point you have to be willing to chalk up some frustrating losses that don’t have anything to do with errors you make on the battlefield. To their credit, the development team has continued to release fixes at a pretty regular cadence, but it’s impossible to know how long it’ll take to get Gray Zone out of this danger zone. </p><p>One of the areas in need of a fix is the faction system, particularly because you can only have one character on your account. When you start it up you select one of three private military contractors to represent, which is a permanent but fairly meaningless decision because they all have the same missions, gear, and vendors to pick from. There are two issues with this, and the first is that it’s a missed opportunity to create more distinct identities between groups (hopefully one that’ll be corrected). Instead, the only functional difference is which edge of the map your base of operations will occupy. But the larger issue with the faction system is you can only form squads with people in the same company as you, so if you want to play with friends you either need to all decide in advance which team to represent, or someone is going to have to delete their character entirely and start from scratch in the correct faction. Losing all your money, weapons, and task progress just to play with friends is tragically bitter pill to swallow.</p><p>As you explore farther and farther around the region you unlock various landing zones, which are critically important given how big the area is and how long walking back to base can take. The good news is that calling in a chopper to ferry you to or from a mission is easily done from the map, and the few minutes it usually takes to wait for extraction can be tense and exciting. The bad news is that our military contractors cheaped out when it came to buying birds, because each faction only has four at their disposal. “Request denied” is an aggravatingly frequent thing to hear when you are trying to hitch a ride, and it’s completely out of your control whether other teams are ahead of you in line. Worse, the helicopters aren’t immediately free once they finish a dropoff – you need to wait for them to fly off the map before they can come back and get you. It’s another unnecessary obstacle to fun, and an all too common frustrating waste of time. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Gray Zone Warfare’s early access version has some excellent ideas for a highly realistic take on an extraction shooter, but most of them come with a caveat or two at this point. Yes, the map is huge, lush, and full of enemies to shoot at, but you will need to be prepared to wait far too long for rides to and from objectives. The damage system is realistic and immersive, but it shoots itself in the foot with unreliable hit registration, and playing wounded is a lot less fun. The detailed weapons are painstakingly true to life, with lots of great customization options, but if you don’t already subscribe to Soldier of Fortune magazine it’s going to be tough to make great use of it. The enthusiasm and ambition behind this game is palpable, even if it is currently rough, buggy, and too often unreliable. But like a greasy burger at a roadside dive, its charm isn’t in craftsmanship, it’s in the earnestness. While its flaws are a bit too numerous to list, much less completely overlook, it can hit the spot just right if you have the right sort of hunger.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the launch seemed more in reach now that we’re nearly midway through 2024, it appears we’ll have to wait another full year before playing it.</p>

<p>Publisher Take-Two released its <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e357ad06-0762-4e80-b80c-e3869252fdfe">2024 year-end financial report</a> today (thanks, <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-narrowed-to-fall-2025-but-theres-still-no-pc-launch-date-confirmed/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com">PC Gamer</a></em>), in which it states that Rockstar is targeting a Fall 2025 release window for GTA VI.

</article><p>Regarding GTA VI, Take-Two states, “We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.” The game is slated to release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A PC version has <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-confirmed-for-2025-no-mention-of">yet to be mentioned.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes players to a modern-day Vice City (the franchise's parody of Miami, FL) and stars two protagonists, a female inmate named Lucia and her still-unnamed criminal male partner.

<p data-characters="198" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The M16 was one of the worst weapons in <em>MW2</em>, and nothing changed in <em>MW3</em> to make the assault rifle worth using either. However, a new aftermarket part finally vaults the M16 into meta conversations. </p> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="446" data-injectable="true">Players unlock the JAK Patriot conversion kit by completing all Season 3 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-season-3-week-7-weekly-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Week 7 challenges</a>, transforming the M16 from a three-round burst into a fully automatic weapon. By sacrificing damage and suffering a small loss in accuracy, the M16 garners more attention with fully automatic capabilities. The time-to-kill potential of 299ms is above average for the class, and the M16 can kill enemies in five shots up to 40 meters, which is impressive. </p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">However, the TTK suffers a massive drop-off after that distance, so players shouldn’t try to use this weapon in anything longer than a mid-range gunfight. With that being said, here is the best set of attachments to use. </p> <h2 id="h-best-m16-jak-patriot-loadout-in-mw3" data-injectable="false">Best M16 JAK Patriot loadout in <em>MW3</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Komodo Heavy </li> <li><strong>Underbarrel: </strong>FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip </li> <li><strong>Optic: </strong>JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Sakin ZX Grip </li> <li><strong>Conversion Kit: </strong>JAK Patriot </li> </ul> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">The M16 with the<strong> JAK Patriot </strong>equipped suffers from a hard recoil that is sharp to the left and straight up. So, our loadout focuses on improving horizontal recoil to mitigate that issue. The Komodo Heavy Barrel, FTAC SP-10 Angled Grip, and <strong>Sakin ZX Grip</strong> all improve a combination of horizontal and vertical recoil, gun kick, or firing aim stability. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Even with this set of attachments, the M16’s recoil will be noticeable. Thankfully, it’s a predictable pattern, so players should have no issue pulling down on the right stick and mowing down enemies easily. Other ARs might still be better on paper, but it’s refreshing to finally have an M16 worth using after two years of irrelevance.</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>World of Warcraft Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> is a new time-limited event. It’s running now until August 19. If you’re interested in checking it out, you can play free up to level 20. Then, all you need is to have an active<em> WoW </em>subscription. No extra expansions are required.</p> <h2 id="h-how-do-i-create-a-new-timerunning-character" data-injectable="false">How do I create a new Timerunning character?</h2> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">On the character select screen, click the <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria </em>button in the upper left. You can also select “Create New Character” and select a Timerunning character. From there, create any character you would like (server restrictions still apply). Once you enter the world, you’ll have a short questline to go through to introduce you to the new mechanics of Timerunning.</p>

Speak to Eternus up ahead and begin your questline. She’ll have you defeat an easy enemy real quick to collect some Temporal Threads. She’ll task you with speaking to Moratari nearby to learn more. As you might expect, you’ll have a few combat assignments to get through. Once you finish those, she’ll have you speak to Horos to purchase a Chronobadge. This vendor also sells a lot of mounts and toys that you won’t be able to afford any time soon. Now, speak to Momentus to forge your artifact. Once you turn in that quest, you’ll have a new Cloak of Infinite Potential.</p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">She will task you with finding another Infinite Reaver to kill and collect some thread off of. Afterward, she sends you to face the big boss of this area. A nasty time elemental named Eratus is causing problems nearby, so go crush that real quick. Don’t worry if you see an army of Infinite Reavers spawn around him, Eternus will take care of those. Turn in the quests and prepare to teleport to your new adventure in Pandaria!</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">As a reminder, your characters are locked to the continent until the event ends in August. You won’t have access to the Auction House, either. So go out there and level up your cloak, get crazy new abilities, and enjoy this wild new mode.</p>

But that time’s over. Rockstar announced that it would reveal the game’s first trailer on Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Unfortunately, an early leak prompted the company to release the trailer more than half a day earlier than planned, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">revealing <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will bring the series back to Vice City</a>, and it showed off a new protagonist, Lucia.</p><p>Though Rockstar Games has kept mum on what to expect from the next installment in the series, we do have a bit of an idea of what the game looks like thanks to a hacker leaking 90 videos’ worth of material.

  <p id="TOqiXl"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085152/hulu-shogun-episode-1-review-fx"><em>Shōgun</em></a><em> </em>is an early contender for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24078257/best-tv-2024-shows-series">2024’s best TV show</a>. The series, which debuted in February, is smart, complicated, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode">tremendously well made</a>, beautifully acted, and the most watched FX series ever, according to a press release from the network. All of which makes Thursday’s announcement that the show is coming back for more season pretty unsurprising. The only question that remains is what exactly those seasons are going to be about. </p>
<p id="rnYFPP">According to FX’s announcement, the series is coming back for two additional seasons. Development on the new seasons will begin soon, with work taking place between FX and the estate of original <em>Shōgun </em>author, James Clavell. The upcoming seasons will also bring back many of the key talents behind season 1, including co-creators, showrunners, executive producers, and writers, Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo, as well as executive producer Michaela Clavell, and producer and series star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091458/shogun-episode-3-review-toranaga-actor-hiroyuki-sanada">Lord Yoshii Toranaga in season 1</a>.</p>
<p id="3bfqQz"><em>Shōgun’</em>s first season is an adaptation of James Clavell’s novel of the same name, which was originally released in 1975. The show’s first season adapts Clavell’s entire (very long) novel, which leaves the question of what exactly it will cover in its next two seasons up for debate. </p>

<p id="wF58Et">One possible option for the show could be looking to Clavell’s other work for inspiration. While <em>Shōgun </em>is unquestionably the most popular of the books, Clavell actually wrote three more novels in his Asian Saga, with <em>Shōgun </em>being the first chronologically. He also wrote <em>Tai-Pan</em>, a book about two traders venturing into Hong Kong in the 1840s after the First Opium War, <em>Gai-Jin</em>, a sequel to <em>Tai-Pan</em> set 20 years later and mostly in Japan, and <em>Noble House</em>, which is set back in Hong Kong in 1963. </p>
<p id="6QV9cD">This variety of novels could provide a solid basis for several seasons, each taking place in a distinct time and place. However, this would bring with it plenty of other problems including issues of cultural accuracy. Both <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132460/shogun-episode-9-crimson-sky-review-mariko-why-death">Marks and Kondo have been very vocal about the accuracy of <em>Shōgun </em>being extremely important to them</a>, frequently rewriting scenes to better reflect cultural Japanese attitudes of the time. To suddenly transplant the series to an entirely new country, with an entirely new culture and different customs would be a massive undertaking, and surely change the show significantly. Although that’s not to say it couldn’t be done. </p>
<p id="s8HH7k">Perhaps even more compelling though is the presence of Sanada. With the legendary Japanese actor returning to the show, and his towering performance as Toranaga being a standout aspect of the series’ first season, it seems more likely that Marks, Kondo, and the rest of the production would opt to keep the story in Japan and create a series that’s a more direct follow up to <em>Shōgun</em>’s story. Thankfully, this period of Japanese history has no shortage of fascinating and complex topics for the show to cover. </p>

<p id="FPt0U3">While Clavell’s original novel changes the names of famous Japanese historical figures, it is closely based on the country’s real history, which means we too can look to history to see what could be next for the show. Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu, a real Japanese daimyo and the first shōgun of the mighty Tokugawa shogunate which ruled the country from 1603 until 1868.</p>
<p id="GWaHJM">The first season ends with Toranaga on the verge of capturing Osaka Castle, a real thing Ieyasu did (although slightly earlier than 1600). So, if the timeline of Japanese history is what the show plans to follow, then the next season would likely be about the fallout of Toranaga’s decision to openly grab power. In real life, Ieyasu met with quite a bit of resistance in the form of a rival daimyo named Ishida Mitsunari who would go on to lead an army in opposition to Ieyasu, throwing Japan into a civil war. </p>
<p id="q9ysSx">We’ll stop the story there at the risk of revealing several potentially significant plot points, but needless to say a civil war would give future seasons of <em>Shōgun </em>plenty of ground for great television. </p>
<p id="PeZCV3">Of course, we won’t know for sure what exactly these upcoming seasons of <em>Shōgun </em>will be based on until FX makes an official announcement, but we know we’ll be watching no matter what.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve yet to beat Borderlands 3. I picked it up on sale, relatively cheap, alongside much of the DLC. But it’s one of those games that will sit in my backlog, likely for another year or so, before I gain any traction. A co-op partner might help. But for now, I have my sights set on the Borderlands 4 release date. Why play an old backlog game when there’s something shiny and new on the way?!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-borderlands-4-release-date">What is the Borderlands 4 Release Date?</h2>



<p>At this time, we don’t know the official Borderlands 4 release date. In fact, the only concrete thing we know about the upcoming game is that publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Interactive intend to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-borderlands-4-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal the fourth mainline entry</a> during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/">Summer Game Fest</a>. That’ll happen on June 7!</p>



<p>According to Randy Pitchford earlier this year, the title has spent the past few years in “active development.” Therefore, it’s likely that we’ll see a reveal and announcement trailer, perhaps a release date, and likely the pre-order details for Borderlands 4 this summer.</p>



<p>Bookmark this page because the moment we have a release date, we’ll update you!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-will-borderlands-4-launch-on">What Systems Will Borderlands 4 Launch On?</h2>



<p>As the last generation of consoles—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—continue to wind down and come to a close, we’ll see far fewer big releases launch on the old systems. As such, we fully expect Borderlands 4 to be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Anything else, however, is unlikely.</p>

<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ever since the highly-anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-vis-trailer-perfectly-captures-my-hometowns-essence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>GTA&nbsp;6&nbsp;</em>trailer</a> debuted, fans have been waiting for another one. The first teaser left us with many questions, particularly about the two characters who were the focus of the reveal. Here’s a rundown of what we know so far about&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>&nbsp;trailer 2, including potential release dates and storyline speculations.</p> <h2 id="h-when-will-gta-6-trailer-2-release" data-injectable="false">When will GTA 6 trailer 2 release?</h2> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">Right now, <em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;trailer 2 <strong>doesn’t have an official release date</strong>. However, based on the release patterns of previous debuts, some rumors are circulating.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">It was believed that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two</a> would announce a new trailer for <em>GTA 6</em> during their May 2024 conference call. Unfortunately, no trailer was released, but we did get some insight into a more concrete release date. According to the report results, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will debut in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rockstar-narrows-window-for-grand-theft-auto-6-launch-to-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Despite not getting a <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer 2 during the conference, we can still try to get an idea for a release from its predecessor. If we look at <em>GTA 5</em>, we can see that the two main trailers debuted a year apart. Therefore, a second trailer for <em>GTA VI</em> might not come until December 2024. It may be released at an earlier date, but given Rockstar Games’ track record, it will likely come out in the latter half of the year. </p>
 <h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-predictions" data-injectable="false">GTA 6 trailer predictions</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">If we take a closer look at the first&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-6-could-be-the-most-important-thing-to-ever-release-analyst-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>&nbsp;</em>trailer, we can see that a second one could take us in many different directions. It could provide more insight into the two characters we’ve seen so far, Lucia and her partner (rumored to be named Jason). Given that Lucia was the primary focus of the first trailer, it’s possible that the second phase will shine the spotlight on her partner.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="816" data-injectable="true"><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>trailer 2 will likely delve deeper into the game’s narrative, which appears to draw inspiration from the infamous Bonnie and Clyde. The initial teaser showed Lucia and her partner in possession of a large sum of money, with the police hot on a suspect’s trail. If&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;follows the formula of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-open-world-games-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its predecessor</a>, heists will likely play a significant role in the storyline. We might also get a glimpse of the game’s side characters and their dynamic in the upcoming trailer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="590" data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true">In addition to the characters and narrative, more locations are expected to be revealed, taking us back to the Miami-inspired Vice City. This setting, known for its vibrant nightlife, beautiful beaches, and mobster escapades, has been a fan favorite since its first appearance in the series. The initial snippet already gave fans a sneak peek at a ton of visuals, and it’s shaping up to be an incredibly eccentric area to explore. Leaks have suggested the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>map will be absolutely massive, giving players the free range to wreak even more havoc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><em>GTA 6’s</em>&nbsp;gameplay details remain a tantalizing mystery, so the second trailer may&nbsp;not fully&nbsp;reveal this information.&nbsp;It will likely continue with cinematics, but one can’t help but wonder about the actual gameplay.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="false">An official release date could also be possible with the next drop, as the game is currently only slated for&nbsp;a Fall 2025 window.&nbsp;Again, this is wishful thinking, but it’s not entirely impractical.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/apex-legends-pro-players-divided-over-new-algs-poi-draft/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=apex-legends-pro-players-divided-over-new-algs-poi-draft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Apex Legends Global Series might replace the Dropship with a point-of-interest (POI) draft in Split 2, and pro players can’t reach a consensus on how to feel about the new potential feature. </p> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">During a scrimmage with his <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/imperialhal-leaves-tsm-marking-the-end-of-an-era-in-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new teammates</a> Zero and Genburten, Imperialhal claimed, “ALGS has just forced us to play on a random draft POI system in a competitive lobby, probably the worst change ever made in Apex history.” The pro player added that the rest of the league was against the change, but that didn’t make an impact. </p> <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true">In March, ALGS commissioner John Nelson first proposed the idea in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveApex/comments/1bq7bl8/algs_split_2_drop_spot_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter </a>to pro players. As things stand now, ALGS teams reach a general understanding through scrims and prior communication about where other trios land from the Dropship. However, there are some instances where teams will land at the same location, and the ALGS commissioner believes “those situations are to the detriment of both teams,” because the outcome gets decided by random factors such as who gets better loot in a short span of time. Some pro players are against the change, but other see its benefits. </p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">But with the draft system, one team will spawn at each of the possible 29 landing locations. According to Nelson’s leaked memo, all teams will get to select towards the front, in the middle, and at the end of the draft for the first nine days of regular seasons of matches. After that, draft order will be decided by performance, with better performing teams picking where they land first. </p> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Respawn Entertainment </figcaption></figure>

Rockstar Games and publisher Take-Two Interactive have narrowed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release window from the previously announced "2025" to "fall" of next year.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two shared the news during its Q4 2024 earnings report, saying it was "highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience".
</p>
<p>
"Our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase", it added, noting it expects to see "tremendous growth" in net bookings over the next three years.

<p>
When Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">unveiled its first trailer for GTA6</a> last December, it only confirmed a "2025" release window for the game. However, reports later claimed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">initially been targeting a "spring" 2025 launch</a> but that an autumn (Q3) release was looking more realistic. There were also suggestions it could slip into 2026 as a "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Assuming Grand Theft Auto 6 makes its newly announced "fall" 2025 release window as expected, it'll be arriving almost exactly 12 years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto 5. That game went on to sell an astonishing 200m copies, so Take-Two is undoubtedly right to be bullish about its expectations for "tremendous growth" over the next few years.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is set to feature dual protagonists - a Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who embark on a life of crime - and marks the return of the series' Miami-inspired Vice City.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158506/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-date-fall-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0mTart"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will be released in the fall of 2025, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive. The release window — however vague — is a narrowing of what Take-Two Interactive had previously shared <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer">when it put <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> simply within the 2025 calendar year</a>. The fall 2025 release window makes sense, placing the much-anticipated game right before the holidays.</p>
<p id="3rQZDE">“We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase,” <a href="https://taketwointeractivesoftwareinc.gcs-web.com/node/30361/html#ttwo4q24earningsrelease.htm">Take-Two Interactive said in its most recent earnings report</a>. “Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.”</p>
<p id="HVl2iX">Of course, there’s always the chance for a delay. Rockstar Games is infamous for delaying its games to ensure a serious level of polish; <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> was publicly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/22/15677376/red-dead-redemption-2-delay-release-date">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/1/16959884/red-dead-redemption-2-release-date-delayed-october-2018">three times</a>, while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/31/3936872/gta-5-release-date"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> had a major delay in 2013</a>. Take-Two Interactive’s willingness to publicly narrow the release window as part of its fiscal report could signal confidence in Rockstar’s ability to meet that date.</p>
<p id="rUnqcv"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>was officially revealed</a> on Dec. 4, a day earlier than expected <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1731813331244085531">after its reveal trailer leaked online</a>. The game is set in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto’s Miami — a location the game centered on with 2002’s <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City </em>and 2006 prequel <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories</em>. Those games were set in the 1980s, but Rockstar Games has set <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> in the modern day, centering on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo in Jason and Lucia, the latter of which is the series’ first playable female protagonist.</p>
<p id="dSuNLN"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> is still a hit, too, with Take-Two Interactive reporting 5 million copies sold within its last financial quarter, totaling 200 million games sold since its release.</p>
<p id="UYqSzS">Take-Two Interactive also reported it expects to reach $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion in net bookings in fiscal year 2025. Ahead of the filing, in April, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-layoffs-canceled-games-1235973835/">Take-Two Interactive laid off 5%</a> of its staff, or about 600 workers. (Despite the layoffs, Take-Two Interactive said it has expanded its staff.) It also canceled several projects — none of which were “core franchises” — but it still has 40 games in its pipeline throughout fiscal year 2027, Take-Two Interactive president Karl Slatoff said during the earnings conference call.</p>
