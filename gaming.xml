		<p>I have a bit of soft spot for Wind Rose as during the pandemic when all the heavy metal concerts were cancelled, they took their mining anthem Diggy Diggy Hole and made an a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnBvEddq7nw">banging EDM version of the track</a> as nightclubs were still open in some countries. Well, they’re back and this time they have teamed up with the video game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deep-rock-galactic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a> for another song about smashing rocks.</p>
<p>The new track, “Rock and Stone” finds the band members being kidnapped by aliens in to the world of Deep Rock Galactic&nbsp; and “it’s not long before the band is called to arms and forced to face down hordes of terrifying Glyhpoid foes in true Deep Rock Galactic fashion to ensure they can keep rocking out.”</p>

            <p>
As an old person who's still not over the novelty of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles being allowed to be called the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the UK without anyone getting funny about the word "ninja", it'd be fair to say I'm a little behind on the franchise. So the news there's a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game out this October based on a movie I didn't know existed using an art style I'm totally unfamiliar with has brought a whole succession of revelations.
</p>
<p>
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, as the game is known, was actually announced earlier this year, but developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games have now released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTQ-DC3dOpk">first trailer</a>, which you can see below. Mutants Unleashed - a "story-driven 3D brawler/platformer" - is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, and promises "action-packed combat, hilarious teen spirit, and a whole load of pizza" as Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello traverse an "immersive" New York City.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to "skate through the streets, grind on rails, and zipline between buildings amid a dynamic night and day cycle" as the gang hunts collectibles and embarks on missions set after the events of this year's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem movie. Series regulars like Master Splinter, April, Bebop, and Rocksteady will also pop in to say hello.

<p>
As for the turtles themselves, each will have his own distinctive play-style, and there's talk of combat XP, skill trees, plus the chance to level up ally friendships in order to unlock new locations. It's playable either solo or in two-player co-op, and the movie's cast - Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, Micah Abbey, and Shamon Brown Jr. - all return to voice their respective turtles.
</p>
<p>
While writing this, I just had a flashback to the time I won a ticket in my local newspaper to see 1991's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze, and got to enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOV6H4NcGEs">Vanilla Ice's Ninja Rap</a> in a completely empty cinema because I guess the novelty of talking turtles was waning by then. Now, though, they look to have well and truly returned; there's a new movie coming in 2026 and two confirmed games in development - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> and Mutants Unleashed. The latter launches on 18th October, when it'll be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and Steam.

Even just looking at an image of the character, you can already envision his look on Pharah’s silhouette. The wings on his back and the launchers on his arms already look like Pharah’s flying suit, so you can see how Blizzard looked at Starscream and immediately thought of her.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-recommend-id="image://6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucio next to Soundwave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucio next to Soundwave." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard Entertainment / Hasbro / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-recommend-id="image://6c6abc1cb9482b3b945404cd85219edd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucio next to Soundwave." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name suggests, Soundwave is a Decepticon that uses audio waves in combat.

This antagonist is a planet-sized Transformer that appears in a spherical shape before changing into his still very large but more recognizable robot form. This would have worked perfectly with Wrecking Ball, a hamster who pilots a ball-shaped mech. Dennett said that while fans would have loved it, Blizzard knew they had to balance the time and resources they had.<br></p><hr><p>So those are just a few of the possibilities that didn’t make the cut, but the skins we have now for Ramattra, Reinhardt, Bastion, and Illari are still pretty great, and managed to capture some of the most recognizable robots in disguise.

Until recently, you might not have even heard of the upcoming film, starring <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>’s Glen Powell and <em>Normal People</em>’s Daisy Edgar-Jones. As a huge fan of the original movie, and an unabashed tornado fiend, I worried it was destined to be a box office dud. But the last few days have felt like an F5 movie hype tornado has swept through town, bringing with it some of the best marketing I’ve seen in years and surprisingly positive reviews from critics who have seen the film. If the hype on the internet is a sign of things to come, <em>Twisters</em> is going to be the blockbuster movie of the summer (and maybe beyond).<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First, there’s the subject matter: tornadoes are fucking cool, and the original <em>Twister</em> was an incredible movie because it centered them for the first time ever on film. Tornadoes are a uniquely American problem—though they happen elsewhere in the world, they happen so frequently here because of the geography of the United States: cold air comes sweeping down off the Rocky Mountains and into the flat plains of the Midwest, where its met with warm, wet air from the Gulf of Mexico and—boom—you’ve got the recipe for a tornado. 1996’s <em>Twister</em> was a technological marvel for how it portrayed these almighty storms, and hopefully <em>Twisters </em>can do the same—nothing says “blockbuster” more emphatically than sexy people getting pelted with wind, rain, and debris, and nothing screams “popcorn flick” louder than the animal-like roar of a column of hundred-mile-an-hour wind.<br></p><p>Then, there’s the <em>Twisters</em> cast, led by a man who could have on-screen sparks with a plank of wood, Glen Powell. In the past several years, the sex-negative movement has somewhat sanded Hollywood’s raunchy edges, but Powell stands in stark contrast to that—the last few films he’s been in were sexy rom-coms in which his chemistry with his co-stars was so palpable fans started saying he has the real-life equivalent of the heart eyes emoji. This week has given us a barrage of clips, pictures, and sound bites that show off Powell’s innate movie star quality, from a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/twisters-cover-story-daisy-edgar-jones-glen-powell-anthony-ramos-8676182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/twisters-cover-story-daisy-edgar-jones-glen-powell-anthony-ramos-8676182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super-sexy <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> cover story</a></span> that blatantly hints at an on-screen romance with Edgar-Jones, to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/THR/status/1811593219538583620&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/THR/status/1811593219538583620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">him bringing his dog Brisket (whom he adopted from the <em>Twisters</em> set) to the Los Angeles premiere</a></span>.

There’s a reason they’re calling <em>Twisters</em> this year’s <em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>…</p><p>And lastly, the marketing team behind <em>Twisters</em> has clearly decided to go the ‘90s Hollywood route, and it’s paying off. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/sereshawed/status/1811559966286721349&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/sereshawed/status/1811559966286721349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboards for the upcoming film look like they’ve been ripped away</a></span> by strong wings and have furniture embedded in them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/jsstansel/status/1811517791138087283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/jsstansel/status/1811517791138087283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movie posters you’d see lining a theater are upside-down and sticking out of the ground in front of them</a></span>, the glass display shattered.

There is something so tactile and retro about the marketing around <em>Twisters</em>, something that feels like it’s reaching back towards 1996 and saying, “we know the first movie whips, just wait until you see ours.”<br></p><p>I’ll be there on day one to see <em>Twisters</em>, and I think there will be a lot of people doing the same. Let’s get twisted.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mithril Interactive have announced that their (deep, rasping breath) first-person player-versus-player-versus-enemy dungeon crawler extraction sim (FPPvPvEDCES) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeonborne">Dungeonborne</a> will launch into early access on Thursday July 18th. Here are some more intuitive, albeit no more elegant, ways of summarising what you do in Dungeonborne than "FPPvPvEDCES": sword go clang, goblin go eek, treasure chest go jingle-jangle, other player go stab-in-the-back.

In Dungeonborne, you and up to two friends descend to a subterranean place of ill-repute, rinse it of riches, and get the seven hells out of there before you're gobbled up by vermin or mugged by other player teams. There are eight, largely self-explanatory classes - Fighter, Priest, Rogue, Swordmaster, Pyromancer, Cryomancer, Death Knight or Druid - each with a few eye-catching signature tricks such as using the Force to quad-wield, spinning with your blade held out, and summoning violent shrubs to guard an entrance. There are two major areas, Clouseau Castle, which somehow doesn't feature any bloodthirsty pink panthers, and Sinner's End. 
</p>
<p>
I dipped into the last playtest, and had a reasonably grand time thwacking the undead with a bog-standard sword and shield. It feels like a melee combat game in which circling, poking at defences and waiting for an opening are legitimate and suspenseful possibilities, though I'm sure some high-level obsessive has already worked out that they can bunny-hop straight into a finishing move, or similar cheesing strat. The dungeon-raiding aside, there's also a competitive arena mode for straight-up player-killers, which I fear to set foot in. I prefer my murderous intent to be veiled initially, thanks.
</p>
<p>
As somebody who files catacombs under "cosy" and is given to warbling about the good old days of Rune and Deathtrap Dungeon, I'm keen to give Dungeonborne a decent shake. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/">Steam</a>. The big question for contemporary crypt-diving enthusiasts will be how it stacks up the already-released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-and-darker">Dark And Darker</a>. I've been playing a bit of that, as well, and my hour one verdict is that it has better beards.

The company behind <em>Super Mario</em> even, reportedly, forces these translators to sometimes sign 10-year NDAs, making it nearly impossible for them to talk about their work or put it on their CV or resume. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators#close-modal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators#close-modal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new July 12 report from <em>Gamedeveloper.com</em></a></span><em>,</em> multiple sources who have helped localize big Nintendo games claim that they and their colleagues weren’t named in the credits for titles like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-review-switch-rpg-1851490626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-review-switch-rpg-1851490626"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a></span>. These uncredited translators work for months on Nintendo games. However, according to one source, Nintendo’s policy is to not individually credit these workers. Instead, only in-house, Nintendo-employed translators make the cut. </p></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196698,191491" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “If you look at the credits for <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, for instance, you will notice that only six people were credited for localizing a full title that’s available in eight languages,” one source told the outlet. “[In my experience] a game like this would normally be localized by a team of around 25 translators. Some languages are skipped over completely like they got magically added to the game.”</p><p>Worse, according to some external translators, Nintendo made them sign 10-year NDAs, prohibiting them from talking about or promoting their contributions to the game. <em>GameDeveloper.com </em>was able to independently verify these NDAs are real and have been used on multiple Nintendo projects. </p><p>“You work on an award-winning title with newspapers and magazines raving about your work, and you’re forced to hide the fact that you actually were a part of that for 10 years,” said one translator. <br></p><p> Nintendo didn’t reply to <em>Kotaku </em>or<em> GameDeveloper.com.</em></p><p>Of course, this isn’t a new phenomenon.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129"> Video game companies have routinely failed to include everyone</a></span> who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everyone-who-worked-on-a-game-should-be-in-the-credits-1847669211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everyone-who-worked-on-a-game-should-be-in-the-credits-1847669211">worked on a project in the game’s credits</a></span>. And when it comes to third-party contractors and external teams, the workers are often stuck between big companies that point the finger at one another but don’t do anything to actually help the people translating some of the biggest games released. </p><p> “It is nigh impossible for translators to push back against this structure,” explained one source. “Anyone trying will get blacklisted before getting anywhere. This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there’s literally nothing we can do about it, and that’s even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for the greater good.”<br><em> </em></p><p><em> .</em> </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Cast both incantations, drink your Flask of Wondrous Physick, then quickly heal up any necessary HP and FP.</p><p>Enter the fog gate and get on the boss as rapidly as you can (dodging any attacks that may come your way in the process). As soon as you’ve closed the gap on the boss, use your Rolling Sparks attack to deal heavy damage.</p><p>If you’ve followed the build guide perfectly, you should feel pretty confident against most of the DLC’s bosses, albeit not as over-confident as you might have felt before the nerfing patch. When you’re done with that, you’ll be able to carry this build into a NG+ cycle, too. Just remember to swap the Lightning Perfume Bottle for another Dexterity weapon when exploring, as this build probably won’t help you much during average enemy encounters.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today the company announced four new limited-edition retro handhelds encased in  anodized aluminum. They’re beautiful and expensive, and Analogue is leaning into the FOMO with one-time-only pre-orders for “ highly limited quantities [that] will never be sold again.”</p><p>  The Analogue Pocket Aluminum Editions are precision CNC’d, meaning they are cut from blocks of metal rather than, in the words of CEO Christopher Taber, being made from “casted bullshit.” There are four colors—natural, noir, black, and indigo—and each one will set you back $500. They go on sale on July 15 at 11:00 a.m. and begin shipping July 17. “These are fucking nuts,” Taber wrote in an email.</p><p>If the Analogue Pocket’s past is anything to go off of, the PlayStation 5-sized price tag won’t scare collectors and retro enthusiasts away. The devices use field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips to run Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges exactly how you remember them. The latest in a series of console recreations from Analogue, the handhelds launched in 2021 and, due in part to supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic, remained perpetually sold out and incessantly hard to find, up until recently.</p><p>Last fall, the company announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/analogue-pocket-classic-limited-edition-release-date-1851022319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/analogue-pocket-classic-limited-edition-release-date-1851022319">Game Boy Color variants</a></span> aimed at recapturing the pure joy of holding a device in your hands that pops with all the colors of the Zebra bubble gum rainbow. These aluminum models are instead channeling the brushed aluminum look of certain Game Boy SP editions when the brand was aiming to be a bit more reserved and refined. Personally, I’m hoping Analogue comes back this Christmas with a mash-up of both bright colors and cold metal. </p><p>Somehow I suspect that whatever comes next, Analogue’s plans for more editions of the Pocket aren’t done yet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-invincible-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 11 bit Studios and developer Starward Industries have announced that&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed a major (but rather odd) milestone.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/731040/view/4404040636376861069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on the game's Steam page</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>has crossed the curiously specific sales milestone of 123,000 copies since its release in November last year. Why 123,000? Perhaps there's some kind of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/invincible-revealed-as-new-sci-fi-game-from-ex-witcher-devs">scientific significance</a> I'm missing.</p>
<p>In the post, Starward Industries thanks&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>players for helping it to reach this rather impressive sales figure, telling fans that there "really is nothing more simple and profound at the same time as 'thank you'".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-invincible-sales-arti.jpg?itok=umVFtbj5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-invincible-sales-arti.jpg?itok=ezSQw1wJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Invincible</em>'s thought-provoking sci-fi has proven a hit.</figcaption></figure><p>Starward Industries also says that it's planning further improvements for&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>in the future, as well as working on a "new, exciting project", about which it discloses absolutely nothing. Sorry, Starward fans.</p>
<p><em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled in 2020 and was set for a 2021 release, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/retro-sci-fi-game-invincible-release-date-set-for-2022">pushed back to 2022</a>, eventually arriving across PC and consoles <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-amd-partnership">in November last year</a>.</p>
<p>The game is an adaptation of Polish author&nbsp;Stanisław Lem's 1964 novel of the same name, arguably one of the most influential Polish-language science-fiction novels ever written.</p>
<p>You take the role of Yasna, a scientist who has landed on the unexplored planet of Regis III and who must quickly reckon with the loss of her crew and the danger posed by her newfound environment.</p>

<p>Being a narrative adventure, <i>The Invincible&nbsp;</i>isn't the kind of game you'd pick up if you wanted high-octane thrills, but if you're looking for a thought-provoking science fiction story with an "atompunk" setting (that's Starward's word), then you'll likely want to give this one a look.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Invincible&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/731040/The_Invincible/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10002666" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-invincible/9N19RM08QL3K" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24195175/zenless-zone-zero-impressions-genshin-impact-mihoyo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve given up on trying to understand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/13/23070689/zenless-zone-zero-trailer-rpg-beta-pc-ios"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>. In every other cutscene, I’m bombarded with in-game jargon about inter-knots, proxies, hollows, and w-engines that I just cannot keep straight. Meanwhile, my patience withers to dust as my eyes flit about the screen trying to make sense of the literal deluge of resources — dennies, polychromes, investigator logs, master tapes, and so, <em>so </em>much more — the game requires you to accumulate in order to progress. It is so overwhelming that the only time I feel a sense of peace is during the breakneck combat sequences filled with their own complicated waltz of combos, parries, and special attacks. It’s just too bad that those moments are few and far between.</p><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is the latest game from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777194/genshin-impact-fanfiction-merchandise-rules-creators"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/24/23695826/honkai-star-rail-release-date-trailer-pre-install"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as MiHoYo). It combines action RPG combat with gacha game mechanics (<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gacha">gacha</a> referring to the type of game where characters and resources are doled out randomly via loot boxes and other kinds of microtransactions). The game takes place in a futuristic urban setting where you play as a Proxy who controls a bangboo to guide your team of operators through a hollow to complete commissions taken from the inter-knot. And though this seems like a string of incomprehensible garbage, this is actually the easiest part of the game to understand.</p><p>Commissions work like daily quests and are categorized as to whether they’re story, combat, or exploration missions. No matter what type of mission it is, though, it seems like they all follow the same basic structure. First is the exploration part. The screen turns into a giant wall of TVs that you move your little rabbit avatar (called a bangboo... seriously) across to reach the goal. It looks kinda like a board game, with each TV representing some kind of event. Some TVs will have resources to pick up, while others hide combat encounters. If you run into a combat TV, the game changes, dropping your party into an arena with a bunch of monsters to fight.</p><div><figcaption><em>An example of </em>Zenless Zone Zero<em>’s exploration minigame.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Hoyoverse</cite></p></div><p>Usually, the <a href="https://youtu.be/GE_KeYdxG2A?si=VwCdy2HoUnOdktG-">highly polished, action-filled trailers</a> of most free-to-play games conceal actual gameplay <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com%2Fshorts%2FBScFjetm_B0%3Fsi%3DM9jynaNI6YusdZpq">that’s either nothing like the trailer</a> or nothing more than a mindless clickfest. So, I was not prepared for how engaging <em>ZZZ</em>’s combat really is. It’s fast and fluid, with a bunch of different actions you can string together to execute slick-as-hell combos. Add to that the ability to switch to any one of your party members mid-combo, and it makes for an experience that could stand next to any blockbuster action RPG game. It’s a hoot landing a dodge just right to chain together devastating attacks from each party member again and again. Pure gas.</p><p>But for some reason, the game is determined to keep that gas away from me as much as possible. There are so many other elements to the game that interfere with what’s most fun. While I appreciate that you can visit a noodle shop where the food buffs your party and that there’s an arcade with little minigames you can play with your party, it all feels like too much fluff. All I want to do is lead my little bangboo around collecting items and fight monsters with my party members, and all the game<em> </em>wants me to do is run a Blockbuster — really. </p><p>Why am I running a Blockbuster? I have no idea, and I’ve given up trying to figure it out. The game’s insistence on throwing so much at you upfront and its inability to explain anything coherently are so bad that I don’t even know how the gacha mechanics work. </p><p>Each combat mission comes with information like the type of enemies you’ll face and their weaknesses, while your party members have their own unique abilities and affinities. The appeal, then, is to acquire as many different operators to mix and match your party so you’ll have the right tool for each job. There are scores of interestingly designed characters — like the superhot wolfman with ice powers and an exquisitely tailored waistcoat — that I don’t know how to acquire because I’m still busy fussing with what movies to rent out at my Blockbuster. </p><p>Maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe HoYoverse is trying to curtail <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/10/06/genshin-impact-gambling/">the criticisms a lot of gacha games get</a> for being naked cash grabs by obscuring the function of its microtransactions to all but the most motivated of spenders. I can see the shop, but where I’m at in the way-too-long tutorial, I don’t have the faintest idea of how to use it.</p><p>I recognize that as video game trends evolve while I get older, there will be some games that I’ll never be able to comprehend. Despite my best intentions and as open a mind as I could muster, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is that game. And if I don’t get that wolfman soon, I’m content to leave the game for the people who get it.</p><p><small><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now on Android, iOS, PC, and PlayStation.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gaming hardware makers have often walked the line between enabling a player’s true skills, and simply delivering them an unfair advantage. Sometimes, honest accessibility aids are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-dont-care-inside-the-triumphs-and-failures-of-accessible-gaming-hardware">falsely accused of being cheating tools</a>; other times, a monitor will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-worst-and-weirdest-gaming-tech-of-ces-2024">straight-up play League of Legends for you</a>. This week, developments in gaming keyboards have sparked a new debate on what does and doesn’t fall within the scope of fair play, with mechanical keeb specialists Wooting <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">declaring in no uncertain terms</a> that "Rappy Snappy is not the same as Snap Tap." Cool, glad that’s cleared up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you’re convinced that only about half that sentence is comprised of real words... you’re right, but bear with me. A while back, Wooting announced the <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-80he">80HE</a>, a superfast <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-hall-effect-keyboards">Hall Effect keyboard</a> that would introduce their new Rappy Snappy feature. This tracks two keys of your choosing and allows one of them to activate even when the other is already being partially pressed – unlike how most keyboards only track one input at a time. In theory, this enables faster side-to-side strafing in pacey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS games</a> like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-2-best-settings">Counter-Strike 2</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a>, as you don't have to fully lift your finger off one directional key before you can start moving in the opposite direction. Unlike your hapless, technologically inferior opponent, who'll likely be full of holes before they can sort their mutually exclusive feet.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a more visual explanation of Rappy Snappy, beginning about 1:24 in.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz9pTOLbeos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 80HE is due to launch this September, but Razer – the dark green Goliath to Wooting’s presumably normal skin-coloured David – have pipped it to the post, releasing a firmware update to their existing <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/pc/gaming-keyboards/huntsman-line">Huntsman V3 Pro</a> keyboards that adds a similar feature called Snap Tap. Like Rappy Snappy – which it turns out is really hard not to type as Snappy Tappy – Snap Tap allows for the same rapid strafing by letting you hold down one directional key and quickly hammer the opposite key for optimal sideways dodging.</p>
<p>Far from ushering in a new era of meritocratic manshooting, however, the near-simultaneous arrival of these duelling keyboard technologies has instead fuelled concern that such SnappyTapRapRapBabap systems are tantamount to cheating, with detractors citing similarities to similar-performing scripts that exist for games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and CS2 progenitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">CS:GO</a>. Scripts, as a concept, tend to occupy that grey area between 'Using the advantages available' and 'Being a cheating toe-rag', but I suspect most online shootists would agree that deploying them is not considered particularly good form.</p>
<p>Wooting elected to go on the defensive, <a href="https://x.com/WootingKB/status/1811425339697996247">tXeeting a series of tXeets</a> that explained how Rappy Snappy is functionally distinct from Razer’s Snap Tap – and therefore not as much of a competitive no-no as it might appear. In short, Wooting argue that Rappy Snappy only registers the input of whichever key is pressed in deeper; this still allows for faster transitions, because one key doesn’t need to be fully released before the next input can take place, but its effective usage still requires the player to put more force into just one key at a time. Snap Tap, on the other hand, merely registers the most recent input, meaning a player could (for example) fully hold down the D key with one finger and just mash the A key to strafe.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Razer-Huntsman-V3-Pro-series.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Razer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In other words, Razer’s system is more comprehensively flouting the comp-shooter rule of only one input being allowed at a time, whereas Wooting’s is... just fudging it a bit, I suppose? It’s still removing the need for a key to fully spring back before the initial input is considered complete, but it does sound like you’d still be manually and rapidly pressing <em>both</em> keys, as you would on a bog-standard keyboard. Snap Tap, by allowing for one key to be held down yet still register multiple inputs, probably does come closer to self-playing territory.</p>
<p>Either way, those looking to claim the supposed advantages of these systems may want to wait and see how they fare with anti-cheat systems. Valve don’t seem to be doling out VAC bans for those using Snap Tap in CS2, but different games will have different rules on hardware that could be considered assistive. And not just shooters, either: rhythm game and minor internet sensation Osu! <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Reporting_bad_behaviour/Handling_foul_play#is-using-specialized-hardware-considered-as-cheating?">enforces a ban</a> on "anything that decreases the skill required to play", a rule of which these input-boosting tools could very feasibly fall foul.</p>

<p>Starfy isn't a particularly familiar franchise to America players. They have received four games – three for Game Boy Advance, one for DS – but only the 2009 DS game ever released in America. Today, the original three Game Boy Advance games are now available for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. The games retain their original title, Densetsu no Stafy, and have not been localized. The gameplay has been describe as Kirby-esque, but I have never been able to confirm that myself until today.</p>

<p>If you’re waiting to get your hands on a new AMD Ryzen 9000 CPU for your next PC upgrade, it doesn’t appear to be much longer. While an official release date hasn’t been set for the latest CPUs from AMD — the only window given was July 2024 –, the Ryzen 9000 series has made its way to retailers ahead of the expected launch.</p>



<p>Reddit user ElectricalEmployer22 took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1e193o8/just_got_them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCMasterRace subreddit</a> to share a quick snapshot of the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X in stock at his retailer. They didn’t share anything else about the CPUs, but seeing them in a retail store tells people that the release is coming.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The new flagship CPU lineup from AMD moves to Zen5 architecture, replacing the Zen4 architecture that launched in 2022. When they launch, there will be four new CPUs from AMD. There are two new Ryzen 9 chips (9950X and 9900X), one Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 5 9600X.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>AMD CPU Model</strong></td><td><strong>Cores /</strong><br><strong>Threads</strong></td><td><strong>Boost&nbsp;/ Base</strong><br><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td><strong>Total Cache</strong></td><td><strong>PCIe</strong></td><td><strong>TDP</strong></td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 9 9950X</td><td>16 / 32</td><td>Up to 5.7 GHz /<br>4.3 GHz</td><td>80MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>170W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 9 9900X</td><td>12 / 24</td><td>Up to 5.6 GHz /<br>4.4 GHz</td><td>76MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>120W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 7 9700X</td><td>8 / 16</td><td>Up to 5.5 GHz /<br>3.8 GHz</td><td>40MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>65W</td></tr><tr><td>AMD Ryzen™ 5 9600X</td><td>6 / 12</td><td>Up to 5.4 GHz /<br>3.9 GHz</td><td>38MB</td><td>Gen 5</td><td>65W</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>These new CPUs will feature the AM5 socket and work with two new chipsets, X870E and X870. These new chipsets feature 44 PCIe lanes and “direct-to-processor PCIe 5.0 NVMe connectivity”.</p>



<p>As said, no official on-sale date has been announced. However, the latest rumors are that July 31 will be the date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-nintendo-secrecy-and-ea-naughtiness.925854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-12th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've got another gaming business roundup for you, and this week has seen some pretty big companies embroiled in (admittedly fairly minor) controversies, as well as a new indie startup, the listing of a major Korean developer on the stock market, and more.</p>
<p>Here's what's been happening on the business side of the industry in the past week!</p>
<hr><h2>EA gets a wrist slap for failing to disclose loot boxes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-golf-clash-business-roundup.jpg?itok=0QjZLJhm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-golf-clash-business-roundup.jpg?itok=l02OGbCr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Golf Clash&nbsp;</em>has landed EA in a bunker of trouble this week.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, the UK Advertising Standards Authority gave EA a slap on the wrist for failing to adequately disclose loot boxes in an ad for the mobile game&nbsp;<em>Golf Clash</em>.</p>
<p>The ASA's <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/electronic-arts-ltd-a24-1239057-electronic-arts-ltd.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ruling</a> proclaims that the text declaring loot boxes in the&nbsp;<em>Golf Clash</em> ad in question&nbsp;isn't sufficiently visible, as it's too small and appears for too brief a time for consumers to understand what it's trying to tell them. Better luck next time, EA.</p>
<p>Notably, this <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/electronic-arts-ltd-a23-1222185-electronic-arts-ltd.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn't the first time</a> EA has been in trouble for&nbsp;<em>Golf Clash&nbsp;</em>ads, although in the last ASA ruling, the studio said the ad in question was mistakenly released, a defense to which it has not returned this time.</p>
<h2>Shift Up listed on the South Korean stock market</h2>
<p><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>developer Shift Up <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_d982ee3c-c2b2-4519-8dc5-cf07bd2b7485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">saw its first day of public trading</a> on the South Korean stock market this week.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the company's initial performance on the market was strong, with Shift Up jumping 18% on its first day and ending on 71,000 won (about $51) per share.</p>
<p>Recently,&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s sales topped a million, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million">according to Shift Up itself</a>, and a PC version of the hack-and-slash game is currently being mooted. We'll have to wait and see what happens on that front.</p>
<h2><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>dev now lets staffers show off unreleased projects</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-business-roundup.jpg?itok=yNdWexHz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-business-roundup.jpg?itok=m9Gt74P_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>studio Phoenix Labs is making some neat moves.</figcaption></figure><p>In a rather unexpected and encouraging development, Phoenix Labs, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>, is now allowing staffers to show off assets from unreleased projects.</p>
<p>As noted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dave-sanderson-exdev_under-our-recently-updated-portfolio-policy-activity-7216138882679984129-Nz5_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by external development director Dave Sanderson</a>, samples from the studio's unreleased projects have begun to appear online, with a view to helping former "colleagues and suppliers" find new work.</p>
<h2>New indie publisher First Break Labs reveals its first games</h2>
<p>This week saw <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-indie-publishing-and-investment-firm-first-break-labs-forms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the formation of a new indie publisher and investment firm</a> by the name of First Break Labs, and it's staffed partly by former Nintendo and Sega execs.</p>
<p>The company's staff includes ex-Sega product marketing head Alfonso Cubias, as well as former Nintendo product specialist Derek Seklecki. Its first four games will be the&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Entropy Survivors</em>, turn-based strategy game&nbsp;<em>Warside</em>, side-scroller <i>Baseless</i>, and adventure game&nbsp;<em>Particle Hearts</em>.</p>
<h2>Nintendo is having issues with secrecy</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/princess-peach-showtime-nintendo-business-roundup.jpg?itok=QVzcS6un 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/princess-peach-showtime-nintendo-business-roundup.jpg?itok=IrqWy5Wk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo isn't telling anyone who the developers on its projects are, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Dataminer Yakumono this week <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nes-world-championships-developer-revealed-via-datamine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">uncovered the identity</a> of the developer behind Nintendo's speedrunning compilation&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition"><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em></a>, prompting questions about Nintendo's apparent policy of secrecy.</p>
<p>Indieszero is just the latest developer not to be obviously credited for a Nintendo project; other recent examples include Good-Feel for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/princess-peach-showtime-demo-new-trailer"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a>&nbsp;and ArtePiazza for the<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg-review-slightly-unbalanced-but-fun-romp">Super Mario RPG&nbsp;</a></em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-rpg-review-slightly-unbalanced-but-fun-romp">remake</a>.</p>
<p>It's not a great look for the company; the lack of developer credit harks back to the dark days of early gaming, when developers often weren't credited for their work, leading to the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2017/12/20/the-true-story-behind-the-original-video-game-easter-egg-that-inspired-ready-player-one/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">creation of the first Easter egg</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Dying Light 2&nbsp;</em>dev Techland adopts a back-to-office approach</h2>
<p>Techland, the developer behind&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, has become the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal">latest developer</a> to mandate that "most" employees return to the office or adopt a hybrid working approach.</p>
<p>The studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-moving-most-roles-to-on-site-or-hybrid-model" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed its decision to GamesIndustry.biz</a> earlier this week, telling the site that the decision was made in order to "create a more collaborative work environment". This also includes staff working overseas.</p>
<p>Techland does, however, insist that it's still possible for workers to "request home office days on demand as needed", and that "remote work remains an option".</p>
<h2>Also in the news this week</h2>
<p>Embracer Group has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-secures-new-600m-revolving-credit-facility" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secured a new credit facility for itself</a>, which the company says will "reduce interest expenses" and make Embracer a "leaner and more focused company".</p>
<p>Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">announced the introduction of a new Game Pass tier</a> and a price hike for some of the existing tiers this week, adding further confusion to what's becoming a less and less streamlined system.</p>
<p>Sony and&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal">signed a new deal</a> to help the creature-collecting survival game go beyond the world of gaming, so expect more&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>media very soon.</p>
<hr><p>That's all we've got for you this week! Join us again next week for another look at what's been going on in the world of gaming business.</p>

An aluminum edition is coming out this month, and the company says that the new handhelds “are precision CNC’d entirely in aluminum.” They come in four colors — natural, noir, black, and indigo — and will be <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">available to preorder</a> on July 15th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET, with units expected to ship on July 17th.</p><p>That metal body doesn’t come cheap, though. The aluminum Pocket will cost $499, a big boost over the $219 of the standard version. Analogue says that the new version will be “available in highly&nbsp;limited&nbsp;quantities and will never be sold again.”</p><p>Here’s a look at all the aluminum parts of the device:</p><p>Since its launch in 2021, Analogue has released a handful of other special editions of the Pocket, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/15/23961099/analogue-pocket-special-edition-classic-colors-gameboy-advance">some bright colors</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848739/analogue-pocket-glow-in-the-dark-preorders">a glow-in-the-dark version</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23888931/analogue-pocket-transparent-price-release-date">the always-popular transparent shell</a>. The device allows gamers to play old Game Boy cartridges (as well as other carts, with the right adapters) on a handheld with modern touches like a crisp LCD screen.</p><p>The Pocket was the company’s first handheld device after previously releasing high-quality recreations of consoles like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/31/14451542/analogue-nt-mini-nes-review">NES</a> (which also came in aluminum),&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a>. Up next is the Nintendo 64 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">the Analogue 3D</a>, which was originally planned for a 2024 release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Work on the<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/"> shadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator</a> is proceeding smoothly, and recent developments have improved Bloodborne's emulation.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video, the latest version of the PS4 emulator now displays the game's menu with the correct colors. Unfortunately, the emulator still can't get in-game, but this quick emulation improvement definitely bodes well for the future of the emulator, which may end up being the only way to play FromSoftware's popular action role-playing game on PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne again (this time with correct colors) shadps4 v0.1.1 WIP" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoMO4N92Vss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>shadPS4 is only one of the many PlayStation 4 emulators in the works, but it is among the few ones that can run 3D games, as most of the others can only run simpler 2D games. The PlayStation 4 emulation scene is still in its infancy, however, so things will definitely get improved in the future and possibly get on the same level as PlayStation 3 emulation, which now allows users to enjoy <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-can-now-run-all-released-playstation-3-games/">all of the games released on the system</a> with enhancements such as higher resolution and more stable performance. Something that could also be happening on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S in the future, thanks to a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-run-playstation-3-games/">update to the consoles' dev mode</a> that could make running emulators such as RPCS3 possible on the systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-development-of-varsity-high-school-football-dynasty-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When Varsity High School Football  releases,  it’ll will center around two main elements: gameplay and Dynasty Mode. We’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-development-of-varsity-high-school-football-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already talked about gameplay</a> and the plans Spear Interactive and Pyramid Lake Games have for it, but what about Dynasty?</p>



<p>To put it in a single word: deep.</p>



<p>The developers have been hard at work fleshing out and implementing all of the features that they want to include in the mode. From how the offseason works to the decisions you can make, everything is geared towards what you might expect when dealing with high school athletes.</p>



<p>So, how does it all work?</p>



<p>You start like any other Dynasty by creating a coach that’s either a head coach or coordinator. From there you’ll see a number of open jobs from some of the thousands – yes, thousands – of high schools in the country. Jobs are broken down by counties within a state. Some states, like Tennessee and Texas for example, will have more jobs and better opportunities than say Montana or North Dakota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you look for a job, you’ll get to see things like the annual budget for your program to spend, how popular you are in the region, the size of the market, and more. It’s all done to help you make the most informed decision you can before you actually start as a coach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you’re at your school, the real work begins. You have to manage your roster throughout the year and keep your team eligible to play games. Some schools, because of their size and location, will only have a roster of 25 players. That means you’ll have players on both sides of the ball, doubling potential injury risk.</p>



<figure><video controls="" poster="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/vlcsnap-2024-07-12-10h44m31s507.jpg" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/VarsityMap.mp4" playsinline=""></video></figure>



<p>Your schedule is made up of teams in your district as well as filling any open dates you want. That said, you can choose, based on your current situation, to keep your schedule at just six or seven games to limit any risk of injury. It’s part of the decision making that goes into being a head coach.</p>



<p>As a head coach, you have goals you need to achieve. These goals vary based on your school and location, and help determine your overall job stability. Underperform, and you could find yourself looking for work. But don’t think it’s just on you. If you are a head coach, you’ll have to hire a staff that works with you to build your team, but you’re restricted to the budget you have to spend. And that budget goes towards much more than your staff hirings.</p>



<p>You use the money you have to hire staff and improve your facilities. Some schools like a major Catholic academy might have an annual budget of $50,000 to spend in a year while a smaller rural school might just have $10,000. Spend too much on staff, and you’ll be behind the eight ball on improving the program through other means.</p>



<p>There’s even the possibility of having to deal with parents who think their kids are the next big thing and deserve more playing time. It’s up to you to figure out how you want to handle that situation.</p>



<p>For those wondering, there will be a full Super Sim engine within the mode for your games, full season player stat tracking that’s realistic to high school statistics, and full league stats.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-offseason-is-where-programs-are-built">The Offseason Is Where Programs Are Built</h2>



<p>The actual football season only makes up a portion of what happens throughout the year. There’s a full offseason broken down by season (winter, spring, summer) that gives you various tasks to help improve your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As mentioned, each part of the offseason will have different tasks for you. You have to reach out to boosters in order to try and raise money for your program. Some will be willing to give you a few thousand while others will be tough to just get $50 out of them. You’re able to see the likely willingness to financially support you before you ask for a specific amount that you can choose. Your success with the boosters directly influences your budget for the following year, so doing as much as you can to get the most money is key.</p>



<p>During the offseason you’ll be able to have training camps with your players. However, not every player may participate. You might find that your star running back is also a hockey player. That means he’s busy during the winter with that season, leaving you without a top player. In addition, there’s the risk of the players who are multi-sport athletes getting hurt resulting in missed offseason time or even the season. That’s why the facilities are important to improve because they will help with things like player recovery, injury resistance, skills, stamina, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When seeing everything that Dynasty has to offer, the developers felt confident that what they have will satisfy the needs of players. For the most part, development of the features within Varsity’s Dynasty Mode has been completed aside from a few things here and there. That said, they did say that there is the potential to add more that wasn’t discussed prior to launch if it makes sense for the mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were also some things talked about during our meeting that can’t be revealed just yet, but will be announced in due time. For the developers, it’s about making sure the timing is right and everything is official before putting news out there.</p>



<p>Varsity High School Football is currently in development. When it releases, it will be available for PC and console.
