			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launched on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC three weeks ago, and according to data from Circana, it has been the best-selling game in the US each of those weeks.</p>
<p>Executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana Mat Piscatella took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24">BlueSky</a> on Monday and announced that Shadows has stayed in the top spot for weekly game sales in the United States since it launched on March 20, 2025.</p>
<p>Piscatella also confirmed that Assassin's Creed Shadows is now the second-best-selling game in the United States for 2025, trailing behind Capcom's smash success to start the year, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>"<em>Here's a fun one...Assassin's Creed: Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US for each of its first 3 weeks in market, according to Circana's Retail Tracking Service (dollar sales, latest data through April 5th)</em>," Piscatella wrote on BlueSky.</p>
<p>"<em>Currently ranks #2 year-to-date trailing only Monster Hunter: Wilds</em>."</p>
<p>Just two days after launching, Ubisoft announced that Assassin's Creed Shadows had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/">surpassed 2 million players worldwide</a>&nbsp;after it broke <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/">one million copies sold</a> on launch day. A week after it launched, Ubisoft confirmed it had gone even further and blown past <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/">3 million players</a>.</p>
<p>These milestones and financial achievements are enormous wins for Ubisoft, a company that desperately needed a win after 2024 was filled with major financial misses. Both of Ubisoft's big-budget games for 2024, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/">Skull &amp; Bones</a>,&nbsp;missed the mark in several ways, including commercially, which made the cloud above the company only grow darker&nbsp;as more and more pressure weighed on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows success.</p>
<p>Ubisoft recently underwent a significant structural change, with its biggest series, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, all being moved to<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/"> a new subsidiary</a> in which Tencent is a minority partner.</p>
<p>Plans for this new subsidiary are still unclear, with a<a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/"> recently leaked internal memo</a> including hints that layoffs could still very well be coming as the company adjusts to its new structure. We can only hope that Assassin's Creed Shadows's major success helps alleviate some of the losses, should they still occur.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/white-knuckle-has-you-falling-from-cloud-9.1163961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/white-knuckle-early-access-preview-falling-from-cloud-9<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that defines the roguelite genre, it’s ascension. Climbing a peak until something – and almost always something unexpected – knocks you back down to the bottom of the mountain. It’s never going to be a breeze, but it’s worth it to know that the wind at the top is going to feel so much better. <em>White Knuckle</em> takes this sentiment to a literal extreme and then some.</p>

<p>This is the debut title from Dark Machine Games, a first-person roguelite parkour platformer, and published by DreadXP, who have been on a tear in the indie horror scene for quite a while now. From the jumpscare jamboree of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mortuary-assistant" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a> to the downright inspiring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dread-delusion-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a>, if there’s a forefront, DreadXP are standing there with arms wide open. As it stands, sprints, and springs, <em>White Knuckle</em> is a definitive example of that.</p>

<p>You play as a disembodied pair of hands, stranded at the bottom of a brutalist spire. An autonomous female voice occasionally spouts warnings and staff updates from the intercom, but beneath her announcements, and your own feet, something is bubbling below you and rising up. You’re tasked with climbing this seemingly endless tower to freedom, before you fall victim to the horrors of this facility’s work.</p>



<p>Even in this primitive state of “Early Access”, what’s fascinating to me about <em>White Knuckle</em> is how emboldened it is with crafting an identity for itself. It doesn’t take long for the core, or rather, cores, to open up layer by layer as time goes by, which is admirable, if a little bit foolishly noble for something so eager to make a statement.</p>

<p>It starts off as a goofy precision platformer in first person, like if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow"><em>Human Fall Flat</em></a> was in VR, where you control your jerky hands and elastic physical movement with the mouse buttons. How big your hitbox is exactly isn’t known, but that seems to add to the general fun of figuring out how you can cheese the climbing system.</p>

<p>One of <em>White Knuckle</em>’s sneaky assets is the inventory system, which is populated over time with pitons you can hammer into the wall to create new routes, weapons, and temporary health buffs. There is a limit to how much you can carry, but for better or worse, the game is reluctant to portray this information, or indeed, any information necessary to retain. With how stripped-down the game is, GUI-wise, it’s exceptionally difficult to figure out what your buffs are doing, even when they’re unlocked for further use.</p>



<p>Then there’s the aesthetic itself, remarkably cold concrete that only becomes colder as it’s smothered in brutalist architecture and PSX-style dithering. It’s not exactly retro, it’s more that it’s lending itself to how direct and suffocating this Soviet-era construction could be, alongside the generic announcements that pertain to employee retention and on-site alerts of failing power units. However, it won’t be long before the voice gives you a fairly direct warning: “It is below you”.</p>

<p>Now the horror kicks into gear, and indeed, the mass underneath you slowly rising up, sludge spitting out to stick to your boots is a threat, and you’re on a timer. You can’t sit there and strategize, this thing is constantly climbing, the same as you, and you’ve gotta pray that you can close the door behind you. You can take minor breaks in interludes that serve as vending machines for equipment, enhancements and extra lives, and this is where the roguelite elements come into play.</p>

<p>Despite this four-piece matinee of mechanics and design trying their best to work in tandem with each other, something still isn’t right. There’s another piece to the puzzle that was exceptionally difficult to ascertain as I threw myself through the monkey bars and motions that <em>White Knuckle</em> presents. It’s not just that the game feels unfocused, but there’s an element in play that’s actively sabotaging the rest of it quite successfully.</p>



<p>Indeed, I kept pushing further, looking for answers when and where I could. In time, I discovered small narrative snippets that present themselves in brief glimpses of the facility’s history and encounters with remnants of individuals designated to the same fate as you. I couldn’t ruminate on them for long, or indeed, at all, because I was on the clock, and there was a good chance I’d lose it if I didn’t make it up in time, which happened a lot, to my rage-fueled chagrin – and that’s when it hit me.</p>

<p>You can point to any number of influences <em>White Knuckle</em> wears as a pinstripe suit, from <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/portal-2-tale-of-two-female-icons" rel="nofollow">Portal</a> </em>to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/half-life-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Half-Life</em></a> – hell, even <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/infra" rel="nofollow">INFRA</a> </em>– but one thing that shines through more than anything else is its synonymy with rage-bait platformers, your <em>QWOP</em>s and your <em>Getting Over It</em>’s. This, in turn, seeks to dismantle the outrageous amount of promise White Knuckle inhibits, to the point where every other core is actively sabotaged by one another.</p>

<p>The roguelite elements tend to be undermined by how linear the platforming elements have to be, lest you’re softlocked by a lack of resources, which happens more often than you’d think. <em>White Knuckle</em>'s extra lives system works as such: If you die after using one, you’ll spawn back at the computer you used the floppy disk on, BUT, you lose your entire inventory upon death unless you acquire a perk, and if you can’t find a piton or rebar rod before you come across something which requires it, you can only jump against the wall and await death.</p>



<p>The progression system is undermined by the sheer reluctance <em>White Knuckle</em> shows when trying to convey information, largely reducing the player’s power to contextless icons and minor screen flashes. What’s the difference between the effect of a syringe, and the effect of a medicine bottle? Who knows! One flashes red, and the other flashes blue, but you’ll be damned to the goo before the game tells you what it’ll do!</p>

<h2><em>White Knuckle</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Fear is replaced by frustration, and discovery is replaced by dismissal. In its current state, <em>White Knuckle</em> isn’t a well-oiled machine juggling its various gameplay features, it’s the Olympic logo warped to “OOOOO”. Thankfully, this infancy can be nothing but a learning curve, as despite so much vigor in their chest, and pep in their step, <em>White Knuckle</em> has been summoned in a disillusioned state that doesn't know where to jump to.</p>

In this&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;review, I'll go over my experience traveling above a ruined Earth, warts and all.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="670cb0ae-b83d-4879-95e2-a5fc28b63dc2" href="https://techraptor.net/games/forever-skies" rel="nofollow"><em>Forever Skies</em></a>&nbsp;takes place on a futuristic Earth that has been overrun by the "Dust", an amalgamation of mutated flora and fauna that has rendered the surface toxic and uninhabitable. This has also caused the birth of new diseases, including the "Grey Plague", a terrible malady that is bringing humanity to the brink of extinction — and now, it's up to you to cure it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-building-out-your-airship-in-the-early-game-of-forever-skies.jpg?itok=ZTVpwddb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-building-out-your-airship-in-the-early-game-of-forever-skies.jpg?itok=MuhUbXWN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're anything like me, you'll likely spend a few hours in the early game collecting crafting materials so you can build out your airship.</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking to the Skies</h2>

<p>Your adventure begins after emerging from a drop pod that descended from the <em>Ark</em>, a space station that is home to the handful of humans who have escaped Earth entirely. The Grey Plague is slowly killing them, and you are their only hope to fix it. But first, you'll have to get on your feet.</p>

<p>As with many survival games,&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;starts you off on a tutorial tower where you learn the basics of the game on foot. You'll assemble a basic Airship toward the end of this tutorial zone and take to the skies in search of answers and valuable crafting materials.</p>

<p>Much like&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>, your Airship is both your means of transportation and your base. You'll only have a small airship with one balloon and one engine at the beginning; eventually, you could build it out to a multi-level leviathan with multiple balloons, engines, turbines, and automated turrets that collect debris to fuel your crafting.</p>

<p>You'll be limited to a handful of different types of towers in the early hours of the game. Adding some turbines and unlocking key crafting recipes will let you access taller buildings and open up new areas of the map. Eventually, though, you'll have to descend below the surface.</p>

<p>The early parts of&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em> are all about landing at towers to get the raw materials you need for your airship. Your main concerns will be keeping up your survival stats, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58f0451d-7399-4cb6-ac14-0b4f1d61a4ea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-build-your-ship-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">building your airship</a>, and avoiding falling off a tower into the ground below. Eventually, the story will take you to your first underground area in the "Underdust."</p>

<p>The surface of Earth is a very different beast. The air is totally unbreathable, and you'll need to rely on a small oxygen tank to survive, supplemented by oxygen stations throughout the Underdust that you'll have to power up.</p>

<p>Early Underdust areas won't have much in the way of hazards save for the oxygen limit and the occasional harmful flora. Later areas, though, will have you fighting against actual enemies. Combat isn't all that difficult, especially when you're using a ranged weapon.</p>

<p>The Underdust is often home to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="956df2a5-09b9-4609-96b5-3636826a117f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/where-to-find-resources-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a>&nbsp;that can't reliably be found elsewhere, such as Crystals, as well as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed3c7773-13d3-4637-9df8-7dc7ad9cce99" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-trading-guide-how-to-buy-and-sell-items" rel="nofollow">trading kiosks</a>. Although you only need to visit each of these dangerous locations once, you'll often find yourself returning to them multiple times to fuel <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7e81d8e6-64ca-49e2-8cf2-d6225e3a402f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-crafting-and-unlocks-guide" rel="nofollow">your crafting</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="58f0451d-7399-4cb6-ac14-0b4f1d61a4ea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-build-your-ship-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">Airship building</a> — all the more so when you're <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="995f762e-ef6c-4c8d-92de-c850561bfa1d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/forever-skies-multiplayer" rel="nofollow">playing multiplayer</a>.</p>

<p>The Underdust is indeed filled with mystery, but it presents another problem — these handcrafted story locations often tanked my framerate.</p>

<p>The PC I used to play the 1.0 beta version exceeded the recommended requirements on the Steam page on every metric — I have a much better processor and graphics card, and more than enough RAM. For some reason I don't understand, however, my framerate would randomly drop to 10 FPS or worse in many of these Underdust areas.</p>

<p>A similar phenomenon happened with bad weather. Whenever it rained, my framerate would go right into the gutter. Saving and restarting the game seemed to help, so my gut tells me that there may be a memory leak or some other unresolved optimization issue.</p>

<p>I was not alone, either; I spent some of my time playing in multiplayer with my girlfriend and a good friend. The three of us all met the minimum and recommended requirements, but our framerate would go to hell in the Underdust, and while it was raining.</p>

<p>This wasn't the only performance issue I encountered, mind; at a certain point, adding or removing pieces from your Airship caused the game to freeze for a moment. As with most survival games, it seems that&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;gets a little bit laggy when you start building big.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forever-skies-review-fighting-a-impious-mantis-in-the-underdust-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=_8tHK0_v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forever-skies-review-fighting-a-impious-mantis-in-the-underdust-in-forever-skies.jpg?itok=y31_n3mV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're freaked out by bugs, you might want to avoid&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>...</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I'll close out this&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;review with an inevitable comparison: yes,&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;feels a lot like&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="43038c34-13cb-4306-a71a-537928a67c0a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/raft" rel="nofollow"><em>Raft</em></a>. You take your base with you, going from story location to story location and stopping at smaller points of interest along the way to collect <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="956df2a5-09b9-4609-96b5-3636826a117f" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/where-to-find-resources-in-forever-skies" rel="nofollow">crafting materials</a> and decorations for your ship.</p>

<p>If you (and your friends) enjoyed<i>&nbsp;Raft</i>, you'll find a lot to love in&nbsp;<em>Forever Skies</em>. If you've never played a game like this before, the sci-fi setting and light first-person shooter elements may be easier for you to pick up than the coconut technology found in&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>.</p>

<p><em>Forever Skies</em>&nbsp;is a fine game in its own right, and Far From Home may very well deliver some excellent post-launch content. However, all of this great game design and fun exploration is hampered by performance issues that should have been sorted out before launching a 1.0 version; one hopes that the developers will fix these problems sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>There, a panel will be held involving Bit Reactor, Respawn, and Lucasfilm Games, during which "a world-exclusive first look" at&nbsp;<em>Zero Company&nbsp;</em>will be shared. Not much more information than that is available right now, unfortunately.</p>

<p>As part of that layoff wave, Respawn employees working on the battle royale hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-developer-respawn-hit-by-layoffs-among-cuts-at-electronic-arts" rel="nofollow">were let go</a>, leaving the future of Respawn's tactical&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game in question.</p>

<p>Happily, it seems that the game was still being worked on all this time, and a full reveal is scheduled for the weekend. If you've been clamoring for something a little different from the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>property, this might well be it.</p>

<p>We'll learn more about&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company&nbsp;</em>on Saturday, when it'll be revealed in full. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And yes, you’ll be absolutely correct to notice that it’s so far missing the two most important Pokémon species, Mimikyu and Mantine. But given there’s not even a Snorlax, perhaps like so many other ranges on the store, there will be more added as time goes on. Or perhaps not...</p><p>So far the releases have mostly focused on all the starters, including of course Charmander, Squirtle and Bulbasaur, with a bonus addition of Pikachu and Mew. The range is called “Adventure Partners Plush Key Chain,” suggesting that maybe it’ll be more limited. But that doesn’t really explain the Eeveelutions or Mew. But, with every starter present, that means there will be at least one everyone loves, and then also Chimchar and Popplio.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4415be2c08ea24746073f6b1e396d6a8"

<p>Star Wars Zero Company will receive an official “world exclusive first look” on April 19 through a panel with Bit Reactor, Respawn, and LucasFilm Games.</p>



<p>Star Wars Zero Company is an upcoming single-player turn-based tactics game that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-bit-reactor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>earlier last month. The official reveal will be live-streamed from a ‘Galaxy Stage’ on April 19 as part of the Star Wars Celebration event. Respawn will produce the title, while Bit Reactor will lead the game’s development. Star Wars Zero Company will be <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911816230908121249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on</a> PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-star-wars-zero-company-about">What is Star Wars Zero Company About?</h2>



<p>Not much has been officially revealed about the game besides its title and genre; however, some details have surfaced early through leaks. According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/images-from-respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-have-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report</a> from March, early images of the game showed gameplay reminiscent of popular tactical turn-based games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2. We also saw a Mandalorian character fighting against a Storm Trooper, with the bottom screen showing the actions a player can take in this situation.</p>



<p>However, the screenshots were from an earlier game build and are subject to change or removal with the final build. The only way to know what Star Wars Zero Company is about is by tuning in for the official reveal on April 19, where we might get to see some gameplay and hopefully a release date, too.</p>



<p>In other news, Star Wars: Hunters will shut down<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-hunters-is-shutting-down-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in October 2025</a>. The Star Wars Eclipse developer was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unaffected by NetEase’s restructuring</a>.

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is continuing to be a successful launch for Ubisoft amid all of the company uncertainty. According to the latest information from Circana, the game is one of the best-selling games in the United States (US) so far this year.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lmrugvasic24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> on Monday, Circana’s Mat Piscatella revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been the best-selling video game in the US in each of its first three weeks on the market in terms of dollar sales. </p>



<p>It was added that it’s the second-best-selling game year-to-date trailing on Monster Hunter: Wilds. Monster Hunter: Wilds released just about three weeks—February 28—before Assassin’s Creed Shadows did on March 20.</p>

<p>Though specific numbers haven’t been revealed by Circana, Ubisoft has said publicly that more than 3 million players have played the game as of its first week. That number, however, is likely to include those who received a copy from Ubisoft or are subscribers to Ubisoft+. It’s unsure, as of publishing, what the official units sold count is for the game as it reaches a month on the market. </p>



<p>That information is likely to come at or around the time Ubisoft holds its next earnings call on May 14.</p>



<p>What do you think of Assassin’s Creed Shadows being at the top of the sales charts in the US since its release? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <p>
EA's Star Wars strategy game, confirmed to be in the works back in 2022, has been given a title - Star Wars: Zero Company - and a first bit of artwork ahead of a full reveal this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
Little has been heard about Bit Reactor's game in the years since its announcement - although the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-star-wars-strategy-game-still-in-development-following-layoffs">studio did break its silence</a> to confirm the project had been unaffected by the EA layoffs that accompanied the end of Respawn's shooter - but all that's about to change.
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
EA has <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911811628124742117">taken to social media</a> to share the first official details about the project, calling Star Wars: Zero Company a "single-player turn-based tactics game", and sharing a first bit of concept art. The image features a motley crew of unnamed characters (plus one luxuriant moustache) including a Jedi, Madalorian, and Clone trooper - with the latter suggesting Zero Company is set in the prequel era. That's further supported by the appearance of a battle droid displayed on the holographic device held by our moustachioed friend.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, there's not much more to report - but that will change this weekend as part of 2025's Star Wars Celebration convention. EA says it'll be sharing a "world-exclusive first look" at Zero Company as part of panel this Saturday, 19th June. Expect those details to start working their way across the internet shortly after.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/marathon-will-be-a-premium-title-but-it-wont-be-full-priced/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/marathon-will-be-a-premium-title-but-it-wont-be-full-priced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> will not be a free-to-play game, but it also won’t be a ‘full-priced’ title, the company has said. How much will it cost, though? Well, you’ll have to wait until the summer to find out.</p>
<p>Responding to a erroneous quote pulled from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/">now amended Gamespot article</a> with details on the game, the Marathon social media account states, “Marathon will be a premium title. Marathon will not be a ‘full-priced’ title.”</p>



<p>The implication is that the game will not be priced at the now expected $70 price point, but will come in somewhere lower, similar to other Sony game releases over the last year, where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> were both $40 games. Of course, those games were literal polar opposites in terms of how well that worked out, and there’s been a fairly negative view of what Bungie revealed over the weekend for Marathon.</p>
<p>As was showcased during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">gameplay reveal</a> over the weekend, Marathon will take the extraction shooter template – teams of players will drop into maps on the planet of Tau Ceti IV, look to scavenge resources and complete objectives against AI enemies, survive encounters with other teams of players, and extract or die trying (and lose everything you’re holding – and seek to spin it out into another broad live service shooter with battle passes, an overarching narrative and more.</p>

<p>For Destiny fans looking for a new fix, that is a huge change of pace to what’s on offer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, where everything is delineated between PvE spaces and missions and PvP. It’s also fair to expect that the story being told will likely have the feel of how narratives are threaded through seasons of Apex Legends and Fortnite – again, comparisons to Helldivers 2 with its cooperative community goals and Concord with its plan for weekly character-building cinematics will be made as more about Marathon is revealed.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of doubters out there, but if there’s one thing that Bungie knows how to do, it’s make great-feeling first person shooters, and Marathon has all the potential to be exactly that, adapted to another fresh setting for the studio.</p>
<p>Marathon is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and set to launch on 23rd September. A closed alpha test is coming later this month.</p>

			<p>This coming Saturday, April 19, 2025, EA and Bit Reactor will reveal the previously announced single-player Star Wars turn-based tactics game, which we now know is officially titled Star Wars Zero Company.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company was one of EA's last few remaining Star Wars games after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/respawn-cancels-another-unannounced-multiplayer-fps/">unannounced shooter from Respawn</a> was canceled earlier this year. We're also still waiting for news on the third installment in Respawn's Star Wars Jedi series, though that seems to be further off considering Star Wars Jedi: Survivor only released two years ago now.</p>
<p>Star Wars Zero Company will be showcased during the Star Wars Celebration this weekend. The celebration officially kicks off on Friday, April 18, and runs until Sunday, April 20. Zero Company will be unveiled during a <a href="https://www.starwarscelebration.com/en-us/explore-the-event/panels.html#/event/bit-reactor-developer-panel-featuring-respawn-entertainment-and-lucasfilm-games">one-hour panel</a> with EA, Respawn,&nbsp;and Bit Reactor that will kick off at <strong>1:30 pm PT /4:30 pm ET/9:30 pm BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea of a turn-based tactics game set in the Star Wars universe has had many speculating that this will be a Star Wars-skinned take on XCOM, though this coming Saturday's reveal will be the first time we see if that's the case or not.</p>
<p>At the very least, Star Wars Zero Company will be a different kind of Star Wars game than we've been getting in recent years. Star Wars Outlaws might not have featured any Jedi, but it was still a third-person action-adventure game, like Respawn's Jedi series. As far as other different or new Star Wars games are concerned, we're still waiting to hear about Star Wars Eclipse, which seems to be delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026-release/">beyond 2026</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/">Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, if that even is still in production.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-is-what-all-sports-games-should-be-its-just-fun/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Though I was only able to play for a few hours during my limited time with the game, one thought kept coming back to me while I was playing Rematch: this game is really fun.</p>



<p>Rematch is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-is-a-new-soccer-game-from-sifu-developer-sloclap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming online soccer title</a> from Sloclap, the developers of Sifu. Featuring 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 online matches, players control their individual player on the pitch. Think of it as Rocket League but for the actual sport it’s based on.</p>



<p>You can control your player either using mouse and keyboard or controller. I attempted to use both, but found a few bugs with the mouse controls that left me going back to the controller for most of my time. The bugs, like not being able to fully turn the camera with a mouse, I expect to be flushed out in future betas and with the full release on June 19.</p>



<p>In the beta that I had access to over the weekend, we were able to play 4v4 and 5v5 matches, private games, and see some of the customization options. The customization options are a solid way to differentiate your player on the field, but it’s not something I care too much about, personally, with games like this so I didn’t spend too much time see what was there. One thing I did notice with the customization, however, is the ability to have prosthetic arms or legs. It’s a nice little touch that is sure to make those with prosthetics feel seen from a genre that they may not normally go to those lengths.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fast-paced-gameplay-of-rematch">The Fast-Paced Gameplay of Rematch</h2>



<p>On the field is where you see everything with Rematch come together. The field size changes based on the team sizes, and the environments of the fields are unique and just make the game feel special. </p>



<p>From the fluidity of your player’s movement to the responsiveness of the controls and everything in between, everything feels polished. Even in a beta state, there weren’t really any moments where I felt like my player didn’t do what I had intended or what I felt it should’ve done. </p>



<p>Within the action, everything is manual and skill based. Your passes and shots go where you aim them, and you need to get to the ball in order to gain possession. It’s not going to stick to your feet if you are somewhat close, which makes your positioning and attack all that more important. You also have to decide how you want to hit the ball when you have possession. There are light, medium, and high-powered hits that are used for passes, lobs, clearances, and shots. The most difficult part when learning Rematch is aiming your shot or pass while trying to get the right spin and power behind it. It’s a lot at one time to get, but once you get the hang of it, it feels incredible to pull off. </p>



<p>When you can’t make the shot or pass you want, however, you could find yourself creating your own meme-worthy moments like smacking the ball along the wall over…and over…and over again. </p>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Slidetackle.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>There are even various dribble moves that are easy to learn but require the right timing to master and get around a defender. A mistimed flick of the ball will lead to a scoring opportunity the other way and a team of players wishing they can call you names in the chat—luckily, they can’t. But there is in-game voice communication that, at least for this, was far more pleasant than any other online game I’ve been a part of.</p>



<p>There are no fouls, offsides, and the ball just bounces off the wall rather than go out of bonds. It’s all designed to keep the action going and the play hectic. And it works beautifully. Playing defense is just as rewarding as offense, especially with a well-timed slide tackle to break up a play.</p>



<p>Lastly, Sloclap has managed to make playing goalkeeper fun without being intimidating. When in goal, you simply need to stay in position and time your save attempts in order to keep the ball out of the net. Some shots you just won’t have a chance to stop while others will have you making a save that even you can’t believe you pulled off.</p>



<p>As I said earlier, it’s just fun. </p>



<h2 id="h-teamwork-is-key">Teamwork Is Key</h2>



<figure><video autoplay="" controls="" loop="" muted="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Goal.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Aside from how <em>you </em>play and control your own player, how you play as a team is key to finding any sort of success on the field. If you go into a game of Rematch thinking you are going to be a Leo Messi against a bunch of children and dominate everyone, you’re going to immediately be humbled. Trying to solo everything will lead to goals against and a team that will just exclude you from play. It’s not a fun way to enjoy the game and will lead to more losses.</p>



<p>Timing passes properly, finding the gaps in coverage, and finding open teammates on a run will serve you better than any other strategy you can think of. Hell, there were even games where my team decided to dedicate ourselves to specific positions for an entire game, and it resulted in a crisp game where we controlled the ball for what fell like all but 30 seconds.</p>



<h2 id="h-rematch-final-thoughts">Rematch Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>In Rematch, every match feels different even if you’re playing with the same teammates. With each game you find yourself getting better and better with a willingness to try more outlandish play ideas or shot attempts. Whether you want to try an intentional pass off the wall above the goal or make a pass to yourself off the side wall, the thrill off successfully pulling off these moves is something that other sports games rarely replicate. </p>



<p>Obviously with this being a beta, I can’t give a full review on Rematch and what Sloclap has to offer. But what I can say is that if what I was able to play is any indication, Rematch is looking like a strong contender for sports game of the year for 2025.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty developer Pete Actipis, who is the game director on CoD: Warzone at Raven Software, has teased Activision's plans for the OG map, Verdansk, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-3-patch-notes-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-adds-major-movement-changes-camo-hub/2900-6387/" data-ref-id="2900-6387">just recently returned to the game</a>.</p><p>As many may recall, Warzone's original battle royale map was featured in the game from launch in March 2020 to December 2021. It was gone for years until its return earlier this month. Actipis told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Activision "brought Verdansk back for a reason."</p><p>"It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it," Actipis said. "So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there."</p><p>Actipis declined to get into specifics on Activision's plans and strategy for Warzone map rotation, but the developer did tease, "We love Verdansk."</p><p>Actipis added: "It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2135581852"

data-ref-id="1100-6530610">helped the game's player populations grow on Steam</a>. Actipis said the return of Verdansk has been "pretty successful" so far. Actipis pointed to Warzone having positive sentiment on Reddit as an example of how the company has turned things around to a degree at least.</p><p>"Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it," Actipis said. "We recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going."</p><p>Beyond Warzone, a new Call of Duty game is expected to release in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">could be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It'll face stiff competition in the market, as Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is coming this fall. For context, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">Black Ops 6 was 2024's best-selling game in the US.</a></p>

                <p>The Advance Wars lookalike tactics game Warside, developed by Lavabird and published by First Break Labs, is out now on PC. However, fans have pointed out that it's buggy and seemingly unfinished, reflecting its Mostly Negative reception so far.</p><p>Warside looks eerily similar, if not almost identical, to Advance Wars. The maps, buildings, battles, and troops look very much like the ones in Nintendo's tactics franchise. The biggest differentiator is that the Commanders in Warside have a more realistic pixel art as opposed to Advance Wars' anime art style.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368300/Warside/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews section</a>, there are several features and gameplay mechanics that are missing. One player said that Warside feels like an early access release, with multiplayer lobbies and local multiplayer functionality nowhere to be found, even though both features were advertised as available.</p><p>Another player noted that the game's economy is broken as income needed to purchase troops is unavailable. However, it seems like the developers have already quickly fixed that issue.</p><p>Warside isn't the only game that's attempting to capture the spirit of the Game Boy Advance era, as the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-classic-fire-emblem-inspired-rpg-launches-in-march/1100-6529734/" data-ref-id="1100-6529734">Dark Deity 2</a> is inspired by Fire Emblem games from that period.</p><p>Warside currently has a 10% launch discount and will be coming to PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox at a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/warside-launches-april-14-for-pc-later-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later date</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-2033-redux-is-free-on-steam-gog-and-xbox-for-48-hours-to-celebrate-metro%E2%80%99s-15-year-anniversary.1163856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-redux-is-free-on-steam-gog-and-xbox-for-48-hours-to-celebrate-metros-15-year-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Metro series, developer 4A Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-2033-legacy-an-upcoming-expansion-mod-shown-in-first-trailer/">Metro 2033 Redux</a> will be&nbsp;free for the next 48 hours on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690/Metro_2033_Redux/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_2033_redux">GOG</a>, and Xbox.</p>
<p>A short clip of gameplay from Metro 2033 Redux announces the giveaway with a post on the series' official X account. The post showcases the definitive version of the first installment of the series, which launched back in 2010. Redux, the version that is free for players to grab, was released four years later, in 2014.</p>
<p>It's unclear why PlayStation players are left out of the loop or if they'll be included in a future giveaway. For now, though, you're better off running to one or all of the aforementioned digital storefronts to add a free copy of Metro 2033 Redux to your library.</p>
<p>The Metro series celebrated its actual 15-year anniversary on March 16, 2025, and at the time announced that there would be "<em>events, deals, and celebratory content</em>" posted throughout the year. In addition to getting Metro 2033 Redux for free, you can also get the rest of the series on sale on Steam and GOG. Though&nbsp;Metro 2033 Redux isn't available for free on PlayStation, it is heavily discounted, along with the other games in the series.</p>
<p><iframe title="15 Years Of Metro  -  Celebration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbADeT1-HLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metro 2033 Redux will take you back to the series' origins, but so will the most recent game in the Metro series, last year's prequel VR title <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/">Metro: Awakening</a>. But no new mainline entry has pushed the story forward in years.</p>
<p>Regarding what's next for the franchise, formally 4A Games Ukraine, now Reburn studio has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/4a-games-confirm-theyre-making-the-next-metro-with-dmitry-glukhovsky/">confirmed</a> that they are working on a new Metro game with the series creator Dmitry Glukhovsky. Still, there's been no news on this new title in some months. It'll be a while longer before we get any new word on how the title is progressing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, grab Metro 2033 Redux for free while you can, especially if you missed it being free on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-and-metro-2033-redux-now-free-on-the-epic-games-store/">Epic Game Store</a> a few years ago.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>'s remake is near upon us, going by the Loud Noises online. Somebody's finally managed to get a response out of Bethesda regarding the much-tipped Oblivion comeback, and it is that special flavour of non-committal that attracts the true believers like wasps to a capsized icecream van. "We have no official information on an Oblivion remake," observed the company's Support staff in a <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1909296361503174761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1909296361503174761%7Ctwgr%5E874b2fca725c12b2e6308c72ab0ce2fe03d343f8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Foblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information%2F">response</a> to some nosy parker last week. "Apologies for any confusion."</p><!--more-->
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remake-elder-scrolls-bethesda-support-denies-rumours-no-information/">The Gamer</a> for spotting the above. I've been avoiding a lot of the rumours because frankly, many of them read like people converting to <a href="https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/Unitology">Unitology</a> after stumbling on an extra-twisty Nik Nak. But there are now enough of them that I can mash them all together like I'm turning junk bonds into triple-A securities, and pass the results off as reporting. Seriously, though, there's quite a lot of smoke in the air. It feels increasingly like there's an announcement in the offing. Here's a quick round-up of the most substantial and/or recent pieces of gossip.</p>
<p>- Back in 2023, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dishonored-3-plus-fallout-3-and-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remasters-appear-on-leaked-microsoft-doc">accidentally shared</a> a 2020 planning document with details of several possible projects, including a new version of Oblivion.</p>
<p>- This January, MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details">dug up a former Virtuos employee's CV</a> which makes mention of an Unreal Engine 5 Oblivion remake, detailing improvements to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking.</p>
<p>- But a few days ago, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game Of The Year Steam page <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/900883/history/">was updated</a> to remove some older trailers. Routine housekeeping?</p>
<p>- Jeff Grubb, a dependable disseminator of insider gossip, has claimed on Giant Bomb's 7th April <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ifsfg5XFuRI">The Power Block</a> video that the reveal is definitely coming this month.</p>
<p>- <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1900277200592548120">NateTheHate</a> claims the remake will be revealed <em>and</em> released this month, in comments green-ticked by <a href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1900289910801916177">Andy Robinson</a> of Vero Gusto Computing. Andy Robinson once beat me at Mortal Kombat in front of Netherrealm and I despise him to this day, but I have never known him to tell a fib about a video game.</p>
<p>If you're ambivalent about Oblivion, or disinclined to engage with anything Microsoft-backed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">in light of recent reporting</a>, you might prefer to check out certain community initiatives that take inspiration from Oblivion, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-gets-a-whole-gamejam-dedicated-to-persuasion-pie-co-hosted-by-a-dont-nod-developer">this persuasion-themed game jam</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jyh4fx/oblivion_remake_official_footage/?utm_name=web3xcss">this fun demake</a> co-starring Bethesda's indefatigable Adoring Fan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He describes frustration with his own lack of upward momentum, as he was passed over for the role of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s creative director in favor of Mike Laidlaw. He says he was eventually won over by Laidlaw’s leadership and that the fantasy series benefited from it, but after he left the series to work on something else, things started to change.</p><p>Gaider asked to move on to something else within BioWare after <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s launch in 2014, and it was between either <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> or “Dylan,” the game that would become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964"><em>Anthem</em></a></span>, the studio’s ill-fated loot shooter. Opting to work on the latter, he says the experience illuminated tensions between the different BioWare teams and that he felt the <em>Anthem </em>team didn’t want him there.</p><p>“You see, the thing you need to know about BioWare is that for a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the <em>Dragon Age</em> team and the <em>Mass Effect</em> team,” Gaider wrote. “Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn’t get along. The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn’t really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the Dylan team. The team didn’t want me there. At all.”</p><p>Gaider says that some of his conflict with the<em> Anthem</em> team came from higher-up instructions to write something more “science fantasy,” similar to <em>Star Wars</em>, whereas the original concept had been more of a “beer &amp; cigarettes” sci-fi world similar to <em>Aliens</em>. According to Gaider, he was frequently given feedback that his ideas were “too <em>Dragon Age</em>.”</p><p>“I won’t go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn’t want to make an RPG,” Gaider wrote. “Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I’d need to actually do that.”</p><p>After it became clear that that the project wasn’t a good fit for him, Gaider told BioWare’s bosses that he’d stick with it if there was some kind of promotion on the other side, and when he was turned down, he quit and went on to co-found Summerfall Studios.

<p>The Minecraft Movie is proving to be a cultural phenomenon. It’s Chicken Jockeying for position in 2025’s list of box office hits, but the fandom is going overboard to the point theaters are issuing a warning disclaimer to Minecraft Movie patrons.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie was always going to be a success. Mojang’s Minecraft is far too big and has resonated with hundreds of millions of players for years. So it doesn’t shock me (or anyone) that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/">A Minecraft Movie is the biggest opening day ever for a Video Game Movie</a>.</p>



<p>It made over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its opening weekend</a>, and people are flocking to see the movie every day. Its success has already put the wheels in motion for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>. It’s fair to say the filmmakers—and theaters—will be looking for viewers to control themselves more with a follow-up. For some reason, people are throwing popcorn around rather than eating it.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-throw-popcorn-during-the-minecraft-movie-you-ve-been-warned">Don’t Throw Popcorn During The Minecraft Movie—You’ve Been Warned</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Truce. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>Movie popcorn isn’t exactly cheap, so it baffles me why people are yeeting it around like there’s no tomorrow. However, this is exactly what’s happening in theaters around the world right now.</p>



<p>The “Chicken Jockey” viral Trend sees attendees start hollering and throwing popcorn everywhere when a certain action in the movie happens. Some of the social media scenes are a real “must be seen to be believed” type of deal. But it probably needs to stop, which is why more recent showings now come with a disclaimer.</p>



<p>X user <a href="https://x.com/ScaredGirlTweet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ScaredGirlTweet</a> shared a video of the new disclaimer. It says: “<strong>Welcome to the Block Party. Please remember, be kind, be respectful, and most of all, remember that popcorn buckets are not to be used as Ender Pearls.</strong>“</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those who don’t get the reference, Ender Pearls are items that can be thrown in Minecraft—the more you know!</p>

            <p>More people have managed to take <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> out for a test drive, and new discoveries are now popping up online.</p>
<p>This includes what appears to be a pilotable hovercraft-like attachment for Mario and co's more standard karts, akin to that big-rig which was commandeered by Birdo in the initial reveal trailer.</p>

<p>According to a video shared by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GettingMadz">GettingMadz</a>, when you are going about the waters in this craft - which reminded me like some kind of Thunderbird 2 and 3 hybrid - you will be able to take out quite a few other players. This doesn't surprise me, given the size of the thing compared to Bowser in his pre-selected kart.</p>
<p>A voice in the background, seemingly a Nintendo representative, said there will be similar vehicles to this hovercraft-type machine found in the city areas as well. I am assuming that will be the likes of the aforementioned big-rig we saw Birdo drive into and boost off in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another user quoting a social media post of GettingMadz' Mario Kart World footage has shared an image of what appears to be a large helicopter, suggesting that this too will be pilotable on the game's release.</p>
<p>"This just confirmed my theory of there being a lot of other vehicles like this in the game where you enter these huge question block warp zones to control them," <a href="https://x.com/nin10doland/status/1910855366012715204">the user wrote</a>, adding Nintendo seems to still be keeping a lot about its upcoming Mario Kart game quiet.</p>
<p>Perhaps we will learn more about these massive yet mysterious vehicles on 17th April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">Nintendo is hosting a dedicated Mario Kart World Direct</a>.</p>

<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-darkness-infamous-sanity-system-patent-has-expired-so-can-anyone-now-copy-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
GameCube exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a> remains a cult classic among video game horror fans for its patented 'sanity system' - a series of paranoia-inducing effects meant to confuse the player and reflect your in-game character's spiralling psyche.
</p>
<p>
While something of a gimmick, Eternal Darkness remains notorious today for the system - which included the game pulling stunts like pretending to crash or turn your TV off, or faking the deletion of your save file. 
</p>
<p>
Whether a marketing tactic or not, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> filed <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6935954B2/en">a very real patent for the sanity system back in 2000</a>, which finally expired in 2021. And every so often since then - particularly with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-mordors-brilliant-nemesis-system-is-locked-away-by-a-warner-bros-patent-until-2036-despite-studio-shutdown">recent discussion around Warner Bros holding the patent for Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Nemesis system until 2036</a> - the matter has resurfaced.
</p>
<p>
"It looks like the infamous patent on the sanity system from Eternal Darkness is now in the public domain," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/rato9h/looks_like_nintendos_patent_on_a_sanity_system/">wrote reddit user DocMemory</a>, shortly after the patent's time period ran out. "Let me just mention that I am not a lawyer and this should not constitute legal advice."
</p>
<p>
But what if you did ask a lawyer, and did get legal advice? Could anyone now copy Eternal Darkness' sanity system and use those same sanity effects for themselves? I was intrigued. 
</p>
<p>
"You SHOULD be able to use whatever elements of an expired patent are necessary to its use (as described in the patent)," video game legal expert and creator of the <a href="https://vl.hoeglaw.com/">Virtual Legality podcast</a> Richard Hoeg told me.
</p>
<p>
"But NOT anything that is not 'necessary' (graphics, perhaps some specific implementations - eg, sanity effects - as that's artistic expression rightly protected by copyright)."
</p>
<p>
In other words, while you might be able to implement a similar version of Eternal Darkness' sanity system, directly copying elements from Eternal Darkness could prove more complicated. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo of America's original patent describes a game system that incorporates a character's sanity level "that is affected by occurrences in the game such as encountering a game creature or gruesome situation". In short, the more bad stuff you see, the worse things get.
</p>
<p>
But there are nuances - your character can rest or progress through an area more slowly to mitigate the sanity system's effects. 
</p>
<p>
"As the character's sanity level decreases, game play is effected such as by controlling game effects, audio effects, creating hallucinations and the like," the patent continues. "In this context, the same game can be played differently each time it is played."
</p>
<p>
The patent goes on to detail a list of possible hallucinations that players may experience as a result of the sanity system, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wall carvings coming to life and reaching out for the character</li>
<li>Something in wall or under floor moving by the character (Frighteners type of thing)</li>
<li>Statue watching the character (Head tracking)</li>
<li>Suit of armour moving (Relaxed to on guard stance)</li>
<li>Static statue or object that appears to follow the character when they're not looking</li>
<li>False doors that appear and disappear when the attempt to open is made</li>
<li>Glowing eyes blinking in the darkness, yet when the area is illuminated they disappear</li>
<li>Painting that shifts and changes along with its meaning</li>
<li>Points of interest markers that the character's head will watch</li>
</ul>

<p>
As well as a list of more physical effects that impact gameplay:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hallucination: lights go out, and a creature appears as lights come on, then the lights go back off, then the light comes back on and the creature is gone</li>
<li>Stretching walls and corridors so they require more time to traverse</li>
<li>Bleeding walls</li>
<li>Enormous roar that emits from a tiny rodent (Mouse or rat)</li>
<li>Dripping water from above, but when the character takes a second look it is now blood</li>
<li>Shadows that appear to shift and change</li>
<li>Character's torch mysteriously blows out, loud noise then it is once again lit</li>
<li>Faint maniacal laughter (That gets louder and louder as the character draws deeper into insanity)</li>
<li>Ambient audio, such as a water drip could become louder as insanity increases, so a really insane character will occasionally have this irritating dripping sound to distract him</li>
<li>Lagging shadow (the character's shadow appears to follow the character)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Eternal Darkness sadly never got a sequel, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-darkness-spiritual-successor-announced">attempts at crowdfunding a spiritual successor were made by some of the game's development team</a>. Perhaps we should all just look forward to experiencing Eternal Darkness' sanity effects as they were originally programmed, if and when the game gets a fresh release via the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Switch 2's Nintendo Switch Online GameCube catalogue</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the summer, the story of Carlo Acutis made headlines at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/pope-recognises-second-miracle-by-gods-influencer-as-the-catholic-church-prepares-to-canonise-its-first-gamer-saint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gaming</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-catholic-church-is-about-to-canonize-its-first-gamer-saint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites</a>: Acutis, who died of leukemia at age 15 in 2006, is set to be canonized by the Catholic Church at the <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260581/carlo-acutis-and-pier-giorgio-frassati-to-be-canonized-in-2025-pope-francis-announces-dates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of April</a>, making him the first millennial to become a saint. While the word “saint” probably conjures up martyrs and monastics from centuries past, Acutis was by all accounts a regular 2000s-era kid. He was a devout Catholic who attended daily Mass, but he also played soccer, hung out with friends, and played video games. He’s said to have owned a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/25/europe/carlo-acutis-mother-sainthood-pope-francis-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a> and enjoyed Halo, Pokemon, and Mario games, though he <a href="https://aleteia.org/2022/10/12/why-bl-carlo-acutis-limited-his-video-game-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited his gaming time</a> to an hour a week.&nbsp;</p><p>Acutis has a global following, like many figures who’ve gone through the long, rigorous process of sainthood. His <a href="https://religionnews.com/2025/03/31/crowds-flock-to-newest-catholic-saint-in-assisi-a-millennial-teen-whose-ordinariness-is-the-draw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomb</a> sees plenty of visitors in person and via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDkelBOase0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">livestream</a>. A church in England has a <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/258249/stained-glass-window-dedicated-to-blessed-carlo-acutis-creating-stir-in-english-parish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stained-glass window</a> of his likeness, complete with cell phone. There was an attempt to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-aFFqIQ02U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game</a> about his life in 2023, though its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/acutisgame/acutis-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a> was cancelled and there’s been no word of it since. The Church recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/carlo-acutis-millennial-saint-relics-sale-italy-catholic-f5a65136f90673ed038cc2e61dd76368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke out against the online market for his relics</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But for all this popularity, there’s also a certain “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-do-you-do-fellow-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how do you do, fellow kids</a>” energy to the way he’s been labelled “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpvzpxgzpnlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God’s influencer</a>” and “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5024766/carlo-acutis-first-millennial-saint-pope-canonization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the patron saint of the internet</a>.” The attention his gaming habits have received reinforces the idea that there’s something <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-is-the-church-a-place-for-gamers-to-worshi-1836507187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">irreligious</a> about video games, and the strict limits he set on himself further drives that home. And, for all his purported relatability, what we know about his internet usage isn’t the “like and subscribe” YouTube videos or secret fan fiction sites you might expect of kids today: Instead, he made a website for his local church and one cataloging <a href="https://www.miracolieucaristici.org/en/Liste/list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eucharistic miracles</a>. He died before Facebook became ubiquitous, and shortly after the <a href="https://x.com/jack/status/20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first tweet</a> hit the internet. What example can the internet’s unofficial “patron saint” really set, especially for young people, if he was so strict with his gaming time and didn’t live long enough to regret going on TikTok?&nbsp;</p><p>To talk about all this, I reached out to Shane Liesegang, SJ, who <a href="https://www.jesuits.org/stories/from-video-game-designer-to-jesuit-with-shane-liesegang-sj/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worked on games</a> like <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Skyrim </em>before joining the Jesuits. While he still works on <a href="https://shaneliesegang.com/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal projects</a> and <a href="https://religionnews.com/2023/11/21/how-game-designer-turned-jesuit-ended-up-writing-about-space-religion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bigger games</a> from time to time, these days he’s a <a href="https://beajesuit.org/jesuit-formation/studies/#:~:text=After%20professing%20First%20Vows%2C%20a,further%20deepens%20his%20Jesuit%20identity." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scholastic</a> living in the Philippines studying migrant theology; over email, Liesegang tells me “Basically migrants and refugees are kind of my ‘vocation within a vocation.’”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>The road to sainthood</strong></h2><p>The first thing Liesegang points out to me is that the word “saint” is a lot more complicated than many people understand it to be: “The Church’s definition of a saint is, simply, someone who is in heaven,” he says. “This is distinct from the <em>title</em> of ‘Saint,’ which indicates a person has been authoritatively declared to be a saint by the Church in the process of canonization. That is, they have been added to the list of saints considered to be authentic and trustworthy… Thus we get the repeated phrase that only God makes someone a saint; the Church merely recognizes it. So there are, of course, substantial numbers of saints that are not canonized, and who are in fact entirely unknown outside their most immediate context.”</p><p>The process by which someone officially becomes a saint has changed over the centuries, but these days involves rigorous investigation into their life (Liesegang tells me, “Imagine the deepest, most thorough background check possible and then also imagine how far it can go when there is no rush.”). This process also includes what might be the biggest stumbling block to modern people: verifying a saint’s miracles.</p><p>Liesegang says a saint’s miracles are “basically considered as ‘proofs’ that the person made it into heaven and now has some sway.” Acutis’ first miracle occurred in 2013, when a <a href="https://angelusnews.com/faith/the-miracle-attributed-to-carlo-acutis-prayers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazilian woman</a> claimed her son, who’d suffered from a lifetime of digestive issues due to a pancreatic disorder, was able to eat normally after praying to Acutis for healing. His second miracle involved a <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2024-05/pope-francis-saints-decrees-miracle-acutis-allamano.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">woman</a> who suffered head trauma after falling off her bike in 2022; the woman’s mother prayed for healing at Acutis’ tomb, after which it’s said her daughter’s condition promptly began to improve.</p><p>While Liesegang points out that the Pope “can basically give you credit for a life of virtue and let that count” as a number of the required miracles, inexplicable healings and their like “do seem to fly in the face of our rigorously scientific and materialist worldview. So here I will say: you might be surprised at the stringency of the standard the Church applies when it determines miracles to be genuine. Medical miracles require a team of neutral doctors to vote [multiple times].… The investigation process on these things is <em>staggeringly</em> thorough — if they found anything that made them question [Acutis' cause as a whole, it], would have been stopped.”&nbsp;</p><p>The line between a miracle and something medicine can’t yet explain might be a thin one, up to interpretation. Father Angelo Romano, the general relator of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/dec/03/miracle-vatican-dicastery-secret-saint-carlo-acutis-pope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> in its fantastic deep-dive into the sainthood process, “The way miracles are seen has obviously changed as the world has changed… The question is: what is today the state of the art of medicine? We have to judge from the present moment of knowledge… We cannot judge based on what you might discover tomorrow.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Teen known as 'God’s influencer' set to become Catholic Church’s first millennial saint" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1aQC3Q-PToA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Beyond miracles, the cause of sainthood also requires some earthly sway; since its inception it’s been a grassroots movement on the part of a saint-to-be’s devotees. While I’ll be honest that, as a non-Catholic, I found it a little hard to believe some relatively unremarkable kid could earnestly gain this kind of widespread attention, Liesegang says that “without a genuine popular movement, [Acutis’ cause] wouldn’t have gone anywhere, so I will give credit that there are a number of people genuinely devoted to him.”&nbsp;</p><p>But how effective that devotion can be in the cause of sainthood has always been complicated by class, geography, and race. The Guardian notes that the documentation of scans and tests required for medical miracles can put causes without financial or technological access at a disadvantage. The Guardian also points out that the causes of several would-be saints of color have moved far slower than Acutis’. Courtney Mares, author of a book about Acutis and a correspondent for the Catholic News Agency, told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/carlo-acutis-millennial-patron-saint-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a>, “It is remarkable that Carlo Acutis will be canonized so close to the date that he was born. For context, of the 912 saints canonized by Pope Francis, the next most recent birth date was in 1926.”&nbsp;</p><p>Acutis was born in London and grew up in Milan. He came from what the AP calls a “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/carlo-acutis-saint-millennial-catholic-church-assisi-ec1b2805f12f1795833c02c1c266d9f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wealthy family</a>;” his <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlo-Acutis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">father</a> worked in banking and finance, and his mother worked in <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/religion/article/how-i-raised-a-saint-by-the-mother-of-teenager-carlo-acutis-0bfgxcklp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publishing</a>. While Acutis obviously didn’t just buy his way into sainthood given the rigors of the process, an access to resources and his geographic location surely didn’t hurt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since the<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/canonization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> formalization</a> of the sainthood process, Liesegang says that “class has definitely played more of a part. (Race, sadly, has always played a part.) A degree of cynicism is warranted, but there is the less nefarious reality at work, too, that the investigation process can be time-consuming and costly, and it’s certainly easier to do that work if someone pushing the cause is willing to pay.”</p><p>“There’s always been a need for people to work, push, and hustle to get someone canonized,” Liesegang continues. “Money is the same cheat code here that it is in most parts of society. (Starting in the late medieval period, you see a lot of saints whose biographies basically read ‘came from a wealthy family, entered a convent, and died.’ I’m not questioning the lives of any of those people, but it’s not too hard to see why they got the recognition.) Folks from more modest backgrounds still get in, of course, but it usually requires either overwhelming acclaim, more time, or both.”</p><p>Ultimately, Liesegang says, “Acutis has a leg up, but only in getting the ball rolling. All the money in the world can’t make people love you (just ask Elon Musk).”</p><h2><strong>Does God hate games?</strong></h2><p>Part of Acutis’ appeal comes from how current he is–or, at least “current” by the Church’s slow-moving standards. As Father Carlos Acácio Gonçalves Ferreira, rector of Acutis’ shrine in Assisi, told Wired, “It’s a beautiful thing that for the first time in history you can see a saint dressed in jeans, sneakers, and a sweatshirt.”&nbsp;</p><p>His gaming habits are part of that modern appeal. On the one hand, the games he played are so standard as to seem almost counter-intuitive to the idea that he’s remarkable; on the other, that he set such rigorous limits on himself is pretty rare for a teen, or for anyone who plays games. A book about his life <a href="https://aleteia.org/2022/10/12/why-bl-carlo-acutis-limited-his-video-game-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> he was concerned by how riled up his friends got while gaming; his <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/video-gaming-teen-become-catholic-millennial-saint-pope/15019268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mother</a> says he limited his gaming time out of fear of addiction and the “dangers of the internet.”&nbsp;</p><p>While a saint who played video games might give a young Catholic kid ammo to argue for a console or some V-bucks, it could just as easily be used by a parent to keep their kid away from games–if a <em>saint</em> knew he barely stood a chance against them, what hope does your average kid have? Acutis’ relationship to games also made me wonder what role they could have played in his sainthood beyond the novelty of “Catholic saint” and “video games” in the same headline. Is he a saint <em>despite</em> games or because he overcame them in some way, or could they have added something to his spiritual life?&nbsp;</p><p>Liesegang, as a game designer, acknowledged his own bias here before saying, “I don’t know that there’s anything particularly remarkable about him being a gamer per se, other than it being a reminder that God can be and is present everywhere. The Jesuit principle ‘<a href="https://www.jesuits.global/spirituality/finding-god-in-all-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding God in all things</a>’ means that anything which does not directly injure your relationship with God is in fact something that can support and nurture it. So we find God in music, in literature, in theater, in films, in science, in exploration, and, yes, in video games.”</p><p>Liesegang praises games for their ability to “get the player to feel like a part of something bigger, to think about moral choices both individual and systemic, to feel a range of emotions, to connect with others. All of these things are potentially part of a vision of humanity that I think is in line with God’s.”&nbsp;</p><p>“But we also see that [games] have the potential to make people <em>less</em> developed in their humanity: isolated, cruel, cold. That’s apparently what Acutis saw in some of his friends and why he chose to moderate his gaming. I wish more people had that level of discernment, to say ‘oh, I don’t like how this is affecting me, even if it is flooding me with dopamine.’”&nbsp;</p><p>Liesegang tells me a story from his days as a game designer: “I remember sitting in a meeting once when I still worked in games where a tech artist was showing off a new system he had developed for having bodies explode in the game. I’m enough of a programmer to appreciate what he had done at the craft level, but I just felt very uneasy. I’m not a prude, but it started to make me think, i<em>s this what I want my name on?</em> A long road from there to being a Jesuit, but those little tugs at your soul do mean something.”&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Liesegang notes, “Go into any Catholic church and you will find a prominent central display of the body of an executed man, sometimes still alive and writhing in agony.”&nbsp;</p><p>I’d ultimately agree with Liesegang’s feeling that if God can be found everywhere, that includes in video games. It’s an understanding rooted in Jesuit theology; while we don’t know if Acutis shared it, he did attend a Jesuit school in Milan. (For what it’s worth, I worked briefly with the Jesuits as a prison chaplain during my time in divinity school.) But whatever Acutis’ specific beliefs, Liesegang’s view shines new light on the attention paid to his gaming habits. Rather than being a headline-making incongruity or a cudgel parents might use to keep their kids away from games, they could be seen as a holistic part of his faith, just as much as his religious devotion or Catholicism-focused websites.</p><p>“God is glorified by more than just attending Mass and praying rosaries,” Liesegang says. “God is glorified when I work for social justice, when I learn about other cultures, when I solve a new programming problem, when I tend our community garden, when I wash dishes with my brother Jesuits. Whatever makes you more human also makes you closer to God.”</p><h2><strong>Household saints</strong></h2><p>Beyond being careful with your gaming time, what is the positive example Acutis as a saint might uniquely be able to offer? What can a 15-year-old, even one who might now have special sway in heaven, really teach people about how to live alongside the horrors of the modern internet, or within the culture wars that exploded in gaming after his death? He at least <em>lived</em> in our context, unlike other saints, but in our current era of streamers and Instagram, does he really deserve the moniker of “God’s influencer?”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Beatification of Carlo Acutis: The first millennial to be declared Blessed | EWTN News Nightly" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFmj9Fw6Acw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Liesegang agrees with me that there’s something a bit forced in the whole “God’s influencer” line, saying, “The Church moves too slowly to ever be hip, so there will always be a bit of [that] ‘hello fellow kids’ energy.” But, he says, “there <em>is</em> also genuine religiosity among youth, so finding ways to tap into that is good.”</p><p>Acutis’ example to youth might be especially valuable these days, as institutions both secular and religious fail them. Youth are<a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/study-shows-young-adults-leaving-church-start-down-path-age-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> leaving the Church</a> while adult converts like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/11/jd-vance-catholic-pope-clash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">J.D. Vance</a> and the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/opinion/nyc-catholicism-dimes-square-religion.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dimes Square</a>” scene enter it; there might be something cringe about the “<a href="https://religionnews.com/2025/02/12/hes-a-young-millennial-catholic-priest-of-course-hes-a-social-media-influencer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influencer</a>” of it all, but it’s an earnest, <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/46124/carlo-acutis-loved-the-homeless-st-francis-of-assisi-and-souls-in-purgatory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">charity-focused</a> cringe, instead of a reactionary, Right-leaning one. If Acutis shows young people a positive way to live their values within the Church if they’re seeking that connection, I think that’s ultimately a good thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Liesegang says, “We use ‘saint’ in casual conversation to say that someone is perfect, that their lives are fully exemplary, and that they are somehow otherworldly. There is this connotation that they are somehow specially touched by God from the beginning, given a special grace that the rest of us don’t have… Sometimes, even within the Church, we use ‘saints and sinners’ as a kind of dialectic, implying that these are two separate groups. But every saint was also a sinner. We should never forget that. These are not perfected people rising out of humanity, but heroes from within, who did the work and struggled and failed and kept going.”</p><p>I’ll admit that, despite my education in theology, Acutis’ cause is the first time I’ve been inspired to learn more about how sainthood works, in an effort to understand why <em>him</em> instead of people I’d personally imagine more deserving. (Out of respect for all of your time, I’ve cut how frequently I demanded Liesegang explain why Acutis but not <a href="https://catholicworker.org/dorothy-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dorothy Day</a>, whom he reminded me <a href="https://catholicworker.org/acclaiming-saint-dorothy-an-argument-against-her-canonization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t want to be called a saint</a>.) And talking to someone on the “inside” of the Church showed me that, even if there <em>is</em> something a bit eye-rolling about a lot of this, Acutis can also remind people of the sanctity of the everyday, where a religious life can live alongside a conscious approach to secular hobbies like video games.&nbsp;</p><p>And while the “saints” and “miracles” of it all might still feel alienating, Liesegang offered his personal interpretation of all that, saying he doesn’t see miracles as “God waving a magic wand to give us something we want. For me, it goes back to the core revelation of Christianity, that God <em>is</em> love. Not a metaphor, not a simile, not poetic language, but literally that the least wrong way to think of the Mystery That Underlies Reality is to think of it as love… When we say that humans are made in the image of God, that’s what I think it means — it’s our capacity to love that makes us like God. We don’t have [God’s] same power to remake reality, but in small ways, when we choose to not give in to the basest firings of our neurons driven by our selfish genes, when we allow that deepest part of us to operate as it should, when we love, those are miracles. And that’s an encouraging thought, because it means it’s happening all the time, all around us.”</p><p><em><strong>Clarification, 4/14, 11:50am</strong>--Edited the wording of how the Church investigates miracles to be more clear that doubts specifically related to miracles would not stop the process.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles"><h3>How Xalavier Nelson Does It</h3></a><p>"The systems you set up give you the life that you live in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer DeadToast Entertainment have announced the release date for shoot-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, in which you must descend into hell in order to arrest Satan himself.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shotgun-cop-man-my-friend-pedro-creator" rel="nofollow">in February</a>,&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is the next game from DeadToast, whose name you might recognize from the similarly irreverent shooter&nbsp;<em>My Friend Pedro&nbsp;</em>(although this one doesn't feature any talking bananas, to the best of my knowledge).</p>

<p>It's launching on May 1st, also known as May Day in Europe, which feels particularly appropriate given the frantic nature of your mission. The game will be landing on Switch and PC, and while there's no word of a Switch 2 release, I'm not sure this one would benefit from the new machine's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">beefier specs</a> anyway.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=Wx1t8aGX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shotgun-cop-man-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=K2JJIdKt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is coming to a PC or Switch near you in May.</figcaption></figure><p>In&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>, you play as the titular law enforcement officer, and it's your job to enter hell in order to arrest Satan. As you can probably imagine, he's none too pleased about the intrusion, so you must battle your way through the hordes of the underworld to reach him.</p>

<p>DeadToast says you'll be armed with "a devastating arsenal and a relentless thirst for glory" in the pursuit of said goal; not only will you have access to a range of weapons (including the titular shotgun), but you'll also use them to propel yourself through&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man</em>'s world.</p>

<p>The game will feature a handcrafted campaign with more than 150 levels to take on, but once you're done with that, you can also try out user-generated levels or perhaps even make your own.</p>

<p>Various challenges are also available if you want to step up your&nbsp;<em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>experience a notch, including No Damage runs, Speedrun parameters, and Kill All stipulations.</p>




<p><em>Shotgun Cop Man&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch on May 1st.</p>
