It’s fall, and spooky season is upon us, which means it’s time to spend your nights settling in with a good scary movie. We’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-halloween-movies-disney-scary-spooky-1851654060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-halloween-movies-disney-scary-spooky-1851654060">a list of those for you to check out</a></span>, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021">best horror games of the last 20 years</a></span>, but what if you’re looking for something more specific? Maybe something sexy, sensual, and sanguine? A vampire movie, perhaps?</p><p>We’ve got a collection of must-watch vampire flicks for your perusal, from ‘80s classics like <em>The Lost Boys</em> and <em>Near Dark</em> to more modern movies like <em>Van Helsing </em>and <em>Queen of the Damned</em>. There’s scary ones like <em>30 Days of Nights</em>, and hilarious ones like <em>What We Do in the Shadows. </em>Whatever kind of vampire movie you’re looking for, we’ve got you covered. So in no particular order, here are the vampire movies you should check out ASAP.</p></div></div><div><p>Joel Schumacher’s <em>The Lost Boys</em> is certainly not the scariest vampire movie, and possibly not the funniest, but it’s the one I can watch and rewatch, over and again, while quoting along with all its most iconic scenes in the most infuriating way possible.</p><p>It’s so wonderfully ‘80s, yet utterly timeless, a ludicrous mishmash of adult horror, Spielbergish children’s caper, and teenage metal album cover, a combination that’s clearly aimed at no one and yet perfect for everyone. This is a movie that has chilling nighttime vampiric stalking sequences and the line, “My own brother, a goddamn shit-sucking vampire! You wait ‘til mom finds out!”</p><p>While I’m not going to try to argue that this film isn’t cheesy, I am going to argue that it’s more than cheesy. That’s in large part thanks to a cast that, alongside 80s cheddar-chewers like Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, features the likes of Jason Patric, Edward Herrmann, and the always exquisite Dianne Wiest. Never mind Alex Winter, two years before anyone would hear of <em>Bill &amp; Ted</em>. <br></p><p>It’s hilariously funny, but it’s funny on purpose. It’s surprisingly creepy, but always with a wry grin. And it’s by far the most quotable vampire film ever made. “Maggots, Michael. You’re eating maggots.” “Are you freebasing? Inquiring minds want to know.” “Then what are ya? The flying nun?!” — John Walker</p></div><div><p>Come for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/netflixfilm/reel/CYkE7_gpjj4/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/netflixfilm/reel/CYkE7_gpjj4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">absurd way Keanu Reeves pronounces “Budapest,”</a></span> stay for literally everything else. The acclaimed film from the man behind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/megalopolis-movie-coppola-reviews-cast-rotten-tomatoes-1851660791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/megalopolis-movie-coppola-reviews-cast-rotten-tomatoes-1851660791">this year’s most baffling movie, <em>Megalopolis</em></a></span>, <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula </em>is a masterpiece, a supple, sensual experience that looks expensive, sounds incredible, and feels dark and dirty and downright wrong. </p><p>The costumes, designed by the legendary Eiko Ishioka, are seared into my memory, from the blood-red armor that looks like musculature to the bone-white lacy collars and headpieces and the impossibly tight corsets representing the shackles of Victorian ideals. Couple that with incredible set design and wildly innovative special effects, and it’s difficult to think of another movie with such a strong visual identity.</p><p>Plus Winona Ryder is an absolute vision to behold as Mina Harker, a Victorian woman drawn to the dark (and sexy) side by Gary Oldman’s (admittedly irresistible) Dracula—we watch as those big, brown eyes that once looked upon the world with innocent curiosity mature and morph into something darker and more dangerous. <em>Bram Stoker’s Dracula </em>is an absolute must-watch not just during spooky season, but year-round. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>It’s not that vampires weren’t cool to me when I was young. They were cool, but in a kind of stuffy, old-timey way. I watched old movies about Dracula and even ventured into his realm myself in <em>Castlevania</em>, and so vampires, to me, were synonymous with capes and fog and remote castles in the European countryside hundreds of years ago. (And yes, I saw <em>The Lost Boys</em>, but while it was “fun” in a cheesy sort of way, it was too glossy and mainstream to really get me excited about the idea of modern-day bloodsuckers.) Then I saw Kathryn Bigelow’s movie <em>Near Dark</em> and had my entire understanding of vampires turned upside down. These vampires were rock n’ roll! Like a leather-clad biker gang that also wanted to suck your blood, <em>Near Dark</em>’s band of modern-day nightcrawlers simultaneously horrified me and electrified me. I wanted to run away from them, <em>and</em> I wanted to be one of them. Who wouldn’t feel the charismatic pull of a group that includes both Bill Paxton—at his most sinister and unnerving here in a thrilling performance—and Lance Henriksen, whose gravitas serves as a counterbalance to Paxton’s mania?</p><p>The movie is as rock n’ roll as its subjects, an exhilarating American odyssey of open roads, small-town motels, and dimly lit bars, with real visual energy and poetry to it. Before she’d go on to mak<em>e Point Break</em> and the much-maligned but now widely reclaimed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692?_gl=1*19ctsm0*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTI2NTM3Ni4yNDkuMS4xNzI5MjY2ODA4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/strange-days-streaming-cyberpunk-2077-braindance-1849945692?_gl=1*19ctsm0*_ga*MTk4MjkyODk2OS4xNzExNTYxOTM0*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTI2NTM3Ni4yNDkuMS4xNzI5MjY2ODA4LjYwLjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Strange Days</em></a></span><em>, Near Dark</em> announced the arrival of a major filmmaking talent in Kathryn Bigelow. It also changed the way I thought about vampires forever. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p><em>Van Helsing</em> is one of those aughts movies that is campy and silly while trying to keep a semi-straight face. Starring Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing in one of his sexiest roles ever and Kate Beckinsale as the equally sexy Anna Valerious, <em>Van Helsing</em> is an homage to the Universal horror movies of the ‘30s and ‘40s, which is why it can sometimes feel a bit too reliant on pastiche. It reminds me a lot of <em>The League of Extraordinary Gentleman</em>, the steampunk/Gothic comic book movie featuring iconic literary characters like Tom Sawyer, Dorian Grey, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde which came out a year earlier.</p><p>It’s got all the hallmarks of an aughts film: an overreliance on mediocre digital effects, an incessantly blue tinge in nearly every scene, and unabashed horniness. Is it a great movie? No. But is it a movie in which incredibly hot and incredibly horny brides of Dracula transform into gray-skinned flying bats to attack a small village and try to turn Kate Beckinsale before one of them takes an auto-crossbow to the gut from Jackman that pins her to a building’s spire? Yes. — AM</p></div><div><p>While the TV show on FX has become arguably more well-known and popular than the original movie, 2014’s <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> is worth checking out a decade after its release. The basic setup of the movie, like the show, is that a group of vampires live together in a house, and we watch them via a documentary camera crew as they try to navigate normal and paranormal situations including ex-lovers, werewolves, parties, and the death of a friend.</p><p>What really makes <em>Shadows </em>a blast to watch over and over is that the cast, including Takia Waititi and Jemaine Clement, perfectly nail their roles as loveable vampires trying to fit into modern society while still being creepy bloodsucking weirdos you probably wouldn’t want to hang out with in real life. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>1998's <em>Blade </em>gives us <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=blade+club+scene&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1108US1108&amp;oq=blade+club+scene&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE0MDhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#vhid=zephyr:0&amp;vssid=atritem-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXHzcIBC50MU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=blade+club+scene&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS1108US1108&amp;oq=blade+club+scene&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE0MDhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#vhid=zephyr:0&amp;vssid=atritem-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DXHzcIBC50MU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the most iconic opening scenes</a></span> of all time: a hot girl drags a goofy guy through a butcher shop to the entrance of a secret club filled with writhing bodies undulating to a techno beat. Hot people make out in corners and eye the guy like he’s a lone zebra calf on an open plain and they’re a pack of lions. Suddenly, the club’s sprinkler system goes off—but instead of water, the sprinklers are spraying blood. “What’s the matter, baby?” the girl asks, her fangs bared. Just when you think this guy is going to become vamp dinner, Blade, the Daywalker, shows up.</p><p>Wesley Snipes is incredible as Blade, the stoic, self-hating half-vampire determined to protect the human race from the worst of his kind. <em>Blade</em> is a bit goofy at times, sure, but we also get banger performances from Kris Kristofferson as Blade’s comrade in arms and Stephen Dorff as an evil vampire club owner. It’s a classic flick, and I really really really hope we can see Mahershala Ali step into Blade’s leather fit sometime soon. — AM</p></div><div><p><em>Let The Right One In</em> was the Swedish precursor to Matt Reeves’ horror success, <em>Let Me In</em>. So, are we picking <em>Låt den rätte komma</em> in because we’re some bunch of pretentious film snobs? Nope, it’s because I’ve <em>seen</em> this version, but never got around to the U.S. follow-up. Although it seems likely you’d do well to watch either, or both.</p><p>Based on the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, <em>Let the Right One In</em> tells the deeply quiet and gentle story of a friendship between a 12-year-old boy, Oskar, and a girl who looks much his own age, Eli. Eli is new to the area, and moves into the apartment building next door to Oskar, and the two begin to form a relationship, despite Eli’s opening declaration that they could never be friends. Eli, as you might have guessed given the nature of this collection of films, is also a vampire, which somewhat complicates things—especially as she needs blood, and the adult man she lives with, Håkan, is failing to secure her any.</p><p>What follows is the most stunningly calm and evenly paced piece of cinema, in which the snow is as much of a character as any of the people. It’s a film that’s about childhood, about bullying, and about friendship, before it’s about vampiric dismemberment, but it does this without pretensions, without thinking itself above the genre, and also with plenty of vampiric dismemberment. Years before the breakthrough of “Scandi-noir,” <em>Let the Right One In</em> embodied all of its defining features of understated severity, brooding quietness, and dark, dark humor. — JW</p></div><div><p>Yes, the television series of the same name based on the same book by Anne Rice is just as good as (if not better than) this Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise film, but you absolutely must watch this movie first. Not only does it have two of the most iconic modern actors playing a bitchy gay vampire couple wearing more makeup than I do for a night at the club, but a baby-faced Kirsten Dunst will wow you as a young girl perpetually frozen in adolescence. </p><p>It’s campy, it’s lush, it’s absurd—it’s Anne Rice, baby. — AM</p></div><div><p>One time I convinced a friend of mine to sit down and watch <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> with me and they had no idea what the movie was about. For the first 30 or so minutes, they were enjoying the dark story of two criminals kidnapping a family and stealing their RV to make their escape to Mexico. And then, after stopping at a large strip club/bar, vampires showed up and my friend was shocked, but also extremely excited.</p><p>Sadly, if you are reading this now you can’t have this experience. But <em>Dusk</em>’s shift from a story about criminals on the run to a tale of survival as a small group of people fight back endless waves of demonic vampires still works even if you know what’s coming. It’s like two movies stitched together and it somehow works. A big reason the “twist” succeeds is that the group we meet in the first half is well-defined and we get to really know who they are, so as they start to get picked off in the second half we care a lot more. What could have been a so-so vampire movie is elevated by the first half and some incredible gore. — ZZ<br></p></div><div><p>If you’re into nu-metal and the late, great Aaliyah, then you’re into <em>Queen of the Damned.</em> This is another one of the movies on this list that isn’t necessarily <em>good</em> but it is an important entry into the lexicon of vampire cinema. It follows iconic vampire Lestat (Stuart Townsend), a rock star in the modern day whose nu-metal concert wakes up Akasha (Aaliyah), the ancient queen of vampires who wants to make him her king consort. </p><p>It’s based on a book in Anne Rice’s <em>Vampire Chronicles</em> series (and is <em>technically</em> a sequel to <em>Interview</em>), and it is as horny and absurd as all good vampire movies should be. There’s ancient vampire meetings, sexual subservience, and a quest for world domination, all powered by music by Disturbed, Papa Roach, and Chester Bennington. Hot Topic was never the same. — AM</p></div><div><p>If “the first Iranian vampire Western” doesn’t pique your interest, I fear nothing will. <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is a beautiful subversion of the traditional life of a woman in Iran—a young vampire woman with a taste for bad men (literally) can freely roam the streets at night, because she <em>is</em> the danger in the dark. She begins to interfere in the life of a young man struggling to take care of his addict father who has gotten them into a pickle with a local drug dealer—the more she interferes, the more it’s clear that she’s no typical woman, but does that matter? </p><p>The film, clearly inspired by Sergio Leone and spaghetti Westerns as well as the original <em>Nosferatu</em>, is beautifully shot and well-acted, taking the familiar genres and turning them upside down and inside out by melding them with a bold, graphic novel-esque visual style. — AM<br></p></div><div><p><em>30 Days of Night </em>(based on the comic book series of the same name) is intense and relentless—as intense as it must be to face a 30-day-long polar night when you’re town is being attacked by vampires, I suppose. That’s the premise of the 2007 horror film, directed by David Slade and starring Josh Hartnett as the sheriff of the small, snowy town of Barrow, which is its own character in this film. </p><p>Though <em>30 Days of Night</em> falls victim to some typical vampire movie tropes (lightning-fast movement, heaps upon heaps of cruelty, and some gaping plot holes), its unique setting helps it stand out in a sanguine sea. You can almost <em>feel</em> the cold hand of death creeping up your leg while you watch it, and it will certainly make you a little bit more freaked out on an impossibly quiet, snowy night. — AM</p></div><div><p>If you’ve got some extra spare time over an upcoming weekend, you should absolutely double feature 1985's <em>Fright Night</em> and the 2011 remake starring Colin Farrell. In both films, a teenager believes his new next-door neighbor is a vampire and turns to an actor who played a vampire hunter to help him oust the bastard. The original is more campy and absurd thanks to its reliance on practical effects and the overall ‘80s-ness of it all, but the second has both Farrell and the late Anton Yelchin, so it’s worth a watch. Try them back-to-back and see which one is your fave. — AM</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

33 Immortals - the 33-player co-op action roguelike from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a> studio Thunder Lotus - has been delayed into next year, as it "needs a little bit more time in the oven before it's ready".
</p>
<p>
Thunder Lotus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-developers-new-game-is-a-33-player-co-op-action-rpg">unveiled 33 Immortals last June</a>, promising a game in which players, taking on the role of damned souls, must co-operative to defeat hordes of monsters and massive bosses in order to rebel against God's final judgment and fight for their eternal lives.
</p>
<p>
33 Immortals was originally due to launch into early access sometime this year, but Thunder Lotus has now pushed its release into 2025, as it revealed <a href="https://x.com/ThunderLotus/status/1846959359043272895">on social media</a>. "The game needs a little bit more time the oven before it's ready," the studio wrote. "We're making great progress, but this year has really flown by! We still want to iron out a few unexpected challenges with stability and address the valuable feedback we've received from you during testing."

"Though we don't have a set date for 2025 just yet," Thunder Lotus continued, "we're excited to announce that another playable opportunity is coming soon on both Epic and Xbox. Stay tuned for more details, we think you'll love what's coming next."
</p><p>
33 Immortals will make its early access debut on Xbox, Windows PC, and the Epic Games Store, with Thunder Lotus having elected to eschew Steam at launch. Whether the studio can pull off its ambitious concept remains to be seen, but signs are promising: its previous titles - Spiritfarer, Jotun, and Sundered - have ranged from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sundered-review">great</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-review-a-beautiful-unique-blend-of-genres">geniunely special</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/18/24273563/supper-mario-broth-creator-fan-support<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the popular Mario blog, <a href="https://www.suppermariobroth.com/">Supper Mario Broth</a>, have come together to remind us that the internet can still be a place where good things happen.</p><p>Supper Mario Broth is one of the most wholesome Mario blogs on the internet. Since 2017, its owner has posted a regular stream of Mario-flavored tidbits he could dig up including interesting glitches, old advertisements and merchandise, screenshots, gifs, artwork, and more. If it’s obscure and has to do with Mario, Supper Mario Broth will let you know about it and the blog has become a celebrated institution in the broader Nintendo community. </p><p>However on October 17th, the person behind all this wonderful content <a href="https://youtu.be/QAPGbeknudY?si=UNRxHxYbatCc8wFZ">posted a video</a> saying the entire endeavor was in danger of being permanently shut down. “This is the end of Supper Mario Broth as we know it,” said the creator, who has not revealed his real name <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/meet-the-meticulous-fan-behind-the-internets-most-meticulous-mario-blog/">and prefers to simply go by Broth</a>. </p><p>In the short-but-heart-wrenching video, Broth revealed that for the last six years he was the primary caregiver for his mother. He said the government assistance he received for that work, in addition to a part-time salary and meager earnings from his Patreon was just barely enough to allow him to work on Supper full-time. However, Broth shared that his mother passed away and that his other earnings wouldn’t be enough for him to stay in his apartment. </p><p>“I will have to get a full-time job,” he said. “And I will not have any time to do Supper Mario Broth anymore.”</p><p>Broth ends the video with an emotional plea begging his fans for their help. </p><p>“I’m praying for a miracle,” Broth said.</p><p>And he got one.</p><p>The very next day, October 18th, Broth posted an update saying support he received was so great that not only would he be able to continue his work full-time but he’d also be able to expand his operation.</p><p>Because of community, mutual support, and genuine human empathy, a person had their livelihood saved. Not only that, but Broth’s work has genuinely contributed to the preservation of <em>Mario</em> history and we, thankfully, still get to enjoy that.</p><p>“I will always remember [...] all of the joy we shared in Mario,” Broth said. “And I hope that whatever happens, you will remember me.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Certain Affinity, a developer known for its co-development projects on major franchises and games like Call of Duty, Halo, and Hogwarts Legacy, has been sold to Keywords Studios. You might not have heard of the Dublin-based Keywords, but the company is gigantic--it owns 50 companies around the world, many of which are connected to the video game industry in one way or another.</p><p>Keywords paid an <a href="https://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=34632409&amp;company=keywords" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">undisclosed sum</a> for Certain Affinity, and as part of the buyout, CEO Max Hoberman and president Paul Sams will stay on with the company. Keywords said it's excited about Certain Affinity's future, which includes a "strong pipeline of high-quality projects." One of these is the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-gets-a-new-trailer-featuring-cosmic-horrors-and-matthew-mcconaughey/1100-6527187/" data-ref-id="1100-6527187">Exodus, which features Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey</a>. Certain Affinity is a co-developer on the game with Archetype Entertainment, which itself is a division of Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Keywords CEO Bertrand Bodson said the company has "enormous respect" for Certain Affinity, while Hoberman said he was "thrilled" to sell to Keywords "at this most difficult time in the market." He said selling to Keywords gives Certain Affinity and its 180+ employees "stability and a supportive home."</p><p>The video game industry has faced a tough stretch in the past few years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">regarding mass layoffs</a>.

In addition to supporting other developer's projects, Certain Affinity made its first original game, Age of Booty, in 2008. More recently, Certain Affinity was in the news when it came to light that the studio was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-battle-royale-mode-could-have-been-a-game-changer-dev-says/1100-6527192/" data-ref-id="1100-6527192">working on a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite until it was canceled.</a></p><p>In March 2024, Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-and-cod-support-dev-lays-off-25-people-citing-unprecedented-challenges/1100-6522262/" data-ref-id="1100-6522262">laid off about 25 employees</a>, its first round of significant cuts in nearly two decades of operation.</p>

<p>Call of Duty has featured some form of Early Access for the last several years, so we’re here to discuss Black Ops 6 and the notion of more Early Access and whether either the Campaign, Zombies, or Multiplayer can be enjoyed earlier than scheduled.</p>



<p>I’ve enjoyed playing the last few CoD campaigns before the official release date. Doing so allows me to complete the story component and move on to the rest of the content with time to spare. I got through the relatively short Modern Warfare 3 Campaign in 2023 ahead of time, meaning I was free to pile my way through multiplayer on launch.</p>



<p>Players typically enjoy this freedom, making Early Access a great benefit and a cool incentive to pre-order. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 release date</a> is on the horizon, so let’s see if Early Access is included in this year’s iteration.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-campaign-early-access">Does Black Ops 6 have Campaign Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bad news, sadly. Credit to Activison</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 does not have Campaign Early Access</strong>, nor does the first-person shooter offer Early Access in any capacity. You must wait until launch day before you can play any of the game’s main content: Campaign, Zombies, and online multiplayer.</p>



<p>My first memory of CoD going down the Early Access route was 2016’s Infinite Warfare, which famously included a special Legacy Edition—giving you access to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered. If you pre-ordered, you could play CoD 4’s Campaign before the full multiplayer launch.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to modern times, and 2022 and 2023’s Modern Warfare reboot entries have also featured Campaign Early Access. This tactic presumably encourages players to soak in and appreciate the time and effort that went into the Campaign before sinking hundreds and thousands of hours into multiplayer.</p>



<p>For whatever reason, Treyarch/Activision has decided against the idea of Early Acces this time around. Personally, it doesn’t deter me from playing the Black Ops 6 Campaign as I play them all—especially when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-achievements-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 trophies</a> are on the line.</p>



<p>You might have a headache concerning the BLOPS 6 content you choose first, but it’s a good dilemma to consider. We’ll have to see if Campaign Early Access returns for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty 2025</a>.</p>

			<p>Once Human received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-dev-promises-strict-action-against-pvp-exploits-being-abused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge new update</a> today, allowing players to explore a completely new region in the free-to-play supernatural shooter. To celebrate the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of the update</a>, there is a trailer that showcases the content that players will be able to dive into. It's two minutes long and showcases the frosty North that players can explore and attempt to survive in. This new update brings in a brand new scenario for players to experience, named The Way of Winter. There is plenty of new content to experience and a lot of difficult enemies that players will have to come up against while fighting off the harsh conditions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human | The Way of Winter Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OyIXqa9ikZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since Once human's release, The Way of Winter is the largest and most content-rich scenario update since the game originally came out, as this scenario is focusing heavily on hardcore multiplayer survival in the north. Players who want to tackle this scenario will find themselves in the northernmost part of Nalcott, where there are new Deviations to encounter as well as new Deviants to fight off. However, Deviants aren't the only threat in this region, as there is also the Vultures faction that is responsible for domineering the region. Since this scenario is the largest to be released since Once Human came out, the scenario will take place over 35 days in total, with four different stages. There is also the season break, which will last 28 days during this time.</p>
<p>To make sure that this scenario is as immersive as possible, The Way of Winter scenario adds temperature as a survival mechanic. On top of micromanaging your sanity, energy, hydration, and stamina, you now need to make sure that you are regulating your temperature in both hot and cold climates. To be able to withstand the drastic temperatures, you'll have to learn how to craft heat and cold-resistant gear as well as cook spicy dishes, similar to the mechanics seen in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>For this scenario in particular, playing in co-op is recommended as players will be able to survive for longer in the Thermal Tower building, which can be scouted and secured quicker with a large group of friends to help you.</p>
<p>Those who are eager to get stuck into this update will be glad to know that the chilling event is already available, and you can begin your journey to the north of Nalcott to try and survive the harsh weather climates. Bring a friend or ten if you can.</p>

"In the meantime, we've unfortunately had to put our team on notice for redundancy.</p><p>"Our team has created a prototype for a bold new project," the update later continues. "It's darker, edgier, and more visceral than our first game, but it retains all ZAU's high-octane combat and cultural depth. And we're looking for a partner."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tales of Kenzera: Zau is the first release from Surgent Studios, which was founded by actor Abubakar Salim in 2020. The game received generally positive critical reviews, including our own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">7/10 review</a> that said while its action wasn't groundbreaking, "it's elevated by a truly moving tale about how to go on in this world when your loved ones have passed on to the next."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Our work on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZauTheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ZauTheGame</a> is coming to a close (although there’s a little more on the way). </p><p>Now we’re looking to the future with our next project…and we need a partner.</p><p>We have a few irons in the fire, but YOU can help move the needle by telling us what you thought of ZAU and… <a href="https://t.co/AAMyp4YGAL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/AAMyp4YGAL</a></p></div>— Abubakar Salim (@Abzybabzy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Abzybabzy/status/1847194778766602657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Despite the game's positive reception, Surgent Studios has had a rocky year. The studio and its members have been the victim of a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sweet-baby-video-games-harassment-gamergate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing campaign</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/19/the-disturbing-online-misogyny-of-gamergate-has-returned-if-it-ever-went-away" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing, targeted harassment</a> since Tales of Kenzera: Zau's release, to the point where Salim <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-director-addresses-constant-targeted-harassment-lowers-price-of-game-on-switch">addressed the wave of hatred</a> in a public message back in May. And earlier this year, Surgent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-surgent-studios-hit-with-layoffs">laid off "just over a dozen" developers</a>, citing "a difficult time in the games industry." These cuts come as part of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more">wider trend in layoffs</a> sweeping the industry as project funding dries up, leading to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 13,000 individuals</a> laid off just this year.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

In addition to his usual selection of Exotic arms and armor, you'll be able to get yourself a skimmer to jet around on, provided that you have a hefty 97 Strange Coins to spend on one. Skimmers were previously only available during the Guardian Games, so this is a good time to grab one now. Here's where Xur is this week, and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for <strong>Tractor Cannon</strong> and <strong>The Fourth Horseman</strong>, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up <strong>Celestial Nighthawk</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Wormgod Caress</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Crown of Tempests</strong>. If you're looking for Exotic weapons, Xur has <strong>Hawkmoon</strong>, <strong>Arbalest</strong>, <strong>Coldheart</strong>, and <strong>DARCI</strong> this week.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386765-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386765-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386765"></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the Tower's Bazaar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386765-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44.

It also modifies Golden Gun to fire a single high-damage shot, and any targets defeated by that ability will explode and help you recharge your Super more quickly. The good thing about this roll is that you get a high intellect stat to play into the Super-centric nature of this Exotic, but you're getting low recovery, discipline, and strength here. You'll be a bit of a glass cannon if you run with this Exotic, but it does pair very nicely with the Still Hunt Exotic sniper rifle.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 18</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 23</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 66</li></ul><h3>Wormgod Caress (Exotic Titan gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386936-destiny22024-10-1819-06-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386936" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386936-destiny22024-10-1819-06-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4386936"></a><figcaption>Wormgod Caress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4386936-destiny22024-10-1819-06-13.jpg"></figure><p>A very good Exotic for Titans looking to leap into the fray, Wormgod Caress increases the damage you'll deal with melee attacks.

he conducts business in The Final Shape. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn bonus Strange Coins from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

But, while playing <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, I discovered an important detail that I thought was worth sharing. Namely, that pooping raises your main character’s stats.

The world of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has a five-day week with thirty days in a month like a weird version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">French Republican calendar</a>. The days of the week are Flamesday, Watersday, Arboursday,&nbsp; Metalsday, and Idlesday. The time you want your character to poop is Idlesday, which is the fifth day. Pooping on this day will permanently increase your luck by 1. Doing so on the other days will do nothing statistically, so basically, if any day of the month is divisible by 5, you want to crap.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-expose-paints-a-fairly-bleak-picture-theres-no-actual-focus-on-getting-the-game-done/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One day before the yearly CitizenCon event, Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an expose on Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games, painting a relatively bleak picture of the game's future. According to Henderson, CIG employees working on stuff that needed to be ready for CitizenCon were asked to work on weekends, too. After employee complaints, CIG changed the policy to allow for Sundays off, provided they had already worked 56 hours that week.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the mood isn't great, and there are deep-seated issues to be found. Firstly, funds seem to have dwindled despite Star Citizen raising a record-breaking $790 million. Over a hundred jobs were cut at Cloud Imperium Games earlier this year at the Los Angeles and Austin offices, while wage increases have stopped. Meanwhile, there are lots of expenses that many feel are unnecessary, such as the huge bar located on the ninth floor of CIG's shiny new Manchester building or the pricey custom Star Citizen furniture that decors the same office.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, the development is taking too long for a variety of reasons, including CIG founder and frontman Chris Roberts. A former employee told Henderson:</p>
<p><em>I've genuinely been sat in meetings that got derailed for 30 minutes so that the placement of objects that players are likely never to interact with could be discussed in detail. There's just no actual focus on getting the game done.</em></p>
<p>Another added:</p>
<p><em>Sometimes the most basic features can be reviewed by Roberts half a dozen times, for it then to be scrapped or changed on the 7th review.</em></p>
<p>The much-vaunted <a href="https://wccftech.com/starengine-video-shows-off-stunning-visuals-for-an-open-galaxy-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Engine</a> is also reportedly one of the reasons for the slow development of Star Citizen. As you might remember, the game was originally based on CryEngine but then <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-switches-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved on the Amazon Lumberyard fork</a>. At this point, though, it has gone through so many changes and modifications that CIG developers described it as a Frankenstein of a game development tool that is unwieldy to use, to say the least.</p>
<p>Going back to the funding issue, Henderson says Cloud Imperium Games plans to leverage Squadron 42's relatively close launch to fund Star Citizen and possibly Squadron 42 sequels, too. However, the insider reckons the game actually just made it to the feature complete stage, despite CIG telling fans that development stage had been reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly one year ago</a>. Beyond Squadron 42, CIG plans to continue selling in-game ships at high prices, but Henderson also uncovered another potential venue: a third game that would take place in a medieval fantasy setting. Needless to say, details are scarce on this project.</p>

		<p><em>One thing the entire Remap staff have in common is they've all in longterm relationships with their partners. For Rob and Patrick specifically, that means relationships that are entering into their second (!!) decades. Relationships change over time, but they also have a habit of condensing, as people come to understand one another more deeply, and more and more of their lives overlap.</em></p><p><em>Some habits and hobbies overlap, while others...look, it's okay to have YOU time. But what defines YOU time, and how does it change over the years? And as you better define who you are and how each of you slot into the relationship, doesn't it become harder and harder to carve out time to develop your own interests?</em></p><p><em>And somehow, this conversation all starts because of Silent Hill 2...</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I couldn’t help but laugh during a moment on last week’s podcast where, after excitedly accepting my offer of a download code to play<em> Silent Hill 2</em> on your PlayStation 5, you ended up not spending any time with the game before your partner declared it was not a spooky evening.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, looked at me booting up<em> Silent Hill </em>2 and went “thank god, I can go to bed early.” If she can find an excuse to be in bed before 10pm, she’ll take it. Despite our shared love of horror, it does not really extend to watching me beat the crap out of flesh blobs and trying to figure out what arcane pieces are needed to progress past a jukebox puzzle.</p><p>What it got me thinking about was something we <em>don’t </em>have in common: partners who are into video games. My wife has never had a problem with my career or the amount of time that I spend playing video games, free time or not. This is a woman who, prior to me getting seriously into football and arguably becoming a bigger nerd of it these days, would spend Sundays at the bar down the street, cheering with strangers, while I tracked down another side quest in<em> Fallout 3</em>. Our worlds eventually overlapped on sports, but games have never quite clicked with her.</p><p>There have been a few exceptions and both involve, perhaps not shockingly, zombies.&nbsp;</p><p>When <em>Left 4 Dead 2 </em>came out, she was entranced by the pitch. This was an era where games still supported split-screen, so we booted it up on Xbox 360, and gave the game a few rounds. A first-person-shooter is a tough genre to dive into when you haven’t really played a video game since high school, and the moment that ultimately broke everything was realizing climbing a ladder meant looking up and moving forward. It was too much. Years later, when the first season of Telltale’s <em>The Walking Dead</em> was a phenomenon, we’d play that game side-by-side, with my wife calling the shots on the decisions. It was so fun that we ended up playing a few different Telltale games that way, too, before falling off them the way the rest of the world eventually did.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally speaking, my habits overlap with my wife’s. I love <em>sports</em> but she, at least, loves football, and has no problem spending all afternoon with the neighbors, beers in hand, watching the games roll on. (But I will say her interest drops sharply when the Chicago Bears are done, win or lose.) Our tastes on movies, television, and especially horror are on the same page, as well, which means there’s rarely any real debate over what we’re watching on a given night.</p><p>I like that. I love that we have many genuine reasons to spend time with one another, where the rare “free time” we get from the kids isn’t also fighting for our personal interests. There have been times in my life where I see photos of couples with two TVs lined up next to each other, as they dig into a game side-by-side, but I actually sorta like that video games are my thing?&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe I’d feel differently if she suddenly got into them, too, but it <em>is</em> nice to have your own thing.</p><p>My mind started off with video games, but I suppose this dynamic applies to all sorts of hobbies.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Patrick actually wouldn't mind his wife helping calm his nerves in Silent Hill 2. Credit: Ko</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> The longer MK and I have been together the more overlap there is. It might just be that as stuff like grad school and the challenges of our earlier careers recede, there’s simply more time and it’s easiest to fill it with stuff that’s already right in front of her because I’m so into it already. Or maybe we were uncannily well-matched from the start, we just wouldn’t fully realize it until a decade or so had passed. But sports went from my thing to our thing. Games were always her thing, but she got into them way more once I was working as a games critic. But the exact things she likes are different than the things I like. Her relationship to these hobbies is always distinct from mine.</p><p>I’ll give you an example. We both adore the Mercedes coupe I bought last year. It’s the greatest car we’ve ever owned, a sleekly luxurious highway cruiser. Like a lot of luxury touring cars, the E450 has different drive modes but the major ones are Comfort and Sport. I like Comfort a lot: it’s still a responsive and agile car, but it’s also got this incredibly smooth and quiet ride that honestly makes it one of the most comfortable places I spend time. Seriously, there are times I hit stop-and-go traffic that adds 45 minutes to my drive home and I honestly feel more relaxed because it’s like a spa day got extended.</p><p>In Sport mode, the priority is on handling and responsiveness. The sensitivity of the controls goes up sharply, and the suspension firms up so you can really feel the road. It’s twitchy and kind of harsh but it gives you quick access to pretty much all the clubs the car has in its bag. It’s… kind of unpleasant, if you ask me. But MK loves it. It’s turned highway ramps into her absolute favorite bits of road when traffic is light, because you can get a taste of what the car can do without actually going too fast. Where I love the Mercedes’ poise and comfort, she loves its eagerness and power. As she often says, there is no law about how <em>quickly </em>you get up to the speed limit.</p><p>A few weeks ago, she came back from having the car detailed and told me that while she was killing time and looking for something to do, she realized there was a karting track nearby. There was nobody there, so she got to go set laps by herself and absolutely <em>loved </em>it. She ran laps until her head was about to fall off her shoulders. She came back from that thinking she might want us to get a “track day” car someday, where it’s comfortable to drive on city streets but can absolutely carve up race courses. Think of stuff like the Mazda Miata / MX-5, the Chevy Corvette, or an M-model BMW and you get the idea.</p><p>Now I love racing and I love cars but this is not something I’ve ever felt a strong pull to do. Would I like to take a nice car onto a track? Absolutely. But would I go to the trouble of making that happen? Probably not. But my interest in racing and cars led to her having this moment of realization about how compelling driving can be.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a landmark release as it signals a proper return to Treyarch’s iconic brand of CoD. You are likely clamoring to know the full extent of the Black Ops 6 release date and its launch details. Luckily for you, we have all the details below.</p>



<p>Treyarch is back at the helm after a few years of Modern Warfare. Black Ops 6 continues Treyarch’s storied history with innovation and historical relocation, with new mechanics such as omnidirectional movement, intelligent mantling, and maneuverability. We are also zapped back to the late 1980s to rewrite history via a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is set to be one of the most exciting Call of Duty titles in years, and if the wait is proving too much, fear not, check out when it releases, its launch time, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-6-release-date">When is the Black Ops 6 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The next era of CoD is almost here. Credit to EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <span>will be released on&nbsp;<strong>October 25, 2024</strong>, and its launch date will see the latest CoD title come out with</span> all guns blazing on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>Since the dawn of man, Call of Duty titles have typically been released in the final week of October or the first week or so of November. Black Ops 6 falls into the former here, and its Friday launch should see many expectant players kickstart their weekends with a bang.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-time-does-black-ops-6-launch">What Time Does Black Ops 6 Launch?</h2>



<p>According to the official Call of Duty website, Black Ops 6 is set for regional rollouts, including 9 pm PDT / 12 pm EDT / 10 pm CST / 5 am BST.</p>



<p>You can check out the complete list of regions and times <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, provided by Activision: </p>



<p><strong><span>October 24</span></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Los Angeles:</strong> 9 pm PDT</li>



<li><strong>Mexico City:</strong> 10 pm CDT</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Seoul: </strong>1 pm KST</li>



<li><strong>Tokyo: </strong>1 pm JST</li>



<li><strong>Sydney:</strong> 3 pm AEDT</li>
</ul>



<p>Depending on your area, it will either be a late-night binge or an early-morning start. That’s 5 am for me, nothing the booming sound of a grenade can’t fix. With Black Ops 6 having no early access this time, all aspects of the FPS go live simultaneously: the Campaign, Zombies, and Multiplayer.</p>



<p><span>I’ll be awake and ready to deploy into&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuketown</a>&nbsp;and attempt to drop banger after banger.</span></p>

                <p>Since 2012, Sony has been in legal battle in the European Union with Datel, the parent company behind the Action Replay cheat software. Sony argued in the European court that Datel infringed upon its copyright, but now the battle is over and the court has come down in Datel's favor. </p><p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that Datel's cheating software didn't change the source code or the internal structure of Sony's games. Because Action Replay only temporarily changes the content for cheats, it doesn't violate the intellectual property of Sony that is protected under European law. It's a victory for Datel, but it may not open the floodgates for more cheating software.</p><p>"No doubt developers and publishers of cheat software will rejoice. [But] they should not be too enthusiastic about this judgement," said Dr. Andreas Lober--a partner in the international law firm ADVANT Beiten--during a discussion with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-court-of-justice-rules-against-sony-in-lawsuit-over-action-replay-cheats" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "For procedural reasons, the Court only ruled on one single ground: whether merely changing variables of a computer program qualified as an unauthorized modification. When publishers of multiplayer games act against providers of cheat software today, they typically rely on other legal instruments which are not affected by this decision, e.g. breach of EULAs and unfair competition."</p><p>Lober went on to explain that third-party software created for cheats or mods may still be considered acts of copyright infringement on other legal grounds. Any company that intends to make a business out of marketing that software will likely run into more lawsuits from Sony or another game publishers. And just because Sony lost this round, it still has plenty of legal options to explore against any would-be infringements from other companies. </p>
