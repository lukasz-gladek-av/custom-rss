			<p>A new MultiVersus trailer has dropped, showcasing the gameplay of DC's Nubia, Queen of the Amazons and protector of Themyscira. She is the latest playable character to join the extensive roster and will be available to play as of October 15, during Season 3: Sugar Spice &amp; Everything Nice. This will make her the 31st addition to the game, with there already being an extensive list of characters from The Iron Giant, Powerpuff Girls, Jason Voorhees, and Arya Stark, for example. There's something for everyone, depending on whether you prefer to be an assassin, bruiser, or mage.</p>
<p><iframe title="MultiVersus - Official Nubia &quot;Long Live the Queen&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYsJMRa5Tw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about Nubia, she is a close-combat fighter but leans heavily into her role as an Assassin, as she utilizes her Staff of Understanding, a long-range spear with a sprinkle of Godly power, to make her a powerhouse on the battlefield. To celebrate the release of Nubia, a new trailer has been dropped to showcase Nubia's capabilities, and it shows off her ability to create Shockwaves using her staff, as well as her ability to kick, slash, and strike.</p>
<p>To celebrate her release, there will also be a character variant called Future State Nubia, which will be available to purchase on October 15 along with her release. Nubia isn't the only thing arriving to MultiVersus, as there will be a new battle-torn "Destroyed" version of the City of Townsville map from The Powerpuff Girls series, which will equally be available as of October 15. For those wanting to obtain Nubia, she will be available on October 15 as a standalone purchase for 1,250 Gleamium, which is the in-game currency. Alternatively, you can use a character ticket for $9.99. If you want to obtain Nubia and some extra features to show off your prowess, you can buy the Future Queen: Nubia's Strength Pack for $29.99, which includes a character skin, announcer pack, taunt, and two badges.</p>
<p>As of October 18 starting at 5 PM PDT / 8 PM EDT, Nubia will be available for purchase with 6,000 Fighter Currency, a currency which can be earned in-game and can be used to obtain new fighters. To those who own the Founder's Pack, you will be required to use character tickets before you can obtain new characters with the fighter currency or Gleamium, so make sure to choose wisely when using your character tickets to ensure you get the ones that interest you the most.</p>
<p>MultiVersus is a <a href="https://multiversus.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free-to-play platform fighter</a> that is available to those on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It features full cross-play and cross-progression support, and there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-multiversus-leaks-skins-stages-renders/">characters constantly being added</a> to the game to keep the game fresh and exciting. Make sure to check out the trailer for Nubia's arrival to MultiVersus above.</p>

<p>How many raids do you have under your belt? You likely have thousands if you’re like a few of us here at Insider Gaming.

<p>Escape From Tarkov features 13 unique bosses, with Santa Claus counting as the fourteenth, but only during the holiday event. They’ll spawn across maps, usually appearing with heavily armed guards ready to mess you up if you come too close. Some prefer to travel alone, like Killa and Tagilla. Whether they bring hype men or not, a few well-placed grenades should remove your target and leave you with high-end loot!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A brand new event has started in GTA Online, where players will be able to fight off zombies in a new Left 4 Dead-style event. This leads players to the starting area of GTA 5, and players will now get to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3999181oaa34ko/fight-off-the-north-yankton-nightmare-in-the-new-ludendorff-cemetery-s#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in,new%20Ludendorff%20Cemetery%20Survival%20mode." target="_blank" rel="noopener">experience the Ludendorff Cemetary Survival Mode</a>, which was released on October 10. Since then, 400,000 people have eagerly logged into the game to play the new game mode, where players got to return to North Yankton. For many, this will be quite nostalgic, as this is where all the initial action of the story takes place, and players get to play as Trevor and Michael as they pull off a bank heist.</p>
<p><iframe title="New GTA Online Ludendorff Cemetery Survival" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDX66qVWCXs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For many years, GTA Online players weren't able to explore North Yankton without using glitches to get into the area, as it's technically disconnected from the rest of Los Santos. As a result, this is the first time ever in GTA Online's history that players are able to freely go to North Yankton without having to try and break their game to get there.</p>
<p>As a result of North Yankton now being available for players to explore, over 400,000 GTA Online players have been coming back to the game to jump into the new game mode within the first 24 hours. In the past couple of days, the number has since shot up to over one million. With these numbers being so high, it's now remarked that player numbers for this event are 270% higher compared to GTA Online's last massive-scale event, Assault on ATT-16.</p>
<p>It's possible that the reason this event is doing better is because it's a wave-based zombie survival mode, which is often a popular genre, especially in games like Call of Duty and even Rockstar's very own Red Dead Redemption, which was recently announced to be making its arrival onto PC, including the iconic Undead NIghtmare add-on. However, this event will at least allow players to team up with each other, as the upcoming PC release of the game won't include any multiplayer elements.</p>
<p>Considering that GTA 5 is now over ten years old, the game continues to remain a mainstay across all platforms, and it's possible that it will gain more hype and attraction in the upcoming months before the release of GTA 6, which still remains a large mystery, as there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-map-two-times-bigger-gta-v/">barely any details</a> out about the upcoming game. While it's said that there may be a release period at the end of 2025, it's possible that it may be even later than that, depending on setbacks and the development budget.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/neva-review-poetic-platforming-perfection</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neva-review-%E2%80%93-poetic-platforming-perfection.1009416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/neva-review-poetic-platforming-perfection<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Neva</em> is an emotionally impactful piece of interactive poetry. Nomada Studios has refined their game design craft, delivering a brief, but deeply moving experience. A stellar blend of measured game design and phenomenal art direction makes it one of the best games of the year.</p>
<h2><em>Neva</em> Review – A Girl and Her Pup</h2>
<p>You play as Alba, a young woman in an enchanted forest. When the forest is overrun by a wave of corruption, its protective guardian, a giant wolf, dies protecting Alba and its pup. Alba adopts the pup, names her Neva, and embarks on a journey to make the world right again. All the while, Alba watches her new friend grow and mature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-spring-time-forest.jpg?itok=lulu-xZu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-spring-time-forest.jpg?itok=YuNyUSbs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every level looks like this. Hats off to the art direction.</figcaption></figure><p>The first early moments of the game do a fantastic job of setting up the tone and core themes. At its heart, it is an inversion of Nomada Studio's first title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gris-review-brilliantly-beautiful-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Gris</em></a>. Where that game was a melancholic meditation on loss, death, and depression, <em>Neva</em> is a celebration of life, parenthood, and the joys of nature.</p>
<p>It is a celebration that bursts off the screen through stunningly beautiful art direction. Fantastically stylized tableaus of warm colors and striking vistas. Coupled with some fluid and responsive animations, it comes together to create an experience somewhere between a game and a watercolor painting in motion.</p>
<p>Contrasting this vibrancy are the more subdued moody color palettes when you wade through corrupted areas. Mountains and forests break away into surreal, abstract vignettes. Nightmarish fields of desolation were torn apart by grasping clawing hands. Once peaceful animals twisted into pained monstrosities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-alba-in-combat.jpg?itok=M80u1NcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-alba-in-combat.jpg?itok=skzNSDbC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bob, weave, keep moving.</figcaption></figure><p>Through visuals alone, <em>Neva</em> expresses a strong environmentalist narrative, one that can be interpreted both as a call to action against climate change and a meditation on the circle of life through the changing seasons. It is arguably the most overt theme in the game since its chapters are broken up by seasons. Starting in Spring and Summer with bright colors and friendly faces before turning into something akin to a horror experience in Fall and Winter.</p>
<p>What anchors this entire story is the central relationship between the two leads. Alba's furry companion starts as this small pup, wandering around, playing with and investigating everything around her. It is only with Alba's guidance that the pup follows and grows. Yes, there is a dedicated button to calling and petting the dog.</p>
<p>In a way, <em>Neva</em> shares similarities with Team Ico's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-guardian" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. Both games are about the growing relationship of a human and a supernatural dog creature. But Nomada Studios handily avoids frustrating situations by keeping the gameplay focused on Alba with her furry friend serving as a guide and aid. It's an elegant solution for interactive storytelling since it allows key moments in the story to land with precision and intention.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-broken-altar-with-monster.jpg?itok=WU07bUSv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-broken-altar-with-monster.jpg?itok=TQwp5hmf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh great, a smaller arena. Reflexes don't fail me now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Neva</em> Review – Oh The Places You'll Go</h2>
<p><em>Neva</em> continues the proud tradition of the arthouse platformer. You will be spending most of your time moving from location to location, navigating through moderate platforming challenges.</p>
<p>Notably, Nomada Studios has greatly improved the game feel in this title. Alba doesn't just look effortlessly gracious as she twirls through the air, her jumps feel responsive and bouncy. Sword slashes are quick, and pack the right amount of punch. Getting into a chase sequence is packed with balletic tension.</p>
<p>Which is a good thing since <em>Neva</em> is expertly paced. Each level introduces a new twist on the gameplay, explores it, and then wraps it up in a nice bow before the idea overstays its welcome. It helps give each story chapter its own identity and each environment personality. The result is a platforming experience with an effortless sense of flow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-falling-birds.jpg?itok=y2YIYBTV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-falling-birds.jpg?itok=m-Sd7Zul 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just when I think the gameplay is getting stale, these vignettes happen.</figcaption></figure><p>Complementing this platforming is some basic but serviceable hack-and-slash combat. Alba has a simple three-hit combo and a dodge roll. Eventually, she can command Neva to pounce and neutralize enemies, but that's about it.</p>
<p>Whenever enemy encounters happen, they never feel completely frivolous. This is thanks to inventive and creative arena design and a steady introduction of new enemy types. It nails the feeling of having each encounter being a puzzle of priority rather than an extensive chore.</p>
<p>It also helps the fights are designed to be quick and rewarding. Checkpoints are plentiful. Enemy attacks are telegraphed expertly with visually distinct wind-up animations. There's even a rallying mechanic where Alba can regain health by hitting enemies.</p>
<p>Yet, <em>Neva</em> doesn't completely alienate the less dextrous members of its audience. The game has two difficulty modes. Normal mode, the one I played, and story mode, which gives you unlimited health and lowers combat difficulty. It's a great compromise that will help this title age like wine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-nightmare-wolf.jpg?itok=4ho-gk90 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-nightmare-wolf.jpg?itok=0caJEZc5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's so expressive, yet Neva is still pops at the bottom, keeping the whole thing readable. Peak visual design.</figcaption></figure><p>What stuck in my mind after rolling credits on <em>Neva</em> is how it feels so precise in its gameplay and focused on its storytelling. There are plenty of games out there that focus on core gameplay, storytelling, or content by volume. But this game maintains a lean completion time of four hours packed with emotional richness and meticulous technical polish.</p>
<p>In the purest sense of the word, <em>Neva</em> is a game that must be experienced firsthand. It stands alongside the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/journey-five-years-on" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Journey</em></a> with its elegance, brevity, and emotional richness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neva-giant-monster-chase-sequence.jpg?itok=clAgsKFy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neva-giant-monster-chase-sequence.jpg?itok=QwHB0A3b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Run. Run. Keep Running!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Neva</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Nomada Studios has made something deeply moving with <em>Neva</em>. A short, but powerful experience about the persistence of nature, the joys and struggles of life, and a great visual tone poem of parenthood. It is one of the best games I've played this year and well worth your time.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Neva</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over 4 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review. </em></p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced the return of its Xbox Partner Preview digital showcase, which will feature "around 25 minutes" of games when it airs this Thursday, 17th October.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Microsoft's "no-fluff, all-games broadcast" kicks off at 6pm in the UK/10am PT and will feature "over a dozen" new trailers across its 25-minute-ish runtime.
</p>
<p>
There's talk of new game reveals, release date announcements, and new gameplay for upcoming games, with confirmed titles including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s The Lake House DLC, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, and dark-fantasy action game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.

<p>
Expect at least some chatter about Game Pass too, likely including a bit of fuss around the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone-coming-to-xbox-cloud-gaming">imminent arrival</a> of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and Call of Duty: Warzone for Game Pass Ultimate members - news that was shared earlier today as Microsoft celebrates a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">concluding its $69bn Activision Blizzard shopping spree</a>.
</p><p>
If that sounds like an enjoyable way to spend 25 minutes of your time this week, the Xbox Partner Preview can be viewed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox">Twitch</a> (4K/60fps footage will be YouTube-only), with British Sign Language, American Sign Language, and audio descriptions all supported - as detailed in Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/14/xbox-partner-preview-october-2024/">announcement post</a>.

            <p>
Bungie has unveiled Destiny: Rising, a free-to-play mobile version of its sci-fi shooter series developed in collaboration with Chinese publisher NetEase, that's set to receive a "limited access closed alpha test" on iOS and Android this November.
</p>
<p>
NetEase initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">announced a partnership</a> with Bungie back in 2018, and reports began circulating in 2022 that the two were, in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-netease-reportedly-developing-destiny-mobile-game">working to bring Destiny to mobile</a>. And the fruits of that labour have now been revealed as Destiny: Rising, a "brand-new adventure set in an alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era".
</p>

"With the help of legendary Iron Lords," Bungie teases, "humanity has broken free the shackles of tyranny and began to rally together against the alien forces intent on its extinction. Amidst the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious entities known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity's prominence and secure its future."

All that'll take the form of a "shared world" experience stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift." Single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes are included, with some set to be "familiar to Destiny players", while others are "all-new". NetEase has so far confirmed a mix of PvP and PvE, including campaigns and six-player cooperative strikes.
</p><p>
Destiny: Rising also promises a "diverse roster" of playable characters - including "familiar faces" from Destiny's past and a "host of new, intriguing characters" - all with unique abilities and stories. And if that appeals, the whole thing can be played in first-person or third-person using either a controller or touchscreen - this comes after Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-new-virtual-controller-patents-following-destiny-mobile-rumours">filed several patents linked to virtual controls</a> on touch-enabled devices back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Bungie hasn't yet shared a release date for Destiny: Rising, but a closed alpha test is scheduled to run on 1st November, with <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/">registrations now open</a> on the official website.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement follows a steady dripfeed of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> news - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-teases-destiny-2s-metroidvania-expansion-with-new-concept-art-talksnext-generation-armour">recent confirmation</a> that next year's Codename: Apollo expansion will feature a "Metroidvania-inspired destination" - as Bungie continues its efforts to build enthusiasm for the game's future amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">significant layoffs</a> at the studio.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-rising-is-a-free-to-play-mobile-spin-off-from-the-developer-of-diablo-immortal-bungie-providing-oversight-and-approvals<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-destiny-mobile-game">long-rumored Destiny mobile game</a> is finally a reality, with an announcement that brings a debut trailer and word of a closed-alpha test on November 1.</p><p>Destiny: Rising is a free-to-play mobile sci-fi RPG shooter set within the Destiny universe Bungie has spent the last decade building. But this new mobile Destiny game isn’t developed or even published by Bungie itself. It’s developed and published by NetEase Games, the Chinese megacorp behind the likes of Diablo Immortal, Once Human, and the upcoming Marvel Rivals, under an official license granted by Bungie.</p><p>In 2018, NetEase invested over $100 million into Bungie to build a new game. The investment gave NetEase a minority stake in Bungie and a seat on its board of directors, but all that changed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">when Sony bought Bungie for $3.7 billion back in 2022</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Destiny Rising (@_DestinyRising) <a href="https://twitter.com/_DestinyRising/status/1845865721659617767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Now, two years after the Sony buyout and six years after NetEase's investment, Destiny: Rising is a reality. And while NetEase is the developer and publisher of Destiny: Rising, Bungie is “providing oversight and approvals of the game's development.”</p><p>In terms of gameplay, Destiny: Rising has both first-person and third-person options, with the player able to switch between them at will. Destiny: Rising supports touchscreen controls and supports PlayStation and Xbox controllers, as well as mobile-specific controllers.</p><p>While Destiny: Rising is set within the Destiny universe, its events take place in an alternate Destiny timeline. It explores a story in the post-Dark Age era (the era that took place after the Collapse of Destiny’s Golden Age). Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>As a genesis of new possibilities in the Destiny Universe, Destiny: Rising delves into an unseen era where burgeoning hope blooms once again after a terrifying collapse of civilization and the dangers of the resulting Dark Age. With the help of legendary Iron Lords, humanity has broken free the shackles of tyranny and began to rally together against the alien forces intent on its extinction. Amidst the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious entities known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity’s prominence and secure its future.</blockquote><p>There’s single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, NetEase Games said, including “beloved” game modes familiar to Destiny players, and all-new modes. There are campaign missions and six-player co-op strikes that are “iconic” to the Destiny franchise. Perhaps we’ll get something along the lines of the Cerberus Vae III strike from Destiny 1, whether we wanted it or not.</p><p>As for characters, expect “familiar” faces from Destiny as well as brand new characters. There is clan support, “fun and casual” party modes, and customizable shared spaces.</p><p>Environments include the sanctuary of Haven (a refuge for the Lightbearers and survivors), the icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift. As you’d expect, Destiny: Rising as exotic weapons, the franchises’ signature guns.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/14/netease-1728923705691.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“For over a decade, we have built this universe to contain many unique and wonderful stories, and we are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe from the creative team at NetEase,” commented Terry Redfield, creative lead at Bungie.</p><p>The announcement of Destiny: Rising comes at a troubling time for Bungie and the Destiny franchise after mass layoffs hit the legendary studio earlier this year. In September, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-set-for-major-changes-as-bungie-battles-to-win-back-players"><u>Bungie unveiled what it called “major changes” to Destiny 2</u></a> designed to win back players. Bungie has reportedly struggled to meet key financial targets, with Destiny 2 significantly underperforming last year. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape"><u>The Final Shape</u></a> expansion, released in June, reportedly sold less at launch than 2023's critically panned Lightfall.'</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe.</p></div><p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7240718454641606656/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn post</u></a>, Don McGowan, the former general counsel at Bungie, reacted to the Destiny 2 changes to say he was pleased with parent company Sony’s apparent influence in the decision making, which, he said, meant the studio was finally “running the game like a business.”</p><p>Bungie reportedly has no plans for Destiny 3 and has canceled a Destiny spinoff project known as Payback. Development on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director"><u>its Marathon revival</u></a> is said to still be ongoing.</p><p>In December, IGN reported on an apparent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>scramble by Bungie studio leadership to avoid a total Sony takeover</u></a>. Then, in March, IGN reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director"><u>a leadership shakeup on Marathon</u></a> that included the removal of long-time Bungie designer Christopher Barrett from the game director role.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Cast your mind back ten years. Done? Good, you survived the hideous form of time travel known as long-term memory. Now, do you see a horrendous first-person shooter anywhere back there, full of memes and intentionally terrible font choices? Congratulations, you may have remembered 420BlazeIt, a freakish eyesore of a game developed during a 7-day game jam by one of the people behind Crossy Road, of all things. It briefly did the YouTuber rounds, back when YouTube was not yet the anxiety-inducing ad factory it is today. </p>
<p>Now I'm going to ask you to come back to the present. But prepare for a bit of a shock - there's a sequel coming to that bong huffing shooter. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/420blazeit-2">420BlazeIt 2</a> has been announced for some months, but now there's a demo you can play too.</p>

<p>It is the "long awaited sequel to the FPS hit", according to the game's irony-soaked <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2624280/420BLAZEIT_2_GAME_OF_THE_YEAR_Dank_Dreams_and_Goated_Memes_wow11_Like_and_Subscribe_Poggerz_Edition/">Steam page</a>. If I was to follow the stylization of the name with complete accuracy, I would have to call it by its full title: 420BLAZEIT 2: GAME OF THE YEAR -=Dank Dreams and Goated Memes=- [#wow/11 Like and Subscribe] Poggerz Edition. </p>
<p>"The illuminati have stolen all the world’s memes!" we're told. "You’re an ex secret-service agent turned to a peaceful life of painting, but now you’re needed one more time to fight back."</p>
<p>The first thing you do is kick a piano to pieces. There is a sign nearby that says "Live, Laugh, Illuminati". As you boot down doors and blast dudes in suits with shotgun shells and AK rounds, you will endure some pounding dubstep in your ears, and the appearance of much comic sans. An arguably sorrowful moment comes when you defeat the bargain bucket swamp ogre "Sherk" while in the clutches of an ocularly punishing multicolour trance. Sherk lays bleeding, pained, dying. The sadness of this moment is undercut somewhat by the continuous vuvuzela horns bellowing over the ogre's dying words.</p><p>So yes, an atrocity upon the optic and aural nerves. The thing is... it actually handles really good? The guns are slickly animated and have a nice sense of recoil, the forceful kick upon a door is suitably hefty, and enemy bodies react to a spray of buckshot in the right sort of way, whether that's by stumbling backwards in pain and firing in the wrong direction, or by ragdolling across the floor with fierce spasms of mortality. Make no mistake, this game is a hideous crime against the ears, eyes, and brain. But it is unusually smooth to the touch. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Perhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise. Andrew Sum, game designer and head of studio Normal Wholesome Games, has previously said he's a big fan of shooters. He also seems very aware that this is a far cry from the other game he is known for, the popular Frogger-like phone game Crossy Road. "If players are surprised, confused, or feeling strong emotions," says his studio website, "then the team can call that a success." </p>
<p>420BlazeIt 2 will also feature a meme slider, letting you presumably adjust just how dank your playthrough can get. The original game did something similar, featuring a "dubstep controller" that worked in the background to detect how many enemies were dying and placed the "drop" accordingly. If you like the sound of that, you can still <a href="https://jigxorandy.itch.io/game-of-the-year">play the original 420BlazeIt</a> today. </p>
<p>Or better yet, grab that demo of the sequel, which we have harvested along with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-october-2024">all the other demos from Steam Next Fest</a>. It's a bumper crop, my friends. A bumper crop.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The announcement of any classic game remake is bound to stir up mixed feelings within a fanbase, and in the case of Silent Hill 2, some were unsure whether Bloober Team had the resume to back them to update such a beloved title. I’ve always enjoyed their games, but their handling of sensitive subjects hasn’t always gone down well, and given the importance of abuse and psychological issues within the world of Silent Hill, this was my main concern for this remake. Thankfully, my worries were fully assuaged;&nbsp;moreover, Bloober has achieved the impossible and produced an update that almost entirely supersedes the classic original.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7f5qac5f3mE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This remake retells the story of&nbsp;James Sunderland as he returns to the mysterious town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his late wife. What follows is a feverish nightmare that blurs the lines between dreams and reality whilst also serving as a haunting metaphor for the longlasting effects of trauma and abuse. Unlike the deliciously pulpy storylines of Resident Evil, Silent Hill is renowned for being darker and more mature and this tone is definitely maintained by Bloober Team.</p>


<p>There’s a moment in the first cutscene where you see a closeup of James’ hand and it’s clear that his wedding ring has gone. While a relatively subtle point it serves as a perfect example of how the extra detail and graphical fidelity can actually serve to improve on a game that relied so much on atmosphere given the technical limitations of its time. This also serves as a metaphor for the game itself – while it is clearly a loving homage and recreation of the original it is also inevitably divorced from it and struggling to become its own thing. I found myself returning to that patch of lighter skin on James’ wedding finger and reflecting on the extra layer of haunting achieved here.</p>


<p>Built within Unreal Engine 5, Silent Hill 2 looks superb. The extra details in the environment, the more sophisticated fog effects (here for effect rather than to hide technical limitations), and the character models all work together to produce a game that emulates my memories of the original rather than the blockier reality. There has been some controversy over character redesigns online, but I’d argue this is unwarranted (if not just pure bad faith) as the various people you meet feel entirely in place here. The different areas you visit are also more distinct than they felt in the original and the use of lighting and shadow is incredible.</p>
<p>Even more impressive is the sound design here. There are updated versions of most of Akira Yamaoka’s iconic score and the discordant tracks still work perfectly to create and cement the uneasy atmosphere. Ambient sounds are incredibly immersive and make for a particularly intense experience when playing with good headphones – as all good horror games should be. The voice acting is also great here, with standout performances from Luke Roberts as James and Salome R. Gunnarsdottir as Mary/Maria. Supporting characters also retain their personalities which means Laura remains just as annoying as she always was, but Eddie is given an extra layer of pathos which I appreciated.</p>

<p>Revisiting the original game before the remake – specifically the Enhanced Edition update on PC – I was surprised by just how well it held up to my nostalgic memories but also by how short it was and how little challenge the combat held thanks, in part, to having an abundance of resources in my inventory.</p>
<p>Bloober Team’s creation is a very different beast.&nbsp;I died a fair amount in my playthrough, whilst also spending far more time managing a more limited amount of consumables and ammunition. Part of the latter stems from an more dynamic system whereby you loot drawers and cupboards for resources rather than there just being set drops. Ammo is far more scarce too, as the default clips of ten bullets are replaced by handfuls.</p>
<p>This limited ammunition is key to the updated combat as the enemies are far more aggressive than in the original. Whilst enemy variety is not increased, the AI of each type has been completely overhauled and many prove to be much more threatening. Perhaps the clearest example of this is the iconic mannequins who were almost passive in the original, but here will respond to your flashlight with unsettlingly jerky and deceptively fast attacks. You can turn off your light to avoid this, but navigating many areas proves impossible without illumination. The mannequins border on being overused, but&nbsp;later levels mix their behaviour up in an unexpected fashion and ensure that they remain a danger.</p>

<p>Melee is a viable approach for most of the enemies, and the updated combat mechanics make fighting far more involved than previously. James is no ninja, though, and so there is a real sense of weight and heft to things as you swing the iconic plank and pipe. Almost all of the weapons from the original return with only one notable exception – the surprise NG+ weapon is especially effective for replays.</p>
<p>In terms of narrative, this is very much the story of Silent Hill 2, but there are many twists and surprises along the way. Puzzles and environments have been revised and updated and the overall effect is wonderfully uncanny as the world feels the same but also different enough to remain unsettling. The sense of homage is maintained through Easter eggs that show memorable landmarks from the original and feed into the sense that you as the player are experiencing an uncanny version of the events just as much as James is.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Silent Hill 2 is a fantastic remake of a true classic, Bloober Team putting their own spin on the iconic horror game. That being said, enough of rough edges remain that could put some players off – ironically the same rough edges that make it so successful for me. These echoes of some of the less positive aspects of the original game, as well as some performance issues on console, are the only negatives in a game that more than does service to the legacy of Silent Hill.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NetEase has announced Destiny: Rising, a mobile RPG shooter based on Bungie's popular sci-fi franchise. The game will be set in an alternate timeline, and its narrative unfolds in the post-Dark Age era. The premise is that, with the help of the Iron Lords, humanity has thrown off the shackles of tyranny and begun to unite against the alien forces bent on its destruction. Amid the chaos of this early age for The City, a new generation of Lightbearers, resurrected by mysterious beings known as Ghosts, set out to restore humanity's greatness and secure its future.</p>
<p>Unlike the regular Destiny games, Destiny: Rising will offer players a choice between first-person and third-person view, supporting both touchscreen and gamepad controls for those seeking greater precision. In another twist from the previous games, the game includes various playable hero characters instead of allowing users to create their own Guardian. The press release says each character will have their own story, personality, and, of course, skillset. Games modes range from campaign missions to the franchise's iconic six-player cooperative Strikes, but there will also be brand new PvE and PvP modes. There will be a strong focus on cooperative play, allowing users to create clans and customized shared spaces.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/3-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Destiny: Rising will include in-game locations like the sanctuary of Haven, a refuge for Lightbearers and survivors, the icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift. As you'd expect from a Destiny game, players will find plenty of loot, chiefly the powerful Exotic weapons with many different Trait combinations.</p>
<p>Ethan Wang, Senior Vice President at NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>With Destiny: Rising, NetEase Games is honored to partner with Bungie to deliver a Destiny-caliber experience to mobile devices. Destiny is an incredible franchise with a passionate and dedicated global fanbase. As huge fans ourselves, we are humbled and thrilled for the opportunity to bring gamers an action-packed RPG shooter set within the Destiny Universe.</em></p>
<p>Terry Redfield, Creative Lead at Bungie, added:</p>
<p><em>For over a decade, we have built this universe to contain many unique and wonderful stories, and we are excited to see mobile gamers be able to experience this new take on the Destiny universe from the creative team at NetEase.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising Developer Preview | &quot;What is Destiny: Rising?&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQPomw5UBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the first outcome we've seen from NetEase's $100+ million investment in Bungie, which was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-gets-100-m-investment-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> around six years ago. Fans won't have to wait long to check it out, as a limited Closed Alpha test is scheduled for next month, and registrations are open now <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website.</a></p>

Hero characters include ones like Ikora Rey<strong> </strong>that exists in <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em>, as well as a host of new characters.</p><p>Each character will have unique abilities and stories, and will be able to access single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes. There will also be the usual Ghosts, Lightbearers, Iron Lords, and Warlords found in the <em>Destiny </em>universe before the Last City. In a trailer for the game we see a variety of characters and their new abilities, including a new void scythe that looks a lot like something a Warlock would use in the main <em>Destiny </em>games. There are also familiar enemies like the Hive, Fallen, and Vex.</p><p>“For over a decade, we&nbsp;have&nbsp;built this universe to contain&nbsp;many&nbsp;unique&nbsp;and wonderful&nbsp;stories,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;excited to&nbsp;see&nbsp;mobile gamers&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;experience this&nbsp;new&nbsp;take&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Destiny&nbsp;universe&nbsp;from the creative team at&nbsp;NetEase,” says Terry&nbsp;Redfield, creative&nbsp;lead at&nbsp;Bungie, in a press release.</p><p><em>Destiny: Rising</em> players will also be able to play in first-person or even third-person view, with touchscreen controls or controllers. There will be the usual campaign missions, six-player co-op strikes, and replayable PvE and PvP modes.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Mythic loot in Destiny: Rising.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: NetEase</cite></p></div><p>Even powerful exotic weapons will be available, alongside a new Mythic weapon rarity class that includes a new weapon type, too. All of these weapons help to fight against the darkness enemies in the <em>Destiny </em>universe in new locations like Jiangshi and the Red Sea&nbsp;Rift. Part of this new <em>Destiny </em>narrative includes searching for seeds of hope that are said to “shape the future of human civilization” after its collapse in the Dark Age of <em>Destiny </em>lore.</p><p>One big question around <em>Destiny: Rising</em> is what monetization system it will use. NetEase isn’t answering that just yet, but it <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20241011/41118_1186026.html">says in an FAQ</a> that a “good part of the main campaign will be available” in the alpha test next month alongside “at least one map for all game modes” so people can try out what the game has to offer.</p><p><em>Destiny: Rising </em>will be available first as a limited access closed alpha test on November 1st in the US and Canada. You can register for the test version at <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/">NetEase’s website</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you missed Kaan's (RPS in Gamesradar) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/before-we-leave-devs-next-chill-city-builder-is-set-on-top-of-a-giant-space-whale">announcement post from February 2023</a>, Beyond These Stars sees you raising a hex-based settlement on the back of an enormous interstellar animal. The creature is named Kewa, and its hide is rich in resources and buildable terrain.</p>
<p>Being a literally living, breathing world, however, it will be affected by your presence. In the course of the campaign, you must decide whether to form a symbiotic partnership with your host, or treat the beast as brusquely as I treat my own allotment grow bags, and plunge it into sickness and sorrow. Myself, I would probably avoid irritating <em>the planet-sized whale</em>, if only because any other star-faring species you encounter will take note of the state of your companion, and respond to you appropriately.</p><p>Beyond These Stars is, in general, very much an eco-fable that strives to avoid any suggestion of conquering territory and stripping it raw. This extends to the choice of resourcing and building options. You'll have to think about irrigation and topsoil quality while maintaining tree populations to cultivate a healthy atmosphere.</p>
<p>All this sits atop more generic building sim questions that perhaps encourage you to play more callously, such as structure adjacency bonuses and worker travel times. I always find it interesting to read about how games such as this try to resist the build-exploit-expand rhythms of their genre. As for the visual presentation in the trailer: the vital space whale component gets a bit lost behind the menus, but it all seems rather gorgeous, with water spilling through canals and clouds foaming up over forest canopies. </p>
<p>Anything you can't find on Kewa, you might be able to find by sending a rocket to establish an outpost on a nearby planet. This isn't space colonialism, the developers insist. The planets in question once "belonged" to the ancestors of your citizens, aka Peeps. As such "the Peeps are effectively reclaiming land that used to be theirs; we took care to ensure no implication that they would be displacing any other beings in the process."</p>
<p>The townsfolk are, moreover, "strictly vegetarian", so they won't be eating any of those adorable space chickens and space cows you see on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2295060/Beyond_These_Stars/">the Steam page</a>. Nor will they be mining the planets they land on, though this is more for the sake of keeping the focus on Kewa than avoiding any historical parallels. I think there's perhaps a touch of "having your 4X empire cake and eating it" here, but I respect the commitment to themes and playstyles beyond setting up oil rigs all over.</p><p>As for the release delay into 2025, "it's very important for us that we take the time to implement everything properly for our Early Access launch, and that we do so in a way that doesn't burn out our team," the developers write. "Because of this, our initially projected 2024 release date has had to shift."

This is rather starkly born out by the announcement video, which includes Bungie lead producer Tritia Medrano saying, “We here at Bungie are so excited that NetEase has invited us to join them as they announce their brand new mobile game...”</p><p>It was NetEase, of course, who also co-developed <em>Diablo Immortal </em>with Blizzard.</p><p>Bungie’s role appears to have been to “support” NetEase, which backs up rumors that suggested the developer had backed off the project a few years back. The hostage video-style appearances of Bungie employees seems like an effort to appease the inevitable backlash from fans.</p><p>Very similar in conceit to <em>Destiny 2</em> on consoles and PC, <em>Rising</em> will be a third-person looter shooter, with all the PvP, strikes and storyline you’d expect, although it’s to be set in a rather convenient “alternate <em>Destiny</em> timeline,” and before the events of the previous games.</p><p>The game’s setting puts it before the establishment of hunters, titans and warlocks, so the game’s Lightbearers will have a whole new set of class archetypes. It’ll also include recognisable modes—missions, strikes, and six-player PVE—but also add new modes of its own. We don’t yet know what they are, but boy will they be “immersive.”</p><p>Perhaps the most telling line of all, that speaks to the bizarre nature of a Bungie-owned franchise being made by a totally different developer, comes when NetEase’s senior narrative designer, Caroline Wan, explains the relationship. “We’re very grateful to Bungie for their amazing support,” she begins, making me wonder if there had been a depth of collaboration. She continues, “granting us the creative freedom to develop and nurture our own vision.” Oh.</p><p>And you can bet it’ll be absolutely riddled with microtransactions. Although obviously nothing about these has been mentioned.</p><p><em>Diablo Immortal </em>has courted no small amount of controversy with its incessant nags that you spend your way to glory. Which is all the more frustrating, given <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-review-mobile-rpg-ios-android-1849003750&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-immortal-blizzard-review-mobile-rpg-ios-android-1849003750">it’s a really good game underneath all that</a></span>, and remains one even if you never pay a penny.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24267805/neva-nomada-studio-interview-gris-devolver<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the launch of <em>Gris</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming">a beautiful game exploring grief</a>, the team at Nomada Studio in Barcelona needed a long break. They spent around half a year not even thinking about what was next, avoiding words like “Unity” or “sequel.” Eventually, director Conrad Roset, who became a parent during that time, came up with the idea of a similar experience that would introduce a new companion, allowing players to connect with and care for another character.</p><p>“I told him, no problem, as long as it’s not a four-legged animal, you can do whatever you want,” says lead producer Roger Mendoza, noting that animating critters with lots of legs can be “quite painful.” But the director was able to make the case for a game called <em>Neva</em> about a young woman who goes on an emotional journey with a magical fox creature. “I think it was worth it,” Mendoza admits.</p><p><em>Neva</em> launches on October 15th (it’s coming to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PS5), and like <em>Gris</em>, it’s a stunningly animated 2D adventure. Players take on the role of a young woman caring for a young fox pup named Neva, trying to usher it to safety in a world filled with dark forces that look ripped out of <em>Spirited Away</em>. It only takes around five hours to finish, but the game spans a long period of time; each chapter is a different season, and you see the fox grow over time. At first, it’s a relatively helpless pup, but by the end, it becomes your protector.</p><p><em>Neva</em> and <em>Gris</em> share a lot in common: the short length, approachable gameplay, incredible art and animation, and narrative that’s told almost entirely without words. (<em>Neva</em> does have some voice acting, but it’s multiple variations of the heroine calling out Neva’s name. “I think we recorded 500 different ways of saying Neva,” jokes Mendoza.) But the new game also introduces two major features: not only a second character but also combat.</p><div><p>“When she’s not with you, you really feel it.”</p></div><p>According to Mendoza, the latter was inspired by the former. “[The addition of Neva] was in a way where the combat came from — we thought it would be a good mechanic to bring together the fact that there’s a companion now,” he explains. Early on, you have to fight to protect the fox, but as she grows up and changes, so, too, does that dynamic. “Now she’s the one who is taking care of you,” Mendoza says. “When she’s not with you, you really feel it. Combat felt like a good way to tie everything together.”</p><p>This presented a number of design challenges, most notably in terms of accessibility. One of <em>Gris</em>’ biggest strengths was how easy it was to pick up and play; it even worked well on a smartphone touchscreen. But the added layer of complexity that comes from combat and a companion meant that <em>Neva</em> “isn’t as approachable as <em>Gris</em>,” according to Mendoza. “That’s something that we knew early on; the moment you add more controls, it becomes more difficult.” To account for this, the developers designed the game from the beginning with a story mode, where you can’t die in battle. “That was a way to try to find the right balance,” he says.</p><p>The success of <em>Gris</em> — the game <a href="https://x.com/nomadastudiobcn/status/1838963894712221984">sold more than 3 million copies to date</a> — gave the studio the confidence to both push in these more ambitious directions but also continue to pursue its strengths. One of the major learnings from that game, according to Mendoza, was that “you can do a strong narrative without the need for words. It’s something that we had no idea if it would work on <em>Gris</em>.” <em>Neva</em> takes things a step further, with a more direct storyline that covers a number of topics simultaneously — not only the evolving nature of a parental relationship but also overt themes about environmental destruction. Again, this story is conveyed almost entirely through art, sound, and animation.</p><p>The other major learning from <em>Gris</em> was more practical. One of the main reasons that game’s development was so stressful and required such a long post-launch vacation was that the team was relatively small. In fact, only two programmers worked on <em>Gris</em> at all, forcing lots of late nights and long hours. Now that many members of Nomada are a little older, with families of their own, work-life balance is a much bigger priority. And so one of the most important changes between <em>Gris</em> and <em>Neva</em> was a seemingly simple one: “we hired more programmers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
