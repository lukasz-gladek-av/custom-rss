And that’s before factoring in games with release dates that haven’t been announced yet and games we already know are coming but whose Game Pass deals are still secret. We have no idea if <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081?_gl=1*nrvzc*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY2NzAyNS4zMTkuMS4xNzM3NjY3NjA4LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081?_gl=1*nrvzc*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY2NzAyNS4zMTkuMS4xNzM3NjY3NjA4LjYwLjAuMA..">will finally hit sometime in 2025, for example</a></span>, but if it does, it’s already been promised as a day-one Game Pass release. </p><p>Last year, after Microsoft’s latest price hike and the move to drop day-one games from the base subscription tier, I wrote about how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059?_gl=1*1v2sqgy*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY1OTgwNi4yMS4xLjE3Mzc2NjY1NzMuMjcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059?_gl=1*1v2sqgy*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY1OTgwNi4yMS4xLjE3Mzc2NjY1NzMuMjcuMC4w">Game Pass was a deal that just keeps getting worse</a></span>. Maybe 2025 is the year Microsoft reverses that trend by delivering quality and consistency thanks to its massive new publishing apparatus, alongside the development timeline for games this generation finally bearing fruit. Who knows if that means Microsoft can keep this trend up, or if this will turn out to be a spectacular but isolated blip as the bill for an unsustainable economic model comes due?</p><p>In the meantime, at least, Game Pass Ultimate and PC subscribers are about to get swamped with  a bunch of (hopefully) cool new games.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fans wondered if they would be the natural fit to handle The Dark Ages’ score creation, but evidently, id has gone in a different direction with Finishing Move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom’s gunplay has always been inextricably linked to its metal soundtracks, with Bobby Prince’s original 1993 score one of the most iconic to have ever been created. Finishing Move will be eager to join the legendary ranks of both Prince’s and Gordon’s score when The Dark Ages releases later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom: The Dark Ages is a single-player only first-person shooter campaign that arrives on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC on May 15, 2025.

Rather it focuses on a group of complicated, messy people who all are brought together to defeat that which is a threat to all of them. There's a focus on the relationship between the characters, and while it can get introspective, there are also NPCs whose stories and mechanics are somewhat lighter. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As we've seen in past trailers, the UI and battle menus are exceptionally stylish, channeling Persona a bit in their big energy. The world itself is inspired by French art deco style, with art director Nicohlas Maxson-Francombe explaining in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent Xbox Wire post</a> that he wanted to avoid doing the same kinds of environments he's seen a million times before. "I just wanted to get out of the stuff that we’ve just seen a million times, – science fiction, to space, or zombies, all that kind of stuff. I just wanted to get my head out of there and see what I can try to come up with that was original for me personally."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also got a look at unique character mechanics and customization via skill tree  in the trailer, and what seems to be a massive colletion of possible equippable passive effects. There are far more details in the same<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox Wire post</a> about the combat system and some of the characters' specific moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also revealed that Clair Obscur will follow in the steps of old-school RPGs and have an actual, navigable world map from which you can access various areas and towns. The world map will also include secrets and even hidden bosses.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-from-sandfall-interactive-announced-for-2025">first announced last summer at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> from Montpellier-based Sandfall Interactive and came as a complete surprise to most. It takes place in a world where an entity known as the Paintress "repaints" the world each year, during which time she also paints a cursed number on a monolith that causes everyone of that age and older to turn to smoke instantly and disappear. Every year, that number ticks down by one, with younger and younger generations dying each time. With the number "33" up next, a group of individuals led by a man named Gustave sets out to try and stop the Paintress once and for all in a turn-based RPG with incredibly stylish battles and real-time elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown in today's Xbox Developer Direct <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced-so-far">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

But according to the devs, they wanted to make a bigger, better game, and cutting multiplayer let them do that. </p><p>“There’s only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning,” said Stratton. “We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we’ve ever made.”</p><p>Martin added: “We didn’t do multiplayer so that we could make a better single-player game. Like, we couldn’t have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we’ve really just focused on single player.”</p><p>Martin and Stratton were also asked if <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is an open-world game. Id Software says it’s the biggest game they have ever made and features the largest levels seen in a <em>Doom </em>game, but the devs were clear that this isn’t an open-world game like <em>Skyrim </em>or <em>Assasssin’s Creed. </em></p><p>“It’s definitely not an open-world game, but it is the most expansive world we’ve ever built,” explained Stratton. </p><p>“You really feel like you’re on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear <em>Doom</em> to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.”</p><h2 id="h28952"><a id=""></a><em>Dark Ages</em> isn’t inspired by <em>Quake </em>and it’s not the end of a trilogy</h2><p>Martin also said that a big thing they learned from <em>Eternal </em>was that too many currencies and skill trees can complicate a game in ways that aren’t fun. So instead, this time around exploring will make you stronger via <em>The Dark Ages</em>’ simplified progression system. </p><p>Martin also denied that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is inspired by <em>Quake</em>. Instead, <em>Batman</em> comics inspired the developers. “The inspiration was more something like <em>Batman: Year One</em> and <em>300</em>,” said Martin. </p><p>“I’m a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-3-eternal-sequel-dark-ages-year-zero-xbox-june-1851500253"><em>Doom: Year Zero</em></a></span> and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although <em>Dark Age</em>s is pretty cool, too.”</p><p>Finally, Martin was asked if <em>Dark Ages</em>, being the third game in a trilogy, is the end of this era of <em>Doom</em>. </p><p>“I don’t think I can answer that. We’re not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making <em>Doom </em>games. I wouldn’t have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn’t designed to be the end of something.”</p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on May 15 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, and Game Pass. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I wasn’t cool enough to play the original release of The Thing, but I am old enough to stay up late and play scary games in the dark now, which means The Thing Remastered, the restored cult classic, was on my to-play list immediately. On launch, it ran smoothly, with minor bugs and glitches to contend with, but that’s to be expected of a two-decade-old game, right? Well, Nightdive Studios continuously proves itself as a top-tier studio, and now they’ve pushed The Thing Remastered Patch 1.1 to resolve so many issues!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-thing-remastered-patch-1-1-notes">The Thing Remastered Patch 1.1 Notes</h2>



<p>As you can see from the massive list of patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">originally posted to Steam</a>, Nightdive broke the mold and decided to address everything from achievement woes to game crashes to Steam Deck performance. That last change is definitely welcome, as it’s where I tend to play the survival horror the most.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the entire list of patch notes:</p>



<p><strong>General</strong>:<br>– Fixed the Conspiracy Theorist achievement. Old saved games are retroactively fixed!<br>– Updated Colins Fate achievement description.<br>– Fixed a softlock where Stolls would stop running to the black tech lab door.<br>– Fixed a crash after detonating the C4 on the airstrip level.<br>– Fixed a rare intermittent crash when fighting Thing beasts.<br>– Added a “Most Recent” button to the load game menu, so it’s easier to load your latest save.<br>– Autosaves now contain the name of the level they were saved on, instead of just “Autosave”.<br>– Fixed a bug where characters would sometimes become unable to step up onto higher surfaces after falling off of the curbs in the roadway tunnel.<br>– Fixed a crash when quitting the game.<br>– Fixed a bug where bindings would be missing from the input options on first launch.<br>– Fixed a crash in Strata Medibay when Fisk dies before telling you the code.<br>– Fixed Blake’s hand clipping with his sleeve in the first cutscene with Faraday.<br>– Fixed a bug where the second camera angle would fail to activate during the weather station cutscene, allowing you to interrupt it and recruit yourself.<br>– Improved performance when querying dynamic game options.<br>– Moved the game version information to the options menu, off of the interstitial screen.<br>– Decreased the visibility of the game version information so it is less intrusive.<br>– Reimplemented the pan upwards when the game over screen is visible.<br>– Added support for autoexec.cfg, allowing users to customize console variables not usually marked as saved to kexEngine.cfg.</p>



<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>:<br>– Fixed an oversight where weapon firing rates were not properly respected when mashing the fire button. Excluding the pistol.<br>– Ammo and health dispensers now dispense fewer clips and medipacks depending on the difficulty. This can be changed at any time during game play.<br>– Marked some grenades as “volatile” so that they explode when damaged, like the original game, to fix a quirk where grenades placed for cinematic purposes would not explode.<br>– Changed the direction Blake faces after ending the cutscene in the weather station level.</p>

<p><strong>Levels</strong>:<br>– Fixed an oversight where an explosive barrel would explode when passing through the tripwire of an already exploded trip-mine charge in the penultimate level.<br>– Hid the out of bounds “Back Door Key” item that looked like a document in the submersible level.<br>– Fixed inaccurate collision in the first level, where characters would appear to sink into the snow.<br>– Fixed collision in the watchtower on the third level where you could get stuck in the handrail.<br>– Renamed Carter in the Strata Medibay level to Hawk, to utilize a set of unused voice lines.<br>– Added the missing green light to a save terminal in the third level.<br>– Fixed two computers in the weather station level that did not have an ID set for the Conspiracy Theorist achievement (given automatically to old saves).<br>– Shimmied a medipack dispenser down in the level following Strata Medibay that was WAY too high up.<br>– Fixed bad collision on the external stairs in the weather station.<br>– Flipped a few ammo boxes which were facing the wrong direction.<br>– Fixed several collision bugs in the Norwegian outpost where you could fall off of the world and walk underneath the building.<br>– Fixed sounds across several levels that would duplicate forever, causing the game to eventually fall silent.</p>



<p><strong>Display</strong>:<br>– Fixed the depth of field effect sometimes creating bright flickering pixels.<br>– Fixed the glass on the doors in the submersible being opaque.<br>– Improved normal maps on many posters and boards.<br>– Gave Whitley new trousers.<br>– Changed the on-screen watermark in the editor build, so it doesn’t confuse people.<br>– Performance improvements when using the D3D11 renderer.</p>



<p><strong>Sound</strong>:<br>– Fixed a bug where speech audio would sometimes not follow the speaker.</p>



<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong>:<br>– Fixed the framerate being locked to half the screen refresh rate while using the Vulkan renderer, when launched outside of the Steam client.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>In place of <em>Doom Eternal</em>'s "jump and shoot" gameplay loop, <em>The Dark Ages</em> focuses on more of a "stand and fight" mentality, the developers said. If <em>Doom Eternal</em> was like flying a fighter jet, then <em>The Dark Ages</em> is more like controlling a tank, they added by way of analogy.</p>

<p>That means a "flatter" game space, where the old-fashioned "strafe-to-aim" strategies work more effectively than in recent <em>Doom</em> games, with less need to be constantly floating through the air. The developers say they're returning to the slower projectile speeds of the original <em>Doom</em> games, too, allowing players to more easily weave between them in a sort of first-person take on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up">shmup pattern</a>. At the same time, your own projectile weapons tend toward the medium to short range, the developers said, encouraging you to take the fight close to the enemies.</p>
<p>While staggering enemies to set up instant Glory Kills is still a core part of <em>The Dark Ages</em>, the developers said the system has been redesigned to avoid taking control away from the player for extended, repetitive canned animations. The new Glory Kill system allows for instant, physics-based attacks that can be activated from any angle without interrupting the gameplay flow.</p>
<h2>The more things change</h2>
<p><em>The Dark Ages</em> developers also promised a more open design, where the usual more linear corridors are interspersed with larger playspaces that let you decide which direction to go and which objective to pursue in what order. And the standard shooting action will be broken up into specific sections where you control a 30-story mech or fly a powerful dragon.</p>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>But the core game will still include the requisite raft of secret areas and hidden nooks to discover, the developers promised. This time around, though, those secrets are more directly tied to your power progression rather than just being collectible in-game trinkets, the developers said.</p>
<p>It's all in service of pushing toward a game that feels "new but familiar," Martin said. <em>The Dark Ages</em> is still about the same sense of exploration and power that all good Doom games capture. But Martin said the development team is comfortable experimenting with what that specific sense of power is, "especially if the change you make brings it closer to classic <em>Doom</em>."</p>
<p>But "I want to play a Doom game," he added. "We don't [want to] change so much that it's not a Doom game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages<em> is scheduled to hit Windows, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</em></p>

<p>"The Japanese architecture, the roofs [are] super complex," said Benoit. "Probably the most complex thing that I ever worked with if we compared to Odyssey and Syndicate. We needed specific codes and specific animations to support something super fluid, changing the transition of the parkour to make it even more fluid. So that's one of the specific feedback that we heard that we wanted to address, and it really improved since the last few months."</p><p>GameSpot's Jordan Ramée recently had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">an extended hands-on preview with Shadows</a>, and he noted that he was "regularly blown away by just how pretty this game is and the team's commitment to creating as accurate a historical fantasy as possible.... I only got to explore a snippet of Shadows' 1579 feudal Japan, but I could not stop staring at what I was able to see, even when I should have probably been paying attention to the approaching guards." Ramée added that he is "inclined to go into the full experience with hopeful expectations," despite not fully experiencing the other aspects of the game during his time with Shadows.</p><p>As part of the recent preview, Ubisoft shared more details about Shadows' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-specs-highlighted-features-and-more/1100-6528990/" data-ref-id="1100-6528990">new features on PC</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-animus-hub-wont-be-a-stand-alone-launcher-but-will-still-launch-games/1100-6528985/" data-ref-id="1100-6528985">the Animus Hub</a> that will debut with the game. Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on March 20. But if you need <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">a pre-order guide to the collector's editions</a>, then we've got you covered.</p>

It’s perfectly fine to play this game at your own, comfortable pace. If you want to add more looks to your repertoire, I do recommend finishing up quests.</p><p><strong>Completing quests will sometimes reward you with clothes or clothing sketches.</strong> The main storyline will give you Ability Outfit sketches and even full outfits for free. World Quests and Random Quests are meanwhile much shorter and might have rewards such as a sketch for a cute hat or an elegant necklace.</p><h2 id="h354"><a id="chests"></a>Find new clothes in glowing chests</h2><figure id="" data-id="09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-recommend-id="image://09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki stands in front of a glowing pink chest, with a mountain range in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nikki stands in front of a glowing pink chest, with a mountain range in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-recommend-id="image://09e2f5fca602a0316bbc604314e5b98b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki stands in front of a glowing pink chest, with a mountain range in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are plenty of clothes and sketches to earn as rewards or to buy with various kinds of currencies, but a lot can be found just by wandering the world. <strong>A good amount of clothing sketches can also be found in pink treasure chests in the open world.</strong></p><p>That said, clothes do not drop from the Brown or Blue chests. Furthermore, not all the Pink Chests will have them either. Some provide you with Diamonds and Bling, while others include a sketch as well. You should aim to open any chests you come across anyway since there isn’t a visual tell for which have sketches.</p><h2 id="h355"><a id="buy"></a>Buy new threads from merchants and shops</h2><figure id="" data-id="9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-recommend-id="image://9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marques Boutique shop screen, with the Golden Elegance top highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Marques Boutique shop screen, with the Golden Elegance top highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-recommend-id="image://9a55b48724d6ea4b89443b9d17a0f378" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Marques Boutique shop screen, with the Golden Elegance top highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Miraland is a world where clothing and fashion hold a lot of importance. Naturally, that also means they’re a hot commodity for merchants too. <strong>It’s worth checking out every shop and NPC merchant as many will be selling unique clothes.</strong> <br></p><p>This ranges from the shops open all the time to the ones that only appear during a specific time of day. From what I can tell, all clothing is limited stock and sold out once you’ve purchased them. This is a stark contrast to shops with crafting materials that will eventually restock over time.</p><h2 id="h356"><a id="nodes"></a>Upgrade nodes in the Heart of Infinity</h2><figure id="" data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-recommend-id="image://b8898176932162365c6233ab1fc14b9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Fully Charged Electrician Outfit sketch, as seen on the Heart of Infinity menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Heart of Infinity fulfills the role of the game’s skill tree. You can spend Whimstars and Bling here to unlock ability enhancements and stat increases for Styling Challenges. <strong>More importantly, the Heart of Infinity also has exclusive sketches for Ability Outfits and individual clothing pieces to unlock.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, you won’t be able to miss ability outfits since they’re all made available during the main story quests. The other individual pieces are typically set in between the ability enhancement and stat increase upgrades, so I suggest checking back now and then to see how much more can be unlocked.</p><h2 id="h357"><a id="surprise"></a>Pull at the Surprise-O-Matic (if you dare)</h2><figure id="" data-id="8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-recommend-id="image://8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-recommend-id="image://8af59d422d20a2008ac07713523ad538" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surprise-O-Matic drawing screen, showing the limited deal that’s offered for the first pull." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After completing the prologue quest, you’ll travel to the town of Florawish. This is the primary setting for the first two chapters. You’ll have plenty of time to explore, but something sure to catch your eye is the Gumball-machine-looking device called the Surprise-O-Matic.</p><p><strong>Acting like its own gacha banner with an exclusive item pool, the Surprise-O-Matic will drop a random piece of clothing every time you use it.</strong> The catch is that it costs 20,000 Bling to make a single pull. Additionally, there is no pity system to help you attain the rarer pieces. You could easily spend millions of Bling here before you get a 5-star piece. So spend wisely.</p><h2 id="h358"><a id="gacha"></a>Pull the gacha banners</h2><figure id="" data-id="e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-recommend-id="image://e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-recommend-id="image://e074b61b2108fcc8f81e1d5d0ab07afb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Bubbling Affections resonance banner shows a fancy outfit and a couple of fishes with giant lips." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of gacha, that’s arguably the most prolific method of getting more clothing. <strong><em>Infinity Nikki</em> runs a series of permanent and limited-time gacha banners that you can pull to get exclusive clothes from.</strong> Anything you get from the latter will feel the most special since you presumably won’t be able to get them again unless the banner returns.</p><p>The permanent and limited-time banners use specific currencies: Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals. They do have a pity system to guarantee you receive a certain rarity after a while, but it still operates mostly on chance. If you see a particular item you just have to get, I recommend grinding out for the appropriate crystals.</p><h2 id="h359"><a id="store"></a>Use Stellarites at the in-game store</h2><figure id="" data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-recommend-id="image://f85112a5d3eac198d289b40f88ba52e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Moonlight Oath outfit, as seen in the Clothing tab in the Store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll be able to exchange for <em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s various currencies through the in-game shop. This includes Diamonds, the aforementioned gacha-related crystals, and the premium currency known as Stellarite. <strong>This Store offers many things to buy with Stellarite, including exclusive outfits that can’t be unlocked elsewhere.</strong></p><p>Many of these outfits are offered on a limited-time basis. They also cost between 60 and 2980 Stellarite, which roughly translates to $1-$45. Make sure to have a calculator out to help with the awkward bundle amounts and first-time double bonuses.</p><hr><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> has a ton of clothing items to discover and craft. We’re sure to get even more outfits and maybe even more ways to unlock them once some big updates have rolled out. Needless to say, you’ll always have plenty of choices to make the right fit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The system RAM is quite beefy, asking 32GB for recommended and ultra settings, while you can get away with just 16GB for the minimum. Id Software is pushing visual fidelity with ray-traced lights an shadows, as well as increased gore and destruction. All three sets of recommends specs call for the game to run at 60fps, so it's possible you might be able to get away with lower-end hardware if you can tolerate a lower frame rate.</p><h2>Doom: The Dark Ages PC specs</h2><h3>Minimum (1080p/60 FPS/Low Video Settings)</h3><ul><li>OS: Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</li><li>CPU: AMD Zen 2 or Intel 10th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X or better, Intel Core i7 10700K or better)</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 8GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 2060 Super or better, AMD RX 6600 or better)</li><li>System RAM: 16GB</li><li>Storage Capacity: 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</li></ul><h3>Recommended (1440p/60 FPS/High Video Settings)</h3><ul><li>OS: Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</li><li>CPU: AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or better, Intel Core i7 12700K or better)</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 10GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 3080 or better, AMD RX 6800 or better)</li><li>System RAM: 32GB</li><li>Storage Capacity: 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</li></ul><h3>Ultra 4K (2160p/60 FPS/Ultra Video Settings)</h3><ul><li>OS: Win10 64Bit / Win 11 64Bit</li><li>CPU: AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Generation @3.2Ghz with 8 cores / 16 threads or better (examples: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or better, Intel Core i7 12700K or better)</li><li>GPU: NVIDIA or AMD hardware ray tracing-capable GPU with 16GB dedicated VRAM or better (examples: NVIDIA RTX 4080 or better, AMD RX 7900XT or better)</li><li>System RAM: 32GB</li><li>Storage Capacity: 512GB or higher NVME SSD (100GB Available)</li></ul><p>At the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/" data-ref-id="2900-6159">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, it was revealed that Doom: The Dark Ages launches on May 15 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though Nintendo can technically claim it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the first big gaming news event of the year</a>, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24338314/microsoft-xbox-event-developer-direct-date-2025">Xbox’s Developer Direct</a> actually showed off some games <em>and</em> let us know when we can play them. The showcase was anchored by deep dives into the biggest games coming down the green pipe like <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight</em>, with a couple of surprises to fill out the nearly one-hour-long runtime. Here are the highlights from the show.</p><p><h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3></p><p>Xbox kicked off the Direct with the surprise reveal of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a>. The game is being codeveloped by Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>studio PlatinumGames. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>revives the series’ bloody, fast-paced combat and high-stakes (but often frustrating) platforming with a new face, the ninja Yakumo. Yakumo will use his unique fighting styles to defeat the Divine Dragon Order that’s turned Tokyo into a dystopian, crumbling mess. <em>Gaiden</em>’s former protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, will also make an appearance as a playable character and Yakumo’s rival.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> will launch in the fall of this year, but if you don’t want to wait for your bloody ninja action, you don’t have to. Xbox stealth dropped <a href="https://youtu.be/MFjWCZIVZDw?si=Dw16HKjd1MRHKDhp"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em></a>, a remake of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>, and it’s available right now on Xbox and Game Pass.</p><p><h3><em>South of Midnight</em></h3></p><p>The developers at Compulsion Games went into detail about <em>South of Midnight</em>’s gameplay and story. You play as Hazel who must use her powers as a Weaver, fighting monsters and traversing the haunted landscape, to rescue her mother who gets swept away in a hurricane. With this, everything I’ve seen about <em>South of Midnight</em> makes it seem like it’ll be one of my games of the year. It’s got a Black protagonist, features characters and tropes that harken to Southern gothic folklore, and its stop-motion art style makes it immediately stand out. I cannot wait to get my hands on this game when it releases on April 8th.</p><p><h3><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h3></p><p>Sandfall Interactive was founded in Montpellier, France, in 2020 with a team led by former Ubisoft developers. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is the studio’s first game — a turn-based RPG with a compelling narrative hook. The world has been ravaged by a being known as the Paintress. Every year, she writes down a number, and everyone older than that number disappears. Expeditions are sent out to stop the Paintress, and the game will follow Expedition 33 in their attempt to save humanity. In addition to an interesting <em>Persona 5</em>-style take on turn-based combat, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271773/dream-rpg-voice-cast-rotation"><em>Expedition 33</em> features some serious voice acting talent</a>, starring Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, Ben Starr, and Andy Serkis. Can’t wait to hear them perform when <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> launches on April 24th.</p><p><h3><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h3></p><p>To close out the Direct, Xbox gave us another look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages,</em> the prequel to id Software’s 2016 <em>Doom</em> reboot and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>. It will, of course, feature all the ripping and tearing a <em>Doom </em>enjoyer could want, along with an interesting focus on narrative — something the series isn’t really known for. But I suspect folks are far more interested in piloting a 30-story Doomguy-shaped mech suit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">when the game releases on May 15th</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
