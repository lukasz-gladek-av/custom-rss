			<p>Avowed is the latest game by Obsidian Entertainment, the masterminds behind Pentiment, Grounded, and Fallout: New Vegas. It is a brand-new action role-playing game set in the same world as Pillars of Eternity, where players explore the familiar world of Eora. While still in development, Game Director Carrie Patel took part in an interview at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPvOB0cDZI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamescom 2024 with IGN</a> where she spoke about Avowed's endings. So far, the Avowed possible endings have reached the double digits, giving the game plenty of replayability, especially for the completionists.</p>
<p>Being published by Xbox Game Studios, Avowed is set to be released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/">February 18, 2025</a>. Originally, it was set to be released this year but has since experienced delays, pushing the game back to the first quarter of next year. Avowed was first announced in 2020 during an Xbox Series X showcase, where excited fans were introduced to this new role-playing game. Since then, Avowed has evolved significantly and is shaping to look better than it was previously.</p>
<p>In the interview, Carrie Patel discussed the number of endings that players can expect to see in the game, with some of them being ending slides rather than full endings. "I can tell you our ending slides number in the double digits; you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them."</p>
<p>How many "full" endings there are for Avowed remains unseen, and how many make up the ending slides. For those unaware, ending slides are contextual slides at the end of the game that tell you what happened to the player and any crucial characters you may have encountered. Plenty of RPGs have this, as well as games that have multiple endings that can be obtained.</p>
<p>"Your ending really is the sum total of your choices in this game," Patel added. Avowed is set to release on Xbox and PC, with no word of whether this game will be introduced to PlayStation 5 later. Players have the choice to play the game either in first-person or third-person, depending on their preference. At the moment, details regarding Avowed are pretty scarce, but there are multiple trailers for curious people to look at, which can give them a glimpse into the upcoming fantasy RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULsF7B6bFuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you want more context for the upcoming fantasy RPG, jumping into Pillars of Eternity is an option that may help you piece together contextual clues for Avowed when the game is eventually released in February.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3-roadmap-promises-new-heist-ui-revamp-and-more.960960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze has finally revealed the&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>roadmap, detailing what's coming to the multiplayer heist shooter in the next couple of months. As the studio itself says, better late than never, right?</p>
<p>You can see the full roadmap over on Starbreeze's <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/payday3/medicbag/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>. It's all part of the studio's Medic Bag initiative, which is an attempt to turn around the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance">struggling fortunes</a> of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/payday-3">flagship multiplayer title</a> (which is currently performing significantly worse than&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam player count stakes</a>).</p>
<p>This month, Starbreeze has delivered a new paid DLC pack in the form of Chapter 3: Houston Breakout, as well as a new heist, new animations, and more. There's more to come in the pipeline over September and October, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-september-october.jpg?itok=LnhGCpSc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-september-october.jpg?itok=2B4v4Dxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>roadmap has plenty of goodies in store.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, in September, the new "Fear and Greed" paid DLC will be released, and it'll bring a new heist, new weapons, and a Tailor Pack for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new masks and a new Overkill weapon as part of that month's free goodies, so you'll get those whether you pay for Fear and Greed or not.</p>
<p>October, meanwhile, it bringing a new Year I Edition DLC. It's not entirely clear what this DLC will contain, but it rather sounds like it'll package in all of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s paid DLC so far, plus maybe a few extras for the die-hard faithful.</p>
<p>Free updates coming in October include a UI revamp, a server browser feature, and a VOIP function, as well as new Twitch drops. This is not, perhaps, the comprehensive roadmap that a game which arguably resulted in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">ousting of its developer's CEO</a> needs, but hey, it's something.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-lasers.jpg?itok=LeUAJSKw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/payday-3-roadmap-lasers.jpg?itok=P0IaHGDZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might not quite be over for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Presumably, Starbreeze is planning more new features for <i>Payday 3</i>'s future, so this very much won't be all you've got to look forward to. Hopefully, the dev can squeeze in those responsibilities between idea sessions for its new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026"><em>Dungeons and Dragons&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007263" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/payday-3/9NPZVDCH73SX/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>It is perhaps deeply ungrateful of me that, when presented with the squirrel with a gun of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With A Gun</a>, my immediate reaction is to thrust out my bowl like a ballsy victorian urchin and ask for <em>additional squirrel information</em>. It’s not that developer Dee Dee Creations haven’t shown off the game in action. It’s just that I find myself rooting so hard for this not to just be a vapid bit of meme-ware that I’m getting more concerned as we rapidly approach its 29th August release.</p>
<p>And look, sure. If I made a game called Squirrel With A Gun, and someone asked me what the game was, y’know, about, then I’d probably just do the equivalent of what these trailers are doing. That is, I’d continuously shout “squirrel with a gun!” until they either left in a huff or started shouting it with me. Maybe we’d start jumping up and down on the spot at some point. Maybe there’d be party poppers.
</p>
<p>And yet, I find myself in the position of - if not a party pooper - at least the equivalent of a commenter on a nice squirrel documentary, writing out a list of horrible diseases you can catch from their bites (salmonelosis, typhus, ringworm). Here’s the launch trailer.</p>

<p>It’s not absent of tangible information, and neither is the game’s<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2067050/Squirrel_with_a_Gun/"> Steam page</a>. We know it’ll be a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> of some sort, possibly in the 3D Mario vein - your goal is collecting golden acorns. We know you’ll use the recoil from weapons to pull off tricky navigation challenges. And we know that the title is a slight misnomer, because the squirrel can actually have several guns. One of them is a six-shooter, and it also comes with a little cowboy hat for the squirrel to wear. You'll collect such apparel by doing side quests for strangers. Also, pets.</p>
<p>In truth, I’ve wishlisted games on less information than this. It’s just that, quite unfairly, Squirrel With A Gun’s memey cuteness means I’m expecting it to work twice as hard to fully sell itself to me. Isn’t this the opposite of how appearing cute to humans is supposed to work in nature? I don’t have time to check how tight the evolutionary science is on that, but I also don’t remember harbouring a deep mistrust for any adorable mammals recently. I’ve had my cat less than a week, mind.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Is this a hollow meme wearing the skin of a devious tree rat, with nothing much going for it beyond a viral-worthy concept? Or will it have some substance to it? “The squirrel that you kill in jest, dies in earnest,” wrote Thoreau. Might we expect the same earnestness from the squirrel that does the killing? One in the chamber isn't enough, squirrel. I need to know your heart's in it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The roughly 9-inch-tall figure comes with two sets of arms, one that has her wielding the dual pistols she was known for in the early <em>Tomb Raider </em>games and another that has the climbing ax she uses in the reboot trilogy. Right now the <em>Tomb Raider </em>series is trying to build a bridge between the origin story of the reboot games and the seasoned version of Lara we meet in the first games, with Netflix’s <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft </em>set to finally fill in the gap between the two. So the statue paying homage to both continuities as part of Lara’s story is a nice detail that captures where the series is at right now.</p><p>The statue itself looks pretty good, especially for the relatively cheap price of $89.99.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, the Xbox console-exclusive RPG from Obsidian, will have numerous different endings that will "number in the double digits," according to game director Carrie Patel.</p><p dir="ltr">Patel sat down with <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/avoweds-possible-endings-reach-into-double-digits-gamescom-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> for an interview as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gamescom-awards-2024-categories-and-nominees/2900-5710/" data-ref-id="2900-5710">Gamescom</a>, during which she was asked how many endings players can expect from the first-person fantasy RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">"That is very hard to say, but I can tell you our ending slides number in the double digits," Patel said. "And you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them. This is an Obsidian game, so your ending is really the sum total of your choices across the game, across a lot of pieces of content depending on what you encountered and what you did when you found it."</p><p dir="ltr">What Patel describes sounds similar to endings in other RPGs like Fallout (of which Obsidian has experience working on, having developed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>), where a slideshow of different consequences play out at the end of the game showing the results of a player's actions as they pertain to different factions, storylines, and characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Patel further elaborated more on the choices players will be making in Avowed.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are a lot of choices to be made about where your true loyalties lie, who your allegiance is with in the endgame," Patel said. "We're really excited for players to explore those possibilities and build their own story."</p><p dir="ltr">Obsidian is putting a big emphasis on Avowed's companion characters, having recently <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1823056988814635415" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed the voice cast</a> for the group of characters players will be teaming up with over the course of the fantasy adventure. One of them, Kai, is voiced by Brandon Keener, whom RPG fans will remember played Garrus Vakarian in BioWare's Mass Effect series.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed was originally slated for a 2024 release but was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-graciously-making-2024-a-little-less-crowded/1100-6525519/" data-ref-id="1100-6525519">delayed to February 15, 2025</a> to "give players' backlogs some breathing room," according to Xbox.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://nikopartners.com/journey-to-success-black-myth-wukong-breaks-records-on-day-one/">Niko Partners</a> analyst Daniel Ahmad, that's a new record to go alongside its newly-minted accolade of being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">the most popular single-player game by peak concurrent users (PCCU) in Steam history</a>.</p>

<p>Ahmad also points out that this success isn't just limited to digital, either.</p>
<p>"Physical editions of the game, including collector's and deluxe versions, sold out within seconds on JD.com, as more than 700,000 gamers signed up for a chance to purchase the limited set of 30,000 copies," he said.</p> <div>

<p>"The broader implications of this success cannot be overlooked," Admad added.</p>
<p>"It signals that Chinese studios are ready to compete directly with established Western and Japanese developers in the premium AAA space. Game Science’s transition from mobile game development to creating a world-class AAA title, backed by heavyweights like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Hero Games, is a path that many Chinese game developers are already trying to follow with growing success."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/08/21/wukong-game-debut-drives-playstation-5-to-top-of-alibaba-tmall/">Bloomberg</a> reports that Black Myth: Wukong has also sparked a demand for PS5 consoles in China, with sales of Sony's system twice that of the same period last year.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now Steam's second-biggest game of all time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">clocking up a staggering peak of 2.3m concurrent players</a>, having pushed both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> down a place. Only PUBG: Battlegrounds boasts a higher concurrent peak of 3.2m, and that's a multiplayer battle royale.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong secured three out of five stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer's Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," Katharine wrote at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At Gamescom yesterday, developer Hollow Ponds announced a sequel, <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em>, which is much more chill while still capturing some of what made <em>Warehouse</em> fun.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060590/Wilmot_Works_It_Out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> </a>is pretty different from <em>Warehouse.</em> You play as overworked-but-still-smiling block Wilmot in their off time, where they enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles. You unpack and arrange the pieces, and once you’ve solved the puzzle, you can hang it on your wall. (Hanging finished puzzles is a thing jigsaw people do, which I can respect but will admit I do not understand.)</p><p>There's a Steam demo out now that's pretty straightforward, containing only a handful of puzzles, but some of <em>Warehouse</em>’s vibes come through. Deliveries contain pieces of other puzzles, so there’s some of the categorizing and cognitive load of <em>Warehouse</em>, as you put pieces aside for later or try to get a sense of a full puzzle within all the extra bits. As more puzzles arrive, I can see it tapping into some of the stress and chaos I liked about the first game, but in a much more relaxed way. According to the Steam page, you’ll unlock new rooms in Wilmot’s house and ways to decorate them as you play.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wilmot Works It Out | Wishlist today on Steam!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YARyZ2peq3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><br>Hollow Ponds recently released <a href="https://aftermath.site/flock-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Flock</em></a>, another chill game about categories, and also announced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHa17b9fJAE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wilmot’s Warehouse</em> board game</a> that I am sorely tempted to buy despite the fact that organizing people for a game night and teaching them the rules are some of my least favorite activities. <em>Wilmot Works It Out</em> comes out in October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-brings-a-roguelike-twist-next-year.960900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thunderful has announced&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, a sequel-slash-followup to 2021's quirky but flawed action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random</em>.</p>
<p>The first game felt rather like what would happen if Tim Burton directed&nbsp;<em>A Plague Tale: Innocence</em>, but this time around, the action is shifting to an isometric perspective and moving in a more roguelike-y direction.</p>
<p>You are Queen Aleksandra, and you must explore four distinct realms packed with randomly-generated (see what they did there?) areas, challenges, and enemy placements in order to recover your powers and escape the nightmare realm in which you're trapped.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-scrapyard.jpg?itok=sd2ZN4Lz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-scrapyard.jpg?itok=NyJIdxNU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die&nbsp;</em>serves as a followup to the 2021 original.</figcaption></figure><p>As you play, you'll be able to unlock Relics to "uncover hundreds of combinations of instant effects, chaotic synergies, and powerful bonuses". It sounds rather like this system is replacing the deckbuilding element of the original game.</p>
<p>Just like many other roguelikes, death won't finish your playthrough in&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Die</em>. Instead, you'll be transported to a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades"><em>Hades</em></a>-style hub area called the Sanctuary, where you'll meet a "fully-voiced band of eclectic characters", unlock new weapons, and choose Blessings to accompany you into combat.</p>
<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random&nbsp;</em>game, you are, of course, also accompanied by a faithful die friend. Fortune can be thrown for a variety of effects, or you can simply watch as it totters along by your side. Aww, how cute!</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>, which will let you return to the Burtonesque world of the original, right here.</p>

<p><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die&nbsp;</em>is set to release across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2564520/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10011792/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die/9n72g399183f/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, as well as Nintendo Switch, at some point in 2025. Given that&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch">many of the games announced at Gamescom</a>&nbsp;aren't coming to Switch, it's nice to see this one's confirmed for Nintendo's console.</p>

A <em>vast</em> Space Marine towers over the crowds of journalists, next to an enormous flag-strewn faux-stone hut that houses half-hourly showings of Obsidian’s upcoming RPG <em>Avowed</em>. There’s the theater-sized temple that showed us Indy punching Nazis in the nose in <em>Indian Jones and the Great Circle</em>, and ghastly neon Xbox-themed counters. But amidst it all, I saw the strangest thing: a large area with just a few people sitting on what looked like enormous motorbikes, wearing VR helmets, all of them laughing or wide-eyed in terror.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196903" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="189" data-playlist="196903,193831,195410" data-current="196903"><div><p>Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22460.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This, it turned out, was Blizzard promoting <em>World of Warcraft</em>’s new expansion, <em>The War Within</em>, which releases on August 27. The game, surely to become commonly known as <em>WoWWW</em>, wasn’t being shown on monitors for people to experience a chunk of, but rather offered as a fleet of ride-on VR experiences. I was <em>sure</em> there wasn’t a VR version of <em>WoW</em>, so what on Earth was it? Obviously I went in. There wasn’t even a line.</p><p>It was bloody fantastic. Called Escape From Dalaran, it was also by far the most wildly exuberant spending of money to promote a game everyone already knows about I’ve experienced since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-press-events-sometimes-go-horribly-wrong-1847165294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-video-game-press-events-sometimes-go-horribly-wrong-1847165294">an ill-fated trip to Poland for <em>Call of Duty II</em></a></span>. I cannot fathom how much this must have cost, to offer something completely unrepresentative of the game to those able to attend a games conference in Cologne, Germany. But I digress. </p><p>To begin, I climbed onto the enormous contraption—one of perhaps twenty in the cordoned section of Hall 7—and wondered nervously about where I was supposed to put my hands. In front of me was an enormous wad of sleek cushioned padding, with metal bars low down either side. It felt silly to hold onto something so low, like I was getting ready to put my head down and plough through a wall. I put on the VR hat, and the extremely lovely and somewhat bemused employee snuck headphones on me without me even realizing. After a peculiarly long loading screen, I was sat on the back of one of <em>WoW</em>’s dragon-like mounts.</p><p>The next few minutes were non-stop exhilaration, as I swooped, climbed, weaved and plunged throughout an epic battle taking place in Azeroth, with buildings crashing down around me, until in desperation me and my companion jumped through a portal to find ourselves in <em>The War Within</em>’s Nerubian Empire. And it only became more frantic.</p><p>At this point, the denizens of the world were not at all pleased about our arrival, and a completely improbable number of enemies rose up to attack. We were doomed, and my steed was suddenly torn away from me, leaving me falling alone. But a very cross lady with floaty magic balls above her shoulders captured me in a bubble, and spoke extremely sternly about how disappointed she was. And then it came to an end.</p><p> On top of all this, it was filming me from the outside, and then created a mixed-media video of the event, so the world can enjoy my wobbly belly flapping through a t-shirt in the considerable breeze. </p><p>What this description doesn’t convey is just how violently I was thrown about by the whole thing, tipping so far to the side at one point that I was holding on with hands and thighs. And those plunges—dear God, I know it was 90 percent a trick of the mind, the slight tilt of the ride exaggerated by the all-senses-consuming nature of VR, but it was spectacular. And I say all this as a VR skeptic who rarely has any truck with the face-melting format.</p><p>But…what was it for? This thing didn’t just throw me around like a bucking bronco, but blew air in my face and all around me, perfectly timed with the swoops and glides to match the sensation of rushing forward, an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twisters-regal-4dx-theater-experience-tornado-1851598749&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twisters-regal-4dx-theater-experience-tornado-1851598749">experience that must have been like seeing <em>Twisters </em>in 4DX</a></span>. But this entire sequence was surely only built for this one experience,and <em>there isn’t even a Blizzcon this year</em>! It’s not like it was made for that, and we got a sneaky preview! Heck, the game’s out on August 27, less than a week from this all, making it redundant almost right away.</p><p>I had a whale of a time. I’m delighted someone decided to spend what <em>must</em> have been millions, just for me and the visitors to Gamescom to have such a silly, exorbitant, and utterly disconnected ride, just to remind us all that the most famous game in the world still exists. “That must have cost a fortune!” I said to the assistant as I got off. “Crazy!” he replied. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/PAYDAYGame/status/1826620510286860393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, an updated Payday 3 roadmap confirms all of the new paid and free content that fans can expect in August, September, and October 2024.</p>



<p>This September, fans will get a new Fear and Greed paid DLC, Heister Pack, and Overkill Weapon. There will also be new masks and Twitch Drops. </p>



<p>This will only be Part 1 of the first anniversary update for the game, which originally launched in September 2023.</p>



<p>October 2024 will continue with Part 2 of the Anniversary Update, adding a Year 1 Edition of the game. In addition to even more Twitch drops, the devs will also introduce improvements with the server browser, UI, and VOIP.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This month, fans can enjoy the Houston Breakout DLC, as well as some fresh challenges, a new secondary weapon, and more. The concrete plan of today’s roadmap update may help renew more interest in Payday 3.</p>



<p>Payday 3 had a rough launch last year, and in February 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starbreeze did admit</a> that “sales and player activity are currently at significantly lower levels than we would like.”</p>



<p>Just a month after that statement, Starbreeze <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired its CEO</a>, and promptly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-appoints-mats-juhl-as-new-interim-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed Mats Juhl</a> as its interim CEO. </p>



<p>In a new quarterly report released this week, Juhl also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-reveals-update-on-dungeons-dragons-game-plans-for-partnerships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered new details</a> on Starbreeze’s anticipated Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Currently titled Project Baxter, Juhl said it is “growing as planned,” and mentioned plans to establish new partnerships for the title.</p>

As a modest prison guard your job is simple—get to the last escape pod and get out alive.</p><p>But you aren’t the only survivor looking to escape. Your rivals—a deranged custodian, a violent gangster, a maniacal lunch lady, and more—can’t wait to step over your corpse and save themselves.</p><p>Only one of you can make it off the moon—make sure it’s you!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_907069"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight, Die, Adapt</strong> – Each death is a learning experience. Starting fresh each run, build up your loadout with powerful experiments, weapon schematics, and buffs to battle through Black Iron. When you die (and you will die), use your hard-earned loot to purchase new permanent weapons, suits, and skills. Get stronger, experiment with your strategy, and get out!</li><li><strong>Rout Your Rivals</strong> – You’re not the only person to survive the initial outbreak or willing to use a bit of violence to get to the last escape pod. Some prisoners and even your correctional services colleagues are just as eager to escape and will make escaping harder by attacking you remotely or challenging you to a one-on-one duel. Race them, attack them back remotely, and fight them to the death to make it out in one piece.</li><li><strong>Fight Your Last Corpse</strong> – When you die, you leave more than a coverall-clad carcass. Defeat the reanimated corpse of the last guard to succumb to the prison’s dangers to earn a powerful experiment. But beware, it’s not going to be an easy fight. The semi-alive guard has the same loadout they had when they met an untimely end and a few extra tricks up its sleeve to keep things spicy.</li><li><strong>“Game Over, Man”</strong> – You’ve made the perfect build, battled through bosses, ran through rivals, killed your corpse, found all the files, and now you’re standing in front of that last escape pod. Sure, you could leave it all behind for the sweet taste of freedom… or risk it all in one last hardcore do-or-die run back through the prison. Fail and you lose all your purchased gear, skills, suits, and weapons. But IF you succeed, you’ll unlock new powerful permanent gear.</li><li><strong>Future Punk</strong> – An irreverent attitude, unique presentation, vivid graphic novel style, and a 180 beats per minute original <a title="Genres > Arcade [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a>-punk soundtrack by Mutato Muzika enhance <em>[REDACTED]</em>‘s science-fiction setting and fast white-knuckle action.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the reveal trailer below.

Set in the same sci-fi horror universe as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a>, the game will see players return to Black Iron Prison and face off against mutant prisoners and other survivors looking to escape the facility.

<p>Nintendo confirms that in-game events and item distribution will "continue until the service ends", although the sale of in-game Leaf Tickets will "cease" shortly before servers shut down.</p>
<p>From 28th October, you won't be able to purchase a new Pocket Camp subscription, and any existing subs will not renew. Players are advised to use all their Leaf Tickets before the game closes.</p>
<p>Players who'd like to try the new premium game will be able to transfer over their save data (albeit not Leaf Tickets), and the new Animal Crossing game will not require a constant internet connection, nor "contain any in-app purchases".</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/">PC release date for Final Fantasy 16</a> looms ever closer. This is a momentous occasion for those who play on PC after the game was exclusively on PlayStation 5 for a year. Now, those on PC can see the glorious combat against the Eikons on PC come September, with both DLCs being available to purchase from the outset.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with GamesRadar+</a>, the Director behind Final Fantasy 16, Hiroshi Takai, discussed the decision to launch Final Fantasy 16 later on PC than straight out of the gate alongside the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Takai was asked whether fans of the long-term franchise will be able to see future Final Fantasy releases on PC on day one. He responded, "I think that's possible—probably even likely," adding, "That said, the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy, so this is just my personal opinion."</p>
<p>It's somewhat surprising to hear that the development team can choose to do a console-exclusive release and that the seniors don't choose to override their opinions. However, they likely have conversations at length where the seniors have some kind of influence throughout the conversations.</p>
<p>Despite Hiroshi Takai stating that those opinions are his own, they align with Square Enix's views, especially when looking at the information in their financial briefings. For example, in the financial briefing from the last fiscal year, Square Enix spoke of changing their modus operandi to a "shift from quantity to quality" as they "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy."</p>
<p>With the most recent releases, such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 REBIRTH, both being PlayStation 5 exclusives, it begs the question of whether future Final Fantasy 7 segments will be PlayStation 5 exclusives or whether the audience can expect to see them on PC as well. The latest game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake is yet to come to PC, and there is currently no information on whether the game will be coming to PC. However, since the others have since come to PC, it's a fair assumption that it will be in due time.</p>
<p>However, in previous history, ports of Square Enix's games to PC have been a bit bumpy. While Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was a huge success, that's not to say it was without issues. If the port of Final Fantasy 16 goes well, then it may seal the deal for Square Enix in terms of releasing future games on PC alongside PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november-sort-of.960849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>will shut down this November, but if you haven't had a chance to play it yet, it doesn't sound like you'll need to worry.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1826502311830860094" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nintendo says&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is shutting down on November 28th at 3pm UTC, which is around 11am Eastern (8am Pacific). Better make sure you've achieved all you want to achieve in the live-service version of the game before then.</p>
<p>The developer goes on to say that it will continue to hold <i>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</i>events and add items to the game up until service ends, so there's still a good reason to keep playing before shutdown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outfits.jpg?itok=s-9IAX49 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outfits.jpg?itok=IlgVrmiE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is set to shut down in November, but this isn't the end for the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike other mobile games which have been shut down recently, however (we're looking at you,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release"><i>Echoes of Mana</i></a>), there's a silver lining to this&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>cloud.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/categories/35735633685657" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official FAQ released by Nintendo</a>, an offline version of&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, which will allow you to play with the same save data you've been using for the standard version, is in the works.</p>
<p>This version of the game <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36353725150489-What-is-the-paid-version-of-the-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">will be a paid product</a>, but it won't feature any microtransactions or extra fees. It doesn't look like you'll get it for free if you've been playing&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, though, so you'll probably still have to fork out for it whether you're a long-time player or not.</p>
<p>Nintendo says details, like pricing and release date, will be revealed in October, so keep your eyes peeled for that. You'll be able to see the info via "service notifications".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outdoors.jpg?itok=Ov9BSAtg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outdoors.jpg?itok=K9UgZyAT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll still be able to play&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>offline, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're still a Pocket Camp Club member, you'll <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36088890803225-What-about-Pocket-Camp-Club-subscriptions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have until October 28th</a> to cancel your membership, because that's when subscriptions will no longer be available. Memberships also won't automatically renew after that date.</p>
<p>As for Leaf Tickets, if you've still got some left over, you'll still be able to redeem them until the end of service, but you won't be able to buy any more <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36088777921945-What-happens-to-my-Leaf-Tickets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">starting from November 26th</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to see Nintendo actually making positive moves towards game preservation; it would have been easy to just kill&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>and let it lie&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragalia-lost-shutdown-coming-this-november"><em>Dragalia Lost</em>-style</a>, but it seems that's not the plan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225634/apple-epic-games-store-ios-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The dream of a successful Epic Games Store on iOS sounds like an oasis: a thriving alternative app store that exists outside Apple’s walled gardens, where developers won’t have to pay Apple’s much steeper commission for in-app purchases, and where they can use whatever payment processor they want.</p><p>Epic’s store launched last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">in the European Union</a> —&nbsp;thanks to new regulations opening up iOS — and it’s likely to be a boon for Epic and its perennial hit, <em>Fortnite</em>. But it’s not clear whether Epic will be able to grow the store far beyond its own games<em>.</em> The company wants to welcome in a vibrant ecosystem of third-party developers, but moving to the Epic Games Store could be an impossible ask for any company that doesn’t make <em>Fortnite</em>-sized piles of cash.</p><p>“It just seems like a lose-lose-lose for Apple, developers, and consumers,” says Bob Roberts, the developer of <em>Roundguard</em> at the indie game studio Wonderbelly Games. “It just makes life more complex and confusing without really improving the situation the way folks imagined it would.”</p><p>Epic’s game store may offer better terms for developers,&nbsp;but every developer, Epic included, is still subject to fees from Apple, even outside the confines of the App Store. And Apple’s terms and fees for apps on alternative marketplaces are so onerous that Epic has a big hill to climb to convince developers that it’s worth the time and money to list their apps at all.</p><p>To sell a game outside Apple’s App Store, developers must effectively pay a 50 euro cent per user per year installation fee once they reach a certain number of downloads. If developers want to link users to purchases outside the app, they’ll also need to fork out a 10 percent commission on all sales made “on any platform” — including outside of iOS. That’s on top of a 5 percent commission on purchases made within one year of the app’s installation. Then, they’d have to pay any fees charged by the operator of the new marketplace. In Epic’s case, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution">that’s 12 percent</a> — a significant discount on its own, but a major addition once you factor in Apple’s costs.</p><p>By comparison, if developers stay exclusive to the App Store, they’d pay an up to 30 percent commission on all in-app purchases, as well as an up to 25 percent fee for purchases made through an external link. There’s no per-user, per-year installation fee, lowering the risk for free-to-play games.</p><div><p>It’s the non-Epic developers who might get screwed by the arrangement</p></div><p>For Epic, even if it is getting stung twice by paying install fees on both an Epic Games Store download and a <em>Fortnite</em> download, that’s theoretically just one euro per person per year. The company can probably take on that risk for the long haul opportunity, especially if regulators change things in such a way that takes the teeth off some of Apple’s rules.</p><p>It’s the non-Epic developers who might get screwed by the arrangement. For one thing, Apple’s per-user fee applies to users on both third-party marketplaces and its own App Store. Epic’s GM of the Epic Game Store, Steve Allison, gave an example in a briefing last week: Take a game that has a billion downloads. If that app gets any updates, even if someone has the app passively on their screen that they got from the App Store, a developer is paying 50 cents for all those each and every year. “It’s untenable,” Allison said.</p><p>Right now, Apple’s new terms only seem manageable for major companies like Epic and developers who don’t collect any revenue from their apps — there’s barely any in-between. Apple doesn’t subject the developers of free apps with no monetization <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147225/apple-ios-iphone-ipad-core-technology-fee-eu">to its per-user fee</a>. While Apple also provides a three-year grace period without fees to smaller developers, it’s only as long as they don’t exceed €10 million in annual revenue during that time period. Apple offers lower fees for developers in its Small Business Program as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the developer community is expected to pay the same fees as a giant like Epic Games. An app with more than 1 million downloads and $150,000 in annual revenue would give nearly half of that to Apple, according to the company’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu/">own calculator</a>. That would go on top of the 12 percent commission the Epic Games Store takes, too.</p><p>It’s an unfortunate outcome, as developers want to see more options for distributing their apps. “Over the years, the App Store has become overloaded with applications, many of which haven’t been updated in a long time,” says Raffaele D’Amato, the developer of <em>Arcadia - Watch Games</em>. D’Amato would’ve planned to publish his app on a third-party store if there was one specific to Apple Watch apps because of the chance for increased visibility. “Alternative stores could certainly offer greater visibility to apps that truly deserve it.”</p><p>And it doesn’t seem like some of the biggest third-party developers are publicly interested. In last week’s briefing, Allison said Epic is in active discussions with “just about every single one” of the top 250 mobile developers about putting their apps on the Epic Games Store for mobile but noted that “almost all of them” said they can’t make it work on iOS. EA (which makes <em>The Sims Mobile</em>), King (<em>Candy Crush</em>), Scopely (<em>Monopoly Go!</em>), Supercell (<em>Clash of Clans</em>), and TiMi (<em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>) didn’t respond to questions about whether they planned to put their apps in Epic’s store.</p><p>It might take a long while for the iOS Epic Games Store to be profitable for Epic, if it ever happens; the PC store, at least according to testimony from Allison last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949372/the-epic-games-store-still-isnt-profitable">isn’t even profitable yet</a>. But the company expects to start filling up the store later this year, even if it’s only in small numbers at first. Allison said last week that Epic plans to offer a “curated” selection of third-party games on its mobile store, which is also available worldwide on Android, in December. Epic is making a “very hopeful push” to bring those games to iOS, Allison said, even though it is “a very tough conversation.”</p><p>Right now, launching its own store on mobile is more about Epic taking some control over its own destiny and, ideally, sharing that control with other developers. But Apple still wants to keep a tight grip — whether a developer is on the App Store or not. If history is any indication, it probably won’t relinquish that control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act">until it’s forced to</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t<em> not</em> a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mars-attracts">Mars Attracts</a>, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.</p>

<p>You’ll notice the way the trailer skips between historical periods. You’ve got a cowboy despairing at a theme park ride. An ancient Roman chap despairing at a ride. An astronaut despairing at a ride. Lots of despair at rides, is the theme here. The reason for all this despondency is that you’ll actually be travelling through time, as the Martians, to nab humans from different periods. Then, you’ll pop them on display in “highly customizable habitats” that mimic their natural surroundings. Once their good and docile, you can get to probing, unlocking new ways to amuse your guests. Apparently, they might try and do a runner if you probe them to much. Speaking as a human, this checks out.</p>
<p>On the ride front, things look far more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/theme-park">Theme Park</a> than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a>, with single fixed amusements rather than customisable tracks. I suppose Theme Park did have customisable tracks too. My main memory of it is the boggy crappers, because apparently my brain thinks that books I read last year are less important to retain than a poo joke from a 30 year-old game. Cheers for that, skull meat! Your skull meat in Mars Attracts, then, will be mainly put to work sorting utility grids, keeping your guests happy, and staying on top of escaped humans and environmental hazards.</p>
<p>It’s from Irish studio Outlier, who previously done <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1269300/This_Means_Warp">This Means Warp </a>- a lively mix of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>. I’m always game for a good park sim, doubly so for a good probing, so I’m eager to see how this pans out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tokyo-xtreme-racer-announced-for-2025-with-teaser-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/Tokyo_Xtreme/status/1826515511041220674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, developer Genki Co., Ltd announced the surprise return of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, with a new title “coming soon” to PC via Steam in 2025. There is no concrete release date at this time.</p>



<p>Today’s post does reveal it will feature races “that unfold on the Tokyo Expressway, a return to the Tokyo Xtreme Racer roots.” The game is now in development, and takes place in future Tokyo. </p>



<p>The new Steam page says players will “drive real cars on meticulously recreated courses, compete against powerful rivals,<br>slip through other cars, and engage in spirit-wracking battles.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="【Tokyo Xtreme Racer】#0：Teaser PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEhzyVcUCCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The Steam page also says players “compete for the fastest speed in your customized cars on the highways that weave through the city, aiming to reach the top.”</p>



<p>The Tokyo Xtreme Racer IP dates back to the 90’s, and the 2025 release will mark a major series return after nearly two decades. Fans may recognize it for PlayStation 2 releases such as Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero and Tokyo Xtreme Racer DRIFT 2.</p>



<p>Although Shutokou Battle Xtreme did release in 2017, it launched on iOS devices and only in Japan.</p>



<p>The arcade racing genre continues to thrive with other upcoming titles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/iracing-announces-arcade-racing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like iRacing Arcade</a>, which iRacing announced just last month. The developer partnered with Original Fire Games on iRacing Arcade, also arriving in 2025.</p>

In “Parliament,” when selecting “March” to invade enemy cities, players will “Adjust” units participating in battle. Players will have decisions to make on leaders and their deputies along with other factors including: “Troop Type” such as infantry and heavy cavalry, “Siege Weapons” like rams and breaching towers, and “Ships” for crossing water. The battlefield includes various terrains such as plains, mountains, and rivers, so advantageously organizing units will be the key to winning strategy, as the selection of officers affects both the unit’s abilities as well as the possible tactics and the difficulty of coordination with other units. By considering the relationships among officers, players can form a more powerful army.</p><p>Additionally, players will find that “Conscript” impacts both domestic affairs and strategies. Throughout the game, soldiers will gradually increase each season based on the draft population, which is relative to the city’s population. If players wish to recruit soldier’s more quickly, they can select “Conscript” during parliament, but this will also lower the city’s public order. If the public order falls below a certain level, it may lead to unrest or rebellion, including penalties like being unable to “Conscript.” Besides the decision between military strength and city stability, this feature also adds depth in gameplay as player can apply new strategies like using schemes to lower the public order in an enemy city to block their conscription.  </p><p>In addition, players will be able to setup traps for incoming armies, utilize ambushes by placing armies out of the line of sight in areas such as forests or rocky terrains, and use defensive buildings such as “Watchtower,” “Gate,” and “Signal Tower,” each with unique effects on the defensive side of the battlefield. “Tactics” from <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII with Power Up Kit</em> will also be significantly upgraded as categories will increase from 15 to over 40, while the effects of tactics will be revamped and the overall balance adjusted.</p><p>Battles also feature elements such as “Stratagem,” which have a wide-ranging impact, and “Link Forged” where friendly officers lead their units cooperatively. By combining these with features like “Troop Types” and “Tactics,” players can fight enemy armies more effectively. Particularly, officers with unique battle traits, like Guan Yu, can create dramatic scenarios where they wipe out tens of thousands of enemy troops by skillfully coming these elements, even allowing for legendary comebacks akin to the “Battle of Chibi”!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

			<p>Paradox Interactive, the developer behind the highly anticipated Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2, has revealed that the RPG has been further delayed into the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>In an update video involving Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO for Paradox Interactive, and Alex Skidmore from The Chinese Room studio, it is revealed that the developers' upcoming RPG title has been delayed (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/532790/view/4248669523824762042?l=english">via Steam</a>) to refine the project further. It is said that The Chinese Room has more work pending, but the game is still in a good position and is in its development phase. Here is what the developers had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>We remain committed to delivering an exciting game to&nbsp;<em>Vampire</em> fans old and new. This commitment is reflected in the history of this development. The game is scheduled for release in the first half of 2025.&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness</em>&nbsp;and The Chinese Room will continue to engage with fans of&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, listening to feedback, sharing updates, and showcasing the game in various forms.</p>
<p>- Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO for Paradox Interactive</p></blockquote>
<p>The historical timeline of Bloodlines 2 isn't optimal, given that the project has been a victim of delays since it was announced in 2019. The title was initially handed over to Hardsuit Labs, with a 2020 release date, but later on, the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/">shifted to The Chinese Room</a>, which Fall 2024 declared as the anticipated release date. However, the new development shows that Bloodlines 2 has been further pushed ahead, which means the project has witnessed a delay of up to five years.</p>
<p>The delay, however, is optimistic, given that Alex Skidmore, Creative Director at The Chinese Room, says that the new date will allow developers to work on certain elements that they were enthusiastic about at the start but, with time complications, couldn't achieve them. One example he quoted was about the possibility of alternate endings. Apart from this, Alex says that the team will provide consistent updates, through means as disclosed below:</p>
<blockquote><p>The additional time also allows us to address feedback from our playtests in our user research lab and also to address the feedback we’ve been getting from all of you in response to our Dev Diaries and videos<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>- Alex Skidmore, Creative Director at The Chinese Room</p></blockquote>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will be released this Fall for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Those interested can view its <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sees-its-debut-gameplay-trailer/">gameplay trailer here</a>.</p>

As of October 28th, new monthly <a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/club">Pocket Camp Club subscriptions</a> will also no longer be accepted, and existing subscriptions to all three tiers will no longer automatically renew.</p><p>November won’t be the permanent end of the trail for <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>. Nintendo has assured players that their save data can be carried over to a new version of the game currently in development by linking their Nintendo accounts. The company doesn’t plan to reveal the new version until sometime in October but shared a few details today. The new <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> will be a “paid app without in-app purchases” and will not require a constant internet connection to be played.</p><p>The announcement is part of Nintendo’s slow shift away from mobile. After the success of the Nintendo DS and the Wii, with many gamers migrating to smartphones, Nintendo did the same. In 2015, it released its first mobile game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9633272/nintendo-smartphone-game-miitomo"><em>Miitomo</em></a>, which was followed by more ambitious apps like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview"><em>Super Mario Run</em></a> in 2016, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14300356/fire-emblem-heroes-nintendo-release-date-android"><em>Fire Emblem: Heroes</em></a> and <em>Pocket Camp</em> in 2017, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20992527/apple-iphone-ipad-top-games-2019-mario-kart-call-of-duty-fortnite"><em>Mario Kart Tour</em></a> in 2019.</p><p>The past five years haven’t seen much of anything from Nintendo for iOS or Android, but at least the company isn’t shutting down <em>Pocket Camp</em> entirely and leaving paying players with nothing, like it did when it shut down its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts">free-to-play mobile game <em>Dragalia Lost</em></a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for Ultimate Doom, there’s a unique quest featuring Gwen Stacy/Deadpool crossover character, Gwenpool—unique because it’s not marked on the map or in the main menu. The only way to activate it is by stumbling into it. Or, you know, reading this guide. Here we’ll detail everything you need to know about starting the secret Gwenpool story quest in <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5, Season 4.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h5624"><a id=""></a><strong>How To Start The Secret Story Gwenpool Quest</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="44eb1f38c166dc999ed96218eec3a477" data-recommend-id="image://44eb1f38c166dc999ed96218eec3a477" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The pink cell that marks the start of the Gwenpool quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The pink cell that marks the start of the Gwenpool quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="44eb1f38c166dc999ed96218eec3a477" data-recommend-id="image://44eb1f38c166dc999ed96218eec3a477" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The pink cell that marks the start of the Gwenpool quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Starting the quest is fairly straightforward, if you already know about it. It’s hidden on The Raft, one of the season’s newest POIs. Before entering the main prison, you may notice a prison cell by itself colored pink. Go to the door and press the listen button to start the quest. It’s also worth mentioning that if you die while trying to complete this quest, it’ll restart your progress on whichever step you’re currently on.<br></p><h2 id="h5625"><a id=""></a><strong>Recover an ID Chip</strong></h2><p>First, you must find an ID and return it to her. All you need to do is go to one of the guards at The Raft and kill them. As soon as they die, they’ll drop a chip, and once you have it, return it to Gwenpool. She’ll then instruct you to come back later, so to complete the next part, you’ll need to do it in another game.</p><h2 id="h5626"><a id=""></a><strong>Enter “CYNTHIA”</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5fb1908f46f5d659e2e4006d1485bcd9" data-recommend-id="image://5fb1908f46f5d659e2e4006d1485bcd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Entering CYNTHIA into the computer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Entering CYNTHIA into the computer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5fb1908f46f5d659e2e4006d1485bcd9" data-recommend-id="image://5fb1908f46f5d659e2e4006d1485bcd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Entering CYNTHIA into the computer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the next portion of the quest, you’ll need to return to Gwenpool’s cell again. She’ll instruct you to enter the password “CYNTHIA” into a computer on the north end of The Raft.<br></p><p>When you go to the computer, it’ll ask you to enter the correct password. To complete it, make sure you enter CYNTHIA, and after that, return to Gwenpool’s cell. You’ll complete this portion of the quest, before again needing to return during another game to finish the final part.</p><h2 id="h5627"><a id=""></a><strong>Steal Electronic Parts</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="7f14be6da769fcdeb5dfceb4f18bfa92" data-recommend-id="image://7f14be6da769fcdeb5dfceb4f18bfa92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Being told to steal electronic parts." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Being told to steal electronic parts." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7f14be6da769fcdeb5dfceb4f18bfa92" data-recommend-id="image://7f14be6da769fcdeb5dfceb4f18bfa92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Being told to steal electronic parts." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like the last two portions of this quest, you’ll need to visit Gwenpool’s cell once again to start it. When you are done talking, she’ll ask you to steal three electronic parts scattered around The Raft.<br></p><p>These will be marked on the map for you, so don’t worry about having to look everywhere.</p><p>Once you get all three, return them to her, and you’ll complete the final part of this story quest.</p><hr><p>Congratulations, you made it a little easier for Gwenpool to escape The Raft. I’m sure you’ll see her in person once we get further down the season.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
