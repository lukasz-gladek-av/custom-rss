                <p>In the realm of Warhammer 40k, players have faced formidable enemies for years. But Warhammer publisher Games Workshop has run into an unlikely foe that it has yet to defeat. According the company's latest financial disclosure, Games Workshop's plan for a new car park have apparently been derailed by a "cute looking" bat</p><p>As spotted by IGN, Games Workshop <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/ost7hseic9hc/6RTEwwgirDZoH36H2AfQ8f/41dd13da3aad11bb599a6c2ad9df8f2b/2024-25_Press_statement_29_Jul.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has shared its latest financial report</a> for investors, and notes that a "cute looking pipistrelle bat is delaying our work on our new temporary car park," before adding that the company is "carefully looking after the bat."</p><p>The report notes that Games Workshop amassed huge profits for its fiscal year ending in June 2025. However, President Trump's tariffs are a larger concern going forward for the company's lucrative physical goods business.</p><p>"We hope the uncertainty around tariffs is resolved soon," notes the company in the report. "We are also mindful of the increased risk of supply chain disruption as a direct consequence of conflicts around the world, which we highlight as a principal risk... This new problem will be dealt with in our normal pragmatic way. We will not change our operational plans too much... It's mostly out of our control."</p><p>Games Workshop also acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-games-workshop-finalize-deal-for-warhammer-40000-adaptations/1100-6520022/" data-ref-id="1100-6520022">a deal with Amazon for the Warhammer 40k adaptation rights</a> has been finalized, with some creative issues still to worked out for any film and television projects. However, they may be years away from arriving on Prime Video. Henry Cavill <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/henry-cavill-reportedly-attached-to-warhammer-40k-series-for-amazon/1100-6510114/" data-ref-id="1100-6510114">is slated to produce and potentially star in the Warhammer 40k TV show</a>.</p>

One of the bright spots for Microsoft was Xbox Game Pass, which had nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time.</p><p>The complete transcript of <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/Document/DownloadDocument/65/TranscriptQandAFY25q4.docx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's investor report</a> is online, but it doesn't break down the specifics of Game Pass' milestone in terms of subscribers or even the specific revenue amount that it reached. Last year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">announced price hikes for Game Pass</a> and introduced Xbox Game Pass Standard, which doesn't include day one access for the company's biggest games.

Other Microsoft titles including Doom: The Dark Ages, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Minecraft also appeared as best-sellers on PlayStation's Q2 chart.</p><p>Microsoft went on to state that Black Ops 6 has drawn 50 million players to date, and added that the Minecraft movie led to record active usage and revenue for the already wildly successful game.</p><p>The report doesn't really dwell on the recent layoffs or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">canceled gaming projects like Rare's Everwild</a>. But it does state that Microsoft still has "nearly 40 games in development."

            <p>Xbox Game Pass made Microsoft almost $5bn in annual revenue last year, proving the company is in a healthy state despite last month's shock layoffs.</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, CEO Satya Nadella stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time" and Microsoft has 500 million active users across multiple gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Indeed, Microsoft overall has seen an 18 percent increase in revenue (up to $76.4bn) and 23 percent increase in operating income (up to $34.3bn). As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">The Guardian</a> has reported, the company's stock rose by more than seven percent on Wednesday, as it remains the world's second-most valuable company.</p>
<p>Said Nadella: "Cloud and AI is the driving force of business transformation across every industry and sector.</p>
<p>"We're innovating across the tech stack to help customers adapt and grow in this new era, and this year, Azure surpassed $75bn in revenue, up 34 percent, driven by growth across all workloads."</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">a statement from Nadella last week</a>, where he claimed "Microsoft is thriving" and doubled down on the importance of AI.</p>
<p>"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI?" he said. "It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving - from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organisation to build whatever they need to achieve."</p>
<p>But this success comes at a human cost. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">Over 9000 employees were laid off from Microsoft earlier this month</a>, including across its gaming divisions. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG were all cancelled</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">roughly 200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and reportedly replaced by the AI tools they helped to build.</p>
<p>Microsoft told Eurogamer the layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>
<p>This Game Pass success is alongside Microsoft's success as a third-party publisher on PlayStation. As we reported earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter">the majority of PlayStation's top-selling games in the US over the last quarter were published from Microsoft</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I would be hard pressed to call Dear Me, I Was a game in any true sense of the word, because it really does not feel like a game. Describing it as a visual novel would do Dear Me, I Was a disservice to its artistic style too. The best way to describe Dear Me, I Was is a reflective piece about life from beginning to end.</p>
<p><iframe title="「Dear me, I was...」Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s43znSJMsAQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Dear Me, I Was follows the life story of an unnamed woman from her childhood to old age, with each significant moment getting its own chapter, of which there are ten in total, including the epilogue. The start of each chapter begins with a meal for breakfast, and one of the few interactive moments in the experience where you pick each item to eat. As the woman grows older her breakfast of choice changes from a glass of milk and some fruit as a kid to croissants and coffee. It’s a good way to introduce each chapter, as it signifies the change in life that the woman is going through.</p>


<p>Every scene is depicted as a watercolour, with moods shown through how bright or muted the watercolour is. The art style immediately stands out and Dear Me, I Was could be a contender for visual design of the year with the way the story is played out through Taisuke Kanazaki’s watercolours which are brought to life through rotoscoping.</p>


<p>Each scene is unique and brief, but carries enough meaning to provide the context of what you are seeing. These scenes are accompanied by plaintive piano pieces, with the music again matching and complementing the scenes, from positive songs to slower and more depressive tones when the story calls for it.</p>
<p>To discuss any element of the story would be a spoiler, but it shows the highs and lows that each of us will experience at some point in life, especially the relationships we have with others. In that way, Dear Me, I Was is relatable even if our life experiences are different to what the woman in this piece goes through.</p>
<p>Dear Me, I Was lasts approximately one hour and in that time you will only be required to put in minimal effort to interact. Already mentioned is picking at the food at the start of each chapter, but there are other moments where you ‘sketch’ scenes, though this is just holding the A button while moving the analogue stick to uncover pictures. There are a few other interactive moments, but it feels like they have been thrown in so you are given something to do instead of simply being a passive viewer.</p>

		Dear Me, I Was offers reflection on a life accompanied by eye-catching art and gentle piano music. There's very limited interactivity though, and while the story is relatable at some points, it's not particularly unique. It is worth picking up if you're looking for something that will make you sit back and reflect, but it feels as though Dear Me, I Was will only appeal to a very specific audience.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft first started using the “Xbox PC” term in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">blog post</a> announcing the <em>Gears of Wars</em> remaster in early May. It was a new branding effort designed to signal that games are available on PC through its own Xbox PC app and store. The Xbox PC branding didn’t last long though, as Microsoft has now started using “Xbox on PC” instead. Which one is it, Microsoft?</p><p>The Xbox PC branding has been picked up by third-party publishers, with Focus Entertainment using it for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCpWo0A0i0">gameplay trailer</a> in early June. Then on June 25th Microsoft introduced the Xbox on PC branding for its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/25/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-update/"><em>Hellblade II Enhanced</em> announcement</a>, but confusingly used both Xbox PC and Xbox on PC in the same blog post.</p><p>Xbox game studio World’s Edge used the Xbox PC branding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MkpGj44bFc">for its trailer</a> of an <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em> expansion in June, and then swapped to the Xbox on PC branding in a <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/pre-order-heavenly-spear-for-age-of-mythology-retold/">preorder blog post</a> yesterday. <em>Grounded 2</em> was also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HQNOtg1WI">announced</a> last month as an Xbox PC title, before an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcUeK3xv17k">early access trailer</a> debuted yesterday and also switched to the Xbox on PC branding.</p><p>I wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">last month in my <em>Notepad</em> newsletter</a> that calling the Xbox app on Windows simply Xbox PC was a clear bid to position it as a Steam competitor or alternative. The Xbox on PC branding isn’t too different, but it’s a subtle change that makes it sound more like you’re getting Xbox games on PC rather than needing some kind of Xbox PC hardware.</p><p>Both of these brands have challenges, though. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22827140/microsoft-pc-game-pass-naming-rebrand">rebranded</a> its Xbox Game Pass for PC subscription to just PC Game Pass four years ago because people were getting confused. There has always been an inherent conflict with Microsoft’s efforts to bridge PC and Xbox, because the experiences are often so different.</p><p>That’s something Microsoft is now trying to change, especially as it heads towards its next generation of Xbox consoles that look set to lean further towards Windows than ever before. Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">combining Windows and Xbox for handheld PCs</a> later this year, and we’ll hear more about that effort at Gamescom next month.</p><p>I think the Xbox PC branding is just a little too early, and that’s probably why it has changed to Xbox on PC in a matter of weeks. It’s a similar situation to how Microsoft used its “this is an Xbox” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing campaign</a> months before it started to make sense.</p><p>Microsoft is attempting to redefine the Xbox brand as a platform that spans across phones, laptops, TVs, handheld gaming PCs, and even VR headsets. There are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/693576/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-steam-notepad">plenty of challenges</a> to overcome to make that a reality, and let’s hope Microsoft avoids some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/11/6135053/windows-mobile-history-branding-names">Windows Mobile-esque branding changes</a> in the process.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/716564/microsoft-xbox-pc-xbox-on-pc-branding-changes]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has already revealed that today's stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, and that it will be specifically targeted at its third-party partners - don't expect anything first-party from Nintendo here (so that's no Fire Emblem, Mario, Pokemon, Smash Bros. and so on). </p>
<p>Maybe we will hear something about Level-5's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>, though - it's been a few years since we first saw that game, and I'm hoping it's nearly ready for another blowout, now.</p>
<p>Personally, given that we recently<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release"> saw (two!) 'final updates'</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, I'm praying for a shadow-drop of the highly-anticipated sequel - especially since we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">it's going to be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>The world and its partner is also holding its collective breath for more news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong, though given<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong"> the game's relationship with Microsoft</a>, I do wonder if all announcements are going to be tied into Xbox-related showcases for the near future.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the Direct yesterday, a lot of internet chatter has been kicked up, referring to the showcase as the 'game card Direct' - a cynical nod to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">the controversial rollout of Nintnedo's virtual game card system</a> that prevents games from being loaded onto (and played) on more than one Switch system at a time. It appears Nintendo has undermined a lot of the goodwill it generated since the launch of the Switch with this move, and I anticipate comments like this only getting louder and more dismissive in the official chat channels and social media during the presentation proper.
</p>
<p>As ever, we're planning on watching and bringing you all the news as it's revealed. Is there anything you're particularly excited for as part of today's Nintendo Direct?

<p>Button mashing is smashing, especially with friends</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've known for a while now, and as reported by our sister site Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/taitos-track-and-field-esque-arcade-game-field-day-is-heading-to-ps4-and-switch-this-month">a week back</a>, Taito's 1984 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arcade_archives_field_day">Field Day</a>, is on its way to Nintendo Switch consoles as part of the Arcade Archives series.</p>
<p>Now, Hamster has announced that the game will officially release on 31st July. Which is today. Holy timely news piece, Batman.</p>
<p>Field Day was amongst a whole crop of a very particular style of button-mashy sports game that popped up in the mid-'80s, mostly off the back of the enormous success of Konami's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_track_and_field">Track and Field</a>. This very writer whiled away copious hours playing most of them on his trusty Commodore 64, so can therefore confirm that the whole thing becomes very addictive if you let it get to you. These were as good as games looked back at the time, too, especially on home computers.</p>
<p>Of course, where Track and Field had regular sports games in a regular stadium sort of scenario, in this one you are taking part in a raft of challenges at a girl's school - stuff like tug-of-war, hence the name Field Day, which is like a Sports Day, right? Right?</p>
<p>Despite the somewhat antiquated look of this one, you must understand — and especially if you've never tried any of these sorts of games — that adding a second human player can lead to a category-10-level time sink. We're talking extinction-level event here. Well, not really. It does get bloody competitive, mind.</p>
<p>Also, some experts (or boffins, if you want) reckon this effort is actually more challenging than Track and Field, given its slightly odder collection of events. Here's some further details from Hamster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"FIELD DAY" is an action game released by TAITO in 1984.<br>
Players compete in a variety of seven non-conventional sporting events from three-legged race to tug-of-war in an effort to become the sports day champion.<br>
Each event features a qualifying score which must be met to progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Field Day releases today and costs £6.29/$7.99/€6.99</p>

        <p>Also found the Summer Game Fest trailers a bit boring</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Buried in the fuzz of an otherwise unstartling <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/culture/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-interview">SSENSE interview</a> with Hideo Kojima, a sudden spike of violence. "People who are making military games, they probably don't know how to dismantle a gun or shoot a gun," said the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> man, in amongst pictures of himself dressed as various Minecraft skinpacks. "So that's kind of sad." Does Kojima know how to dismantle a gun? "Yes, because I've been doing this training as well, and I learned so many ways to kill people as well."</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pretty big talk for a guy who likes to go out on rooftops and cosplay as a sail. I don't know how to shoot a gun myself, Kojima, unless you count the sniper rifle I fired at a Sniper Elite press event in 2012, but I know a bazillion other ways of ushering my enemies off to the pearly gates, and only half of them are from Hanna Barbera cartoons. Here's a quick rundown to show you I'm serious business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a nice warm bath for my adversary in a copper bath tub on a very high hill under a very tall tree sprinkled with iron filings during a thunderstorm</li>
<li>Get all up in my adversary's grill and invite them to "step outside", while standing in a space station</li>
<li>Hack my adversary's internet history and expose their deep and abiding love of all the things they say they hate on social media</li>
<li>Exchange my adversary's favourite earphones for some carefully painted Black Widow spiders</li>
<li>Build a mile-long chain of dominoes of relentlessly increasing size</li>
<li>Paint very small images of calm blue skies on the inside of my adversary's flying goggles</li>
<li>Place a tactical guillotine on the other side of a fence with a hole labelled "free hat"</li>
<li>Photoshop evidence of my adversary playing patticake patticake with the spouse of the local mafia boss</li>
<li>Challenge my adversary to a friendly unranked game of "who can drink the most nail polish", then sportingly let them go first</li>
<li>Shoot them with a gun. How hard can it be. You just have to remember which end is the bangy one and wait for the button prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't much else of note in the interview. The second spiciest moment is the revelation that Kojima found this year's Summer Game Fest trailer deluge dull, presumably not including the trailer for his own latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>. </p>
<p>"Even the visuals and the systems are pretty much the same," he said of the games on show, "and a lot of people enjoy this, I understand, but it is important to put something really new in there for the industry." I can't judge how "new" Death Stranding 2 is because Auntie Sony ain't put it on PCs yet, but I bet it doesn't let you kill people with dominoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hideo-kojima-has-learned-so-many-ways-to-kill-people]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're the sort of person who likes to take in plenty of trailers when you're hunting for new stuff to play on Steam, Valve have just put out an update that should make doing so a bit more pleasant. The pipe-themed platform operators have casually gone through hundreds of thousands of videos as part of an effort to make Steam's trailer player easier to use and less likely to run into hitches as it shows you the video games.</p>
<p>To put it how Valve do in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579723494031420">their news post</a> about the changes, they've improved the player's "interface and streaming to help you browse more quickly". So, much like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-redesigned-store-menu-is-out-in-beta-so-you-can-take-the-freshly-embiggened-search-bar-for-a-spin">Steam store revamp that's currently in beta</a>, Mr Newell and co want you to be able to zip around at the speed of sound.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Starting off with the new user interface, Valve say it'll be "more responsive" to whichever sort of clicking you're doing. For instance, it'll now automatically realise whether you're on desktop, mobile ("it even works well on iPhones now", Valve boast), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, or using big picture mode, then adjust accordingly. Jumping to different bits of a video will see you served a quick preview, while doing either that or hopping into full screen "should see fewer pauses and hitches".</p>
<p>Pretty obvious quality-of-life stuff there, but it's far better to have than not. To make the video streaming better, the Steamy folks say they've undergone what certainly sounds like a pretty beefy bout of scrawling through their trailer back catalogue.</p>
<p>"In order to update the streaming technology," they wrote, "we had to re-encode every trailer that appears or could appear on the Steam store. That ended up being around 400,000 video files." Oof. Holy admin, Batman. The result of that work is that these revisited trailers now have up to four quality options they'll automatically switch between based on how much net bandwidth you're packing at a given time, with the new player also adapting to different aspect ratios.</p>
<p>So, you're not guaranteed  1080p for every vid, but it seems you should at least get a version that's of decent quality and won't freak out if you do a single mouse click. Valve admit there are older trailers which are of very low resolution, but suggest they can do nothing about this because the original files are no longer lurking in Steam's system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the case with one of their own games in the original Portal. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/">I've checked</a> and your options for that trailer are limited to 360p and 394p. Don't worry, you can still pretty easily make out the diagrams of toilet sign-esque person outlines being pointed towards colour-rimmed holes that'll spit them out somewhere slightly different.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-upgrade-steams-trailer-player-and-all-it-took-was-trawling-through-something-like-400000-videos]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the NES being an incredibly popular system, Nintendo was the only company making steady profit, according to a CAPCOM veteran Yoshiki Okamoto.</p>



<p>As reported by Automaton, the Japanese developer, who produced some of CAPCOM's best classic games like Street Fighter II, recently discussed in a video shared on YouTube how a third-party developer like CAPCOM struggled to earn money releasing Famicom/NES games. While he admits there are probably some exceptions, Okamoto-san says in the video that Nintendo was the only company making steady profits back then, as everyone else involved in the production of games didn't make much money, retailers included. For example, out of a game costing 10,000 yen, 3,000 yen went to the retailer, 4,000 yen to the developer, and 3,000 yen to Nintendo, with 1,500 yen going to the manufacturing contractors. The issue was that Nintendo had to be paid upfront for the exact number of copies, so only Nintendo was getting a guaranteed profit. Companies new to the console market at the time, like CAPCOM, did not have a lot of cash on hand, and so these upfront costs were a burden, often requiring taking out bank loans. With the time it took to deliver cartridges and for CAPCOM to get paid from distributors, the publisher would have to deal with six months' worth of bank interest, which would further eat into any profit CAPCOM made, together with every other cost, including the risk of having unsold copies.</p>



<p>With the arrangement above continuing to be a thing for years, it's unsurprising to hear Okamoto-san describe the launch of the first PlayStation as a revolution for third-party developers. During the first PlayStation era, CAPCOM's profit increased significantly, thanks to lower production costs and a more developer-friendly returns policy, as the company would give back to the publisher its share for unsold copies, essentially charging only the manufacturing costs. Restocking was also much faster, which allowed CAPCOM to take advantage of sudden popularity spikes of their games.</p>

<p>While Nintendo's first-party line-up was often more than enough to make its systems popular, the loss of third-party support for the Nintendo 64 was a decisive blow that compromised the system's popularity in many regions. Things have changed a lot since the late 90s, however, and with third-party developers aiming to massively support the Nintendo Switch 2, it looks like the company has finally managed to mend those relationships ruined by its old strict policies</p>

            <p>The majority of PlayStation's top selling games this last quarter in the US came from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Data <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w">shared by Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a> revealed that between April and June of this year, six out of PlayStation's top 10 selling games in the US were Microsoft published titles, with the likes of The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and Minecraft all making the cut.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which was released on PlayStation 5 back in April, took the number two spot, coming only behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s co-op spinoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>. Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-forza-horizon-5-is-ps5s-highest-selling-game-of-the-year-so-far-says-analyst">Forza Horizon 5 was the highest-selling game on PS5 this year so far</a>, and had surpassed 3m copies sold.</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, only had two titles in PlayStation's top 10 US selling games last quarter - MLB: The Show 25 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>.</p>

<p>The top 10 selling Playstation games last quarter in the US were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign (Bandai Namco Entertainment)</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered (Microsoft)</li>
<li>MLB: The Show 25 (Sony)</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Doom: The Dark Ages (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (Sony)</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows (Ubisoft)</li>
</ol>
<p>Xbox's own top sellers differ slightly from PlayStation's. While once again Elden Ring Nightreign takes the top spot for Microsoft's own consoles, the likes of EA's Split Fiction also made it into the top 10. In fact, only four Microsoft published games made it into the Xbox top 10 last quarter.</p>
<p>To compare, the best 10 selling Xbox games for the last quarter in the US were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign (Bandai Namco Entertainment)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered (Microsoft)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls Online (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Minecraft (Microsoft)</li>
<li>NBA 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>WWE 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows (Ubisoft)</li>
<li>PGA Tour 2K25 (Take-Two Interactive)</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Microsoft)</li>
<li>Split Fiction (EA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Many big Microsoft titles are notably missing from Xbox's own list, including the likes of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, however it is worth noting that both this game and Doom: The Dark Ages are available via Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>In an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella noted that Microsoft is now the "top publisher" on both Xbox and PlayStation. The company executive also stated "Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5bn for the first time", adding that the company has 500 million monthly active users across various gaming platforms and devices.</p>
<p>Today's earnings come just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees were laid off from the company</a>, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace". While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions is unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMax MMORPG</a> were cancelled.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nadella released a statement to say "Microsoft is thriving", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">before the CEO doubled down on the importance of AI</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-games-made-up-most-of-playstations-top-sellers-in-the-us-last-quarter]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-revenue-grew-13-this-quarter-as-microsoft-ceo-boasts-game-pass-yearly-revenue-of-almost-5-billion.1257789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q4 fiscal year 2025 results</a> show that Xbox content and services revenue grew 13% this quarter (12% when considering constant currency). Hardware revenue continues to decline (-22%), but overall gaming revenue is still up 10%. According to Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, the result was driven by 'better-than-expected performance from first-party content and Xbox Game Pass.'</p>



<p>During the subsequent investor call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared some new milestones, such as the fact that the Game Pass subscription service has nearly reached $5 billion of yearly revenue for the first time since its launch in 2017. Nadella also referenced the fact that Microsoft was the top publisher not only on Xbox but <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on PlayStation</a> this quarter. Lastly, the chief executive officer noted that Xbox has nearly 40 games in development.</p>



<p><em>When it comes to gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices. And we are now the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation this quarter, with the successful launches of Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. The Call of Duty franchise has never been stronger: 50 million people have played Black Ops 6. Total hours surpassed 2 billion.</em></p>



<p><em>Minecraft saw record monthly active usage and revenue this quarter, thanks in large part to the success of the Minecraft movie. And we have nearly 40 games in development, so much, much more to come. We surpassed over 500 million hours of game play streamed via the cloud this year. And Game Pass annual revenue was nearly $5 billion for the first time.</em></p>



<p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted, however, that Xbox revenue will likely decline in the first quarter of the next fiscal year due to a tough comparison with the previous year: </p>



<p><em>In Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high single digits. Against a strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid single digits.</em></p>



<p>Xbox Game Studios is about to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-enhanced-launches-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-pc-on-august-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced</a> on PlayStation 5, no doubt hoping to repeat the excellent results of ports like Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The remaining release schedule for the publisher's calendar year includes Gears of War: Reloaded on August 26, Double Fine's new game Keeper on October 17, Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden 4 on October 21, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 on October 29. There's also Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, although that one is technically published by Activision, which is nevertheless owned by Xbox.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dead-take-review-true-horror-was-institutionalized-power-we-met-along-way</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-take-review-the-true-horror-was-the-institutionalized-power-we-met-along-the-way.1257786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was drawn to <em>Dead Take</em> on its teased reveal with my love for psychological horror, love of movies, and a cast of some of my favorite actors from various live action, video game, and actual play content. Getting to sit down and play <em>Dead Take,</em> I was taken on a rollercoaster of emotions, tense relationships, and a veritable 'who's who' of warped power dynamics and relationships.</p>

<p>In <em>Dead Take,</em> the player takes on the role of Vinny Monroe, an actor in Hollywood trying to score his dream role but coming up short due to a number of reasons. After not hearing from your friend, Chase Lowry, who attended a party in the home of renowned producer Duke Cain, you go to investigate.</p>

<p>Arriving at the mansion in the Hollywood Hills, you find the lights on, but no one is home. Letting yourself in, you begin a strange exploration of the house where you'll get to solve puzzles, witness audition footage and screen tests for Cain's latest film, The Last Voyage, and learn what it takes to make it in this warped version of the industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-ben-starr.jpg?itok=ei65ggXl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-ben-starr.jpg?itok=NysIIalg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Be prepared to see a LOT of Ben Starr</figcaption></figure><p>If you're interested in knowing a bit more about the kind of horror experience you're in store for, expect eerie rooms of the house and a few jump scares crossing thresholds or when completing puzzles.</p>

<h2>Exploring The Mansion</h2>

<p>This mansion covers three floors of locked rooms and progressive exploration. From the get-go, though, you can explore most of the rooms, interact with some strange objects and letters, and even pick up a few progressive puzzle pieces.</p>

<p>You'll walk and run, but the game doesn't let you do more than that as you're forced to sit with your own thoughts amid tense audio and the sound of your own echoing footsteps. The game will do a lot more to set you on an unsettling edge, teasing you that something might be about to happen, far more than it ever actually scares as you're moving through this space.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-piano-puzzle.jpg?itok=chDJrTtV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-piano-puzzle.jpg?itok=I0tO0PvU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It's in progressing through the puzzles of the game that you'll uncover more puzzle pieces, leading to more parts of the mansion, and to fill in the grander story. It felt a lot like playing a classic Resident Evil title, but more of the mansion exploration and less active antagonists.</p>

<h2>Some Puzzles Were Highlights, Others Were Too Simple</h2>

<p>Puzzles were one of the two core aspects of <em>Dead Take</em> to engage in. From the moment you start the game, it's about figuring out how to get in. You can do this by programming a Fob with a certain frequency based on a sticky note in a drawer and the numbers on the front plate of the house.</p>

<p>There were some really entertaining puzzles, like getting to walk by a grand piano with all kinds of cultish and demonic symbols on it or needing to develop film correctly by bathing it in different chemical solutions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-set-puzzle.jpg?itok=VNla-T1O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-set-puzzle.jpg?itok=znV_RgxK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>My favorite puzzle of the game involved stepping into a set with mannequins posed around a table. I had to read pages of the script, including notes from the director, in order to determine the 'correct' setting for the scene. Make sure all of the actors were in place, they had the correct props, and that the camera was angled correctly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were also a few puzzles that really let me down. I was excited to make it to the pool house and begin picking up different weapons with snake motifs: a Snake Sword, Dagger, Sickle, etc. As I was hypothesizing where they could go or what they could do, I happened across a plaque with four places to put them and a very clear description of what cardinal direction each should point in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-weapons-puzzle.jpg?itok=l6xhZbId 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-weapons-puzzle.jpg?itok=n3eOhs2W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The answer is as simple as you'd expect...</figcaption></figure><p>It was less of a puzzle and more like English comprehension.</p>

<p>The other major aspect in gameplay, and one that lends to the deeper part of the story, is in collecting footage to watch, and Splaicing that footage. Splaicing is an 'AI' driven editing tool that lets you combine two pieces of footage together automagically.</p>

<p>For the narrative, this meant you could see one scene where Alanah Pearce's Victoria Cross is running her sides of a pivotal scene in the movie, and a second scene of Ben Starr's Chase Lowry doing the same, and combine them to get the full scene's context.</p>

<p>You'll watch footage and combine it for new footage to advance the greater plot of the game.</p>

<p>You can also get a variety of behind-the-scenes footage that honestly doesn't make sense based on the clips you provide the machine, but is interesting nonetheless. It might be Travis Willingham's Harry Dufresne, who plays the captain and love rival in The Last Voyage, candidly telling Vinny that just because he feels a role should be his… doesn't mean it should, and he shouldn't be so quick to use his connections, as it might backfire.</p>

<h2>Surface Story Didn't Do Much, But The Deeper Narrative Was Fascinating</h2>

<p>The surface story didn't do too much for me, it was never entirely clear why Vinny was in that mansion, what had happened to the party members, or why there were terrifying mannequins that were lurking around. Honestly, by the end of it, I wasn't exactly sure what kind of adventure Vinny had been on.</p>

<p>The aspect of the game that fascinated me was the deeper story. About the kind of man Duke Cain was — Producer, Husband, and Father — and how each of the actors in the story used their own power and were abused by each other's power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In talking with<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81fc54e7-5f6a-4933-8e34-9698b21581bd" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/inside-dead-take-abubakar-salim-explores-fear-fame-and-actors-experience" rel="nofollow"> Narrative Director Abubakar Salim </a>he told me that Video Games were the place to tell this story because it allowed him to present a situation and have others interpret</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing these audition tapes, learning about the Cain family history through notes around the house, and learning about how everyone was pining to be part of The Last Voyage and were cutthroat to earn their place was an interesting reflection on aspects of the movie industry, but also many creative careers.</p>

<p>Playing as Vinny I could feel his pain for not making the cut and losing the role of the lead man to Chase, but we also got to see how Chase reacted when screening Vinny's phone call, tossing him to the side as an actor without a job.</p>

<p>It shows that even when the entire system is working against you, and is trying to churn you up and spit you out, that if it's something you love, and you feel you were born to do you'll continue to lay everything on the line and even cross some lines to get to where you feel you 'deserve' to be.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-review-uv-light.jpg?itok=i5KT1r0k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-review-uv-light.jpg?itok=dYZAo-IC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The more I thought about what Vinny was putting himself through, the more I understood and related. Obviously not to the level of horror, but I can understand taking something you love doing and wanting to push to make a larger name for yourself in that field. For me, my ambition and drive have me sitting here and writing this review, but even in the game review and journalism space, I've heard all kinds of stories of abuse of power from those running the companies, to individual writers seeking to propel themselves to spite all others.</p>

<p>How this journey can relate to your own personal story of development, or in what you've seen of major industries, or closer to home,e can really enhance how deep this story is.</p>

<h2><em>Dead Take</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Dead Take </em>was a game that I went into expecting a few good puzzles and a cheap jumpscare or two. In that sense, the game perfectly delivered on my expectations. It did bring something extremely unique to the table in the live action sequences, delivering different sides of a story or a whole picture, letting the player mull over what they've seen and then rediscover it in an altered framework.</p>

<p>The surface story of Vinny in the mansion and his adventures throughout were entertaining gameplay wise, but didn't make as much sense from a narrative perspective. The grander story that it revealed of each of the main characters was one that was truly fascinating to me and will sit with me for a long while to come.</p>

<hr><p><strong><em>Dead Take </em></strong><em>was reviewed on PC via Steam with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 5 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

<figure><a title="Ys X: Nordics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08a0a6e93bac7/ys-x-nordics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nihon Falcom, NIS America,</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> launches for the Switch 2 in Japan today, and while there's still no word about a local release, some new details have now emerged about this experience.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/18019-ys-x-nordics-switch-save-data-transfer-ys-x-proud-nordics-nintendo-switch-2-falcom">highlighted by RPGSite</a>, an early review from <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202507/48248">Japanese outlet Dengeki</a> has revealed some key details about how the Switch 2 version connects with the existing Switch release. According to the source, "clear data" from your save file can be carried from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> to Ys X: Proud Nordics.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ys X: Proud Nordics will also feature 29 DLCs from the Switch release. The same outlet's review has also reconfirmed previous reports about the game featuring a performance mode that supports up to 120fps on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Apart from launching in Japan, Proud Nordics will also be made available for Switch 2 in Asia and is being distributed by Cloud Leopard Entertainment. If you haven't tried out the Switch version since its arrival last October, there's a demo available on the eShop.</p>

We’ve teamed up with the experts at Maxroll to bring you a beginner’s guide, builds to crush the game’s hardest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/Boss_Guides">bosses</a>, additional resources and mechanical overviews, and much more. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Beginner's Guide</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Get started with Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/guides/wuchang-fallen-feathers-beginners-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Beginner's Guide</u></a>. Combat in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is different from a lot of other Soulslikes, as your main resource Skyborn Might revolves around getting “perfect dodges” called Shimmers (think Sekiro but with hitting B instead of LB). You can then spend Skyborn Might to empower your weapon skills, or instantly execute a charged heavy attack. This is particularly useful because you can use charged heavy attacks to stagger foes, opening them up to a powerful Obliterate attack. Maxroll’s Beginner’s Guide also covers topics like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/How_to_Level_Up">leveling up</a> using the Impetus Repository system, how the game’s unique <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/Madness_(Inner_Demon)_Explained">Madness system</a> works, and the various character progression systems including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/How_Temperance_Works">Temperance</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/wuchang-fallen-feathers/How_to_Unlock_and_Use_Benedictions">Benedictions</a>, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/guides/wuchang-discipline-guide-best-disciplines" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disciplines</a> and more.

The Longsword is a balanced weapon that acts as a middle ground. Spears have great reach and excellent Disciplines, but have a weaker charged heavy attack animation. One-Handed Swords have long animations and low damage but provide Spell Damage, enabling a dedicated caster archetype. The Dual Blades reward all out aggression as you clash through enemy attacks and heal yourself. Axes hit hard, staggering foes and stopping them in their tracks, but they also tend to be slower and have higher stamina costs. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/dual-blades-blademaster-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dual Blades Blademaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/one-handed-swords-spell-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Spellcaster Build</u></a></li><li><a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/builds/axe-rampage-build-in-wuchang-fallen-feathers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Axe Rampage Build</u></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Database</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/31/database-wffimg1-1024x767-1753926837961.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s <a href="https://maxroll.gg/wuchang-fallen-feathers/database" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers database</u></a> to learn more about all of the items in the game.

Palace Heist is only the second Illumineer's Quest standalone game in the TCG's nearly two-year history. It launched in early June alongside several other Reign of Jafar products, some of which are also discounted right now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Collectors/dp/B0DDPM3PL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar's 24-pack Booster Box (288 cards)</a> is on sale for $114 (was $144).

Players place character and item cards from their deck on the game mat and square off against Jafar's 50-card deck. Your objective is to make it through the palace and secure the Reforged Crown. It's not a straightforward journey, however, as Supreme Sorcerer Jafar has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to impede your progress.</p><p>Palace Heist is a compelling variant on Lorcana that is especially great for those who don't always have someone around to battle. It's also a good tool to introduce new players to the game, since it's fully playable as a single-player experience as well as cooperatively with one other player. You can also use the cards in the standard Lorcana TCG.</p><p>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist includes the following:</p><ul><li>1 Jafar Scenario Deck (50 cards)</li><li>2 Player Decks (60 cards each)</li><li>1 Oversized Jafar Card</li><li>4 Battleground Cards</li><li>1 Reforged Crown Tile</li><li>1 Palace Heist Playmat</li><li>1 Jafar Draw Token</li><li>5 Lore Tracker Tokens</li><li>29 Damage Counters</li><li>1 Victory Card</li><li>Palace Heist Rules Sheet</li></ul><p>As mentioned, this is the second Illumineer's Quest game. The first, Deep Trouble, released as part of the Ursula's Return set in May 2024. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0CGXJ8244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble</a> still regularly sells for full price, though you can save a few bucks at Amazon. It's worth clarifying that Palace Heist and Deep Trouble are different games with unique scenarios and entirely separate decks of cards, so both games are worth checking out.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-evo-2025-accessory-sale-ps5-dualsense-edge-controller-deals/1100-6531846/">PlayStation Evo 2025 Sale Features Rare Deals On DualSense Edge &amp; Pulse Headset</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>According to its <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1950723771306054133">customer support account on social media</a>, the ability to upload records to the rankings is temporarily suspended. Rankings will also not be updated for the time being. This will once again be resolved in an update as soon as possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo Customer Support:</strong> "Regarding "Super Mario Party Jamboree" (including the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition), due to a glitch, the function to upload records to the ranking is currently suspended, so even if you update your records, the ranking will not be updated. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. We are currently preparing update data to fix this issue, and we will provide further information as soon as it is ready."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="XT_vmJEKdkw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XT_vmJEKdkw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4a62a0przxty&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT_vmJEKdkw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

It had this plane game on it (that you had to manually program in) where you had to clean, via dropping bombs, a landing field before your plane reached the bottom of the screen. When I say plane I mean single pixel moving from left to right and then right to left. It was really, really hard, but also amazing. I then had an Atari, an Amiga, and then a Mac. I didn't want the Mac, because I wanted to play <em>DOOM</em>! Luckily I found <em>Marathon</em> (by Bungie) and then all was well. In fact, l would go on to be the game reviewer for New Zealand's best (only) Mac publication, <em>MacGuide Magazine</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>When I wasn't playing video games or TTRPGs I was really interested in biology and animal behaviour. As such, I enrolled in an animal behaviour course at university and even worked for a year as a zoo keeper at a local zoo. The course was jointly taught by the biology and psychology departments and via the psych department I was also exposed to the idea of “human factors psychology”, which is a branch of psychology that studies technology and humans and as a principle believes that technology should be made for humans and the capabilities of humans. That is to say that people shouldn't have to suffer or struggle because of technology asking them to do things humans aren't physically or cognitively good at. Human factors also acknowledges that behaviour is systemic and arises from a web of interactions. Therefore the designers and owners (governments, businesses, etc) of those systems have the biggest responsibility for the outcomes of those systems.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Human factors psychology really spoke to me. There are so many systems out there that don't seem to care about the people interacting with them at all, and that should change. So I did a master’s in human factors, focused on road safety. Then after some time working for the NZ government as a road safety scientist I discovered that games UX research existed within the games industry! It was a pretty new field back then and the most prominent lab was at Microsoft. So I wrote them a message and they very kindly replied, put me through an interview loop, and then let me know, amongst other things, that really I needed a PhD (no longer the case, but the field was newer back then). I had always wanted one of those, so I headed off to the Netherlands, got a PhD, and more importantly also was lucky to find my partner while in Europe!&nbsp;</p><p>My PhD in human factors psych was also focused on traffic safety, but I always kept an eye on the games UX research world and taught some courses about UXR to game design students at a local university in the Netherlands. I also gave some talks at GDC EU. I was then lucky enough to get my first role as a Games UX Researcher and entered the games industry around 12 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: So you've worked in the same space for over a decade, what was the last job title you had?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: My first role was as a Games UX Researcher at a consultancy in the UK called Player Research. We worked mainly with indies and mobile game companies, and in the two and a half years I was there I worked on around 75 games.</p><p>I then moved on to Epic Games in the USA, around nine years ago. I started as a Researcher, but then moved into management of the UX Research team. My move to leadership happened a little while before <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> came out, and most recently my title was Director, User Experience Research.&nbsp;</p><p>I left Epic a few months ago to move back to NZ for lifestyle and family reasons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Across both your user experience roles, both as a researcher and managing a team, what did your job actually involve? Like, on both a daily basis and a more long-term basis?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: As Director, User Experience Research, I viewed my main role as making sure my team was happy, healthy, having fun (we work on games so fun should be part of the work environment!), and had what they needed to do their job. Effectively as the top level of the UXR team system my role was to design it as a positive place to be. This also included knowing what the priorities were, where the work is most needed, and advocating for games user experience research and my team.&nbsp;</p><p>To talk more broadly about what games user experience research can do, I see it as typically having four main functions:&nbsp;</p><p>UX research with external players: There are a range of methods that can be deployed here, but the most important and valuable is running observational UX tests with external players and users. The primary goal of this is to put real, representative, players/users into contact with the in-development games and products to observe and research what happens. These players are not familiar with the game and therefore better represent the behaviours of the player population. Another aspect of this can be checking to help make sure the game is accessible for a range of players e.g., looking at things like is the UI colour blind friendly? Are simulation sickness triggers minimized? etc.</p><p>Competitive and UX analysis: This is where UX researchers use their training and education to examine a game or product for what makes it work and what may be issues. This can be a full description of a single game or looking at a particular mechanic or system (for example crafting systems) across multiple games.</p><p>Internal playtesting: Setting up, running, and collecting and sharing data on the results of internal (employee) playtests. This can also include being involved in the technical side of making sure in-development builds are ready and working. The goals of internal playtests are to let developers play/use and provide feedback on games and products being developed at the company. This is important as it lets teams experience what they and others have been working on and fosters a feedback culture. At some companies this function is owned by QA, and at others by UXR.&nbsp;</p><p>Survey research: Creating, sending, and analyzing surveys. Surveys can be sent via email (to people who opted in) and/or built directly into games (for example has <em>Fortnite Battle Royale</em> ever asked you how powerful you thought bananas were?). The goals of this function is to find out how players were feeling and thinking via representative surveys. In the banana example, by having players rate the banana, alongside also collecting ratings for, say, the Kamehameha, it can give comparison points and context for the data.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Across the functions above, ultimately, the goal of user experience research is to be a partner to other devs and help them make sure their design intent/vision is reaching the players/users. So for example, is a new game mechanic clear? Can players use it the way the designer intends? Is it too easy to use? Then once it is out, is it being received and interacted with as intended?</p><p>One example of a UX test finding from during my consulting days was a game where at a certain point you had to "press tab". I watched a player in a lab not press tab over and over and then went to talk to them. At that point they told me they had seen the instruction, but couldn't see a tab (as in a tab in a browser) anywhere in the UI to press. Which was an important lesson in how mental models can differ, particularly in a world where often the "tab" button on keyboards may not be labeled and its use is relatively rare.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to look at it is that the goal of user experience research is to use the scientific method and what is known about how psychology and physiology to:</p><p>- Help make sure the intended game/product design is being experienced. Including that the friction/difficulty the designers want is being achieved.</p><p>- Help make sure any unintended friction that gets in the way of, or blocks, the intended design is found and addressed.</p><p>- Finally to help find any unexpected/emergent experiences that may not have been fully intended, but are awesome.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we use the above data to help inform design. I do want to flag the use of "inform" there as very intentional vs the idea of "data driven" design. I have found that data is a poor driver, as it is often short sighted, lacks context, and is overly reactive. Where data really shines is when it is used, in partnership with the expertise of other devs, to inform a design. It is here that data can contribute to long term views and mesh well with the art of games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: That's certainly a lot! Out of all that, what would you say was the thing you loved most about the job?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: The clear answer is the people I have had the privilege of working with in my career so far. They are all just the best people; smart, funny, and awesome to work with.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, to be able to raise players' issues and concerns and to highlight what they think is cool is another wonderful thing. To see a game come through UX tests, design iterations, reach players, and then see the behaviour we saw in the lab also being shown by millions of players and to know they are loving it! That is really a great feeling. To have the collaborative process of game design come together.</p><p>As someone who loves research it is also really fulfilling to be able to take the knowledge I have of why, cognitively speaking, a motorist may not see a cyclist at an intersection and be able to use that to investigate why a UI element or enemy in a game may also not stand out. Every survey, every UX test and every playtest, it is just exciting to me to see the data, whether it is surprising or completely expected.</p><p><strong>LP: On the flipside, what are the downsides? Are there any challenges you would face regularly, and are there fresh ones you see coming on the horizon?</strong></p><p><strong>BT</strong>: A regular challenge would be dealing with the misconception that UXR dumbs down games and makes them easy. Also, that we are all inherently evil and working to manipulate players into spending money. Neither of these is true about UXR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard in a way that just isn't the goal for consumer UX. Games can be confusing and challenging. If that is the intent of the designer, then that is what we work to support in UXR. In my 12+ years working in games UX research I have far more often highlighted that some design element was too easy for players than I have said something was too hard.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the manipulation I do understand where that comes from. So much of the online world now has been made to intentionally work against the user. But absolutely that is not what I am interested in, nor is it what games user experience researchers should be supporting. Our goal is to represent the players. This means if something around purchasing is unclear it is our job to find that and point it out.&nbsp;</p><p>Two other things regularly bug me. One is calling what games user research does “focus testing” or “focus groups”. A focus group/test is a specific methodology where you get a group of people together and get them to talk about a product, design, or idea. It is a flawed method, and not one I use or recommend. If I were to pick one method that is most representative for UXR it would be observational research. Watching people play and writing down what happens to collect their actual behaviour i.e., not what they say they do, but what they actually do. So, please if you are going to generalize say: we do playtesting or UX testing, not focus tests.&nbsp;</p><p>The other is when people throw around scientific terms like "hit of dopamine" or "dopamine rush". Dopamine just simply doesn't work like that at all. Also we really shouldn't be using drug metaphors in general when talking about games.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Thanks so much again for your time.
