		<p>Developer Pixelatom&nbsp;and publisher&nbsp;Blowfish Studios have announced that Anarkade, a platform fighter, will be available from September 23rd on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anarkade - Coming 23rd September | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejUkOamlck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Anarkade&nbsp;is a fun, fast-paced party game at heart,”</em> said Javier Arias, Founder and Lead Developer, Pixelatom. <em>“We’ve crafted a balanced experience, mixing action, shooting, and platforming with unpredictable scenarios that make for an dynamic, ever changing experience for shooters to play over and over again.”</em></p>
<p>Anarkade will feature six different stages with each of them having their own hazards and quirks. For example, in the Space stage the battle wills be fought in low gravity, while ice stages have slippery surfaces. The layouts will change as each is procedurally generated. There will be various weapons available to use in the fights too including a knife, Python revolver, the gatling gun, and the bowling bomb. At the start of each fight, players will be randomly assigned their weapons and will have to fight to grab crates to change weapons.&nbsp;Anarkade will feature both local and online multiplayer. Game modes will include single matches, or tournament matches that include Deathmatches and collecting loot in Cratebox.</p>

					<p>I didn't know what to expect when I first booted up the game. I went in without knowing it and didn't even look it up on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/721180/Dustborn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. I installed Dustborn, developed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/dustborn-qa-red-threads-first-attempt-at-action-adventure/">Red Thread Games</a> and got stuck in. However, after some time playing the game, it felt familiar.</p>
<p>For a while, I couldn't place my finger on what felt so familiar about Dustborn until I realized that it reminded me of the Telltale games, specifically Tales from the Borderlands. The characters had the same kooky vibes as those of Tales from the Borderlands.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I also found it similar to a Telltale game was the art style. It carried the same comic book aesthetic, one of the biggest factors that drew me into Dustborn. While the art style was similar, Dustborn has a more authentic comic-book feel, which I loved as someone who avidly reads comic books.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/dustborn-2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Off the bat, the game is incredibly accessible. While it did tell me to play with a controller, I decided to forgo the warning and use a mouse and keyboard. Even then, I found the game perfectly playable. My only issue was that I couldn't change the keybinds, which I do in every game for the optimal experience. For those who need subtitles, there was the option to stack the subtitles and have different colors for character subtitles, making it easier to digest the conversation.</p>
<p>If, like me, you sometimes miss crucial dialogue, accessing the menu shows you the full dialogue on the right-hand side, which I loved as a feature. Additionally, for those who struggle with QTEs (Quick-Time Events), there was the option for simplified QTEs.</p>
<p>The game opens with a scene introducing the four main characters in a car. In the driver's seat, there is Sai, with pigtails and vitiligo, who is freaking out about the cargo that they have picked up. Sai is very explosive, her moods changing with a drop of the hat. With how dramatic she is, she quickly became my least favorite. Then there are the two passengers in the back: A non-binary person named Noam with silver hair and a masculine Latino named Theo. Along the way, you are introduced to other important characters, like a sweet lady named Luna, who is working on getting you to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>You play as the protagonist, Pax, a black woman with powers who can utilize them to manipulate language and saves her and her team a fair few times. She gets tired of their bickering and utilizes her powers to "block" them, stopping them from talking entirely until she releases them. Her ability to have powers makes her someone who is called Anomal. In addition, Noam's powers gaslight people and make them feel a certain way. Pax has a bullet wound, and Noam manages to gaslight her to make her feel okay again. Then there is Sai, whose powers turn her into stone. Which proves to be mildly problematic throughout the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ss_dc5d02bbec90aa90fcf5eebb3c2279ae067f6166-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Pax has been hired to deliver a very important package from Pacifica to Nova Scotia, a long and troublesome journey. In addition, you get to see every inner thought that Pax has; through this, you see her refer to herself as a "kid." It quickly becomes apparent that she isn't on about herself and is pregnant, which is a huge secret she is hiding from the others.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I wasn't confident in their abilities when I was first introduced to the ragtag team. While I swear like a soldier, I felt that the amount of swearing from Sai was unnecessary, making the opening cutscene long and tedious. The other characters were incredibly likable, with Noam quickly becoming my favorite. One of the main things that I found incredibly bizarre in the prologue of Dustborn was the rhythm mini-game. It felt incredibly out of place, and I wasn't sure if that was what I would expect from the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Once the prologue was over, I found the experience much more enjoyable. There was space to explore and connect with others and enemies to battle. However, during cutscenes where Pax was in charge of making decisions, I often found myself irritated by Sai's passive-aggressive rebuttals. They all comment on Sai being emotionally charged, which becomes evident quickly.</p>
<p>Dustborn is a politically charged game where you deliver "supplies" across the border. These include pamphlets, manifestos, and books banned from libraries in the American Republic, a fascist state that has outlawed all politics that oppose their views. During a specific scene where Pax is confronted with the "tree in the stillness," she hears politically charged whispers from the far-right, talking about how scientists lie to people and are putting things in the vaccines. From this scene alone, it became clear that Dustborn is a metaphor for everything happening in the real world, and I was here for it.</p>
<p>My one gripe with this game is how long it takes to get into the nitty-gritty. While the prologue is intense and dramatic from the outset, after that initial cutscene, it slows down. Many of the conversations are bonding sessions where Pax is trying to navigate her relationships with the other crew members.</p>
<p>Throughout the game, many words were either bolded or capitalized to provide emphasis. Even now, I am still confused about what some words mean or whether they are just alternative words used to describe things. For example, I see Anomal's powers described as "Words," "Vox," and then the other character-specific terms, such as "Block" and "Trigger," for Pax.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ss_99a0bcba5ecbf6bf151e4948229c245a6fdaecf6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Music is also important in the game, with mini rhythm games throughout. I found this quite bizarre and wasn't sure what this added. While your cover is part of a Punk Rock band, with all of you playing different instruments, it still felt peculiar and out of place.</p>
<p>The story and interactions were the most fun parts of the game. However, I didn't mesh with the combat system and found it a little lacking. While there was the opportunity for fun combos and using your powers to make the fight easier, it wasn't what I wanted from the combat system.</p>
<p>Overall, I did enjoy my time with Dustborn. It wasn't at all what I expected, but it was a lot of fun, even if I did have some minor gripes on the personality of a particular character.</p>
<p><em>Reviewed on PC (code provided by the publisher).</em></p>

					
					

<p>Overall, it was enjoyable to watch the relationships between the characters unfold. However, the prologue soured it early on for me, as it felt a bit too overexaggerated. The conversations and getting to explore new environments were&nbsp;some of the best parts of Dustborn, while I unfortunately found the combat system to be a little lacking in places. Still, the idea for this game is incredibly unique and one that I really enjoyed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, Valve's immensely popular multiplayer shooter&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has already made a staggering amount of money in 2024, and the year is nowhere near done yet.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/which-steam-games-won-the-first-half" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless</a>,&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>racked up an astonishing $610 million in the first half of 2024. It's not hard to imagine the game breaking a billion dollars in revenue before the year is through.</p>
<p>It's a pretty big leap from&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike&nbsp;</em>to the next game on GameDiscoverCo's list,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, which racked up "just" $458 million. An impressive number by any metric, but it probably could have been even higher if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">that whole PlayStation ID debacle</a> hadn't happened.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-revenue-report-shooting.jpg?itok=4FK7N0H8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-revenue-report-shooting.jpg?itok=G2HS7bMU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>is big business for Valve, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>It's another fairly big leap from&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s $378 million, which secures it a bronze medal, with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>&nbsp;</em>bringing up fourth and fifth with $276 million and $159 million, respectively.</p>
<p>The first single-player game (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/baldurs-gate-3-multiplayer-coop">does also support multiplayer</a>) on the list is&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, which raked in $127 million for the first half of 2024. That's not bad at all considering it was released last year.</p>
<p>Predictably enough,&nbsp;<em>Dota 2&nbsp;</em>is in seventh place with $119 million, although&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragons-dogma-2"><em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em></a>'s eighth-place $108 million finish is something of a surprise, especially given that it's beaten&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, which sits in ninth with $100 million.</p>
<p>Finally, rounding out the top ten spot is&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>, which made $91 million in the first half of the year. That's probably not going to serve as much of a balm to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees">200-plus staff let go from developer Bungie</a> last month, though.</p>

<ul><li>11.&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;- $56 million</li>
<li>12.&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>- $54 million</li>
<li>13.&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>- $49 million</li>
<li>14.&nbsp;<em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>&nbsp;- $48 million</li>
<li>15.&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut&nbsp;</em>- $48 million</li>
<li>16.&nbsp;<em>Warframe&nbsp;</em>- $46 million</li>
<li>17.&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty HQ&nbsp;</em>- $41 million</li>
<li>18.&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink&nbsp;</em>- $40 million</li>
<li>19.&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>- $40 million</li>
<li>20.&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>- $36 million</li>
</ul><h2>Steam is also cracking down on link spam in store descriptions</h2>
<p>Elsewhere in Steam news, Valve has also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed a new set of changes</a> coming to Steam store page descriptions in order to combat excessive link spam.</p>
<p>The changes essentially limit what it's possible to include in a Steam game's store page description; publishers will no longer be able to include links to other websites, for instance, nor will they be able to include "embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons".</p>
<p>Also prohibited are "images, links, or widgets pointing to other games on Steam". Starting from early September, an update for Steam will be rolled out that will hide instances of URLs being included in games' descriptions or "other text section[s]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-store-page-descriptions-forest-ranger-simulator.jpg?itok=NTy6kvgo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-store-page-descriptions-forest-ranger-simulator.jpg?itok=IznvoH7t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be seeing less of this sort of thing.</figcaption></figure><p>Valve says it doesn't like "store pages linking prominently off to other store pages", and that the changes are also intended to nudge publishers towards using Steam's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos">new demo features</a> rather than releasing a separate "Prologue" for their games and linking to the main game from that prologue's store page.</p>
<p>You're unlikely to notice a huge amount of changes when this new Steam update drops, but it should at least make navigating Steam a bit easier. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Out December 13, <em>Kraven the Hunter</em>’s latest trailer also introduces us to the titular anti-hero’s gangster dad played by Russell Crowe. </p><p>Take a look:</p><p>As Johnny Cash sings in the background, we see Kraven doing all of his hunter things, from dodging bear traps and knifing guys in the leg to running on all fours like he just finished watching James McAvoy in <em>Glass</em>. The trailer also sets up Rhino as the big bad, described as an animal “stronger than you can imagine.” It ends with the two fighting out in a valley amid a stampede of water buffalo. </p><p> <em>Kraven’s Last Hunt</em> is considered to be one of the top comic book arcs in Marvel’s repertoire, but with no Spider-Man to pull on, Sony’s origin story for Kraven, who was also featured in last year’s PlayStation 5 hit S<em>pider-Man 2, </em>appears to be going more for an action movie revenge flick vibe in the vein of <em>John Wick</em> or <em>The Equalizer</em>. Whether it can actually succeed on its own merits is the big question. The first <em>Venom </em>aside, Sony’s recent Spider-Man B-sides track record has been full of major misses like <em>Morbius </em>and <em>Madame Web</em>. </p><p>One thing Sony clearly does want audiences to know is that <em>Kraven the Hunter</em> won’t be shying away from brutal violence. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-box-office-flop-bomb-2024-gearbox-1851619588&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-box-office-flop-bomb-2024-gearbox-1851619588">Given <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>’s recent $1 billion box office blowout</a></span>, shattering records for R-rated movies, it’s a strategy that makes sense. At the same time, it’s going to take a lot more than a few decapitations to purge Sony’s current comic book movie malaise. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some fans, however, are concerned that <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fans-fear-h2m-mod-will-get-shut-down-as-sales-skyrocket-2860448/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision will step in and shut the whole thing down</a> like it did with the <a href="https://x.com/sm2game/status/1658745182819598337" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fan-made Call of Duty SM2 mod in 2023.</a></p><p>The mod is for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, and it includes numerous maps (50+ in total), an updated progression system, more camos, and custom attachments. The killstreaks you remember from Modern Warfare 2 are in the mod, too.</p><p>There is a lot of excitement and hype around this mod, in part because 2020's Modern Warfare II Remastered was campaign-only and did not include any multiplayer support. At the time, Activision's explanation for why it didn't release a multiplayer experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-cod-modern-warfare-2-remastered-lacks-multipla/1100-6475496/" data-ref-id="1100-6475496">left a lot of people shaking their heads and trying to understand.</a> And now, Call of Duty fans are taking matters into their own hands and doing it themselves.</p><p>The H2M mod, as it's called, requires a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, which was originally released in 2017. The mod launcher will arrive on August 16.</p><p>To install H2M-Mod, you will need to own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. Presumably due to the great anticipation for the mod's release, Modern Warfare Remastered has surged up the sales charts and currently sits at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers&amp;os=win" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 overall on Steam's top-sellers chart.</a> Black Ops 6, the next entry in the series that's due out this October, is No. 15, for comparison.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwBEmMPxuRU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VwBEmMPxuRU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The H2M mod includes all the Modern Warfare Remastered maps, as well as original MW2 maps that the community creators brought forward. Additionally, some of the campaign play spaces from the MW2 Campaign Remastered release are playable in the mod as custom maps.</p><p>As for progression, the modders said there will be 70 ranks to make your way through and 10 prestige levels. After prestige 10, players can work their way up to level 1000.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision will reveal what's next for Black Ops 6 during the Call of Duty Next event on August 28. Shortly after that, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta begins on August 30.</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hzwdhdoaPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Player First Games revealed new MultiVersus gameplay featuring Beetlejuice and confirmed they will join the roster on August 20, 2024.</p>



<p>The trailer showcases some of Beetlejuice’s kit as an Assassin class fighter, an archetype that only offers a few other characters like Arya Stark and Marvin the Martian. It also reveals new voice lines, interactions, and potential cosmetics. </p>



<p>The new trailer closes with a brief nod to Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the upcoming movie sequel. Director Tim Burton returns for the film, which premieres in early September this year.</p>

<p>Today’s announcement for August follows just a month after leaker AusilMV claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leak-teases-beetlejuice-is-possibly-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus could add Beetlejuice</a> sometime soon. </p>



<p>That lends more validity to AusilMV’s previous leaks from May 2024, which teased even more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leaks-tease-possible-new-characters-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential characters and stages</a>. They claimed they found these additions by datamining the game.</p>



<p>Beetlejuice’s moveset features a variety of thematic abilities, like falling into a coffin or transforming hands into a weapon. Most notably, that also includes the addition of the sandworm, iconic enough to be worked into the popcorn bucket merch for the upcoming film.</p>



<p>Late last July, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially acquired</a> MultiVersus developer Player First Games. The developer’s co-founder Tony Huynh said that “having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players.”</p>

<p>This past wipe was currently the longest in the history of Escape From Tarkov. As such, most of us long-time players find ourselves rather anxious to jump into a brand-new wipe with new content to explore, new mechanics, weapons, and more. It’s a long time coming, but here’s everything new in Escape From Tarkov patch 0.15!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-patch-0-15-of-escape-from-tarkov">Everything New in Patch 0.15 of Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>To announce patch 0.15 of Escape From Tarkov, Battlestate Games published a brand-new trailer showcasing the game’s new boss enemy, Partisan, a few of the all-new weapons we get to play around with, the reworked Factory map, and so much more!</p>



<figure><p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reworked Factory</strong></li>



<li><strong>New Guns</strong>
<ul>
<li>9mm UZI SMG</li>



<li>Desert Eagle</li>



<li>M60</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>New Boss – Partisan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Tripwires</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>As soon as Battlestate Games releases the official patch notes, which will include far more additions to the game than what we saw in the trailer, we’ll update this piece so you’re in the know!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Next Tarkov Wipe Arrives August 20, Battlestate Reveals</a></p>



<h2 id="h-does-patch-0-15-come-with-a-wipe">Does Patch 0.15 Come With a Wipe?</h2>



<p>It does, actually! The upcoming patch 0.15 for Escape From Tarkov is a massive addition to the game, with so much new content and mechanics that it warrants a wipe. Thankfully, for those who have eagerly awaited the next wipe, it’s coming on August 20. It will, of course, coincide with the release of the new patch.</p>



<p>The last wipe in Escape From Tarkov occurred in December! It has been approximately 230 days since the last one, and I don’t know about you, but my stash is overflowing. I don’t even have gear fear; it’s just an accumulation from many months of play.</p>



<hr>



<p>While Escape From Tarkov slept, upcoming extraction shooters such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-early-access-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arena Breakout: Infinite launched into Early Access</a>. Do you think Tarkov should be worried about the competition?</p>

            <p>We now have a release date for the upcoming, current-gen version of Supermassive Games' slasher horror Until Dawn.</p>
<p>The game will arrive on both PC and PlayStation 5 this autumn, on 4th October. What better way to get yourself ready for the run up to halloween than doing your utmost to save that poor group of unsuspecting teens from the horrors of the night.</p>
<p>In addition to announcing a release date, the Until Dawn team has also <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/?sf274260483=1">shared a few details</a> about how it has enhanced the game with changes to graphics, gameplay, story elements and "more". Before I get into all that, though, you can check out a new trailer for Until Dawn showing off some comparisons between the remaster and original below.</p>

<p>Right, time for those aforementioned enhancements.</p>
<p>First off, and as you will have seen in the trailer, the team has overhauled the Until Dawn's visuals, with the game being "built from the ground up" using Unreal Engine 5. This means that the character models, environments, props players can interact with and so on have all been updated. The game has also been "completely relit" and includes raytracing, which has allowed the developer to focus on "a more atmospheric and 'modern horror' experience".</p>
<p>Until Dawn will also have a new camera control mechanic on its release, which will allow players to "see the world... from entirely new perspectives".</p>
<p>"Blending the cinematography of the original with the introduction of a modern third-person camera, we hope to bring new life to characters and locations. The camera's flexibility allows us to place new emphasis on important moments and tell the story from a view closer to the characters," the Until Dawn team said.</p>
<p>From a narrative point of view, this version of Until Dawn's story will feature a reworked prologue. While the original narrative is "intact", adjustments have been made to the prologue to help with some pacing. This includes more screen time with the Washington family, but I won't say any more to avoid potential spoilers. The developer hopes the adjustments here will increase the emotional impact of the prologue.</p>
<p>In addition to nicer visuals and the like, Until Dawn's rerelease will also provide players with new collectables to scoop up and the implementation of new accessibility and usability settings.</p>
<p>If you didn't play Until Dawn on its original PS4 release, I would recommend giving it a bash. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-review">Until Dawn review</a> from 2015 called the game "weird, gory and surprisingly moving".</p>
<p>You can pre-order Until Dawn from 21st August. And yes, a PSN account is required on PC.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game.952743/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/obsidian-ceo-would-love-to-make-a-shadowrun-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian Entertainment CEO Feargus Urquhart was just featured in an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with YouTube channel Limit Break Network. When asked which Xbox IP he'd like to tackle if given the chance, Urquhart singled out Shadowrun.</p>
<p><em>I love Shadowrun. I think it's super cool. Within, like, two months of Obsidian getting acquired I asked for the list. It's just a spreadsheet. I think I got the latest version and I looked through all the stuff. I mean, there's a lot of stuff on there. It's been a while since I looked at it, but it's a pretty incredible thing, and now you add in Activision and all the stuff that they have... But yeah, if you had to pin me down on one, yes, it would be Shadowrun. I bought the book of the first edition when it first came out. I probably own four of the six editions. I think it's a super cool IP.</em></p>
<p>Personally, I agree with the Obsidian CEO. Shadowrun has a lot of potential to flourish and even go mainstream with the right project and budget. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-harebrained-schemes-should-be-microsofts-next-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocated</a> for Microsoft to purchase Harebrained Schemes, which made the latest Shadowrun games, but it looks like they're <a href="https://wccftech.com/graft-is-harebraineds-new-game-slated-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">busy</a> with something else. Obsidian could be an amazing fit.</p>
<p>Of course, this question followed the more obvious one: would the studio head like to make Fallout New Vegas 2? Urquhart again said yes without giving away anything else.</p>
<p><em>Fallout is very dear to me. I put an incredible amount of my own time into Fallout. I wrote dialogues, I designed maps, and I was a lead designer. That was back at Black Isle. For Obsidian, it was an incredibly important game, not just from the standpoint of how much people love it, but it got us to make a big open-world game, and we learned a lot from it, and so I think it's important to us.&nbsp;Fallout's just fun. I mean, that's why the series also worked well. It's so silly. For me, I would love to make another Fallout game. I always say that, I never back away from it. We'll see. That's the best thing I can say, but if that opportunity comes out, I'd love to do it.</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-talks-reportedly-happening-at-microsoft-obsidian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculation</a> on Fallout New Vegas 2, and it was rekindled after the show's success and the second season tease of New Vegas. On the other hand, Bethesda seems staunchly against lending their franchise to someone else, so Shadowrun may really be the best option for Obsidian.</p>
<p>Of course, the studio is already busy with its own franchises, such as The Outer Worlds and Pillars of Eternity, which is about to get the action RPG spin-off Avowed. On that note, the Obsidian CEO talked about some changes made to the beginning of the game (now <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-officially-delayed-to-february-18-2025-new-live-stream-set-for-august-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to February 18, 2025).</p>
<p><em>We made a specific decision about a year ago. Where the game started a year ago is not where it starts. It now basically starts with a prologue. Where we're putting character creation within that and how much we were asking the player to actually do within character creation has been a lot of that. With the prologue, we basically said hey, we need to create a much more directed experience for people to get a taste for a lot of the stuff. Not all the depth that they will be able to do with a character, but give them enough of a taste so they can understand what this game is. It also helped the game introduce players to a taste of what's going on with the conflict and a taste of this part of the world of Eora. In this case, we did make changes specifically because we wanted people to get in quicker and not just hit a wall of too much exposition.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-final-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun.952740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/visions-of-mana-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stepping into the 18th <em>Mana </em>game as a newcomer to the series was daunting, but I was enchanted by the characters, combat, and semi-open-world traveling of <em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I was able to preview <em>Visions of Mana</em>. The game is focused on Val, a Soul Guard, and several Alms, who are chosen adventurers dedicated to sacrificing themselves to preserve the flow of mana in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple story setup lets the rest of the game shine. The preview of <em>Visions of Mana</em> only saw a bit of story, mostly creating the backdrop for the characters as a group and a introducing a bit about the politics of the world.</p>
<h2>The Colorful Cast of <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-morley-and-the-moon.jpg?itok=q_al3RJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-morley-and-the-moon.jpg?itok=NYwQfs9e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters and the world in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana&nbsp;</em>are stunning.​​​</figcaption></figure><p>The characters are quirky in the best ways possible, and the range of personalities in the five-person group I experienced was delightful. From mellow, happy Hinna to sassy, spirited Careena to somber, serious Morley, the party was well-rounded and kept things interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The original characters, Val and Hinna, are cute and happy-go-lucky at the start. However, the stage set during the preview makes it look like they’ll get heavy character development. Some of the other characters grew a bit during the early hours of gameplay, which makes investing in them emotionally a breeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, most of the crew sounded as good as their characters were written. Cutscenes are much more enjoyable when the characters sound good, and for the most part, they did.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Visions of Mana</em>&nbsp;Has Charming Combat</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kraken-fight-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=iGJAHSA8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kraken-fight-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=avi2wFaR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemies were as well-designed as the characters in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>The combat in <em>Visions of Mana</em>&nbsp;is well done. It’s not offering fast-paced ARPG fighting but instead takes things a bit slower. Characters move pretty slowly, which felt sluggish at first. However, after the first few fights, it was clear that the slower-paced combat helped focus on playing smarter instead of spamming buttons.</p>
<p>I started with the easiest difficulty option: beginner. However, combat still wasn’t a breeze even at this level. It was challenging even here, which just shows how challenging the game is meant to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Combat is also pretty varied. Each character can change classes with elemental objects. This was fun to mess around with – building teams that played well together while using elemental objects was a challenge since each object could only be with one person at a time.</p>
<p>And, of course, the outfit changes show off just how great the character’s designs in general are.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Frolicking in Fields in <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-giant-wolf.jpg?itok=GVDunKt2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-giant-wolf.jpg?itok=DNmwax9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players can ride this adorable wolf, Pikul, after meeting Morley, and it's one of the cutest parts of&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most surprising parts of <em>Visions of Mana</em> was the open-world areas. The game isn’t open world, though some areas are large enough to have multiple fast travel points.</p>
<p>Traveling through these areas was both satisfying and rewarding. There’s a lot to collect, including money. Considering the prices of items in-game, the currency alone makes exploring worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movement and banter between characters are part of what makes exploring so fun. Jumping and running is so smooth that it felt like I was constantly racing myself. Plus, a lot of rewards can be obtained just by running over them, adding to this feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The banter between characters is entertaining and kept me laughing while I did this. Combined with great sound design, exploring may have been my favorite part of the preview.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/visions-of-mana-release-date"><em>Visions of Mana</em></a> has a lot to love, and while parts of it might take some getting used to, it’s worth it. It’s set to release on August 29, 2024, on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Until Dawn Remake Release Date Set for the Spookiest Month of the Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-release-date-set-for-the-spookiest-month-of-the-year.952737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ballistic Moon have announced the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake release date, and I'll give you three guesses as to which month this spooky horror adventure is launching in.</p>
<p>That's right: the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's official release date is October 4th. Halloween falls on a Thursday this year, so I suppose launching on that date wouldn't have been an option, but hey - at least the month is right!</p>
<p>Unlike the original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, which was a PlayStation exclusive, this reimagined version will launch on both PS5 and PC simultaneously, so you'll have your pick of which platform you want to play it on (unless you want to play it on Xbox or Switch, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-release-date-mountain.jpg?itok=3c1FDmXw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-release-date-mountain.jpg?itok=QQE1wk1Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake officially arrives in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with announcing the release date, Sony and Ballistic Moon have also released a comparison trailer that shows off some of the changes the two studios have made since the original 2015&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>was released.</p>
<p>These changes include alterations to some of the game's plot points, as well as a visual overhaul that should make the game look as pretty as you'd expect it to in 2024.</p>
<p>Handily, the trailer includes side-by-side shots to show you exactly what's different, so if you have played the original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, you should get a kick out of seeing what Ballistic Moon has done with the place, so to speak.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>comparison trailer right here.</p>

<p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>is an enhanced remake of the 2015 narrative horror adventure. If you want a rough idea of what Sony and Ballistic Moon are going for with the remake, think&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part I&nbsp;</em>(although hopefully without the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-accknowledges-last-of-us-part-i-issues-on-pc-promises-updates-coming-next">well-documented PC issues</a>).</p>
<p>Although many changes have been made, including visual and narrative differences that you'll definitely notice if you've played the original,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>still has the same basic premise as its predecessor, so you can enjoy this one whether or not you've experienced the 2015 game.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that original&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games isn't involved with this remake, although you can still get your horror kicks from that studio thanks to upcoming games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed"><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 4th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/next-tarkov-wipe-august-20/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has finally been revealed (after more than 230 days) that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will land on August 20. It’ll go hand-in-hand with the typical Twitch Drops campaign that’ll reward users for watching top Tarkov streamers broadcast gameplay on the purple platform, Battlestate Games has announced.</p>



<p>This marks the end of the longest wipe in Tarkov history and it ushers in the 0.15 patch that’s set to change <strong>plenty </strong>about the most popular extraction shooter game in the world.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-escape">Prepare To Escape</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games has just posted a trailer online for the 0.15 patch that accompanies the first wipe since December 2023:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov Beta - 0.15 Patch trailer (feat. Partisan)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Jlyhs7yOLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In this trailer, we get our first full-fledged look at the Factory expansion, which seems as though it’s blowing the map wide open. As one of the oldest Tarkov maps, Factory has been the place to go for short, aggressive matches for several years, and this change marks the first time it has been expanded by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>The trailer for the next Tarkov wipe also reveals new weapons, including the 9mm Uzi SMG and the sought-after Desert Eagle. In one scene, BSG’s capture artists are scene blasting down Killa with the .50 handgun.</p>



<p>Right now, pre-wipe events are unfolding like wildfire in the game, with Battlestate Games tweaking various elements of the game in the final few days of this ‘season’. Before long, everything in the game will be reduced in price to just a few roubles, and players will have the entire game unlocked as they make the most of what’s left of this patch.</p>



<p>Next Tuesday, Escape from Tarkov will wipe, and hundreds of thousands of people will return to the game – then the cycle begins all over again.</p>



<p>Are you planning on playing Tarkov once the 0.15 patch has been deployed?</p>

<p>In a new PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, developer Ballistic Moon announced that the anticipated rebuilt version of Until Dawn will launch on October 4, 2024. </p>



<p>Creative director Neil McEwan explained that “our intention has not been to alter the events.” However, they added that the enhanced version will rework the prologue to adjust its pacing.</p>



<p>McEwan also broke down the new build, which adds “updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations.” These improvements will be available in both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions. </p>



<p>Ballistic Moon also offered a new comparison trailer, including a few side-by-side glimpses of cinematics and gameplay.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today’s blog mentioned that the rebuilt Until Dawn will also feature new collectibles, accessibility and usability settings, and the Stay Calm mechanic. Stay Calm is an alternative “for third party peripherals that do not feature a gyroscope or for players who prefer a different challenge.”</p>



<p>The new version just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-for-pc-playstation-5-gets-esrb-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> a couple of weeks ago. Fans can pre-order the “rebuilt and enhanced” version of Until Dawn starting August 21, 2024, ahead of the October release.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Until Dawn fans can also look forward to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action movie adaptation</a> from Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions. The cast of the film <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-cast-grows-peter-stormare-possibly-reprising-dr-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently expanded</a>, including the return of Peter Stormare, who played Dr. Hill in Supermassive Games’ original Until Dawn.</p>

                <p>Sony and Ballistic Moon have confirmed that the remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/until-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-616356">Until Dawn</a> will officially launch on October 4 for PS5 and PC. A remake of the 2015 horror game that Supermassive Games originally developed, Until Dawn tells the story of a group of friends stuck on Blackwood Mountain and forced to make tough decisions as they attempt to survive a terrible night.</p><p>If you're looking to see just how much of a difference there is between the game, you can check out the trailer below showing off a comparison between the gamess.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIkuM5y0Bjw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bIkuM5y0Bjw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For the remake, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ballistic Moon said that</a> its intention has not been to alter the events of the game, but to give it instead a "cinematic update" while also offering players a "more intimate experience" through the enhanced visuals. Remade entirely in Unreal Engine 5, Until Dawn has updated character models, environments, interactable props, visual effects, and animations alongside artistic changes to create a more-atmospheric horror story.</p><p>You can also expect the game to be more gruesome, as the developer says modern pre-rendering simulation techniques have allowed it to create "realistic real-time fluids" and more convincing injuries for the cast.</p><p>The one big change that players can expect is a reworked prologue, as Ballistic Moon has made adjustments to the narrative pacing of the game's opening to give specific characters more screen time. There'll also be new collectibles to discover in the form of Hunger Totems--these add extra context and detail to the world of Until Dawn--and there'll be a range of accessibility settings to tinker with.</p><p>October is shaping up to be the month of horror-game-remake showdowns, as Until Dawn will be launching mere days before Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-release-date-revealed-in-new-trailer/1100-6523824/" data-ref-id="1100-6523824">Silent Hill 2 arrives on October 8</a>.

A full list of these interviews can be found </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbgamedev.com/dev-insights">here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you can follow my </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/cbGameDev">Twitter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to find out when new ones are released!</span></p><p>Some of the Rekindled team at Develop Brighton in the UK  (Left to right: Liam Lambert, Yogi Patel, Rob Moody)</p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduce yourself / Rekindled"><span>Introduce yourself / Rekindled</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hey! My names </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmoody11/">Rob Moody</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I’m a ‘hands-on’ lead animator and co-founder at Rekindled Studios! I’ve been in the games industry for almost 15 years now working on a numbers of projects from indie to AAA.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our studio, Rekindled, was established over 2 and a half years ago (wow time flys!) by myself and a technical animator, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smaracle/">Siobhan Maracle</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rekindled is an animation and character art house specialising in game project development. We love working co-development contracts and integrating ourselves with different studios, ranging from large AAA studios where we become an extension of their team, to working with small indie studios where we take on the entire character art or animation pipeline for the project!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="What made you want to start your own animation outsourcing studio?"><span>What made you want to start your own animation outsourcing studio?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Myself and Siobhan have worked with each other for 7 or 8 years now in multiple studios across many projects and the last large studio we worked at kind of ran out of internal work so they started hiring us out. We really enjoyed the idea of being mercenary artists, getting to meet lots of new devs, working on different styles, learning new pipelines and tools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Siobhan and I worked well as a little unit, Siobhan being a technical animator (the brains) and myself an animator (the creative) were able to collaborate and take on any issue or feature. And after a few years, we thought we could do this on our own and be able to choose cool projects and teams to work with, so we did! And Rekindled was born.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="How did you choose who to team up with initially?"><span>How did you choose who to team up with initially?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was myself who first had the idea to set up a studio, but I knew I couldn’t do it on my own. I struggle with admin, I tend to do first, think later and I’m kind of scatter brained, so luckily for me Siobhan didn’t take too much convincing. She has a very logical brain which keeps the company on track. A good analogy is that in Rekindled I have my foot down on the accelerator while Siobhan is pulling up the handbrake, resulting in the studio moving at a nice steady pace!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of splitting up the workload of running the studio, I take on a lot of the introductions and client-side meetings whereas Siobhan likes to run the back end and support the studio. We both get to spend the majority of time doing what we love though, developing and animating. As for the most important skill, I’d have to say that it is communication. We talk everything over in the highs and the lows, being 100% transparent and seeking guidance from another perspective.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="What are the biggest challenges and how do things differ from what you expected?"><span>What are the biggest challenges and how do things differ from what you expected?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the biggest challenges so far have been growing the studios team size and then managing more projects. We started off as a 2 man band and quickly felt the need for an extra pair of hands to cope with demand. Initially, I assumed that bringing on some extra animators to help out would make things easier, and at first it did! We had more skills at hand, more bandwidth and more brains to bounce ideas off. It wasn’t until a couple of months later we realised that we didn’t have a clue how to manage a bigger studio. Keeping employees engaged and tasked up, resulted in working with more studios and more slack servers to track. We were remote only, Discord was our office and we didn’t have regular meetings set up or syncs, everything was kind of adhoc. We were still working it out and as a result, we felt that people felt quite isolated and a little lost. To combat this we now have 2 syncs a day, a short 15-minute discipline sync in the morning and a larger all-studio sync at the end of the day. On top of that, we have two scheduled animation reviews with the team, allowing team members to prepare ahead of time which streamlines the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another challenge as of late has been getting the word out that we also offer character art! </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogipatel3d/">Yogi Patel</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> joined us this year to set up a character art team allowing us to offer the full end-to-end pipeline from character art through rigging to animation. It’s something we have always wanted to have in place at Rekindled. The challenge is that we are currently known as an animation studio but we are hoping that by 2025 we can show that we are more!</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Is there anything you would do differently if you started again?"><span>Is there anything you would do differently if you started again?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being honest, I’m not sure I’d do anything differently again. Life is a journey, you learn a lot from mistakes and ventures into the unknown. The biggest unknown for us was the business side, we had animation down to a T, happily working on different exciting ideas and pushing boundaries…. However, we were complete noobs at running a business. Learning what a good contract looks like, NDAs, licences, pensions, accountants, corp tax etc. It was a steep learning curve! But very rewarding.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Any resources you think would help people build their own outsourcing studio?"><span>Any resources you think would help people build their own outsourcing studio?</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are many resources that help small businesses navigate their adventures. We’d really recommend using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wearecreative.uk/support/creative-enterprise/">CreativeUKs courses</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, they run 4 a year, each one aimed at helping studios at different stages of their progression. From foundations for entrepreneurs just starting out, to scaling up a business, then investment-ready businesses. The courses are very affordable, £250 per studio the rest is subsidised by the government and you are in a cohort of like-minded business owners. We completed the scaling up module and as part of the course we met Rebecca from YellowJumper who was assigned as a business mentor for us. This was a fantastic bonus, and worth its weight in gold. I’d highly recommend it to any games industry small business owner.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Where to find more about yourself / Rekindled"><span>Where to find more about yourself / Rekindled</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If anyone wanted to find out more about Rekindled or its services head over to our website: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rekindled.uk/">https://www.rekindled.uk/</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or check us out on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rekindledstudios/">LinkedIn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve also come to learn that networking really is the superpower that everyone in the games industry needs so please feel free to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robmoody11/">reach out to me on Linked-in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> if you wish to chat!

<p>This collaboration means players can now bedeck their little space beans with a number of items worn by those intrepid members from Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, or Bells Hells. I am talking about Artagan's Incredible Brows Visor or the Dust of Deliciousness Nameplate, to name but two.</p>
<p>"Getting to work alongside the wonderful crew of the hit TTRPG show Critical Role to bring some of their magic to Among Us for Gilmore's Curious Cosmicube has been mind blowing," <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/announcing-among-us-x-critical-role/">InnerSloth</a> said.

<p>This collaboration with Critical Role comes ahead of cast member <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animated-show-casts-sus-stars-including-ashley-johnson-and-elijah-wood">Ashley Johnson's role as "Purple" in the upcoming Among Us animated series</a>.</p>
<p>We first got word of this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-sci-fi-social-deduction-is-getting-the-animated-adaptation-treatment">Among Us adaptation last year</a>. On its announcement, we were given a general overview that read: "Members of your crew have been replaced by an alien shapeshifter intent on causing confusion, sabotaging the ship, and killing everyone. Root out the 'Impostor' or fall victim to its murderous designs."</p>
<p>Since then, famous faces such as Elijah Wood, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-animation-cast-rounded-out-with-jurassic-park-ratatouille-talent">Wayne Knight</a> and, of course, Johnson have been announced as voicing various crewmembers.</p>
<p>Back in February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/among-us-teases-upcoming-animated-series-with-blood-splattered-pizza-party-image">InnerSloth and CBS Studios shared a small teaser for the animated series</a> with an image showing an empty cafeteria with pizzas and balloons adorned by a banner that read: "We're not dead". Well, actually, it said "We're dead", thanks to an ominous splatter of blood down the middle of the banner.</p>
<p>Hmm, seems sus.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"We had a really hard time at the studio during Covid."</p>

    </div><div>



            
<p>
Satirical space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-announced">announced back in 2021</a>. Since then, we've heard nary a peep about it, with developers Obsidian focusing on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars Of Eternity</a> successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and their ace <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grounded">Grounded</a>, which left early access in September 2022. According to Obsidian's studio head Feargus Urquhart, the project is rubbing along nicely. But it was not ever thus: during the opening years of the Covid pandemic, there was apparently "talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
That's from a new, hour-long interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADkKzjY6j7Y">Limit Break Network</a>, in which Urquhart talks about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">this year's Xbox studio closures and layoffs</a>, the trick to retaining talent, the influence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and (as is mandatory for an Obsidian interview nowadays) the pipedream of making sequels for Alpha Protocol and Fallout: New Vegas.
</p>
<p>
"It's going really well," Urquhart said of Outer Worlds 2. "And it's always easy for us to say that, because that's what we should say, when asked the question, but it actually is. I'm really impressed with the team." While Avowed remains the priority, of course, Obsidian have apparently built "a pretty good wall  - not a wall, it's a semi-porous membrane" between that project and Outer Worlds 2 in terms of managing creative input and resources. I am inevitably picturing a web of mucus dividing the office, with Spacer's Choice branding on one side and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-really-pushed-avowed-as-a-co-op-rpg-pivoted-to-single-player-in-eight-months">mushroom bears</a> on the other.
</p>
<p>
"Luckily, the lead programmer is the same lead programmer, Leonard Boyarsky is the same creative director, Brandon Adler's game director, Matt Singh was a tester on Fallout: New Vegas, and he's the head of gameplay and content," Urquhart added. "So we were very lucky that we have a lot of people on that game that get it, that worked on the first one and worked with us for a very long time."

<p>
Nonetheless, it sounds like it was touch and go for Outer Worlds 2 during the pandemic lockdowns. "We had a really hard time at the studio during Covid," Urquhart said. "We got acquired [in 2018], and we were figuring out how to be acquired, and then Covid happens, and we're trying to get Outer Worlds done, and we're trying to get the DLC done, and we're trying to move Avowed forward, and we want to start again on Outer Worlds 2, get Outer Worlds 2 moving, and Grounded moving, and Josh [Sawyer] is working on Pentiment... 
</p>
<p>
"There's just all this stuff happening, and to be honest, we were kind of a crappy developer for about a year and a half," he went on. "There was talk of 'do we stop Outer Worlds 2 and just throw the whole team on Avowed'. There was talk of 'well, should you do that?', because Grounded wasn't in Early Access yet during some of these conversations." (The implication here, I think, is that Obsidian also thought about reassigning Outer Worlds 2 personnel to Grounded.)
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Obsidian decided to stay the course, while embracing the prospect of delays (Avowed was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-release-delayed-into-2025-to-dodge-a-busy-season-on-game-pass-claims-report">pushed back to 2025</a>, albeit seemingly to avoid a "busy period" on Microsoft's Game Pass service). "We kind of said: no, we will get there," Urquhart recalled. "We will get there with all these games. Are they going to be on the timelines that we originally thought? No. But we're going to get there and I think that's been proven now. 
</p>
<p>
"Grounded turned out awesome. Pentiment turned out awesome. Avowed is going to be great. Outer Worlds 2 is looking incredible. And then we have a base now, of everything we've now done with Avowed and Outer Worlds 2, with how we use Unreal Engine and all the tools that we've been developing for years and years, to go off and make the whole next generation of games."
</p>
<p>
It's worth considering these thoughts alongside Urquhart's comments earlier in the interview about the dark art of juggling several projects. Amongst other things, he highlights the importance of "working with" third-party tools such as Unreal Engine rather than trying to create too much bespoke technology.
</p>
<p>
I wasn't that keen on the first Outer Worlds: I found its chortling satirical elements self-indulgent, and its RPG design too familiar. But I share Alice Bee's (RPS in peace) view that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-pc-review">"it could have been great, if it had taken a few more risks"</a>. Hopefully, Outer Worlds 2 will bring it home. As for Avowed, I'm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-combat-wasnt-ready-to-show-at-reveal-obsidian-admit-but-theyve-made-it-feel-more-juicy-since">mixed on what I've seen of that too</a>, but I've been thinking lately that it's been a while since I last fireballed a mushroom bear. Fingers crossed it sticks the landing as well.

            <p>Valve is making some changes to written store page descriptions on Steam.</p>
<p>Starting in "early" September, the Steam team (the dream team's lesser known cousin) will be "enforcing new rules for what can and cannot be included in your written store page descriptions".</p>
<p>These changes are coming into force due to a recent "trend", as Valve describes it, that has seen a number of developers using their store page descriptions as a platform to "present information or links" to other places.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Wishlisted - Our 10 Best Steam Next Fest Demos!" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8s5QBMYRRUQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>It specifically said that developers had been using descriptions as a way of advertising other store pages on Steam, in some cases with as many as eight other games mentioned within the text before it got to the game the page is actually about. Valve said this can be distracting.</p>
<p>These changes to the current Steam rules will affect four specific areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "About The Game" section</li>
<li>the "Short Description" section</li>
<li>Any "Special Announcement" sections</li>
<li>The "Awards" section</li>
</ul>
<p>There will still be a section with dedicated link fields on store pages, for the likes of Discord, Facebook, X, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, YouTube and a developer's own website. Valve said developers can also highlight other games they make by <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/bundles">creating bundles</a> of related games, setting up a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/franchise_pages">franchise page</a> or by setting up a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/creator_homepage">developer/publisher page</a> with all the games made by the same entity.</p>
<p>Valve also wanted to help reduce confusion around games with a 'prologue' label. "We've seen developers doing novel things on Steam to help build an audience through a separate app that most call a 'prologue'. In these examples, developers are buying a secondary appID and releasing it as a stand-alone free game to promote the upcoming release of their full premium game," it explained. "This has been fine with us, but we've seen a few ways that it causes confusion for players and unnecessarily requires devs to pay a second app fee."</p>
<p>Valve continued: "With a few changes to how demos work, we can replicate the positive benefits of a separate 'prologue' while also creating a tighter connection between the two entities so that customers are clear on how to learn more about the full game and to wishlist the correct thing.</p>
<p>"The changes already made to demos should make it unnecessary for developers to purchase a separate appID to use for prologues, and can instead use the demo appID that is already associated with their game."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>In another change, Steam now has a separate 'Trending Free' tab, as you can see in our screenshot below.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/simoncarless/status/1823565448656642433">GameDiscoverCo founder Simon Carless</a>, this change has been made in response to "complaints of 'free demos are stomping on paid games in the New &amp; Trending charts'".</p>

            <p>Valve have made no secret of their plans to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steamos">SteamOS</a> – the Linux-based operating system that powers the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – available to other games-playing devices, including rival handhelds. After a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">recent beta update</a> mentioned adding support for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">Asus ROG Ally</a>’s inputs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">The Verge</a> confirmed with Valve that SteamOS support for non-Steam Deck portables is still very much in the works. The Deck’s long-promised dual booting capability, on the other hand, sounds further down the to-do list.</p>

<p>"The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS", Valve engineer Lawrence Yang told The Verge. "The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS".</p>
<p>While Yang also warns that this third-party support "isn’t ready to run out of the box yet", it’s likely a comforting development for those who crave the Deck-beating performance of its big rivals – the ROG Ally, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-x-review">ROG Ally X</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> and so on – but don’t fancy their preference for Windows 11. Which is understandable, as unpleasantness abounds when trying to wrestle a desktop-optimised operating system with a tiny touchscreen and thumbsticks. The ability to run more of your PC games collection without SteamOS’s occasional compatibility trip-ups is a compelling one, though even the most basic Steam Deck can work around this, be it through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">streaming games from the cloud</a> or manually installing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-and-use-lutris-on-the-steam-deck">non-Steam launchers</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there also exists a contingent of Steam Deck owners/admirers who’d like to dual boot their handheld with both SteamOS and Windows. Best of both worlds, innit. Unfortunately, this feature sounds even further off than the spread of SteamOS, despite being floated as a possibility back when the Deck first launched. So sayeth Yang:</p>
<p>"As for Windows, we’re preparing to make the remaining Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED available (you might have seen that we are prepping firmware for the Bluetooth driver). There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support – it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet."</p>
<p>Booo. You can already bodge a form of dual-booting, by installing Windows on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> and booting from that, though being able to keep both on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s SSD</a> will first require an indeterminate amount of thumb-twiddling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
