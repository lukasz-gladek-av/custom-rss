            <p>
Developer Full Circle has shared a fresh update on the next Skate game. While there is still no release date, the team has laid out several tweaks and additions coming to the series, many of which have been developed alongside feedback from various play tests. 
</p>
<p>
First off, the upcoming free-to-play game has a rebuilt Flick-It system in place. The developer said this will ensure each trick "feels as fun and satisfying to perform as ever before".
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this rebuild, in which added upgrades improve a player's accuracy and control, tricks in Skate should be easier than ever. "All of this work has been done with an eye to the future, so we can give the game plenty of room to grow as we add new tricks and techniques down the line," said senior gameplay designer Reid Buckmaster. Additionally, Skate will have a "streamlined" control system, which should make things easier for players to get to grips with.

<p>
Full Circle said while Skate will be fun to play solo, it is best experienced with others, and as such the team is including a number of 'social' features such as collaborative Pop-Up activities. 
</p>
<p>
There are also going to be a number of customisation options, with Full Circle confirming "almost everything" players do in the game will earn awards, which can then be used to change up characters and boards. These awards will also unlock placeable objects that can be popped into the world. 
</p>
<p>
As for its character creator, the team said it is bringing "as many options" as it can to the game, to allow for a more inclusive experience. This includes body shape, height, hairstyles and more. This is so Skate's players can "feel free to be whoever [they] want to be in San Van".

<p>
Ahead of Skate's release, the team is going to keep listening to its community's feedback. As such, it is encouraging more players to sign up to its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">Skate Insider program</a>. It confirmed console testing is scheduled for this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC and mobile. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">everything shown at the Xbox Showcase last night</a>: one of the best summer preview events in recent years, and one of Microsoft's best ever. </p>
<p>On the one hand, perhaps the trove of upcoming titles should be expected. After all, this is what you <em>should</em> get when you spend nearly $100bn buying up swathes of the games industry. On the other, well, Microsoft has seemed to perenially exist on promising that <em>next</em> year's crop of first-party games will finally be where its acquisition spree pays off, where Game Pass truly hits the big time, and where it at last starts clawing back some market share. </p>
<p>After watching the avalanche of announcements last night (Doom! Gears! Perfect Dark!) alongside everything else we knew was coming (Fable! Indy! More Diablo!) it's hard to see how the next 12 months couldn't make an impact - let alone the boost of launching Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 into Xbox Game Pass. Could Xbox finally feel like it's hitting its stride this console generation, after numerous misfires? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/2006-03-20-yet-another-microsoft-portable-media-gaming-device-rumor.html">extremely long-standing rumors</a> regarding Microsoft making a portable game console got a strong shot in the arm over the weekend from none other than Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Speaking on stage as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbYl4_y7N14">part of an IGN Live interview</a>, Spencer said directly that "I think we should have a handheld, too."</p>
<p>The comment stops just short of an official announcement that Microsoft is actively working on portable gaming hardware for the first time. But if anyone is in a position to make an "I think we should..." into an operational reality, it's Spencer.</p>
<p>"The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome," Spencer continued during the IGN presentation. "And the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862655/microsoft-xbox-handheld-editorial-steam-deck">Previous insider reports</a> suggested that Microsoft had at one point prototyped a cloud-focused Xbox handheld sporting a new "lightweight version" of the Xbox UI. Speaking to IGN, though, Spencer suggested any potential portable Xbox would not be a modified version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the streaming-only PlayStation Portal</a>.
</p><p>"I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck," Spencer said. "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<h2>We’ve heard it before?</h2>
<p>If Spencer's mention of "different form factors" sounds familiar, that's probably because he said something almost identical <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">back in February</a> when he told Bloomberg that he "get[s] excited about different form factors that allow people to play in different places." Around the same time, Spencer told the Verge that he was looking at unorthodox ways that Xbox could potentially capture more "player hours," saying:
</p><blockquote><p>So, OK, what keeps people from playing certain hours? Well there’s some sleep, school, and kind of normal life, but some of it is just access. Do I have access to the games that I want to play right now? Obviously we’re kind of learning from what Nintendo has done over the years with Switch, they’ve been fantastic with that. So when I look at Steam Deck and the ROG and my Legion Go, I’m a big fan of that space.</p></blockquote>

<p>Comments like these are a big change from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">internal Microsoft documents that leaked last September</a>, which listed an Xbox portable as a "current gap in FY23" that is "not in scope for 1st party" (alongside potential products like a mobile controller, earbuds, and a media remote). But Spencer was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/xbox-exec-says-leaked-old-emails-and-documents-have-outdated-info/">quick to call that leak "outdated"</a> at the time, so it might not be the last word on Microsoft's portable gaming plans.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2020, former Chief Xbox Officer Robbie Bach <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/microsoft-never-made-handhelds-reason/">said</a> that his tenure—which ended in 2010—included "at least three groups that presented portable Xbox presentations... All three times, we decided not to do it." That feels like ancient history, though, in a world where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">everyone</a> and their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/new-steam-deck-competitor-lets-you-easily-swap-in-more-ram-storage/">corporate subsidiary</a> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/no-one-needs-this-cryptocurrency-powered-steam-deck-competitor/">looking</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">draft</a> off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the market success of the Steam Deck</a>. And if Spencer gets his heart's deepest wish, it seems like Microsoft might be joining them before too long.</p>

                <p>Full Circle, the team behind the highly anticipated Skate reboot, has shared some new information about what players can expect upon its release. This includes a new way to use the iconic Flick-it system, a new approach to soundtracks, and lots of customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">Senior gameplay designer Reid Buckmaster explained in a development update that the studio has "done a ton of work rebuilding Flick-it to ensure that every trick feels as satisfying to perform as ever." Buckmaster explained that the new system will accurately help players perform more-difficult tricks and is meant to be fun and satisfying for everyone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_877568xsPg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_877568xsPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As the video continued, gameplay software engineer Lance Lawson stated the team has been pushing the limits of the Frostbite engine and has been able to add various new tricks. These include Slappies, Boned Ollies, Quick-Pop Ollies, Wallies, Improved Power Slides, Enhanced Transitions, Pre-Wind Spins, Roll-Ins, Grind Bump-Outs, and Smoother Flip Tricks.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can fully take advantage of San Vansterdam (in-game location) by placing objects where they want via Quick Drops. As they progress through the game, they can unlock various items, including customizations for their character, board, and even new objects to place around the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Another interesting feature that was mentioned during the development update is that the game will be ever-changing. New parts of the city will be added from season to season, and the music will update based on which songs players are listening to the most. Near the end of the video, it was revealed that console players will be able to get their hands on Skate a bit early by signing up to be playtesters this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Skate content, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-everything-we-know-about-the-skate-reboot/1100-6505591/">our story detailing everything we know so far</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Slug Tactics - Official Gameplay Features Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each playable character can move and shoot in the same turn, and staying on the move grants an important damage reduction modifier that will be essential to staying alive. Each character sports a basic weapon with unlimited ammo, as well as a more-powerful secondary weapon that has limited shots. Ammo for secondary weapons can be replenished by completing specific objectives. Attacking an enemy while another friendly squad member is within striking distance will activate a Sync attack, described as one of the key ways players will be able to dominate the battlefield and maximize the amount of damage they can do each turn.</p><p dir="ltr">By running, gunning, and completing Sync actions, squad members will build up Adrenaline, which can be used to activate powerful special abilities unique to each character. Of course, it wouldn't be a Metal Slug game without the titular armored vehicle, and players will be able to pilot various vehicles, including the Metal Slug, over the course of the game. The Slug uses fuel as a resource, but can attack multiple times as long as it has the required fuel. Fallen squad members can be revived with a 1up token, but players only have a limited number of reinforcements over the course of each set of missions, with more able to be acquired by completing various objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug Tactics, developed by Leikir Studio and published by Dotemu, is slated to release in Fall 2024 on Steam for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p data-characters="223" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Thanks to her ability to deal high Liberation damage, offer a 38% Resonance Skill DMG Deepen buff, and her title as the game’s only shielder, Taoqi can be a great addition to a wide array of teams in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">But who can benefit the most from her buff? And more importantly, which weapon and Sonata should you pick to potentialize her strengths? For all looking to awaken her true potential as a defensive support, here’s the best Taoqi build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">The best weapons for Taoqi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-best-weapons-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">As Taoqi’s whole kit scales off Defense, the best weapon for her is the 4-star <strong>Dauntless Evernight</strong>. The weapon earns the spot given its 61.56% DEF substat (at level 90). When using the broadblade, you will also be able to get another 15% boost in the stat by performing her Intro Skill (R1). Using the 4-star Discord can also work, as its Energy Regen value will increase her Liberation availability. </p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Dauntless Evernight is also my main F2P pick for Taoqi, as you can find a free copy of it within the Port City of Guixu. The free copy of the weapon will only become available after you complete the We Promise, We Deliver quest. You can check out its exact location in our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-all-free-5-and-4-star-weapons-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to get all free 5 and 4-star weapons in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> guide.</a> For F2P players looking to get an extra boost in ER, the craftable 4-star Broadblade#41 will be my main pick. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-taoqi" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Taoqi</h2> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Taoqi is a full <strong>Moonlit Clouds</strong> set. The set shines through its ability to provide a handy amount of ER and further empower her Outro Skill by adding a 22.5% ATK buff to it. As Taoqi’s ability to constantly self-heal will allow you to always proc its buff, a full Rejuvenating Glow set will be my main alternative. </p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">When using Moonlit Clouds, the best main echo for Taoqi is Impermanence Heron. The echo is a must, as it will allow you to offer a 12% all-damage boost to the character taking the field after her. I recommend that you pair our main pick with two Elites and two Common echoes. If using Rejuvenating Glow, go with Bell-Borne Geochelone as your main.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-stats-and-substats" data-injectable="false">Best stats and substats</h3> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">As the focus of our build lies in both strengthening her shield and allowing her to deal good damage, I recommend going with Crit Rate as the main stat for your main echo. For the remaining ones, go with pairs of Havoc DMG Bonus and DEF. </p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">When using any weapon but Dauntless Evernight, replace one of your Havoc DMG Bonus echoes with a DEF one to make sure her shield will offer enough protection. Substat-wise, prioritize Crit Rate, DEF, and Energy Regen. Don’t overlook ER, as having at least 130% will allow you to perform her Liberation without worry on every rotation. </p>

However, those looking to potentialize her should prioritize getting her first node sequence, Essense of Tranquility. Once active, the node will increase the HP of each shield instance generated by her Timed Counters by 40%. Her second node will also add a lot by increasing the Crit Rate and DMG of her Resonance Liberation by 20%. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-teams-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Best teams for Taoqi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">The best team for Taoqi features her as its defensive support, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-danjin-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Danjin</a> as its main DPS, and either <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-verina-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verina</a> or<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Baizhi</a> as its healer. Overall, Taoqi feels handmade for Danjin, as the latter can both perform her Skill at no cooldown and buff her biggest sources of damage with a 23% Havoc DMG Deepen boost. Even if they won’t be able to make use of her buff half as well, Taoqi is also a good fit for teams featuring either<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-yinlin-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Yinlin</a> or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calcharo </a>in the main DPS slot.</p>
 <h3 id="h-how-to-play-taoqi" data-injectable="false">How to play Taoqi</h3> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">Taoqi is most at home when working as a quick swap support focused on performing her Intro Skill, as many Timed Counters as possible, her Liberation, her Echo Skill, and her Outro Skill in quick succession. If using her together with Danjin, don’t forget to also fit in Rocksteady Shield for an extra layer of protection. </p>

After last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-look-reveals-companions-and-fan-favourite-returning-character">cinematic trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard which detailed the game's full suite of seven companion characters</a>, today brings our first - albeit very brief - glimpse at actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
A short clip shared to social media platform X shows series regular Varric in Minrathous, capital of the Tevinter  Imperium region, a location we have heard plenty about - but never seen before in a mainline Dragon Age game.

<p>
Varric is hot on the tail of Solas following the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, though I imagine things won't be as easy as he makes out here. Minrathous, meanwhile, or the quick glimpse we get of it, looks suitably grim. I'm getting dark Ankh Morpork vibes.

<p>The footage, and an accompanying press release, confirms The Veilguard's player character will be named Rook. </p>
<p>"Dragon Age: The Veilguard features some of the deepest companion storylines in Dragon Age history, navigating romance, tragic loss and complex choices that will affect relationships with players and the fate of The Veilguard," said creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>"BioWare's storytelling roots shine through every chapter of this adventure, and we are incredibly excited for Dragon Age fans as well as those new to the series to experience this crafted, character-driven narrative that is so intertwined with our studio's DNA."</p>
<p>
We'll see much more of Dragon Age: The Veilguard tomorrow in BioWare's big gameplay reveal livestream. That's set for 4pm UK time - and you'll be able to watch it right here on Eurogamer.

That roadmap currently runs through four seasons, each with a new playable character, a new playable environment, and additional activities, skins, and balance updates. <em>Suicide Squad</em> is currently finishing the first episode of season 1 with a second episode expected to drop soon, but Rocksteady Games hasn’t been clear about the timing, or if future seasons will last just as long. </p><figure id="" data-id="b33f8b705b23438f62387a40d23aa6e1" data-recommend-id="image://b33f8b705b23438f62387a40d23aa6e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1263" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Promotional art shows Suicide Squad's first year of contact.

                <p dir="ltr">I hate small talk. I don't feel I'm any good at it. I don't want to engage in it. I practically run from it if I see it coming. But I love talking about big ideas, especially philosophy. Quite obviously, that makes me annoying. I admit it. People minding their own business in a casual setting may feel assaulted by my unprovoked diatribes about Nagel's concept of moral luck, humankind's supposed dominion over other animals, or the virtues of a restorative justice system. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-philosopher-2-governments-and-grievances/" data-ref-id="5000-591162">Pro Philosopher 2: Governments and Grievances</a>, everyone in my personal life can enjoy a reprieve from my ceaseless desire to debate and discuss topics like these as I work to beat this game instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Pro Philosopher 2 (PP2) is modeled closely after the Ace Attorney series but recontextualizes Capcom's art style and mechanics to focus on philosophical debates rather than pit players in a court drama. Here you don't present evidence that refutes the claims being spoken from the witness stand; you find holes in the arguments of your verbal sparring partner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBrzfQsnmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tFBrzfQsnmQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first game, which focused on moral philosophy specifically, is on Steam for free following a debut on Kongregate years ago that earned it some cult praise. I came to the series with the upcoming second game, which very pointedly focuses on political philosophy this time around. Because if there's one thing gamers love, it's politics in their games.</p><p dir="ltr">Jokes aside, Pro Philosopher 2 is made for people like me who sincerely <em>do</em> feel that way--and it's also self-aware enough to take digs at itself in the demo I played. The game supposes a metaphysical realm in which you have access to numerous philosophers from world history and you can attempt to unravel their worldviews. In the demo, which is available for a limited time as part of Steam Next Fest starting today, you'll get to take on Machiavelli, author of The Prince, whose might-makes-right philosophy still lingers in our real world all too often today.</p><p dir="ltr">It serves as a strong introduction to the game, because not only will you get to learn the ropes of the game's debate mechanics--in which you ask clarifying and backing questions before challenging your opponent's perspective armed with their own words--but it also quickly becomes obvious how relevant these centuries-old points of view still often are--for better or worse. For those interested in the subject matter but perhaps not as well-versed in it, the game even feels like a strong introduction to the material.</p><p dir="ltr">In my demo level, I had to carefully dissect Machiavelli's words to try and prove why it actually <em>isn't </em>better for a leader to be feared than loved. There were often many wrong answers and few right ones, and each wrong answer would damage my credibility rating like a health bar, which I find to be an awesomely creative way to transpose a debate into a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">The game pairs its Ace Attorney-like 2D cartoonish art with a serious understanding of the subject matter, but even then it doesn't take itself too seriously. When I initially failed to beat Machiavelli in the demo, the characters discussed how it might not be a strong first impression with which to sway me into buying the game, all in a very fourth-wall-breaking manner. And during the course of any debate, you're armed with a secret, albeit ineffective, weapon: You can simply tell your rival they stink. Literally. You can use the "you stink!" reply to resort to the debate tactics of a fourth-grader, and honestly, that's still seen pretty often in modern politics, so I think it's fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">Enjoying the demo for PP2 as much as I did, I'm now looking forward to the full game when it launches later this year, and in the meantime, I'm perhaps even more excited to go back to the first one and argue moral philosophy--which is really where I do my best annoy-everyone-around-me work. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120070/Pro_Philosopher_2_Governments__Grievances/" rel="nofollow ">try the demo for yourself for a limited time on Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120060/Socrates_Jones_Pro_Philosopher/" rel="nofollow ">download the original</a>, which is free.</p>

Mostly, it fills in some story and gameplay details about what each of those episodes will entail, because up until now, we only knew their names and the structure of how Bungie was arranging content going forward.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 | The Journey Ahead</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Episode 1: Echoes</h2><p dir="ltr">The first episode, Echoes, starts Tuesday, June 11, and deals directly with the aftermath of The Final Shape's conclusion. The Witness, Destiny 2's ultimate antagonist up until now, is defeated, but the paracausal energy it embodied isn't gone. Instead, it mixed with the Light of the Traveler to manifest weird artifacts from the Witness's memory, shooting them out into the solar system. The episodes all deal with the fallout of what those sources of power to do the worlds where they land and the people who find them, with the first one resulting in major shifts to Nessus.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie said that players will head to Nessus to find the echo and discover the location has been physically altered, with the Vex enemies there acting strangely. The episode comes with a new activity, Breach Executable, which Bungie described as an "arena-style offensive" in which you're trying to cap geysers of Radiolaria (otherwise known as "Vex milk") while holding off hordes of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525"></a><figcaption>Strange things are afoot inside Nessus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The episode is also going to take players deeper into Nessus to uncover secrets of what used to be there--including, apparently, a whole lost civilization. It looks like that will include more than just a few superficial changes to Nessus as it tells its story. Bungie also teased a new villain who might be behind what's happening with the Vex and said the Vex will exhibit new behavior, changing up how they act in battle.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 2: Revenant</h2><p dir="ltr">The second episode is Revenant, one that deals with Scorn leader Fikrul, otherwise known as the Fanatic. Bungie described the Episode as having a sort of "vampire-hunter" theme, and it'll heavily concern the Fallen, who are finally trying to establish a new permanent home since their own homeworld, Riis, was destroyed by the Witness. Bungie said you'll team up with the Fallen to become a Slayer Baron, essentially a Fallen monster hunter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528"></a><figcaption>Concept art for Revenant suggests armor inspired by the Scorn and the act of killing monsters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In practice, the vampire-hunter theme is informing the armor aesthetic--you look a lot like you're in Bloodborne or the movie Van Helsing. Fikrul also has a Dracula castle, so it sounds like we'll be Castlevania-ing our way through that. As for new gameplay, Bungie mentioned a potion-crafting system, where you'll be able to create potions that provide different combat buffs and influence what loot drops you receive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 3: Heresy</h2><p dir="ltr">The final episode, Heresy, concerns the Hive. The Final Shape saw Savathun standing as both an ally and an antagonist to the Guardians, and her sister, Xivu Arath, is still out in the universe somewhere as a potential threat. Bungie said the episode is going to shake up the existing relationships in the Hive god pantheon, which sounds ominous and potentially important for Destiny 2's future.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the relevant details of what's taking place: We're headed back to the Dreadnaught, the big Hive battleship that was introduced in Destiny's The Taken King expansion and has been kind of chilling in the orbit of Saturn ever since. It'll have an activity Bungie likened to The Coil from the Season of the Wish, although we don't have many details about how it'll actually work. Bungie referred to an "eldritch force" players will face aboard the Dreadnaught and showed off two armor sets--one that takes cues from resident Hive expert and former Hive god Eris Morn, and another that imagines being a navigator on the Dreadnaught. That last one has the flair of an 18th century officer's uniform from a European navy, but made out of bones.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Destiny 2 Year 11</h2><p dir="ltr">The last thing Bungie did was tease Destiny 2 content in 2025, although it provided precisely zero details about what that might entail. The final screen of the vidoc just listed the name "Codename: Frontiers" with the Destiny 2 logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523"></a><figcaption>Here is what we know about Year 11: this image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a couple things to intuit from that slide, at least. First, the use of the Destiny 2 logo might suggest that we're not in for a Destiny 3 anytime soon, despite some rumors to the contrary. To some degree, that make sense--with massive player investment in Destiny 2, rebooting the community in a whole new game has its risks, even if that might help Bungie deal with some of the current game's technical limitations.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the name, Codename: Frontiers might suggest expanding Destiny 2 beyond the solar system, where the game has taken place up until now. Before the original Collapse that kicked off the story and created the world we've been playing in, humanity was trying to expand beyond Sol and out into the rest of the universe, and it would make some sense for the story to go back to that direction, cleaning a lot of the slate for something new. But that's all speculative at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, we at least have a better understanding of where things are going from The Final Shape for the next year. Bungie didn't mention any new dungeons or raids among the episodes, but the Annual Pass that was made available with The Final Shape buys access to a dungeon, so we can expect at least one to pop up sooner or later, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/preview-pro-philosopher-2-is-ace-attorney-crossed-with-a-political-debate-club/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=preview-pro-philosopher-2-is-ace-attorney-crossed-with-a-political-debate-club<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="490" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In 2013, Intelligible Games released the <em>Ace Attorney-inspired</em> <em>Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher</em> for web browsers, where instead of catching murderers in over-the-top courtroom dramas, you debated with real-world philosophers from throughout history to deduce the true nature of morality. It saw a full remake on Steam in 2023 but, 10 years after the original, the same team is back with a proper sequel; one that shifts its focus towards that oh so favoured of topics among gamers: politics.</p> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Titled <em>Pro Philosopher 2: Governments &amp; Grievances</em>, I was able to test out a short demo ahead of its release as part of Steam Next Fest (it should be available for download by the time you’re reading this). And by short, I do mean short; you can easily clear it in 20 minutes. However, it does succinctly sum up what you can expect from the full game: interesting topics of debate, a fun sense of humour, and a lot of blatant similarities to <em>Ace Attorney</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="1077" data-current-count="1077" data-injectable="true">A part of me feels bad directly comparing <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> to Capcom’s visual novel series, but one look at it and you’ll see <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> doesn’t just wear the <em>Ace Attorney</em> influences on its sleeves; it’s dressed head to toe in them. Not only are its core gameplay mechanics functionally identical, but even aspects of its presentation borrow liberally from <em>Ace Attorney</em>. Characters have exaggerated reactions when taken by surprise, and they let out cries of “Nonsense!” during arguments, which have the same energy as Phoenix Wright’s iconic “Objection!”, right down to the word smacking into the screen in bold red letters. This may risk costing <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> any semblance of its own identity, but it’s clear these similarities come out of reverence for <em>Ace Attorney</em> and not a cynical attempt at copying it in the hopes of recreating its popularity. Plus, as a die-hard <em>Ace Attorney</em> fan myself, I can’t help but crack a smile at the ways <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> lifts elements from Capcom’s work.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intelligible Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="885" data-injectable="true">The thought of a game that requires you to engage in political debates and point out the flaws in each philosopher’s way of thinking sounds like a daunting and difficult task, but it’s easy to get to grips with if you’ve played even one <em>Ace Attorney</em> game. Instead of tangible evidence, you have an idea slate, which holds ideas and concepts you can use to challenge your opponent’s statements, no different to spotting contradictions in an <em>Ace Attorney</em> testimony. Challenging incorrectly will reduce your Credibility, and if that runs out it’s game over. </p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true"> It’s a very simple idea in practice and, much like how you can press for further testimony in <em>Ace Attorney</em>, you can ask for clarification if you think a specific statement is too vague, or ask your opponent to back up their claim with evidence. Doing these can result in new ideas for the idea slate or additional statements. There’s no punishment for using the Clarification and Backing options on every statement, which is perfect for the most cautious of players (you’ll also get some amusing dialogue out of it). And reaching the end of a statement earns you a slight hint on what to do should you be completely lost.</p>
 <p data-characters="727" data-current-count="727" data-injectable="true">I got to grips with the demo incredibly easily, but I have to imagine the full game will prove far more challenging. One extra gameplay mechanic is alluded to but isn’t featured in the demo, and given the very nature of the political debate and its complexities, there could be some real head-scratching puzzles that’ll leave more than a fair share of players stumped. It’s obviously too soon to tell how these will be handled, and whether the difficulty will be fairly balanced or not. At the very least, the <em>Ace Attorney</em>-esque presentation and fun banter between protagonist Ari and her fellow cast members should keep you engaged, and may even help you learn some new things about the history of politics.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Intelligible Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="740" data-current-count="1040" data-injectable="true"><em>Pro Philosopher 2</em>‘s slightly goofy sense of humour won’t be for everyone, but it definitely got some light chuckles out of me. Mostly from how it portrays actual philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli as this arrogant genius, regularly cracking a smug smile as he lords his superior intellect. Liberties are absolutely going to be taken with how these real-world figures are depicted, but it makes for an entertaining experience nonetheless. You also have the option during debates to just insult your opponent with a “You stink!,” which is designed to never work and cost you credibility. Yet I can see players using it anyway if only to see how each philosopher reacts to being dragged into your average Twitter argument.</p>
 <p data-characters="1132" data-current-count="1132" data-injectable="true">What will likely make or break <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em>, however, is exactly how it handles its choices of debate topics. Based on the demo, it fortunately doesn’t feel as if it will try and pursue a neutral stance throughout. Machiavelli argues in favour of blatant totalitarianism, believing a stable state of government is only possible with a single ruler in charge; one untethered by pesky morals. I like to think we can all agree that’s an awful idea, and it’s one Ari (and by extension the game and the development team) completely refute, but will this same approach be taken with future debates? What if the game requires the player to make an argument they fundamentally don’t agree with? Will <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> even broach the more controversial topics, or will it play things safe and stick to dismantling outdated or unpopular arguments that don’t hold water in the 21st century? It’s a tricky balancing act, though I’d rather see the game take at least some kind of stance instead of flaking out at the last minute and pulling some “all sides are equally valid” nonsense.</p>
 <p data-characters="948" data-current-count="948" data-injectable="false">Regardless, <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> is one to watch for anyone with an interest in visual novels, logic puzzles, and/or political discourse that doesn’t quickly devolve into hurling slurs at one another. It sounds like it’ll be a pretty meaty experience too, with it promising more philosopher opponents than the five its predecessor had, though an exact number hasn’t been confirmed. A couple of examples shown in trailers are 17th century Englishman John Locke (who looks delightfully foppish) and Chinese philosopher Confucius, so there’s already some decent variety to the kind of views that players will need to engage with. Mechanically, <em>Pro Philosopher 2</em> seems perfectly sound, and building a game all around political debate, especially in the current climate, is a gutsy decision I applaud Intelligible Games for making. I just hope it has actually interesting or insightful things to say about its various debate topics.</p>

These new features now live in the first-person shooter over two years after it launched aim to provide players with an easy way to report it.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/battlefield/battlefield-2042/voice-chat-moderation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s help page</a>, the company said voice chat moderation is used when reviewing reports of “harmful or offensive” voice chat, so its support teams can “action the reports appropriately.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s how it works: when you report a player, EA’s support team automatically receives a recording of the session you wish to report. Then, after evaluating the recording, the support team will make a decision according to EA’s Positive Play Charter and “enforce a solution.”</p><p>As outlined by EA, here’s how to report someone through Battlefield 2042’s Squad and Players list:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Open the Pause menu.</li><li>Choose Squad and Players.</li><li>Select the player’s name on the list.</li><li>Choose More.</li><li>If you want to report them, select Report.</li><li>Select Abusive Voice Chat.</li></ul><p>If you just want to block the player, follow the same steps above, select Block, and then confirm when you’re asked to. Blocked players are also muted for you in voice and text chat.</p><p>It’s worth noting that you can’t turn voice chat moderation off, but you <em>can</em> choose not to use voice chat when you play. EA said this is “to protect players.”</p><p>The expectation is this new voice chat moderation feature will be used in future Battlefield games. In April, EA announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-season-7-motive-connected-battlefield-universe">Battlefield 2042 Season 7 is officially its last</a>, with development of the Connected Battlefield Universe now in full swing. Battlefield general manager Byron Beede explained that it's time for the franchise to "turn from the present to the future." To that end, he said, EA would continue to support Battlefield 2042 with "in-game challenges, events, modes, and of course, ongoing maintenance," but would move away from a seasonal structure when Season 7 wraps up this month.</p><p>Season 7 marks the end of Battlefield 2042's comeback trail after its disappointing release back in 2021, which saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review"><u>fans and critics pan its 128-player matches and its Specialist system</u></a>, among other things. In the years since it has managed to rehabilitate its reputation somewhat, though it still sits at Mixed on Steam.</p><p>EA has a number of developers working on future Battlefield projects, including a team at Dead Space remake maker EA Motive, Ripple Effect, DICE, and Criterion.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Following the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a>'s massive (but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-may-update-causes-head-scratching-new-problems/1100-6523649/">rather underwhelming</a>) May update, Bethesda has just released version ​​1.12.30 of the game, known as the June update. Starfield's June update includes a number of features, including new missions, a new bounty-scanning mechanic, and the introduction of the Starfield Creation Kit for all modders (it was previously released for modders hand-picked by Bethesda).</p><p dir="ltr">Sadly, it seems that land vehicles--which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/land-vehicles-are-finally-coming-to-starfield-but-we-dont-know-when-theyll-arrive/1100-6523105/">Bethesda confirmed are in development</a> last month--still aren't on the menu (yet). Regardless, the update includes quite a few changes, quality-of-life improvements, and, of course, a good number of bug-fixes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiN5PDu400s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiN5PDu400s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Starfield Creation Kit is now available to all modders, and can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" rel="nofollow ">downloaded on Steam</a>. Players on all platforms can now access Creations, including unique new missions, gear, skins, and weapons, among other content. Creations can be accessed via the game's menu, and Bethesda has a special surprise for certain players: Anyone who ordered the Premium Edition of Starfield will find that 1,000 Creation Credits have been added to their account, free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Two new Tracker's Alliance missions have also been added. The first, called The Starjacker, puts players in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in various parts of The Settled Systems. The second mission, called The Vulture, is a Bethesda Game Studios Creation, meaning it can only be accessed via the Creations menu mentioned above. This new mission will cost real-life cash unless you happen to have received the aforementioned 1,000 Creation Credits for ordering the Special Edition version of Starfield. Both missions see players taking on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-summer-update-introduces-diy-bounty-hunting-new-creator-tools/1100-6523963/">serious bounty-hunting gigs</a> that can end in riches--or disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of bounty-hunting, Starfield's June update introduces a new "bounty scanner" mechanic, which enables players to seek out targets with active bounties on their heads, and dispose of them (or work things out without exchanging gunfire). Using the scanner function, players can now identify targets in crowds of NPCs. Wanted individuals will be highlighted in red, and scanning them directly will reveal their name, the crimes they're wanted for, and how many credits the player will earn for bringing them in.

The answer to that is…of course! It’s a learning process, just like everything else. It doesn’t happen overnight. I still remember when I didn’t even know the first thing about making video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But after some time passed and looking over certain resources again and again, everything started to fall into place…like a game of Tetris, where you have all those falling pieces left and right and must quickly rotate/guide them to those open gaps at the bottom. Your disability, whatever it may be, does not define you. You can be anything you set your mind to, and that includes making video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re all different. We do things differently, learn differently, and so on. As long as your heart is in the right place and making video games is your passion, you’ll be making video games in no time! I don’t know everything about making video games (and I never will), but I do know enough to build them from scratch for everyone to enjoy. Some people like my games…some do not, and that’s ok.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is actually one of the things you must be prepared for. Not everybody’s going to like what you make. Any obstacle that comes your way will always be overcome by your love and passion for making video games. It’s like they say: ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Where there’s a will, there’s a way</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’. Life is full of trial and error, especially when it comes to making video games. I make video games, and I have high-functioning autism.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That never stopped me from doing what I love. Don’t let it stop you. Do you have a disability? Do you want to make video games? If you’ve answered “yes” to both of these questions, I have one thing to say to you: Go for it! Just remember, if at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that we’ve spent some in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4’s</a> initial phase, it’s time to gear up for the mid-season update. Here’s when <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Reloaded releases, and what to expect.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-start" data-injectable="false">When does MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded start?</h2> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Based on the Battle Pass duration, <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 Reloaded is expected to come out on June 26, 2024. Although the date and timing have yet to be confirmed, it will likely debut at 9 a.m. PT/11 a.m. CST/12 p.m. EST.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">With the Reloaded patch, the update size should be a manageable amount of space, typically around 18 to 25 GB. A pre-load should be available the day before the launch to ensure you’re fully prepared. This way, you can dive right into the action as soon as it’s live.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-to-expect-in-mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded" data-injectable="false">What to expect in MW3 and Warzone Season 4 Reloaded </h2> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">The <em>MW3 </em>and <em>Warzone </em><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone-wzm-season-4-maps-modes-zombies-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4 roadmap</a> gives us a glimpse into what to expect for its Reloaded release. We’ll break down each category to give you an idea of upcoming features. </p> <h3 id="h-mw3-multiplayer-maps" data-injectable="false">MW3 Multiplayer maps</h3> <figure data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Multiplayer is set to introduce <strong>two new 6v6 core maps: Incline and Das Gross<em>.</em></strong> Incline will take you high above the mountains of Urzikstan in a medium-sized map, perfect for mid-range loadouts. And if that’s not enough, Das Gross will transform Das Haus into an alien nightmare, adding a whole new twist to your gaming experience.</p> <h3 id="h-mw3-game-modes" data-injectable="false">MW3 game modes</h3> <figure data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">Havoc mode returns in Season 4 to change up the classic dynamics of Team Deathmatch. You may remember this entry from <em>Modern Warfare 2’s </em>Season 5 launch, where you’ll be rewarded with various modifiers throughout the match. In particular, Operators can equip the Camera Shift ability to change to third-person mode.</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Another upcoming game mode will also unleash a new wave of Team Deathmatch content with Headshots Only. The challenge is pretty self-explanatory, in which players can only get kills when aiming for an Operator’s head.</p>
 <h3 id="h-mw3-zombies-unstable-rift" data-injectable="false">MW3 Zombies Unstable Rift</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-zombies-fans-slam-lackluster-season-4-content-worst-update-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not much is planned</a> for <em>MW3 Zombies, </em>as it only features one new challenge. Players can tackle the Unstable Rift Exclusion Zone to earn more rewards and wipe out hordes of zombies. The quest can be replayed as many times as you want, and weapon/schematic cooldowns will be refreshed each time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-warzone-weapons-and-events" data-injectable="false">Warzone weapons and events</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone’s </em>Season 4 Reloaded content has been shrouded in mystery, with a few updates garnering a ‘Redacted’ title. What we do know, however, is that rare weaponry will be available in Loot Hot Zones or Bunkers. The guns in question haven’t been revealed yet, so we’ll need to wait until more Reloaded information comes out. Plus, Bunkers will be receiving an update of their own, increasing enemy activity within its radius. </p>
 <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">Other than the exclusive weapons, the Runaway Train Public Event will begin during Season 4 Reloaded. Use the train to get around Urzikstan quickly, but be mindful of enemy Operators who also have the same goal in mind.</p> <h3 id="h-new-weaponry" data-injectable="false">New weaponry</h3> <figure data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-superi-46-loadout-for-mw3-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Superi 46</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KAR98K</a> have already become some of the most powerful guns in Season 4. However, Reloaded will introduce new weapons that could take over their spot. This includes the Reclaimer 18 Shotgun and Sledgehammer Melee Weapon. While Reclaimer 18 was previously shown in <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, the Sledgehammer is a brand-new weapon that packs a 20-pound head.</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="false">Other content will presumably arrive for Season 4 Reloaded, but for now, these are the confirmed features from the roadmap. We also can’t forget the upcoming Aftermarket Parts from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-season-4-week-1-weekly-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Challenges</a>, such as the Jak Volkh, Jak Thumber-656, and Jak Intimidator.</p>

In a “journey ahead” stream today, Bungie disclosed the first details on its plans for the rest of the year ahead with <em>Destiny 2</em> and even teased a 2025 release for new content that’s codenamed “Frontiers.”</p><p>Until Frontiers arrives next year, <em>Destiny 2</em> will continue with new episodes of story content that explore what’s happened after the conclusion of <em>The Final Shape</em>. <em>Destiny 2</em> players have just battled The Witness in the latest expansion, the main antagonist of&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s light and darkness saga, which has created what Bungie is calling echoes throughout the universe. </p><div><figcaption><em>Destiny 2 is getting loot potions.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bungie</cite></p></div><p>The first echo has landed on Nessus, which is why <em>Destiny 2</em> players have noticed earthquakes occurring on that planet over the weekend. Nessus is changing, and so are the Vex enemies that inhabit it, which <em>Destiny 2</em> players will start to discover this week as <em>The Final Shape</em> seasonal content begins with this first episode of stories. </p><p>Later in the year, the second echo, Revenant, will see the focus switch to the Fallen enemies, with <em>Destiny 2</em> players turning into vampire hunters that have craftable potions. After Revenant the final episode is Heresy, which will focus on the Hive pantheon enemies. And yes, we’re heading back to the dreadnought to see what’s changed with the Hive. There will even be armor that’s themed around Eris Morn, <em>Destiny</em>’s very own Hive lore expert.</p><p>After Heresy ends and year 11 of <em>Destiny 2</em> begins in 2025, a new “Frontiers” drop of content is on the way. “The journey continues,” teases Bungie. It’s not clear what storyline the Frontiers content will cover, but it doesn’t seem to be the big annual expansion that Bungie typically puts out for <em>Destiny 2</em>. Either way, Bungie is making it clear that <em>Destiny 2</em> isn’t going anywhere just yet, despite speculation over whether or not a <em>Destiny 3</em> is on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="G4PEix">One way to ensure that a favorite show or movie never disappears from streaming rotation? Buy a physical copy. On Monday, the animation distributor GKIDS announced that fans of Netflix’s <em>League of Legends</em> series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24026643/arcane-season-two-netflix-teaser-trailer-release-warwick-singed-riot-games"><em>Arcane</em></a> would soon have that chance, with Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray releases planned for later this year.</p>
<p id="59AXMA">While <em>Arcane</em> carved out backstories for known <em>League of Legends</em> characters Vi and Jinx, the animated series triumphed on Netflix thanks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22800666/arcane-season-1-review">a tenuous connection to known lore</a> and an emphasis on stylish action and dramatic character work. Produced by the French animation studio Fortiche for Riot Games, the series was a major hit for the streamer, clocking over 34 million hours of viewership in its first week. And based on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix">Netflix’s recent report of 2023 stats</a>, the series is <em>still</em> finding millions of viewers two years later as people wait and/or catch up ahead of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24081168/arcane-season-2-release-date-cast-news-league-legends-netflix"><em>Arcane</em> season 2</a>, due out in November. </p>

<p id="pf2jwY">Details are light on what GKIDS might pack into a physical release, but the initial announcement promises “a full product array later this year, ranging from digital to premium editions, including a 4K version exclusive to the home entertainment release.” But in a rare tone for a Blu-ray licensing agreement, the folks at GKIDS seem over the moon to be making a physical edition of the series possible. The news broke out of the Annecy International Animation Festival, where where the distributor also acquired rights to Science Saru’s anime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxXNtfIapqs"><em>Dan Da Dan</em></a><em> </em>and a 4K restoration of Mamoru Oshii’s masterpiece <em>Angel’s Egg</em>.</p>
<p id="o27YJN">“We are MONSTER fans of [<em>Arcane</em>],” said GKIDS founder and CEO Eric Beckman in a statement, “and our team is having a blast collaborating with the creatives at Riot and Fortiche to put together an amazing package for the fans. This project was dreamt up on the lawn by the lake at Annecy, so we are extra happy to be able to announce this collaboration at the festival and true home of animation.”</p>
<p id="RRBOgy">There’s no word on when <em>Arcane</em> season 1 will hit Blu-ray, but GKIDS promises more announcements to come later this year.</p>

While that’s an exciting prospect for longtime fans, the game has been mired in a bit of controversy as Square Enix has rolled out details about its release plans.<br></p><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Like previous games in the series, <em>Double Exposure </em>will be an episodic game. However, it won’t be rolling out periodically like the first few games did, and will instead follow <em>True Colors</em>’ format of releasing all the episodes at once. Well, with one catch. The game’s $80 Ultimate Edition will let you play the first two chapters on October 15, two weeks before the game’s October 29 release date. Fans are criticizing this decision (thanks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-criticise-30-upgrade-to-play-new-games-early-chapters-two-weeks-early" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span>) both because it’s incentivizing players to pay up for early access and because it will open up fans who can’t afford or don’t want to pay extra to spoilers for two weeks. The move would almost feel like an homage to the original game’s structure if it wasn’t also kinda gross.</p><p>“I feel like Square Enix locked this awesome feature behind a paywall,” upper_camel_case wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/1dc1d8g/no_spoilers_ultimate_edition_of_double_exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span>. “[Episodic releasing] made the original <em>Life Is Strange</em> such a great experience when it originally released. Now only the people who are willing to pay a lot of money for something they don’t know if it’s even good are going to be able to experience it. They are preying on the most devoted fans. Not nice.”</p><p>It’s clear Square Enix is banking on FOMO to get people to fork over the extra $30, as even their marketing copy on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874000/Life_is_Strange_Double_Exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span> highlights how this lets people be part of the discussion around Max’s latest story.</p><p>“Don’t miss your chance to join the conversation around this unforgettable supernatural murder mystery,” the Steam page reads.</p><p><em>Double Exposure </em>isn’t the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-starfield-diablo-iv-madden-1850831357">only video game in the world</a></span> that lets people pay more to play early, but two weeks is a much larger head start than these arrangements usually allow for. However, it does have the advantage of not being an online game like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> which had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-early-access-100-servers-down-batman-wb-1851207239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-early-access-100-servers-down-batman-wb-1851207239">server trouble during this early access period</a></span>, rendering it useless after all that money spent. The trade-off is that, inevitably, someone will get spoiled on those first two episodes because they can’t justify the cost. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-recommend-id="image://3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-recommend-id="image://3b77451fecb372b09d82a2c0d6c83fd9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Double Exposure Collector's Edition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On top of all this, <em>Double Exposure </em>is also falling into another tiresome modern video game release trend in that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/life-is-strange_-double-exposure-collector_s-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$60 “collector’s edition”</a></span> doesn’t actually contain a copy of the game. There’s some neat stuff in the package, including a vinyl soundtrack and artbook, but Square Enix’s store page puts in big red letters that the actual <em>Double Exposure</em> game is sold separately. If you want both this big box of goodies <em>and</em> to see Max’s next chapter unfold, you’ll have to fork over an extra $50 (or $80, if you want the early access). Honestly, a $110 collector’s edition isn’t even that expensive by modern standards, but the unnecessary obtuseness in how it’s sold is the issue. Collector’s Editions that are just boxes of swag that don’t include the game aren’t actually “editions” of the game at all.<br></p><p>Ultimately these are big company decisions separate from whether <em>Double Exposure </em>will be any good or not, but it’s not the best look for a game that’s clearly banking on fans’ love for the 2015 original. The <em>Life is Strange </em>series has become known for hopping between protagonists at this point and going back to Max is likely to draw back in old fans, so it’s a shame it has this weighing it down right out the gate. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bungie released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PYzMqhu3Fs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“journey ahead” trailer</a> today, announcing that Destiny 2 Codename Frontiers will arrive in 2025.</p>



<p>The trailer does not confirm an exact release date for Frontiers. Instead, it simply teases that “the journey continues.” So, that remains the biggest reveal for Year 11 today.</p>



<p>However, the new Destiny 2 trailer also reveals new footage for Year 10 episodes. These will include Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy. </p>



<p>Bungie showcased gameplay and concept art alongside developer narration. However, much of the footage added a disclaimer that it remains in-progress, and it is still subject to change.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Following a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delayed-to-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay that lasted months</a>, Bungie finally released Destiny 2’s The Final Shape DLC last week. It is the culmination of years of storytelling, an epic conclusion for the Light and Darkness saga.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, Sony itself appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-dlc-leaks-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak The Final Shape content early</a>, including the entire campaign. </p>



<p>The Final Shape DLC ultimately earned decent ratings, and currently holds a 7.2 user score on Metacritic. It adds new collections, weapons, story, and more.</p>



<p>Recent rumors from April 2024 suggest that Bungie could be working on Destiny 3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-possibly-developing-destiny-3-under-codename-payback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under the codename Payback</a>. Paul Tassi of Forbes commented on an old, notable post from Reddit, though Tassi did not confirm the rumor outright.</p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Bungie also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-destiny-cheat-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won a key lawsuit</a> against cheat provider Phoenix Digital.</p>

Now, a new Killing Floor 3 gameplay trailer has revealed a look at the upgraded Zeds that are awaiting gamers. These monstrous creations are several generations ahead of the Zeds seen in Killing Floor 2. This time, the Zeds are more heavily armed and they're also able to fight as an army instead of a mindless horde.</p><p>The trailer also reintroduces Mr. Foster and his Nightfall commandos as they attack an army depot that has been taken over by Zed forces. Mr. Foster even seems to revel in the opportunity to destroy these creatures.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Tripwire has set Killing Floor 3's story in 2091, seven decades after Killing Floor 2. The Zeds have been nearly perfected by Megacorp Horzine, and the Nightfall team might be the only thing standing between these creatures and the rest of humanity. Fortunately for players, the Nightfall team has a few new tricks of their own including specialized weapons, the ability to climb and dash, and new environmental traps that can be laid down to devastate the Zeds.</p><p>Killing Floor 3 will be available on PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cods-most-popular-map-has-already-been-confirmed-for-black-ops-6/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cods-most-popular-map-has-already-been-confirmed-for-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em> has plenty of iconic maps, but perhaps none are more popular than Nuketown. While it was always expected that it would arrive in Treyarch’s <em>Black Ops 6</em> at some point, eagle eyes have already spotted in the game ahead of release. </p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">During the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> reveal at <em>Call of Duty Direct</em>, Treyarch gave us not only a glimpse at the game’s new movement features and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-finally-ends-the-round-based-zombies-map-drought/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round-based Zombies</a> but also showed off an early look at the UI. As spotted by CharlieIntel, in the corner of the lobby UI, we can see the game loading into a match on Nuketown, confirming that the map is coming this fall. </p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">Nuketown has been a feature in the <em>Black Ops</em> series since 2010 when it first appeared in the first entry of the series. It’s returned in every Treyarch-developed game ever since. With five appearances in mainline <em>CoD</em> games, and also a cameo in <em>CoD: Mobile</em>, it was almost guaranteed that it would be in <em>BO6</em>, but it’s still nice to know it’s happening. </p> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="747" data-injectable="true">It’s no surprise that it’s coming back though, as it’s <em>CoD</em>‘s most popular map. In <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, the Nuketown 24/7 playlist was one of the game’s most played and is just match after match played on the map over and over again. In fact, when Treyarch did remove the mode for a period, fans spent the entire time asking when it was coming back. </p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that we’ll be able to play it at release, as Treyarch has said the game will launch with 16 new maps, which Nuketown definitely is not. In my opinion, Nuketown is the perfect map to drop with the game’s first seasonal update, along with a new weapon and likely the <em>Black Ops 6</em> patch for <em>Warzone</em>. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">A true fan-favorite, I personally can’t wait to get back on Nuketown, as it’s often the map I play the most. If you’re ranking up guns or trying to complete camo challenges, Nuketown 24/7 playlists promise lots of gunfights in a small location, making it perfect for grinding your way through the progression system. </p>
 <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false">We’ll be sure to keep you updated as we learn more about Nuketown’s introduction to <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

  <p id="S5ZB5M">In classic <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars">Star Wars</a> fashion, the Jedi of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673259/star-wars-high-republic-explained">the High Republic novels</a> — who have now made the jump to live action in the form of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171592/star-wars-acolyte-kill-jedi-mae-sith-master-no-weapon"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> — have spent much of the past few years veering toward disaster. Amid the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/21507879/star-wars-high-republic-the-great-disaster-jedi-explained">“Great Disaster,”</a> which provided an explosive opening to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2021/1/12/22221112/light-of-the-jedi-spoilers-author-charles-soule-interview">Charles Soule’s <em>The Light of the Jedi</em></a>, they were first responders. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sdcc/22591953/star-wars-high-republic-books-order-wave-3-sdcc-2021">cataclysmic events</a> of Claudia Gray’s <em>The Fallen Star </em>made them victims. Now, after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/22867009/star-wars-high-republic-books-phase-2-announcement">a prequel jaunt in The High Republic phase 2</a>, phase 3 is in full swing with the second adult novel in the sequence, Tessa Gratton’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Temptation-Force-Republic/dp/0593723090?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Temptation-Force-Republic/dp/0593723090?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23937258__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23937258__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Temptation of the Force</em></a><em>, </em>in which the Jedi finally start fighting back.</p>
<p id="7pof2s">Following up George Mann’s <em>The Eye of Darkness</em>, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> reunites the Jedi of the High Republic Era after the marauder-terrorist group known as the Nihil staged a violent takeover of a portion of the Outer Rim known as the Occlusion Zone. Focused on the reunion of star-crossed Jedi Avar Kriss and Elzar Mann, <em>Temptation of the Force</em> promises to pay off some long-simmering character work while rallying for what ought to be an explosive conclusion in next spring’s <em>Trials of the Jedi</em> by Charles Soule. </p>
<p id="eA7nhx">In this exclusive excerpt from <em>Temptation of the Force</em>, ahead of its debut on June 11, we see the beginning of the Jedi’s offensive against the Nihil — one that doesn’t involve weapons of warfare, but words of inspiration. </p>
<hr id="k2GELT">
<p id="L6Ubw1"><em><strong>While the Jedi take the fight directly to the Nihil, within the Occlusion Zone, a group of freedom fighters work to support the planets imprisoned in Nihil space, spreading a message of hope and freedom. </strong></em></p>
<h2 id="HEF0ES"><strong>RILIAS II, INSIDE THE OCCLUSION ZONE</strong></h2>
<p id="5FKYvS">Cair San Tekka had been a lot of things in his relatively short life: a spy, a musician, a secret husband, a security aide, a secretary, a punk kid, a troublemaker, a pilot, and now a smuggler and freedom fighter. He wasn’t the only one running various rebellions throughout Nihil space, and several such rebel groups had found ways to access the constantly changing anti-scav codes to allow for safer travel out here on the frontier, as well as a comm subroutine channel that made it through the Nihil comm embargo. Cair managed those things, too. But what he had that nobody else had was someone who provided him with frequently updated time-phased Path codes that could be used by the Jedi to penetrate the Stormwall. </p>
<p id="fx1oOY">And allies with ships of their own. </p>

<p id="ycRPKL">Those ships were what allowed Cair to be down in the central water garden of Rilias II, huddled in the bowl of their foris alloy funnel. The funnel had been built a few generations ago as a decorative fountain the size of a small building, out of a metal mined on one of their moons that allowed for an exact resonance with the minerals found in their perma-scatter clouds. The funnel gathered thin trickles of water all day and night from the water garden, and at sunrise and sunset most days of the year, when the light filtered through the clouds, it hit the alloy funnel. The funnel’s reverberation caused particles in the air to vibrate into little rainbow stars. </p>
<p id="tglXni">It also amplified certain audio frequencies. </p>
<p id="KLVcmd">Cair shifted the strap of his harness to better reach the small panel that was part of the controls in the base of the funnel. He balanced against the sloped, slippery wall with his feet and worked quickly to remove a datachip and replace it with his sliced frequency emitter. </p>
<p id="Lc9r7c">This would be the fifth morale drop he’d personally led, but the first that included a visual component. </p>
<p id="YaiwhU">Ever since he’d met up with Rhil Dairo last month, she’d been angling to find a way to include visuals in their drops. Symbols and smiles, she’d insisted again and again. Cair hadn’t disagreed with the sentiment, only the practicality. </p>
<p id="TP7GRB">But today they had means and opportunity. </p>
<p id="a6irLq">It was a three-pronged setup: Cair down here slicing the funnel to match the necessary frequencies, Rhil up in orbit with the <em>Brightbird</em>— or as it was known in these parts, the Nihil transport <em>Blood Vulture</em>— and Belin ready in his ship on the other side of the sparkling felsic cliffs edging the city. Rhil had dropped the refitted comm buoy with her newest broadcast, active to the frequencies Cair matched with the funnel, and Belin would fly over the city, releasing a hydro-spray to activate the clouds prematurely. Then their show would begin. </p>
<p id="GpQY8q">Cair finished his slice and hit the countdown monitor he’d brought. It synced up with the similar countdown embedded in his artificial hand. He grinned. So far, so good. </p>
<p id="q2a1jp">Climbing out of the funnel took a bit of time, but Cair hooked his legs over the edge and found a seat on a broad ruffled lily pad. He leaned back on the soft moss and tilted his head up. The teal sky was striped by thin blushing scatter clouds, and every once in a while, a personal shuttle zipped past.</p>
<p id="SIENko">Rilias II had been hard hit by the Nihil, but its central government had capitulated faster than many, giving in to demands for total surrender and allowing regular Nihil rioting missions under the cover of “tax collecting.” Neighborhoods had been razed and anybody who fought back taken into custody or killed. It was a horribly typical story of the past year in the Occlusion Zone, but thanks to quick thinking or cowardly leaders, enough of the populace and riches had been sacrificed to semi-mollify the Nihil. </p>
<p id="uluPQv">That just made Cair’s job more important. He had to remind people they needed to fight. And they could survive. There was hope. It was worth reaching out, worth trying. Everybody needed to be trying. </p>
<p id="Pu0fZC">The water garden shuddered under him as the city’s inner mechanisms opened the underground rivers. It was nearly time. </p>
<p id="HFCyyP">Cair tried not to feel too deeply about the moment of peace. Waiting was the only peace he got these days. The peace between planning and action. </p>
<p id="8b40JB">As always, he pretended he could feel the Force thrumming through everything, connecting him to the lily pad and water, to the air and atmosphere, to his allies in their positions, to the stars beyond, to his family—all of whom were in Republic space now, thank the Force. Cair wasn’t strong in the Force in the least, but he’d been raised to trust it anyway. Sometimes he pretended so well he could actually feel it in his bones. </p>
<p id="ZMq0Yf">The countdown alert notified him he had a minute, and Cair got up onto his feet. He stood at the edge of the funnel as if he didn’t have a care in the world. Security teams—the local constabulary indebted to the Nihil now and oppressed by them—could see him if they looked. If Cair was seen, he might be shot on sight. Or he might be cheered. </p>
<p id="njteCJ">But Cair felt deeply that he needed to be seen. Somebody would tell the story: A human had been here and caused this disruption. Not from space, not from the distance beyond the Stormwall. Someone here. In the flesh. Risking death and torture to bring them this message.</p>
<p id="unuiPs">Cair stood, ignoring the fear. This was worth being afraid. Worth death. It had to be. He’d spent too much of his life serving only his family’s benefit, making underhanded business deals instead of music, toying with industrial espionage instead of new wavelengths for his dulcimer. He was good at creating trouble and spycraft, and he’d never regretted prioritizing what his uncles and parents pushed him toward. Until he met somebody even better at such games, and married him. </p>
<p id="HZwSvu">Of course, with the Nihil occupation, nothing was a game anymore. Cair had done his best to lay low, help those he could, and keep himself from putting a target on his husband’s back. He hadn’t known what else <em>to </em>do. </p>
<p id="5V4sxs">Now he knew. </p>
<p id="KMRCkI">He’d seen people sacrifice everything to keep their families alive. He’d witnessed far-flung San Tekkas disregard profit and exploration and everything Cair thought made San Tekkas San Tekkas just to save a handful of people in danger. They’d been more than brave, risked everything, left it all behind, not for glory or profit but for <em>hope. </em>He’d lost his hand learning to make the same choice. </p>
<p id="BXefUs">It still wasn’t easy to do. But every time Cair chose hope, it got a little less scary. </p>
<p id="ugydwY">Warm wind brushed strands of messy black hair across his face. He made himself smile. That would be the last thing he did, if it was the last thing he did. His dramatic husband would say, <em>Running should be the last thing you do, you fool. </em></p>
<p id="Eg2yFW">Cair heard the high scream of Belin’s engine before he saw the glint of the ship out at the line of felsic cliffs. </p>
<p id="JAba7r">It was time. </p>
<p id="a1Btfd">Cair twisted a tiny red dial on his black-metal hand, and it snapped with a frequency. The funnel hummed in answer. </p>
<p id="LMkQd5">The rest was up to Rhil and Belin. </p>
<p id="LM7hmx">Suddenly Rhil’s voice blasted throughout the sky: “Greetings, free citizens of the frontier! This is your friend and ally Rhil Dairo, and today we have a message from a hero you all know!”</p>
<p id="KuTYQl">Cair laughed. Rhil’s broadcast would travel from buoy to buoy until the Nihil managed to stop it. </p>
<p id="HxI2Ap">The funnel thrummed harder, and there came Belin, streaking across the sky in his sharp-nosed shuttle. Behind him trailed a shimmer as the hydro-spray clung to the lower atmosphere, ready. </p>
<p id="An3wEZ">Cair raised a hand to Belin, who vanished over the distant horizon. </p>
<p id="6ZZyzo">The spray caught the sunlight and the funnel flared. </p>
<p id="R1ccHV">“Hello, this is Jedi Master Avar Kriss,” the Jedi’s voice rang out. </p>
<p id="a1i8t1">Everywhere in this system, and hopefully the neighboring as well, and in every Nihil ship and city with comms that could be reached, Avar Kriss spoke to those listening. </p>
<p id="MAVbZF">But here on Rilias II, held in shape by the rainbow frequencies of the alloy funnel, Avar Kriss’s face looked down like a god. </p>
<p id="Lg09qn">If Cair knew Jedi at all, he knew she’d hate the comparison. But Cair relished it. He grinned and laughed again. And before he hightailed it to his mark to be picked up in a hurry, he stood there, watching and listening. </p>
<p id="4rBwG5">“I bring a message of hope, though it is difficult to hear. But listen, please. Even I am familiar with despair. I know it. That feeling when everything is too much, when the pressure of looking for anything inside of tomorrow is overwhelming. It hurts. I know it, too. In times like that just remember who you are—who you want to be. Who you can be. Focus on that. Fight with me, if that is who you can be. But if you cannot, you do not have to fight. I won’t ask that of you. There are people already fighting for you. For all of us. All I am asking of you today is that you live. Live today, and try to find hope tomorrow. This is Jedi Master Avar Kriss. Help is on the way.”</p>
