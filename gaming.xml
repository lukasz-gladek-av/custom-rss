			<p>Acclaim, a US-based video game publisher who you'd recognize for its success in the 1990s with games like Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Turok, NBA Jam, and a suite of movie licensed games under its belt is <a href="https://playacclaim.com/">back from the dead</a> after filing for bankruptcy in 2004. The publisher is making a grand return with its own PlayAcclaim showcase series debuting in two weeks time, on September 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Titled "<em>A New Era is Coming</em>," this showcase is set to include the publisher's "<em>upcoming lineup of titles while celebrating the brand's unforgettable legacy</em>." There are even hints at what'll be revealed, and how Acclaim is going to kickstart its comeback, according to a press release, that eagle-eyed viewers can spot in the teaser trailer released today.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Acclaim is now led by Alex Josef, who prior to being the chief executive officer of this new iteration of Acclaim was the chief executive officer of publisher <a href="https://www.graffitigames.com/">Graffiti Games</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>We're not here to chase ghosts,</em>" Josef said in a press release. "<em>We're here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what's coming through is something exciting and different. You can't rewrite the past, but you can build upon it. This is about owning our story and moving it into a future that feels bold, energetic, and completely fresh</em>."</p>



<p>Though this new iteration of Acclaim won't be publishing the Mortal Kombat games anymore, it'll be interesting to see what it adds to the modern videogame landscape, and for fans of the games the Acclaim used to publish, perhaps we'll see a few more series get a resurrection of their own. </p>



<p>We'll see what Josef and his team have in store in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-2042-is-going-nuts-as-fans-wait-for-battlefield-6-to-release.1281036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta ended far too long ago already, and fans are chomping at the bit for more fast-paced, destructive action. Instead of waiting until October 10 to get their hands on Battlefield 6, hundreds of thousands of players are pouring into Battlefield 2042, sending the game rocketing back up the sales charts almost four years after launch.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 was a rocky title from day one, and for a while, it threatened to bring about the ‘end’ of the franchise. It has been a dark few years for Battlefield fans, and while Battlefield 6 is expected to be the savior of the series, Battlefield 2042 is finally getting a long-awaited moment in the sun.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2042-player-count-soars">Battlefield 2042 Player Count Soars</h2>



<p>Battlefield 2042 recently leapt up the charts on Steam, rocketing to 75,000 peak concurrent players and rivalling other top-tier shooters thanks to a) Battlefield 6 hype, and b) a staggering sale that dropped the game to record-low prices.</p>



<p>It was the highest peak player count Battlefield 2042 had secured on Steam <strong>since launch</strong>, provided you don’t count the free weekend in October 2023 that saw the game land 107,376 concurrent players.</p>



<figure><figcaption>That peak is really something (Source: SteamDB)</figcaption></figure>







<p>It’s safe to assume similar numbers are circulating on other platforms, particularly as Battlefield 6 draws ever closer.</p>



<p>In the most recent release of the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> newsletter, Battlefield 2042’s growth was studied by the team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Battlefield 2042 <strong>sold almost 500,000 on Steam </strong>last week. While the hype for the imminent Battlefield 6 explains part of this, the real reason for its spike is a HUGE price drop, -95% to $2.99, its cheapest price yet on Steam.</p>



<p>EA often does massive fire sales like this on its legacy titles to give it revenues a boost ahead of its financials. The $1.4 million in Steam revenues from Battlefield alone is nothing to sniff at. Expect more at the end of Q3.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What’s sad is that folks will be pouring into Battlefield 2042, perhaps expecting a similar experience to Battlefield 6, which many would have recently run through when the open beta was live. What they’ll be getting isn’t <strong>bad</strong>, but it’s not a patch on Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Have you jumped into Battlefield 2042 in anticipation of Battlefield 6? Or did you pick it up just because it’s cheap? Either way, let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA has announced that Skate will launch in early access three weeks from now on September 16, 2025, bringing years of <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-4-pre-pre-pre-alpha-signups-insider-program-testing/">closed playtesting</a> and waiting to an end. It'll be available to download for free on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>Yesterday, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-skate-early-access-release-date-cover-art-reveal/">confirmed</a> that we'd get the early access release date announced and the game's cover art revealed today, with both arriving in a short trailer showing off some gameplay and introducing players to San Vansterdam.</p>

<p>The fourth entry in EA's Skate series has been long-awaited, with 15 years between Skate 3's 2010 release and this new Skate game from Full Circle. Of course, it looks very different than the trilogy of games that skateboarding fans fell in love with between 2007-2010.</p>



<p>This new Skate is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-free-to-play-live-service-full-crossplay-2/">free-to-play live service game</a>, that will feature cosmetic microtransactions and require that <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-always-on-online-multiplayer-activities-some-without-skateboards/">players always be online</a> if they want to hop into San Vansterdamn. It's Skate for the modern video game landscape, or more accurately, it's the only iteration of Skate that EA believes is worth making in today's video game landscape, as EA ignores the success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk remasters</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Skate is not just a return, it's a complete evolution of the franchise that's built to last,</em>" said the game's executive producer, Mike McCartney, in a press release. "<em>Our goal with Skate is to capture the freedom, creative expression and community of skateboarding, and share it with as many people as possible. From day one, our priority has been to honor the legacy of the franchise while pushing it into a bold new future - one built in partnership with our players</em>."</p>



<p>While many players might not be on board with a Skate game that's potentially more focused on selling you a new colorway for your board than it is on making a good game, the fact that this is an early access release does at least mean, to some degree, Full Circle and EA will create the experience alongside player feedback. And, so long as Full Circle is able to nail the gameplay, you should be able to ignore all the live service filler you didn't ask for in your Skate game.</p>



<p>"<em>Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of&nbsp;</em><em>skate</em>," added the game's head of creative, Jeff Seamster. "<em>From day one, we've aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We've built this game alongside our community - listening, learning, and evolving together. Whether you're a seasoned skater or just dropped in, Skate is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers - just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we're hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Skate's early access, free-to-play journey begins in a few weeks time. Hopefully, it's a strong enough start that we're not hearing about Skate being unceremoniously shut down in less than a few years time.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> modding group have just polished off a game jam in which they challenged themselves to recreate every singleplayer map in id Software's 1996 FPS from memory alone. That is, they were forbidden from replaying the original game before they started. As Slipseer user iLike80sRock puts it, "if somehow id1 was wiped off of all computers in the world, do we collectively remember the maps well enough to recreate them?"</p><!--more-->
<p>The Quake from Memory pack has been in the works since last year. Find the finished package <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-from-memory-full-release.487/">here</a>, with installation instructions. I don't know the original Quake well enough to comment on the accuracy of the results - I was naught but a sobbing child when Quake came out, and also, a hopeless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> enthusiast. Still, I'm very interested in the concept of this jam, because when we recreate things from memory, it <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/visual-memory-distortions.html">tends to reveal some kind of bias</a>. </p>
<p>The comments on that Slipseer thread run a fun gamut. Levels are "either uncannily spot on or butchered". Some rooms are too tall, perhaps because people remember being physically smaller when they played the game, and that difference in scale has somehow bled across the gap between simulation and the flesh. Some nail traps seem to fire too fast. Some maps "are very different in ways I can't explain in words".</p>
<p>There's a sense of fascination, throughout: it's not just people complaining that the Shamblers are the wrong way round. The premise of recreating the game from memory cultivates an intrigue and a generosity not typically found in responses to certain high-fidelity videogame remasters or remakes. </p><p>In the absence of lasting, external tangible records, such as writing, remembering becomes <a href="https://historyireland.com/recycling-the-dustbin-of-irish-history-the-radical-challenge-of-folk-memory/">more of a communal practice</a>. I'm interested to know if the Quake from Memory modders were allowed to show each other their work and compare reflections, or if each mapmaker had to go it alone. "Collectively" implies the former.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I've been trying to work out if I could recreate any of my favourite games from memory. Back in the day, I could have drawn most of Sonic 2's layouts by hand, but I have played a million games since, and that squiggly hedgehog lore is lost to me. I have sharper memories of G-Police, the cyberpunk flight sim from WipEout creators Psygnosis.</p>
<p>In particular, I have quite vivid memories of one mission in which you have to stave off base assaults while tracking down and obliterating an approaching land train. The time management rigours of that mission have drummed those dome cities into my head. Still, don't come crying to me if somebody manages to delete all surviving copies of G-Police. Missions 11-16 are just hypermissile whooshing noises on repeat.</p>
<p>Which game could <em>you</em> recreate from memory alone? Thanks to RPS reader Salty for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-346?view=comments">posting about this in the latest RPS wappity</a>.</p>

Previously, the publisher had teased that it would be out sometime this year and later promised it would be out this summer. But now we know that the new, online-only <em>Skate</em> reboot is launching on September 16. Mark your calendars and set aside some time to kickflip. Or crash.

Since then, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">leaked a few times</a>, and EA has put out early, unfinished footage of <em>Skate</em> as part of a plan to be more transparent about the open-world skateboarding game’s development. <em>Skate</em> has also been playtested by fans in the lead-up to its launch.

<p>It appears Activision and Call of Duty’s teams have listened to the community’s cries. It’s been revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t feature a Black Ops 6 carry forward. This would’ve seen cosmetics from BLOPS 6 be available in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-players-think-black-ops-6-purchases-carrying-over-to-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB summary hinted at Black Ops 6 purchases carrying over</a> into Black Ops 7. Despite claims that Call of Duty remains a realistic military shooter, this would’ve meant <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-adding-beavis-butt-head-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>, Squid Game, and various other novelty skins existing in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. This now appears to be off the cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-won-t-feature-black-ops-6-carry-over-content">Black Ops 7 Won’t Feature Black Ops 6 Carry-Over Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I mean, what is this? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 26 news briefing on the Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> addressed the “Identity of Call of Duty.” It discussed Black Ops 7 being a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2. However, the statement also recognized new changes that will be reflected in BLOPS 7.</p>



<p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7,” is the front-page story here. Activision has decided against the planned carry-forward from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The statement continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward,&nbsp;because we recognize your time and progression are important. This change applies only to Black Ops 7.&nbsp;Call of Duty:&nbsp;Warzone is not affected,&nbsp;and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I can’t help but wonder if this is a response to Battlefield 6. EA and Battlefield Studios have already come out and said: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-dev-hints-that-game-wont-have-unrealistic-skins-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 likely won’t have unrealistic skins &amp; cosmetics</a>. In any case, the negative reaction to Black Ops 7 has more than likely alarmed Activision. We’ll have to see if the company caters to any more feedback moving forward.</p>

<p>What do you make of this bombshell? Is it the right call? Are we finally seeing the end of wild Call of Duty crossovers? Let me know what you think through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Co-op gaming isn’t making a comeback; it never left. LEGO Voyagers is the latest title to feature two-player-focused adventuring in a fantastical world you’re encouraged to explore. I had the opportunity to play it at Gamescom 2025. I also had the pleasure of talking to (and playing the game with) Karsten Lund, who revealed LEGO Voyager’s potential 5-hour length and other features in a special interview.</p>



<p>Karsten is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a>‘s senior quality manager. He graciously kept me company as we journeyed together through a succinct LEGO Voyagers demo. He had likely played the demo to death when Gamescom 2025 was all said and done. However, I conducted a one-to-one interview all about the LEGO Voyagers demo.</p>



<p>He was more than happy to answer several key questions I had about the game and gave us all a sneak peek at the game’s motives and content.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-voyagers-is-something-everyone-s-ready-to-play">LEGO Voyagers is Something “Everyone’s Ready to Play”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We smashed it. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/games/lego-voyagers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LEGO Voyagers</a> doesn’t focus on a specific media license or property, or a talkative character with a riveting backstory. We care about two mute bricks who want to rescue a spaceship. Lund explained the dynamic and what the team wanted to achieve with Voyagers.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This time around, we focus on the brick; figuring out a way to put brick and brick building as the star of the show as opposed to the minifigure-based games that are also out there. So in this game, you actually play as a LEGO brick, a small one-by-one brick with an eye. Then you have to navigate the levels that are completely brick-built as well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I did mention recent contemporaries that have excelled in the genre—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hazelight Studios</a>‘ work, in particular. Karsten says that “the way has been paved now, right?” in (presumably) reference to the likes of It Takes Two and Split Fiction. </p>



<p>Furthermore: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s something everybody loves to play and everybody’s ready to play.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like Hazelight’s games, LEGO Voyagers supports the Friends Pass system. This means only <em>one of you</em> needs to buy the game to play it in co-op. Future content hinges on the game’s success. With it being an easy and accessible co-op LEGO release appealing to a wide demographic, this probably won’t be an issue.</p>



<p>I also enquired about the game’s length and if there are any fun mini-games to break up the gameplay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have a game of tic-tac-toe in the middle of the game, so we’re giving lots of opportunities to play and hang out in the game. We’ve seen players complete this in four and a half to five hours, if they just run through it and solve the puzzles.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I gave my full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-voyagers-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Voyagers verdict in my complete Gamescom 2025 preview</a>, which I encourage you to check out!</p>



<hr>



<p>LEGO Voyagers is scheduled to release on September 15. Will you be picking it up straightaway? Do we need even more co-op games and fewer multiplayer-only titles?

            <title><![CDATA[Gears of War: Reloaded Review Update]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update.1280982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2006 Gears of War is the classic case of "don't judge a book by its cover;" this seemingly meatheaded, bro-forward game has cemented itself as not only one of the best third-person cover shooter series with its iconic gameplay and weapons, but also one that shrugs at its stereotypes to both embrace them (when was the last time you heard someone called a dickwad?) and defy them with great storytelling and fantastic voice acting. Ten years after its first makeover, it's gotten another with Gears of War: Reloaded. Unlike some games that get a premature remaster treatment a few years after their release, this one looks and feels like a noticeable improvement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we’ve come to expect from Xbox Game Studios developer The Coalition, the PS5 and Steam crowds are welcomed to the first game in this iconic series with gorgeous modern graphics and framerates, and no more waiting around on long load screens. Before we get into the details of Reloaded, here's what IGN said about Gears of War’s first remaster from 2015: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From playing about seven hours, I can say that the glowing review of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and its few faults still stand true with Reloaded. The story begins by throwing you into the thick of a losing war. Things go from shit to shittier for Marcus Fenix and crew as they try to accomplish one task that spirals out of control, and while that may not be fun for them, it sure is exciting to play, especially with the technical updates. Here are the highlights: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reloaded plays in 4K with up to 120Hz output (if you've got the screen for it). </li><li>The 60fps is a nice upgrade on consoles for the campaign, which previously only went up to 30fps at its launch and 60fps with the Series X performance boost, and 120fps in multiplayer is equally welcome.</li><li>There are more options to change up controls, audio, and more Reloaded than were in Ultimate Edition.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Touch of Color</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2015 Gears of War: Ultimate Edition did a great job upgrading the notoriously drab look of the Xbox 360 original with color adjustments, lifting the muddy grey and brown fog from the planet Sera. Reloaded takes that a step further, with an even more lively color palette and better lighting that resembles what we saw in Gears 5. The uplifted style gives extra vibrancy to splurting blood during a chainsaw kill, and the blue skies clouded by smoke and dust look nice, too. The Coalition added extra detail to the environment as well, like additional paintings in legal buildings, dense bookshelves, fridges with rotting food, more corpses, and other fitting decor like that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Gears of War Review Ever</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Welcome to Delta Squad, PS5 </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's still mighty odd seeing Xbox Game Studios on the screen while I hold a DualSense, but I can only say that the shredding of exclusivity lines hasn't hurt Gears of War one bit. If anything, it's made a strong case for me to do a co-op run on PlayStation 5. The core of Reloaded is the same between all three platforms, but the DualSense adds a twist with the adaptive triggers and any comms done through radio output through the controller's speaker. It was a neat surprise having dialogue and sound effects – like hitting the perfect active reload – presented this way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, the adaptive triggers can be off-putting in some situations, like when hopping on a Troika where the triggers feel like they're on max resistance for firing the turret or when driving a vehicle, so I could see them being unwelcome to some. I got tired of it in the second act during a long driving section, so I ended up turning adaptive triggers off for a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect of Gears that's evolved over time is the heavy screen shake with the roadie run. It's less pronounced in other Gears games that’ve come along since, but The Coalition kept the exaggerated effect for Reloaded by default. I appreciate its unique touch and that the shakiness encourages tactical use. Running around an encounter isn't the way to play Reloaded, and if you do, you'll likely be punished for it. Instead, you'll want to run and bounce between cover, keeping yourself protected from the onslaught of enemy fire.  If you don't like screen shake, though, it can be turned off. It's good to have options! </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Some Minor Bugs</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The cool additions are also joined by some minor bugs I’ve seen in the roughly six hours I’ve played on PlayStation 5. There was weirdness in checkpoints jumping me forward and facing a different way, characters’ voices would drop for a line randomly, and I saw some enemies get stuck in between cover. Those bugs have appeared infrequently and weren’t too bothersome, though, and are probably nothing a patch or two won’t fix. I didn't see these happen much during my time with the Xbox version, but just because I didn't see them doesn't mean they aren't there. Bugs are tricky like that!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bad Squad AI</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one actively annoying gameplay issues I came across was how incompetent and overall wonky my AI companions were on the Hardcore difficulty level, which is a noticeable downgrade from how they performed in Ultimate Edition. In Reloaded, they go down <em>constantly, </em>whereas in Ultimate Edition they still went down occasionally, but seemed to be helping more<em>.</em> Hardcore is only a step above normal and below Insane, so I expected they should be able to hold their own at least a bit. I noticed Dom waltzing into the dark and dying to the lurking Kryll that shredded him in seconds in one mission, and every now and then, Dom or the other two companions, Cole and Baird, would get stuck far behind, unwilling to leave a doorway. I love Delta squad, but I'm not reviving them every encounter only to put myself in danger.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Cherry on Top: Extras for Gears Fans</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: Reloaded includes a nice Extras section, which is something you'd want to see in a remaster like this to reward returning fans who’re buying it for the second or third time. What'll interest most folks in the Extras section are the five different issues of the Gears of War comic. Grabbing the collectible COG Tags throughout the campaign unlocks pages in five different issues of the Gears of War comic, which is a nice reward for those who haven't read them. This was available in the Ultimate Edition, and it's a welcome return. Completing acts of the campaign also unlocks neat concept art.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, while multiple sets of credits may not be what someone who’s new to this game cares about, for folks like me, seeing the credits available for Reloaded, Ultimate Edition, and the original are in line with Gears' respect for teamwork.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplayer Only Has Minor Tweaks</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Multiplayer hasn't changed (in terms of what content is included) between Ultimate Edition and Reloaded, though The Coalition upgraded to 60Hz dedicated servers, as opposed to the 30Hz we’ve had in previous versions. The maps got the remaster treatment too, with better lighting, visual effects, and best of all, an upgrade to 120fps on consoles (PC players also get a 240fps option). I expect weapon tuning to be in flux after launch; The Coalition already noted it's making some improvements to the Gnasher, making perfect active reload damage fixed, and more tweaks based on feedback from the beta. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Miranda's Top 10 Games of 2025</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Get Your COG Tags </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If this is your first time playing Gears of War, I recommend finding a friend to join you – the Gears of War teams have always designed these games with a partner in mind (and as I mentioned, the AI doesn’t really pull its weight on the higher difficulty levels). The Coalition thankfully maintained the option to play Reloaded couch co-op, which we don’t see enough these days, and of course, you've also got the option of online crossplay if your co-op buddy is on another system. I'm still undecided on whether or not I want to spend my next co-op replay on Xbox or PS5 or bounce between them (thanks, cross-progression!), but I'm excited to dive back in again either way.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-review-update]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2021, Marvel Studios attempted to expand the reach of the MCU with an adaptation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">Eternals</a>, a lesser-known group of immortal heroes. Kumail Nanjiani was cast as Kingo alongside Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and more. Eternals didn't earn enough to merit a sequel, and Nanjiani has revealed that he had a deal for a video game and a theme park attraction that never came to pass.</p><p>"I signed on for six movies, you know," said Nanjiani during his appearance on Mike Birbiglia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Y8zwAj3sYpc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working It Out</a> podcast. "I signed on for a video game. I signed on for a theme park ride. They make you sign up for all this stuff ... And so you're like, 'Oh, this is the next 10 years of my life, so I'll be doing Marvel movies every year, and then in-between I'll do like my own little things, whatever I want to do.' And then none of that happened."</p><p>That deal appears to have been predicated on Eternals being a hit like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, which did get licensed out for video games and theme park rides. Marvel hasn't had a lot of video games based directly on the MCU movies in the last two decades, but the studio apparently kept the possibility open for Eternals.</p><p>Nanjiani previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-eternals-star-kumail-nanjiani-went-to-therapy-after-bad-reviews/1100-6520870/" data-ref-id="1100-6520870">disclosed that he went to therapy</a> after Eternals was greeted with bad reviews, but he told Birbiglia that the experience taught him that too much of his self esteem was tied up to other people's reactions to his work.</p><p>Eternals had $402.1 million worldwide, which is a threshold that Marvel Studios has had trouble reaching this year. Regardless, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-brings-adamantium-finally-references-eternals/1100-6525358/" data-ref-id="1100-6525358">the only Marvel movie to pick up on some of the threads introduced in Eternals</a> was Captain America: Brave New World.</p><p>Nanjiani also noted that he's proud of Eternals, and his experience with it has given him material for his latest standup comedy set.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there."</p><p>Activision said double XP tokens and GobbleGums will continue to carry forward. "Because we recognize your time and progression are important," the developer explained.</p><p>Only a week ago, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-carry-forward-returns-for-black-ops-7-but-with-limitations/1100-6534013/" data-ref-id="1100-6534013">the Carry Forward program would return for Black Ops 7</a>, but not until some time after Season 1. The company said at the time there would be some exceptions, but now, it's not happening at all.</p><h2><b>The identity of Call of Duty has "drifted"</b></h2><p>In the statement today, Activision also acknowledged the conversations online about "the identity of Call of Duty" and how the perception from some is that Call of Duty has "drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place."</p><p>Activision said it understands that people want Call of Duty to be and feel "immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded."</p><p>"That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," Activision said.</p><p>The company did not, however, say what it's doing to address this beyond cancelling the Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7. It appears Activision could be referencing the wacky skins that Call of Duty has become known for in recent years. Some part of the Call of Duty audience enjoys and embraces these skins, and others have said they are a detriment to the overall experience.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 6 backdrop</strong></h2><p>Activision is making these comments against the backdrop of Battlefield 6's release in October. Battlefield Studios has said it wants the game's multiplayer skins to feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-have-grounded-skins-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj/1100-6533627/" data-ref-id="1100-6533627">"grounded."</a></p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." That is seemingly a reference to the DLC skin for Call of Duty that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">lets you play as Minaj.</a> Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, producer Alexia Christofi said much the same thing, explaining that Battlefield Studios is hoping to make Battlefield 6's skins "feel grounded."</p><p>"We want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like, 'I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin,'" Christofi said. "But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. You can find highlights of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">new Black Ops 7 announcements</a> here, which includes details on an endgame for the campaign, a massive round-based Zombies map, and a futuristic look for multiplayer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/iracing-and-indycar-team-up-for-new-series-of-indycar-games.1280955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iRacing Studios, the developer behind the upcoming&nbsp;<em>NASCAR 25</em>, has announced a multi-year partnership to bring a series of IndyCar games to PC and consoles, starting with an inaugural title next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.indycar.com/news/2025/08/08-26-iracing-console-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official IndyCar website, the open-wheel racing brand reveals that the first IndyCar title is due to land on PC and current-gen consoles in "the second half of 2026".</p>

<p>It'll mark the first IndyCar game since 2004's&nbsp;<em>IndyCar Series 2005</em>, which was developed by legendary racing studio Codemasters (which also had the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032" rel="nofollow">taken away from it by Nacon</a> recently amid rumors of a shutdown).</p>

<p>Electronic Arts is preparing to welcome gamers to San Vansterdam from September 16 as Skate (I’m not writing skate., I hate that title) enters early access. This news was announced on social media earlier today, and it comes after months of closed testing phases have unravelled much of the game’s content.</p>



<p>The Skate team also released a short trailer to celebrate the announcement. It has been more than 15 years since the last Skate game was released, and fans are <strong>hungry</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-skate-will-release-in-early-access-next-month">Skate Will Release in Early Access Next Month</h2>



<p>In little more than two weeks, Skate will be released in early access by Electronic Arts. Earlier today, the team posted a small trailer to announce the release date:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For months, fans have been testing Skate (stylized as skate.) and running the game through its paces. This has meant that stacks of content have emerged online, giving us a fair indication of what to expect when San Vansterdam opens up on September 16, 2025.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the team revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-skate-game-gets-official-cover-art-and-early-access-release-date-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover art for Skate</a>, promising that the early access release date would drop <strong>today</strong>. Well, as you can see from the above, they’ve delivered on that promise.</p>



<p>In June, the biggest update ever made to the playtest product was unveiled, adding more challenges and upping the server limit to 150 players per map. Even in a testing state, Skate featured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-skate-playtest-update-revealed-wishlists/">a whopping 140 challenges</a> and activities.</p>



<p>The full game could end up being something pretty monumental, scale-wise.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Skate when it enters early access on September 16? Let me know what you’re most excited about with this game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Tuesday, it was announced that iRacing and IndyCar had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indycar-game-coming-in-2026-from-iracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached an agreement</a> on a new game for the second half of 2026. The first console game in over 20 years for IndyCar, this new title is planned to launch on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. </p>



<p>But when did the deal come together? </p>



<p>Back in early 2024, iRacing president Tony Gardner <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-iracing-not-planning-an-indycar-console-game-right-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Insider Gaming</a> that an IndyCar console game wasn’t in a “short-term plan” for the company, but that the door was open. Later that year, the door blew wide open.</p>



<p>Gardner says that while the long-term plan was <a href="https://iracingstudios.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to eventually get here</a>, talks really picked up in late 2024.</p>



<p><strong>“We finalized an agreement with them early this year,”</strong> Gardner told Insider Gaming, <strong>“So, it was six to nine months ago and, and we didn’t want to announce it too soon because we’d rather get some development under our belt and whatnot.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as why announce the game now, Gardner said it made sense to do it ahead of the final race of the 2025 season on August 31. </p>



<p><strong>“We need to to start talking more openly to the teams and getting driver feedback on the physics and things like that,” </strong>he said. <strong>“So it’s a good time for us to let the cat out of the bag.</strong>“</p>



<p>In addition to the console game, iRacing will continue to have a relationship with IndyCar on its main platform. The game is <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-development-update-august-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to add</a> the Dallara IL-15 from the INDY NXT series is set to join iRacing in season 4 of 2025.</p>



<p>Are you excited about the IndyCar game from iRacing? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a> </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/04/lumines-arise-is-a-brand-new-entry-in-the-series-showcasing-everything-the-team-learned-on-tetris-effect/">Lumines Arise&nbsp;</a>was first announced back in June during Sony’s State of Play, marking a new entry into the Lumines series. Today, Enhance Games has released a new limited time demo for Lumines Arise on PS5 and PC via Steam, allowing players get a first taste of the game. The limited window to experience the Lumines Arise demo lasts from today until September 3rd. After that, players will have to wait for the now confirmed release date of November 11th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Demo Explainer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4_s7uLivr58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Lumines Arise demo will feature three stages, with those being Arise, Duo Soul, and Chameleon Grove, along with the multiplayer mode of Burst Battle. The Burst feature is indicated by a percentage score that increases as you play, and when it hits 50% or 100% you can activate it. Activating Burst means a shift in how Lumines plays. Instead of blocks clearing when the line passes through them, you will build up blocks to grow the Burst area. The aim is for you to clear as much of the area as possible when the timer expires. In the multiplayer Burst Battle, garbage builds up making the playing area smaller and smaller, but activating burst stops the garbage falling for a time. You want to be able to build up your score and use the Burst at the opportune moment to beat your opponents. To grab the Lumines Arise demo, head to the following links.</p>

</ul>
<p>The last game Enhance released was Tetris Effect, and in our review we gave it a 10/10 saying, “<em>There’s a point when you’re playing Tetris and everything else seems to fade away. Tetris Effect takes that one step further by bringing the game to PSVR alongside its regular 4K HDR presentation, where the closed circuit of headset, player and controller is the only reality. In the main Journey mode – a collection of stages strung together in a series of EP-like sets – you’re still attempting to remove lines from the playing field by fitting shapes together, but when you combine the low latency response of the PSVR’s screens, the ever-changing visuals and wire yourself up to the music, Tetris Effect’s heady melody of the physical and the experiential offers one of the most compelling arguments for virtual reality yet.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>iRacing Studios, the developer behind the first major NASCAR game since 2021, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3873970/NASCAR_25/">NASCAR 25</a>, which is due out in October, will produce and develop a series on IndyCar racing games for PC and consoles, with the first of this new series coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a press release on iRacing Studios' <a href="https://www.iracing.com/iracing-studios-to-produce-standalone-indycar-video-game-in-2026/">official website</a>, as iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations and IndyCar have signed "<em>a long-term licensing agreement for iRacing Studios to produce standalone INDYCAR titles for console and PC.</em>"</p>



<p>We don't yet have an official title for this new series, but its significance for racing fans cannot be overstated, as it's the first major IndyCar racing game "<em>in more than two decades</em>," according to iRacing and INDYCAR.</p>



<p>"<em>INDYCAR fans have long been clamoring for a standalone title for consoles, and we're excited to give them what they're looking for in 2026,</em>" said iRacing.com Motorsport Simulations president, Tony Gardner. "<em>iRacing Studios' standalone INDYCAR title will offer all the excitement of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and an immersive experience that fans of all ages can enjoy. We are already very excited about how the game is coming together."</em></p>



<p>IndyCar president J. Douglas Boles added, "<em>The most competitive and challenging racing on the planet deserves a dedicated and widely available gaming experience. iRacing Studios is the ideal partner for us, trusted and known to our core fans and ready to share our sport with a wider and highly engaged audience.</em>"</p>



<p>According to the press release, this new game will include licensed vehicles and drivers from the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and INDY NXT, featuring online multiplayer, a career mode for players to progress through, and will be made on iRacing Studios' proprietary Orontes game engine.</p>



<p>"<em>Our company has grown significantly in recent years with the addition of new development teams and studios,</em>" Gardner continued. "<em>Our INDYCAR title will benefit from this growth as it will be the sole focus of one of these teams. However, the game will also incorporate elements like car and track assets, technology and driving characteristics from other iRacing Studios products</em>."</p>



<p>iRacing has always been more simulation than arcade focused, so it's not exactly trying to take away players from games like Forza Horizon, but it'll be interesting to see how this new IndyCar game fares when it arrives, and how its coming NASCAR 25 game does in October. It definitely feels like there's more of an interest in the overall sport of racing with major films recently released on the subject, even if they're not IndyCar or NASCAR-focused. We'll see what October 2025, and then 2026, has in store for racing fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced an Early Access release date for its&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot, and the always-online open-world reimagining of the classic skateboarding franchise is due to arrive in just a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>As revealed in a trailer released earlier today,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across PC and consoles (including last-gen machines, but not including Nintendo's Switch family) on September 16th.</p>

<p>Just to remind you, rather than the more traditional boxed-game approach of its predecessors, the&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot will be a free-to-play experience; EA describes it as an "ever-evolving online skateboarding sandbox, refreshed with a forever vision in mind".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-early-access-release-date-church.jpg?itok=P12TtELF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-early-access-release-date-church.jpg?itok=gQn6XRht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA's&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot is set to arrive in September.</figcaption></figure><p>EA first revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>franchise would be making a return <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-franchise-willed-into-existence-again" rel="nofollow">back in 2020</a>, at which point it had been ten years since we last heard from the series. Original&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>co-creator Cuz Parry said at the time that the reboot had been "willed into existence" by eager fans.</p>

<p>Subsequently, a new studio, Full Circle, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-is-happening-ea-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">was created</a> to work on what was then tentatively known as&nbsp;<em>Skate 4</em>, with the project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play" rel="nofollow">officially being renamed</a> to simply "<em>Skate</em>" and gaining free-to-play status in 2022.</p>

<p>Following that, in September last year, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>would be making its way to Early Access sometime in 2025, and a financial statement from the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">later confirmed</a> it would arrive sometime before March 2026.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what this&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot will offer, you can check out EA's new Early Access release date announcement trailer below. It should give you some idea of what you're in for if you decide to check it out.</p>




<p>According to EA, the new&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>'s setting of San Vansterdam will offer "new spots to discover, hundreds of challenges to conquer, and a constantly dynamic scene driven by community". It'll also feature a new iteration of the&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>series' signature "Flick-It" trick system.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you're hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>offline, you won't be able to do so; EA confirmed back in April that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't feature an offline mode</a>, so you'll need an internet connection if you want to check it out.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>launches in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10006353" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on September 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And EA has built in a lot of social features into the new <em>Skate</em>, including the ability to drop things like ramps and rails right into the world that you and the other skaters nearby can use. Up to 150 skaters can be in a server at a time.</p><p>You’ll be able to buy in-game cosmetics for your custom skater from the in-game shop, though they’re optional and don’t provide any gameplay benefit. Like other free-to-play live service games, <em>Skate</em> will have seasonal content and its version of a battle pass with free and paid rewards.</p><p>The new <em>Skate</em> will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC, and it will support crossplay and cross-progression. A mobile version for iOS and Android is in development as well.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date#comments">4<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/761186/ea-skate-free-to-play-early-access-release-date]]></content:encoded>

The studio hopes to move toward a full release approximately one year from the start of Early Access. <span id="more-987962"></span></p><p>“<em>skate.</em> is not just a return, it’s a complete evolution of the franchise that’s built to last,” said <em>skate.</em> executive producer Mike McCartney in a press release. “Our goal with <em>skate.</em> is to capture the freedom, creative expression and community of skateboarding, and share it with as many people as possible. From day one, our priority has been to honor the legacy of the franchise while pushing it into a bold new future—one built in partnership with our players.”</p><p><em>skate.</em> head of creative Jeff Seamster added, “Community is the heart of skateboarding, and it’s the heart of <em>skate.</em> From day one, we’ve aimed to create an open, welcoming space shaped by players. We’ve built this game alongside our community—listening, learning, and evolving together. Whether you’re a seasoned skater or just dropped in, <em>skate.</em> is a place to express yourself, connect and grow. No gatekeepers, no barriers—just a city built for skating and a community that keeps it alive. Early Access is a huge milestone in that journey, and we’re hyped to keep growing San Vansterdam with our crew around the world.”</p><div id="carousel_988096"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Electronic Arts:</p><blockquote><p>Set in the vibrant city of San Vansterdam, <em>skate.</em> is a <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [582 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> skateboarding destination offering a massive open world where players discover unique skate spots, land insane tricks and connect—or compete—with friends online. With four unique neighborhoods—Hedgemont, Gullcrest, Market Mile and Brickswich—each offering its own distinct vibe and challenges, the city is a huge playground for skaters. From parks and plazas to rooftops and massive ramps, every corner is packed with skateable spots, including the House of Rolling Reverence, a former church transformed into a trick haven for skaters.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the core of <em>skate.</em> is the restored and improved Flick-It System, brought back to life through the Frostbite Engine to deliver the best skateboarding experience we have ever offered. With unparalleled precision and control, Flick-It brings the magic of the franchise back to life for a new generation of players. <em>skate.</em> also introduces a variety of new tricks—such as wallies, slappies and firecrackers—offering fresh ways to ride. Skatepedia serves as the ultimate resource for mastering tricks and styles, while ensuring accessibility for new players. </p><p>In <em>skate.</em>, players can discover new ways to explore and get vertical with new off-board controls, giving them total freedom to roam, climb and find epic new spots. Additional features like Quick Drop allow players to place ramps, rails, benches and more anywhere in the world to fine-tune their perfect spot. <em>skate.</em> offers players the ability to find their own fun with endless activities, including rotating world map challenges—such as Line Challenges, Own The Spot and <a title="Games > Session: Skate Sim [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/session-skate-sim">Session</a>s – as well as high-energy Throwdowns with friends.

Player feedback has been welcome all throughout playtesting and something Full Circle will continue to look at during the game’s Early Access period.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While details on Skate remained under wraps during its early development period, the last year has seen a trickle of new information released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-robinson-basically-did-an-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-to-reveal-skates-story/1100-6524066/">and at least one memorable promo</a> featuring skateboarder and I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson. What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/">Skate will be an always-online game</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-somehow-has-microtransactions-before-it-even-hits-early-access-report/1100-6530068/">supported by microtransactions</a>, and in terms of gameplay, players can pull off some impressive tricks using the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-dev-explains-new-flick-it-system-and-its-ever-changing-city/1100-6524008/">redesigned Flick-it system</a>. The game will also feature a new approach to soundtracks and lots of customization options.</p><p>Skate is kick-flipping its way back into gaming at a time when skateboarding games have experienced a resurgence. Over the last couple of years, we've seen spiritual successors to Skate like Skater XL and Session: Skate Sim, while the franchise's biggest rival, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/" data-ref-id="1900-6418379">returned this year with a remake of the THPS 3 and 4 games</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we've also seen several well-received projects from the indie side of game development--like the OlliOlli series from the now-shuttered Roll7 and The Ramp--help to herald in the current era of skateboarding games.</p>

Depending on who you're playing with, the latter can be dangerous--there's always that one player who won't hesitate to create a TikTok-worthy moment.</p><p>Here's the trick with items in Peak: While the game tells you its name, it doesn't actually explain what an item does. Some are easy enough to guess from looks alone, but more often than not, you should be wary of using something to avoid being penalized or affecting the run by accident. Don't fret, though--if you're wondering what things like the <strong>strange gem</strong> or the <strong>crystal skull</strong> do, the list below includes <strong>every item in Peak and what they do</strong>, so you can have a helpful page at hand to dispel doubts in the group chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4554843-20250628031112_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554843" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4554843-20250628031112_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554843"></a><figcaption>I'm sorry, Bing Bong.

There have been quite a few smaller patches, but by and large, here are all the items available thus far. Note that we're skipping most of the food, as their purpose is largely self-explanatory.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Item</th><th scope="col">What it does</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ancient Effigy</td><td>Revives any dead player or players.</td></tr><tr><td>Ancient Idol</td><td>You gain invulnerability to everything... as long as you hold it, that is.</td></tr><tr><td>Antidote</td><td>Cures poison partially</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-rope Cannon</td><td>When shot at a surface, it releases a rope that "falls" upwards instead, starting from the point of impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-rope Spool</td><td>It releases a rope that "falls" upwards instead.</td></tr><tr><td>Backpack</td><td>It can carry up to four items</td></tr><tr><td>Bandages</td><td>Restores health partially.</td></tr><tr><td>Berrynana</td><td>You can throw it on the ground to cause other people to fall.</td></tr><tr><td>Big Lollipop</td><td>Grants infinite stamina for about seven seconds, and inflicts the drowsy status immediately after.</td></tr><tr><td>Bing Bong</td><td>Basically just a cute plushie, and part of a tough achievement that involves finishing a run while carrying it, in a similar fashion to Gnome Chompski in Left 4 Dead 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Binoculars</td><td>No abnormal effect here. They're just binoculars.</td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>Shoots a dart that clears negative status except for the curse status. The player who receives the shot will be temporarily drowsy.</td></tr><tr><td>Bounce Fungus</td><td>Creates a mushroom platform when thrown at a surface, making for a good spot to rest while climbing.</td></tr><tr><td>Bugle</td><td>Plays a song, or heinous sounds, depending on your taste. If you use it around the capybaras in Alpine, you'll get an achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Bugle of Friendship</td><td>Boosts everybody's stamina momentarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Cactus</td><td>It does nothing, but beware of its thorns if you throw it around.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain Launcher</td><td>Shoots a chain to the spot you're aiming at. Be mindful of your current stamina before committing to it.</td></tr><tr><td>Compass</td><td>Points north, which matches the peak of the mountain.</td></tr><tr><td>Conch</td><td>It does nothing. You can throw it at your friends if you want, though.</td></tr><tr><td>Cure-All</td><td>Cures all negative statuses.</td></tr><tr><td>Cursed Skull</td><td>Heals allies at the expense of your own health.</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamite</td><td>Causes an explosion, which can also cook items.</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Drink</td><td>Increases speed momentarily while inflicting the drowsy status afterward.</td></tr><tr><td>Faerie Lantern</td><td>Gets rid of all negative statuses. It doesn't help with hunger.</td></tr><tr><td>First Aid Kit</td><td>If injured, it restores all of your health, while also curing poison.</td></tr><tr><td>Flare</td><td>This emits a big smoke cloud that alerts others of your location. It's also used at the peak to call the helicopter.</td></tr><tr><td>Flying Disk</td><td>You can just have some fun with this.</td></tr><tr><td>Heat Pack</td><td>When used, it gradually removes cold for some time. Useful for blizzards in the Alpine biome.</td></tr><tr><td>Lantern</td><td>Emits light, and its heat also removes cold gradually.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Bean</td><td>It summons a beanstalk, which is great for climbing.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandora's Lunchbox</td><td>It removes all negative effects upon use, but you also get a random assortment of new effects, which can be either positive or negative. Thanks, Pandora.</td></tr><tr><td>Parasol</td><td>Along with protecting you from the sun, you can use it for gliding.</td></tr><tr><td>Pirate's Compass</td><td>Points toward suitcases nearby.</td></tr><tr><td>Piton</td><td>Adds a piton on any suitable surface that you can grab onto to restore stamina.</td></tr><tr><td>Portable Stove</td><td>Useful for cooking items and reducing cold.</td></tr><tr><td>Remedy Fungus</td><td>It creates a healing mist when thrown against the ground. If you're playing with others, make sure you're all gathered together first.</td></tr><tr><td>Rope Cannon</td><td>Shoots a harpoon to where you're aiming, which releases a rope in the place of impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Rope Spool</td><td>Releases a rope. You can adjust the height and, once ready, press the action button again to anchor it to the surface you're standing on so it stays in place.</td></tr><tr><td>Torch</td><td>A great source of light, albeit limited.</td></tr><tr><td>Scout Cannon</td><td>You can shoot yourself from a long distance with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Scout Efficy</td><td>Revives another player. If more than one player is dead, the item picks one at random.</td></tr><tr><td>Scoutmaster's Bugle</td><td>If you're playing solo, using this rare bugle summons the Scoutmaster. Useful for an achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Scroll</td><td>There's a chance of seeing them at the summit of biomes. You can use them to create Torn Pages.</td></tr><tr><td>Shelf Fungus</td><td>It creates a mushroom platform when thrown at a surface, great for climbing or to provide an extra platform when attempting long jumps.</td></tr><tr><td>Strange Gem</td><td>It does nothing. At least for now.</td></tr><tr><td>Torn Page</td><td>Mostly for an achievement, which tasks you with collecting eight Torn Pages.</td></tr><tr><td>Weird Shroom</td><td>No weird side effects, it just restores your health partially.</td></tr><tr><td>More to come at some point</td><td>There'll likely be more items added in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's all the items available in Peak at the time of writing. Have fun climbing!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ninja Gaiden 4, the long-awaited fourth mainline entry in the iconic action franchise, graces the next cover of <em>Game Informer</em>, and we could not be more excited to feature both the new protagonist, Yakumo, and his counterpart, the series' longtime hero, Ryu Hayabusa, on the full spread of our cover art. The digital issue goes live today at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/ninjagaiden4">GameInformer.com/NinjaGaiden4</a>, with print subscriptions rolling out in a few weeks. If you haven't subscribed yet, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">there's still time to get the Ninja Gaiden 4 issue shipped to your mailbox</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Ninja Gaiden franchise has been dormant for more than a decade, but 2025 has been a big comeback year for the series. Koei Tecmo kicked off the year with an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the beloved Ninja Gaiden 2, followed by Dotemu and The Game Kitchen's incredible retro-facing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ninja-gaiden-ragebound/a-retro-revelation" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0fc156cb-d76d-423a-8fd8-c650e1b0aef4" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>. However, the franchise's 2025 is far from over, as the first mainline entry in more than 13 years is set to hit this October. Just like Ninja Gaiden 4 delivers action starring two ninjas, it also unites two fabled game studios: series developer Team Ninja and the acclaimed action team at PlatinumGames.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We flew to Tokyo, Japan, to spend a day in PlatinumGames' headquarters, talking to various members of the team from both studios and playing through the first several chapters of the story. Our cover story explores how Team Ninja united with the studio behind such beloved titles as Nier: Automata, Astral Chain, and the Bayonetta series, plus a deep dive into what to expect when the game launches in October.</p><p>The Ninja Gaiden 4 cover story is the centerpiece, but our next issue is so much more than that article. If you're new to Ninja Gaiden, our editor-in-chief Matt Miller <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/legacy-of-the-ninja">runs down the history and importance of the franchise</a>. Wesley LeBlanc spent a week in Beijing and Shanghai, China, to go in-depth with the promising action title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/kung-fu-punk">Phantom Blade Zero</a>. Marcus Stewart caught up with the indie masters at Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games to dig into what makes <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/digging-for-gems">Mina the Hollower</a> such an exciting prospect. Charles Harte spoke with the team behind <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/suiting-back-up">Dispatch</a> about rising from the ruins of Telltale Games to create a humorous superhero game. We also have a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/a-conversation-with-matt-mercer">conversation with prolific voice actor and <em>Critical Role</em> dungeon master extraordinaire Matt Mercer</a>, as well as a piece from award-winning comedy writer Mike Drucker about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/08/26/roberta-quest">the legacy of King's Quest and its creator Roberta Williams</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Includes a look at 'gameplay'</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/11/random-ghibli-inspired-animation-of-zeldas-castle-town-looks-even-better-in-third-person">exceptional work</a> carried out to reimagine <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> with Ghibli-inspired visuals, animator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RwanLink">RwanLink</a> is back with another stunning short film.</p>
<p>This time, it's focused on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Zelda: Majora's Mask</a> to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary, which commenced back in April to align with the game's release in Japan in 2000. And holy moly, the short film is absolutely stunning! Not only are the visuals alone simply beautiful to look at, but the overall direction is stellar, and the soundtrack from 'Mosik' really adds to the emotion.</p>
<p>The whole thing took around 8 months to complete, with RwanLink pouring around 40 hours a week into the passion project. The result is absolutely astonishing; there are just so many cool little details, including the cheeky inclusion of some <em>actual</em> Ghibli characters in and around Clock Town.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the cutscene-style presentation, we also get a glimpse at what gameplay might look like if Zelda: Majora's Mask were built with Ghibli-inspired visuals. It's pretty neat. Finally, in a rather touching conclusion, RwanLink himself removes his own mask to reveal his face, thanking fans and Patreon members for their support over the years.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-netease-backed-studio-has-closed-without-releasing-a-game.1280874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another NetEase studio has had its funding pulled without releasing a game, and this time, it's the turn of T-Minus Zero Entertainment and its founder, BioWare and Sony veteran Rich Vogel.</p>

<p>The news was announced by Vogel <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-vogel-093425/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over on LinkedIn</a>, where he says that T-Minus Zero Entertainment's "journey" with NetEase is "coming to an end". Vogel says that he and his studio have been unable to "secure the funding [it needs] at this time" due to "current market conditions".</p>

<p>Although Vogel doesn't technically say that T-Minus Zero is shutting down, he does say later in the post that the studio's "talented team members will continue to explore new opportunities", so even if the studio is only entering hibernation, it sounds like Vogel doesn't expect a windfall anytime soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-the-old-republic-rich-vogel-netease.jpg?itok=VIRUv5Ax 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-the-old-republic-rich-vogel-netease.jpg?itok=090kj6Rc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might know Rich Vogel's name from games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Vogel founded T-Minus Zero Entertainment <a href="https://ir.netease.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netease-games-introduces-t-minus-zero-entertainment-new-global" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a>, at which point he also revealed that his studio was working on an "online multiplayer-focused third-person action title set in a sci-fi universe".</p>

<p>In his LinkedIn post, Vogel says that the project (which is presumably the same one that was revealed at the studio's founding) had a "fully playable hands-on demo", but that this demo was unable to attract funding despite garnering "a lot of interest".</p>

<p>Perhaps Vogel can take some solace in the fact that his is far from the only studio to have NetEase pull the plug on it. Back in November last year, Worlds Untold, the studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>'s Mac Walters, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">made the decision to "pause operations"</a> amid NetEase pulling its funding.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that didn't manage to release any games, either; the NetEase outfit responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which was based largely in Seattle, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down back in February</a>&nbsp;despite the fact that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>appears to be a resounding success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-rich-vogel.jpg?itok=PYUfhNj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-netease-rich-vogel.jpg?itok=mtQx0FdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' success couldn't prevent its development team from being shut down.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear what Vogel intends to do next, but it looks pretty certain that we've heard the last of T-Minus Zero Entertainment, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things industry-related.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a> developers Enhance have released a new demo for their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a> on Steam, alongside news that the spacey rhythm attack game will launch on November 11th. If you missed Tetris Effect, it's a game about making deletable lines out of falling blocks while standing in the middle of a very musical supernova.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise, meanwhile, sees you arranging blocks into 2X2 scoreable combinations, which are removed from the playing field by a horizontally sweeping Time Line. While standing in the middle of a very musical supernova.</p><!--more-->

<p>There have been eight previous Lumines releases, including remasters, on various platforms since the first game's appearance in 2004. This one is a collaboration with Monstars Inc, who also worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rez-infinite">Rez Infinite</a>. I played a bit of Lumines Arise earlier this year, and spoke to an Enhance developer about its new emphasis on expressing "the human", which is what sets it apart thematically from Tetris Effect. I'll get that write-up turned around before the release date. If I don't, feel free to quote this piece at me aggressively in the comments on any and all subsequent news articles.</p><p>In the short term, I'll say that Arise is yet another pacey and flamboyant puzzler that drizzles your occipital lobe in (for example) footage of frenzied chameleons, while challenging your primary motor cortex to save you from total visual constipation. Yes, it's making bits of your brain fight each other. I like when games do that.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm interested to make sense of Arise being a more "human" game than Effect. Much as I enjoyed Tetris Effect, I entertain suspicions that Enhance's framing of Arise might be bullshit artistry. Perhaps "more human" just means there are more human figures in the background art. Come to think of it, I'm not sure the devs mentioned Enhance's most recent game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humanity">Humanity</a>, during my hands-on - RPS reviewer Kim Armstrong <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humanity-review">witheringly summarised</a> that as "perfect puzzles pumped with existential hot air".</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3847360/Lumines_Arise_Demo/">Here's the Steam link for the demo</a>, which will be available from today, August 26th till September 3rd. It includes three stages from the single-player Journey mode and a bit of new multiplayer mode Burst Battle, which can be played online cross-platform. The full game has VR compatibility but there's none of that nonsense in the demo, and they've locked the difficulty to easy. They don't want to scare you away, after all.</p>
<p>Those damn fool editors of RPS gone by never found time to review Tetris Effect, but they did put it on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">best VR games</a>.</p>

              <p>Good morning and good day. I welcome you all back to Morning Checkpoint. Drink some coffee. Eat a bagel. Go to the bathroom. Now with all that out of the way, let’s get to some news and other stuff. Today, we have a <em>Marvel Rivals</em> leak, a giant <em>Zelda</em> collection, trouble in <em>Roblox</em>, and a new <em>Lumines</em> demo that won’t be around for long. Oh, and some new gameplay of a <em>Fallout/Doom</em> mod that looks sweet.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> leak seemingly reveals Deadpool is coming</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-teases-deadpool-daredevil/">As spotted by <em>Insider Gaming</em>,</a> a <em>Marvel Rivals</em> leaker has shared some new voice lines that seemingly reveal Deadpool is coming to the popular online free-to-play hero shooter. In a video posted on Twitter on August 25, leaker XOXLeak shared two alleged Deadpool voice lines as well as a host of replies from other characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> referencing the Merc With A Mouth. That same leaker also shared evidence that Daredevil is coming to <em>Rivals</em>, too.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hero voice interactions w/ Deadpool <a href="https://t.co/MSGT2fSTtU">pic.twitter.com/MSGT2fSTtU</a></p> <p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1960089802709356544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s possible these audio files are fake or were included in the game’s data to throw off dataminers. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/no-marvel-rivals-developer-netease-isnt-intentionally-planting-fake-leaks-to-mess-with-everyone-but-its-datamined-characters-arent-guaranteed-to-appear-in-the-future-either/">The devs behind the game have explained</a> that not <em>every</em> piece of content datamined from the game will end up in <em>Rivals</em>. And AI voice-gen tools are better than ever these days, so these audio lines could all be fake.&nbsp; But Deadpool has been a rumored <em>Rivals</em> character for a bit now, and he’s a very popular Marvel hero, so it seems likely he’ll be added in the future.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Lumines Arise</em> gets a demo, but just for a week</strong></h2> <p>Rejoice, as we now have a release date for <em>Lumines Arise</em>, the next entry in the wonderful music puzzler series. It’s out in November on PS5 and PC. Nice! <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lumines-arise-gets-a-demo-on-ps5-and-steam-to-celebrate-its-release-date-announcement-but-its-for-one-week-only/">And a demo for the game has been shadow-dropped on PS5 and Steam</a>, which is cool. But sadly, this demo will only be around for a week. Bleh. But hey, I can’t complain about getting to play more <em>Lumines</em> for free, even if it’s just for a week. We must all cherish the good news during these dark days.</p> <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> players were disappointed by Lady Gaga’s <em>Dress To Impress</em> event</strong></h2> <p>Over the weekend, one of <em>Roblox’s</em> biggest games, <em>Dress To Impress</em>, held a large in-game event featuring Lady Gaga. The famous singer and actress was actually playing the game and fans were excited to meet her and hear her speak. However, that didn’t happen. Lady Gaga hung out in a separate server where only a few select players and influencers could interact with her, and she communicated via text chat. When some fans got angry about this, a community manager for the game reportedly said on stream: “None of you are forced to be here. If you’re unhappy, just leave.” Needless to say, it was a mess.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi everyone. We would like to take the opportunity to apologise to you and take accountability. We took the time to read over messages sent by a lot of you in the chat.</p> <p>I want to begin by apologising for my defensiveness personally. As a community manager, it is not professional…</p> <p>— Dress To Impress (@_Dress2Impress) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Dress2Impress/status/1959707211262734787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dress-to-impress-lady-gaga-meet-and-greet-leaves-fans-disappointed/1100-6534261/">On August 23, as reported by <em>GameSpot</em>,</a> <em>Dress To Impres</em>s posted <a href="https://x.com/_Dress2Impress/status/1959707211262734787">a lengthy apology on Twitter</a>. In the message, the community manager apologized for her behavior, and the devs explained why the event was so limited. They blamed <em>Roblox’s</em> tech limits for the lack of Lady Gaga’s voice being broadcast to players and said limited server space was to blame for the lack of a real meet and greet. The folks behind the online dress-up game are promising to do better in the future.</p>

 <h2><strong>The largest collection of <em>Zelda</em> stuff in the world</strong></h2> <p>Constantine Adams, a software engineer from Fairfax, Virginia, has the largest collection of <em>Legend of Zelda</em> memorabilia in the world, according to The Guinness Book of World Records. <a href="https://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/legend-zelda-collection-fairfax-city-worlds-largest-guinness">As reported by Patch,</a> the collection contains over 4,000 items and is housed in the collector’s large basement. In July, Guinness confirmed it to be the largest in the world.</p> <p>“I’ve been very quiet about my collection for a long time,” Adams told the outlet. “It was just a goal, right? There was something challenging to do, and I enjoyed it. It was hard at times. I’m not jumping up and down because of it. But now’s my time to show it off and say, ‘Here it is.’”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Overwatch 2</em>‘s director is aware of the game’s horrible Steam rating</strong></h2> <p>Things are looking up for <em>Overwatch 2</em> these days. The game’s Stadium mode has been celebrated by many players, and its new characters have been popular. But over on Steam, <em>Overwatch 2</em>‘s overall rating is still a “mostly negative” 25 percent. <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch-2/gamescom-2025-interview"><em>PCGamesN</em> asked</a> <em>Overwatch 2</em> game director Aaron Keller if he was aware of the low score.</p> <p>“It’s something that I do think about a lot. Our active players are telling us, ‘Hey, the game is in the best state that it’s ever been in, or has been in for a really long time. You have to reconcile that with the reputation from a much broader gaming community,” Keller told the outlet.</p> <p>“[That reputation] is one of the reasons we’re taking bigger swings&nbsp; – we’re trying to break through some of that noise and let players who may have written<em>&nbsp;Overwatch 2</em>&nbsp;off know that there’s still really exciting things happening in this game. I think if the players who stopped playing a year ago or two years ago jumped in right now, they’d recognize that there is something&nbsp;very different&nbsp;about the game, and that it’s come a really long way. I think that it has leveled up as a competitive&nbsp;FPS game. It’s giving players more strategic choice inside of a match, and, if you look at Stadium, there’s more ways to transform the way any hero plays.”</p> <h2><strong>ICYMI:&nbsp;</strong></h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/replaced-release-date-cyberpunk-pixel-art-batman-arkham-2000620061"><em>Replaced</em>, that cool-looking cybernoir action game, has a new release date</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-delta-3-remake-ps5-pro-performance-mode-2000620023">That new <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> remake isn’t running well on consoles</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/us-open-tennis-medvedev-bonzi-delay-crowd-yelling-booing-racket-smash-2000620025">The US Open was delayed for a bit because the crowd wouldn’t stop booing</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fallout: Bakersfield Extended Gameplay Footage" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L0Wv6kkloCU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
