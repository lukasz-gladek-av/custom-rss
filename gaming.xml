			<p>On the surface, Fading Serenades is a game about delivering packages on a tiny island, managing your inventory, getting to know the inhabitants, and living a quiet life. Underneath that, though, is a story about a sinister world away from the island, with constant surveillance and the threat of the Fade. The island has its own secret too, lost for years after the resident scientist disappeared.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fading Serenades - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edaqyzKY6MY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fading Serenades tells the story of Callum and his robot pal Par, who is not just a companion but a required piece of equipment that all people from the mainland are expected to carry with them at all times. However, on Clifford Island the technology from the mainland does not quite work as it should, so there is some more freedom there. It is a refuge that few go to and the only inhabitants left are a few older people living out their lives farming, fishing, fixing things, and taking life at a slower pace. </p>


<p>They have some contact with the mainland, but mostly they send packages to each other. &nbsp;The story hints at a lot of big things happening in the wider world, but the ending does not quite land as it should because there is a bit of vagueness and loose threads.</p>


<p>As the courier, you are responsible for picking up and delivering packages to the island’s inhabitants, fitting them into your backpack. Packages are different shapes and sizes so it is not easy to carry everything at once, though you can upgrade the capacity of the backpack. Going from point A to B means clearing obstacles like climbing walls, jumping across rocks and walking along logs to cross streams. There are minigames where you either have to press the correct buttons or balance yourself, which is impacted by the weight of the items in your bag. </p>
<p>They are simple games but add a nice little distraction and a bit of risk. Fail and you’ll fall which can damage the items you are carrying. The inhabitants also have missions for you too, which all boil down to finding things and bringing them. The thing is that the items start repeating quite quickly, and each character just has the one additional collection mission which repeats. For example, Baron asks for two logs every couple of days. Logs that can be found in the same place each time.</p>

<p>In addition to couriering, there are a couple of other things to do on the island namely finding and lighting the shrines. These shrines improve your stamina. You can also buy pamphlets that reduce the time to traverse between areas. This is important because each day has a time limit to complete jobs. Once it passes 10pm, you need to be in bed otherwise you will pass out somewhere and be taken to bed. If you get to bed in time, you’ll wake up at 6am but if you pass out on the island you will not wake up until 9am. </p>
<p>Fading Serenades is a chill game to play, including with the daily time limit, because there are no major consequences and you can complete the story in a little over four hours. It has a nice pixel aesthetic too which looks very colourful. Music is also important in Fading Serenades, and the songs in each area sound good too.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Fading Serenades is a nice, chill courier game on a nice little island where life is pretty laid back. But there are hints of something more sinister that the story explores in a bit of detail, but not enough. The game can get repetitive quite quickly, but it looks and sounds good.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Fallout 76 is <strong>finally </strong>getting a native version of the game in 2026, with a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X &amp; S version being released in a few months. This announcement came amid the news that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-getting-anniversary-edition-november/">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> <strong>and </strong>a Switch 2 version are also incoming.</p>



<p>Not much information was given away, but this is something that Fallout 76 fans have been wanting for a very long time. What’s next on the list is crossplay, but we doubt that it’ll ever come.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76-current-gen-upgrade-coming">Fallout 76 Current-Gen Upgrade Coming</h2>



<p>During the Fallout Day broadcast, Bill LaCoste, lead producer, revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Early next year, a native version of Fallout 76 will be coming to Xbox Series S and X and PlayStation 5. This update will take full advantage of their hardware capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fallout 76 is the most up-to-date Fallout game on the market, taking the form of an open-world MMORPG that took the rulebook tied to Fallout and threw it clean out the window in 2018. It has since become the cash cow of the series, and Bethesda Game Studios has kept the game pumped full of updates.</p>



<p>It’s easy to assume what will arrive with the current-gen upgrade of Fallout 76, of course.</p>



<p>We can envision higher base resolutions, a higher frame rate (60 FPS upgrade, most likely), cleaner textures, and faster loading times. That’s usually the run-of-the-mill stuff associated with current-gen upgrades, and Fallout 76 on <strong>consoles </strong>has long needed them.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the current-gen version of Fallout 76 being released? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

There will also be premium edition for $100 that will only be available digitally.</p><p>At launch, the Switch 2 port will have all of the content updates released since the game's debut except for the first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">Claws of Awaji</a>. Switch 2 users will have to wait until 2026 for that. However, the Switch 2 version will support cross-platform progression through Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>"We are delighted to bring Assassin's Creed Shadows to Nintendo players," game director Charles Benoit said in a statement. "Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>An update released for Shadows in September added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-what-we-all-wanted-a-cat-dressed-like-ezio/1100-6534658/" data-ref-id="1100-6534658">a cat dressed like Enzio</a>, one of the fan-favorite characters in the Assassin's Creed franchise. A recent report revealed that Ubisoft began developing an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Assassin's Creed title set during the American Civil War</a> and the Reconstruction era. However, the project was canceled because it was considered to be too controversial.</p>

<p>New features also get a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As we approach the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, The Pokémon Company has lifted the lid on a brand new expansion that will be arriving in the app next week.</p>
<p>The "Mega Rising' expansion bursts onto the scene one week today, on <strong>30th October</strong>, and, as the name suggests, it'll bring a Mega Evolution twist to proceedings. Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken and Mega Altaria take to the covers of this new set, and all users will receive one of each on launch day <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>That's to celebrate the app's one-year anniversary, for which TPC has announced new Special Missions, and reissued Special Drop and Wonder Pick events. The "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">New and Updated</a>" app features that were teased earlier this month will also arrive on 30th October, so keep an eye out for improved Wonder Picks, a new share feature, and an expanded number of tradable cards.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at some of the chase cards from the new expansion:</p>


<p>While this writer wishes the new releases would slow down a little, we can't imagine that it'll happen any time soon. The Pokémon Company today announced that the app has surpassed 150 million downloads in its first year, which is a <em>crazy</em> number when you think about it. Expect the new expansions to keep on rolling out, we guess.</p>

              <p>It certainly looks like it’s going to be a joke. When you create an extraction shooter, but then theme it around cartoon ducks and give it a spoof name based on one of the most popular examples of the genre, it’s hard not to assume <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/"><em>Escape from Duckov</em></a> is just a goof. But I’m here to tell you, nope, this is a solid and astonishingly compelling PvE looter-shooter that deserves every one of its million sales.</p> <p>I’m not a big extraction shooter guy. (These are first- or third-person games that are generally about entering a battlefield and attempting to harvest as much loot and progress as you can, then extracting yourself before either a timer runs out or you get killed.) This high risk/high reward model tends to feel too stressful to me, and never more so than when it’s all about surviving the attacks of an enemy team of real, human players. It’s like a roguelite but with other people laughing at you, and where loss not only means you don’t keep anything you found, but also anything you arrived with. However, it turns out all I needed was for it to be about ducks.</p>

  <p>Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em> (the lead developer of the five-person Chinese team behind the game told me he’s an avid, hardcore player), but utterly dissimilar in so many important ways, <em>Escape from Duckov</em> strips the formula down to something that feels far more approachable, although just as ruthless. The game is entirely PvE, and played in single-player, but those web-footed CPU enemies aren’t even vaguely friendly. You’re going to die a <em>lot</em>. But importantly, you’re not going to mind nearly as much.</p>

 <p>The game begins with the most delightful character creator, in which you build yourself a duck avatar with a lot more variety than you might imagine that concept could offer. The wide, blank, pupil-less eyes were irresistible to me, but I could have chosen anything from buttons to metallic binocular-like protrusions. You can have regular cartoon duck legs, or the utter abomination that is human feet. And given this is an offline premium game with no mercenary in-game purchases, you can change up your look any time you want. You then arrive in your bunker, a large, mostly empty space, but for your little bedroom off the side. Down here is Jeff, your duck companion who will show you the ropes, set you quests, and guide you through the process of building out your base.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638622">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To do this, you’re going to need loot, and to get that, you’re going to have to go outside. So originally armed with nothing but a pointy stick, you need to start making tentative ventures into the green and pleasant realm above. It’s just it’s populated by furious birds (and wolves) holding powerful weapons, all determined for unexplained reasons to kill you on sight.</p>

 <p><em>Escape from Duckov</em>‘s greatest trick is just how well it’s designed around welcoming you in. Those early trips can certainly be tricky, but you’ll very quickly be armed (winged?) with a revolver, shooting down opponents (into really quite horrendously gibby goop), and scooping up all the loot from their amusing cooked-carcass remains. You’ll then do all that extraction shooter goodness, like sneaking into abandoned buildings and emptying the cupboards, daring to head a little further each time. The key point is, the game very carefully doesn’t overwhelm you at first, but subtly ramps up those earliest areas once you’re ready to cope. You’re motivated by those early quests, like finding a flat-head screwdriver to fix the local radio tower, but also by that far more powerful drive: revenge. If a group of ducks took you down last time, well, first you’ll want to return to that spot because you’ve got one chance to recover everything you died carrying, but you’ll also want to wipe the smiles off their beaks right away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638627">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And then the loop has its webbed claws into you. Soon you’ll be adding new stations to your base, letting you craft better health items, weapons, and various other elements essential for crafting the next thing on the compelling list. And each of those stations have upgrade paths themselves. Friendly ducks you meet will end up moving in to run some stations, such as a gym or a weapon-modification store, each with their own quests to give you. Everything you add adds more, becomes another to-do list of improvements to loot for, and drives you to be ever-more brave on your expeditions.</p>

 <p>Holding you back are two elements: nighttime and the Storm. The former is fairly easily dealt with: you can either brave the far more dangerous world, or just go to bed and wait for morning. The latter happens every few hundred in-game hours, and at first just makes the outside world inaccessible for a while (it’s a good chance to get busywork done, or you can just sleep past it). But only at first, because of course this too is an opportunity for progression as you start to seek out a means to survive the purple mists.</p> <p>That’s the core of why&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> is so great, and so successful: it just keeps expanding its scope as you increase your ability to survive, and this loop is so wonderfully compulsive. Of course, this also means that the risk inherent in your run grows so much more, as you head off in your best suit of armor and carrying your finest guns, only to get walloped a few feet from a previously undiscovered extraction point. Then you have to decide, do I risk the exact same super-dangerous run again to recover it all, but this time—you know—without all the equipment you’re trying to rescue? Or do you give it up as heartbreakingly lost, shake it off, and rebuild? (The latter, by the way, is generally the smarter option. I always pick the former.)</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638626"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638626">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So for as silly as it looks, and as daftly as it’s named, this isn’t a goof. This is a fantastic and superbly crafted game that continuously draws you further in like falling down a spiral. There’s a really good reason it’s already sold a million copies in its first week since launch. Extraordinarily, for a single-player game, it’s currently the fifth-most played game on Steam, ahead of even&nbsp;<em>Rust</em> and&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, peaking at over a quarter of a million simultaneous players just yesterday. It also has an extraordinary 96-percent positive rating on Steam from nearly 15,000 reviews.</p> <p>And yes, it has me completely hooked. I’m writing this so late in my day because I didn’t want to stop playing and get on with my job. I’m going right back to it now that I’m done. And it’s hard to give a game more credit than that.</p>

<p>During the Fallout Day Showcase, Bethesda Game Studios unveiled a <strong>new trailer for Fallout 4</strong>, ten years after it hit the market in 2015. The trailer, which was kind of better than anything published before the game came out, revealed that an ANNIVERSARY EDITION is coming to the market on November 10.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition of Fallout 4 will come with all expansions, plus Creations is being added to the game, bringing a whole host of curated expansions, mods, and other upgrades and changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-by-bethesda">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Announced by Bethesda</h2>



<p>Today’s Fallout Day bonanza included a stunning announcement: Fallout 4 is coming back with an Anniversary Edition. It has been ten years since the best-selling title dropped, and it’s still one of the most popular Fallout experiences ever made.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition comes with all DLCs and expansions released for the game in the years that followed the launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>



<li>Far Harbor</li>



<li>Automatron</li>



<li>Nuka-World</li>



<li>Contraptions Workshop</li>



<li>Wasteland Workshop</li>



<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>
</ul>



<p>More than 150 Creations will be added to Fallout 4 via the Anniversary Edition, and Bethesda also revealed that the game will feature <strong>unreleased items</strong>, just to keep things feeling fresh. These items will be discoverable through a new menu, added in an upcoming update to Fallout 4 – you won’t need the Anniversary Edition to obtain this content.</p>

                <p>A new advertisement from Razer is making the rounds on TikTok and proving, yet again, that old-fashioned sexism in gaming is alive and well. Though meant to help promote the tech company's noise cancelling headphones, the ad instead reinforces the stereotype that women--who make up <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">48% of all gamers</a>, by the way--simply can't stop talking.</p><p>Accompanied by the caption "Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning," <a href="https://v45.tiktokcdn-us.com/089da21650d5c53cd0ece9bdffdedac2/68fd05f3/video/tos/useast8/tos-useast8-ve-0068c002-tx2/oEix9o0qfABiQjBlEpAbswEAGiRgfmoBCViIE6/?a=1233&amp;bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&amp;ch=0&amp;cr=3&amp;dr=0&amp;lr=all&amp;cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C&amp;cv=1&amp;br=1858&amp;bt=929&amp;cs=0&amp;ds=3&amp;ft=4KLxRMzm8Zmo0TugXI4jVXOeQpWrKsd.&amp;mime_type=video_mp4&amp;qs=0&amp;rc=M2c5ZjQ8OWg3Omg3aTw7ZUBpMzVyO2s5cmx5NTMzaTczNEBhMi1hXzIwXjExMzFgMzM2YSNxMmxsMmRzYGFhLS1kMTJzcw%3D%3D&amp;vvpl=1&amp;l=202510231716183F8AFA4B6A9D6205A3D7&amp;btag=e000bd000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the ad</a> (first noticed by PC Gamer) depicts a man and woman sitting on a couch together. The man, both holding a controller and wearing a headset, awkwardly shuffles as the woman emphatically speaks to him. After a few moments, he decides to activate the headset's Active Noise Cancellation feature. The woman's voice is drowned out, while the text on the video reads: "Active Noise Cancellation: On, Drama: Off." As of October 23, the advertisement is still up on TikTok.</p><p>Considering Razer's history of making <a href="https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-headsets-and-audio/kraken-kitty-line?srsltid=AfmBOorPF5lRBMw9zdVmy9cmMGcbxDiM02bQkIhk8yRN4bujxcZAvGeP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cute accessories geared towards female audiences</a>, the advertisement comes as a bit of a shock. Though the ad might not be intentionally sexist, it plays into long-standing gender roles and is extremely dismissive towards the large population of women who also play video games. Coincidentally, a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent study</a> by the Entertainment Software Association found there is a "nearly equal gender split" among video game players.</p><p>The response to the ad has been primarily negative, with users writing comments like "welp guess I'm done with razer after 15 years," "I just put my razer headphones in the bin," and "the casual misogyny is INSANE" in response. Per PC Gamer, TikTok users are also taking to other Razer videos to express their discontent, with the top comment on an ad for the company's Razer Kuromi headset reading, "razer's sexist btw."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Razer for comment.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shown a bit more of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, though apparently by accident. Two 15-second commercials for the Switch 2 were found, both unlisted on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel, and one includes a brief glimpse of a boss fight that we haven't seen before. Those hypersensitive to spoilers should turn away.</p><p>Both unlisted videos, uploaded on October 15, are titled "Power Up Your Holidays," with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZEWTy9xpk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first video</a> showcasing the previously seen plant-like boss Carvex. But more noteworthy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second video</a>, which emphasizes the Switch 2 version's use of mouse controls and 120fps support, while also giving us our first look at a boss called Xelios. And this boss is spherical!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtEt0Cudt8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grtEt0Cudt8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We only see it for a few seconds, but Xelios appears to be composed of several hexagonal plates that can shift around, with a green sac and pink core at its center. Presumably, you as Samus Aran will have to blast that pink center to hell whenever this sphere-like boss exposes it.</p><p>With only slivers of information to go on, there aren't too many conclusions about the story and events of Metroid Prime 4 we can make, but the existence of Xelios confirms a couple of trends.</p><p>First, there's a clear naming indication with these bosses, with the early-game enemy Aberax (as seen in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W9xes7BZto?si=4oERcI-JJq88Ev7d&amp;t=683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>) and the aforementioned Carvex and Xelios. They, along with the main villain Sylux, all have the letter X in their names, not unlike the members of Organization XIII in Kingdom Hearts. Don't expect any crazy crossover, though.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0yz3tTS0xPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, footage of the Aberax fight shows the enemy being possessed by a Metroid before it attacks Samus, gaining new abilities and green sacs and pink nuclei similar to those of Metroids. It's possible that the other bosses we've seen are also fused with Metroids. Whatever the case is, it looks like Metroid Prime 4 is heavily emphasizing the "Metroid" part of the title.</p><p>Both commercial videos are still unlisted, but they indicate that Nintendo is priming (pun intended) the game for holiday-season marketing of the Switch 2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">out just in time for the holidays</a> on December 4, but fans eager to digest anything Metroid-related can look forward to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-1-3-trilogy-visual-retrospective-book-preorder-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release/1100-6528042/" data-ref-id="1100-6528042">Metroid Prime 1-3 visual retrospective book</a> this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the desperate arguments for AI is that it will help people be creative without all the practice and hard work that goes into actually creating something–that, as science fiction writer Ted Chiang wrote at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Yorker</a> last year, “art can be all inspiration and no perspiration.” A world where whatever enters your head can be immediately externalized is already one of the best reasons for deleting all your social media accounts, but lately we’ve seen politicians use generative AI to show us the unfettered horrors of their brains, and completely remove the wall between them, their cruelty, and the rest of us.</p><p>Donald Trump is of course a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/13/ai-is-opening-a-maga-trump-split-00534925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan</a>, creating AI videos that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/trump-racist-deepfake-video-jeffries-schumer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mock Democratic leaders</a> and, after last weekend’s No Kings protests, depict him <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-no-kings-ai-poop-jet-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumping shit</a> on protestors from a fighter jet. Vice President JD Vance called the Democrat videos “funny” and told reporters they would stop if Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries did what Republicans wanted; <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5563504-speaker-johnson-trump-no-kings-ai-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaker Mike Johnson</a> called the plane shit video “satire” and praised Trump for using “social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that.”</p><p>Lately, NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo has gotten into the AI game, saying during the first of NYC’s two mayoral debates last week that one his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581418/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takeaways</a> from his rout in the primary was that he “did not do enough on social media” compared to his opponent and front runner <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>. On October 1 he released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCgSirfbjc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially AI video</a> of himself doing jobs he doesn’t actually do, like window washer and stage hand. This week, he released an utterly bizarre AI-generated smear ad against Mamdani, a riff on <em>Austin Powers’</em> Mini-Me that compares Mamdani to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. “There’s no such thing as talent; socialism means we’re all equally dumb!” a squeaky-voiced rendering of Mamdani cheers, while fake de Blasio looks everywhere but at the viewer as if even he knows how dumb this is.</p><p>This ad is off-putting and desperate and dated, but at least its contents just feel like an off-putting and desperate and dated political ad from Cuomo, a man who is himself all of those things. The same can’t be said of another AI video reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/cuomo-zohran-mamdani-ai-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded and then deleted</a> by the official Cuomo Twitter account during last night’s debate. Shared by Zeteo reporter Prem Thakker, the over two minute video shows various AI-rendered people identifying themselves as “criminals for Zohran” and celebrating the idea that he’ll make their crimes–which include shoplifting, drunk driving, and domestic abuse–legal.&nbsp;</p><p>The video starts with an AI-generated Mamdani frollicking through NYC’s streets and eating rice with his hands, and then continues to be awful: a guy who looks a lot like Idris Elba puts on a medical mask and keffiyeh before shoplifting from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24025691/shoplifting-scare-criminal-justice-reform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pharmacy</a>; a cliche 1970s movie pimp stands before a windowless van full of presumably sex-trafficked women. In a nod to equality, I guess, white people are also portrayed as criminals, with an old lady driving around drinking out of a paper bag before crashing her car, and a scene where a woman with a name tag that says “social worker” encourages a man it’s suggested is beating his wife to take deep breaths to “kumbaya the situation.” “Globalize the intifada,” one of Cuomo’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite phrases</a> to hurl against Mamdani, makes an appearance as pro-Palestinian protestors burn an American flag. Because it’s AI, several of these offensive, NYC scaremongering stereotypes become different people through the course of the ad; the old lady, the pimp, and Idris Elba all look younger at points. But even if AI can’t even give us consistent characters to follow along on their crime sprees, the essential message comes through: New York is full of bad guys, and if Mamdani becomes mayor, those bad guys will burn the city to the ground, as seen in the last shot of the video.</p><p>This would be an appalling ad even if it featured real actors and locations, but I suppose you could argue it would have created some local jobs and thus contributed to the economy Cuomo wants his hands on. But as AI, with all the technology’s wobbles and flaws and weird lighting, it lays bare exactly <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how stupid</a> Cuomo thinks voters are–that we are so weak and terrified that we would take this message seriously no matter the grubby package it comes in. This isn’t a surprise coming from the angry, self-righteous man we’ve seen on the campaign trail, one whose supporters considered trying to freak us out with an altered image of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani with a thicker beard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We already know this about AI, that its boosters think we will guzzle <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/762594/fable-showrunner-edwatch-saatchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any slop they feed us</a> simply because <em>they</em> are the ones feeding it to us. But these AI posts reveal less about the general population’s tastes and insecurities than they do the people making them. With AI providing a direct route from Trump and Cuomo’s brains to our screens, we get an unrestricted tour through their heads. They can show us exactly how angry and afraid they are, without even an actor to try to put a spin on it or a local street corner we can recognize. It’s the kind of stuff you could imagine them dumping out in a therapy session with Cuomo’s fake social worker: <em>I am scared everyone is out to get me, I would like to take a big wet crap on people who are mean to me</em>. Fake de Blasio can’t look us in the eye because AI doesn’t understand eye contact, but it also gives Cuomo’s gross fantasy a sense of shame, like some part of him knows these are not the kinds of thoughts you should shout out in public, like he knows these are not the kinds of emotions that should rule a person’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a sort of intimacy here that could almost be humanizing. The vulnerability in art made by humans can help us understand why people do the bad things they do, but stripped of craft or the self-reflection required to <em>make</em> something, the videos show them as not just vicious but also lazy, like even expressing their deepest insecurities isn’t worth their own time. AI gives us <em>too much</em> intimacy with these men. It gives them the uncut ability not just to externalize their crap in the limited words of Twitter and Truth Social, where a reader would then have to translate it into their own imagination, but in sound and color and the wavering facsimile of humans, the way they must experience their fantasies when they close their eyes and indulge them. They can show us, effortlessly, exactly what they see in their heads, without anything to get between us and their thoughts. We can live in their brains with all the vivid, inescapable impact that they want to bring to bear on the real world. </p><p>Using AI isn’t just a quick way for them to make their videos. It’s another expression of the power they have, and what they’ve turned power into: not just the freedom to shape laws or economics to their desires, but the freedom to be easily and unreservedly their worst selves at all times and make the rest of us live with it.

<p>Sneaky...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Ubisoft have finally confirmed the world's worst-kept secret: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is launching on the Switch 2 on 2nd December 2025. Darn, that is a <em>packed</em> first week of the last month of 2025, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Rumours have</a> been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-may-clash-with-metroid-prime-4">swirling about</a> this one for a few weeks now, but the announcement confirms a couple of rather lovely features. It'll cost <strong>USD</strong> <strong>$59.99</strong> and will be available on the eShop or as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>First up, cross-progression is available as long as you have an Ubisoft Connect account! So if you've been playing on another console up until now and want to swap to the hybrid system for the holiday season, you won't lose your progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, here's something we didn't expect: touchscreen support. All the in-game menus will allow you to use the touchscreen when playing in handheld mode. That includes the world map, too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">a blog post</a>, Ubisoft has also detailed Title Updates 10 and 11 for the game. Those updates will be available on the Switch 2 version from release, and these bring Corrupted Castles, parkour updates, new free story updates, and new environmental puzzles. Note that the Claws of Awaji expansion won't be available until early 2026.</p>
<p>For those who missed it earlier in the year, Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on other consoles on 20th March 2025. Taking the series to Feudal Japan, you play as both the shinobi Naoe or the samurai Yasuke, both of whom play very differently. Naoe feels like your more traditional series protagonist, focusing on stealthy gameplay, while Yasuke is much more direct in combat.</p>
<p>Our sister site Push Square were fans upon its original release, awarding the game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows">an 8/10</a>, concluding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series — and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch."</p>
</blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/project-tal-is-a-stunning-new-open-world-action-rpg-slated-for-2027.1333045/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean publisher WEMADE MAX and developer MADNGINE have unveiled a new open world action RPG called Project TAL with a stunning trailer. </p>



<p>In this single player game, which is currently scheduled to arrive on PC and consoles in 2027, players will explore a reimagining of Korea's traditional Tal masks and the mythology and folklore surrounding them. Project TAL features cinematic and fast-paced combat where players can leap onto massive monsters to deliver powerful attacks, exploit enemy weak spots, and perform tactical counterattacks and skill combos.</p>



<p>One of the game's core features is a companion system that responds dynamically to the player’s combat style and the environment. Each NPC companion featured in the game has unique abilities, personalities and combat roles ranging from defence and support to melee, ranged and magic. Players will experience seamless moments of cooperation in Project TAL, such as catching a falling companion in the heat of battle or witnessing a support companion deploy a magical barrier to deflect enemy attacks away from the party.</p>



<p>Sohn Myun-seok, CEO of WEMADE MAX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Project TAL combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG. With MADNGINE’s technical expertise and artistic vision, we’re creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage.</em></p>

<iframe title="Project TAL – Official Announcement &amp; Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>WEMADE MAX and MADNGINE previously worked together on the MMORPG Night Crows, which launched in Korea in 2023 and globally last year. However, Project TAL is a far cry from it, being a single player action-oriented roleplaying game for PC and consoles, whereas Night Crows is an MMORPG for PC and mobile with blockchain-powered play-to-earn features.</p>



<p>According to the press release, MADNGINE has recently established a 'multi-production creative structure' to develop multiple new franchises, such as Project TAL. Going forward, it will focus on high-end genres, platform diversity and technological scalability.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-impressive-switch-2-port-ubisoft-december-2000638603</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the worst-kept secrets of 2025 has finally been officially announced by Ubisoft.<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, the latest entry in the publisher’s sneaky-stabby series of open-world games, is getting a Switch 2 port later this year.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://youtu.be/OzyD_EFZzgc">Ubisoft officially revealed</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. This version of the game will support full cross progression across all platforms and will also feature touchscreen support for all in-game menus, though you’ll be able to use a controller, too. The recently released expansion for <em>AC Shadows</em>, <em>Claws of Awaji</em>, won’t be available for Switch 2 players until “early next year.”</p>

 <p>Here’s the first trailer for the Switch 2 port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</em> which appears to show a seemingly impressive-looking port of the massive and <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">gorgeous open-world game</a> set in feudal Japan.</p>  <p>“We are delighted to bring <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to Nintendo players,” said <em>AC Shadows</em> director Charles Benoit in a press release announcing the port. “Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s incredible-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">Switch 2 port of<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> earlier this year</a> showed that the company can bring its high-end blockbusters to Nintendo’s less-powerful hardware while still making sure the games look great. And this first trailer for <em>Shadows</em> running on Switch 2 looks equally impressive, with lots of detail and realistic lighting. Sure, it’s not as sharp as <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> running on a PS5 Pro connected to a 4K TV, but I bet it will look fine on the Switch 2’s smaller screen.</p> <p>Of course, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arriving on Switch 2 isn’t exactly a surprise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-preorder-release-date-2000634141">The game was leaked earlier this month</a> following months of rumors. Still, it’s nice to have it officially announced, and it’s great that more people will have a chance to check out what I think is one of Ubisoft’s best games in a long time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even in a packed year for kart racers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is playing for keeps. Will it earn a place alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></a>? Director Masahiro Sakurai hopes so. The legendary developer said he doesn’t plan on continuing the series; the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive is a one-and-done. “I’ve thrown everything I have into this game,” he said during its latest livestream preview. He certainly has. Just when you thought you knew everything<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> has to offer, Sakurai announces even more modes, characters, and features, including a roguelike adventure called Road Trip.</p> <p>In a second hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZHYjYHHiBM">Direct-style presentation for <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> that went live on Thursday, the famed<em> Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> director reminded fans why he’s the king of content maximalism. If you thought Nintendo’s latest racing game, out November 20, would be just a racing game with a sandbox mode, you would be sorely mistaken, my pink, puffy friend. Some are already calling it the “<a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1981361888173969671">Kirby game of all Kirby games</a>.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry to break the order of my reporting of the Kirby Air Riders Direct, but I needed to share Sakurai's closing speech because what a guy! He is a masterclass in game development. <a href="https://t.co/ngXoBgcj4X">pic.twitter.com/ngXoBgcj4X</a></p> <p>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1981362564576551304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is far from the full list of newly revealed features players will get to mess around with:</p> <ul> <li>Top-down camera view race mode called Top Ride</li> <li>Roguelike mode with random challenges from other modes and unique story beats called Road Trip</li> <li>Match lobby called Paddock where you can interact and move between different online races</li> <li>Variant of Air Ride called Swap Relay where you change machines every lap</li> <li>Machine that can switch configurations called Transform Star</li> <li>Set of achievements called Checklist that lets you chase unlockables throughout the game</li> <li>Global Win Power shows how many times you’ve won in addition to your online class ranking</li> <li>Custom licenses to show off your personality online</li> <li>Boss battles</li> <li>Expanded roster including the spider Taranza, wily duo Lololo &amp; Lalala, the bug-eyed Marx, and others</li> </ul> <h2>“We’re not planning DLC, everything is here”</h2> <p>Like I said, this is an incomplete and abridged rundown of all of the gameplay elements Sakurai dove into during the latest and likely final preview of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> ahead of release. He also mentioned how players will earn miles by playing that are spent to unlock more parts of the Machine Market to outfit your ride. Plus there are new collectibles called Gummies. They sound a bit like the stickers from <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. “Who knows, maybe you’ll become a Gummillionaire!” Nintendo’s words, not mine.</p>

 <p>But wait, there’s still more! <em>Kibry Air Riders</em> is also getting dedicated amiibo figures. There are three, all launching next year starting on March 5 with Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star, followed later on by King Dedede &amp; Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star. Like the new amiibo Nintendo’s been rolling out, these are bigger, more complex, and will likely have those bigger $30 price tags to match. Has Nintendo given Sakurai a blank check to do whatever he wants with <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> before he makes the next <em>Smash Bros.</em>? Probably.</p> <p>We’ll see how it all adds up in practice, but on paper at least, the game is certainly shaping up to satiate even the most ravenous fans’ demands in a way the somewhat content-lite <em>Mario Kart World</em> maybe didn’t when it debuted back over the summer. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” Sakurai said of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. Ouch! Switch Online subscribers can try the game for free during Global Test Ride events on Nov. 8-9 and Nov. 15-16.</p>

The big update is called Mega Rising, and this expansion adds powerful Mega Evolved Pokemon to the digital card game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mega Rising expansion features Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken, and Mega Altaria as powerful new Mega Evolution Pokemon ex cards. These Mega Evolved Pokemon will each headline their own booster pack, so players will have plenty of new cards to open. As shown in the video below, these Mega Evolved cards feature some pretty dynamic illustrations to make the Pokemon look like they're jumping off the cards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWaCRes4uBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bWaCRes4uBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon TCG Pocket is celebrating its first anniversary and the major milestone of hitting over 150 million downloads since its global launch. For this occasion, there will be some new updates to the game. One of the biggest changes is an update to the trades feature, which will allow players to trade even rarer cards than the ones that were previously eligible.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there's a new share feature coming to the game. Players will be able to share up to one card per friend each day, and they can also receive up to one card per day through this feature. This works more like a gifting feature, so players aren't required to give a card in return.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon TCG Pocket has also shared an early look at some of the cards coming in the next major expansion, including the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news" rel="nofollow ">powerful Mega Lopunny ex</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a> is a megapopular tactical shooter, and one of the reasons for its sustained popularity is its in-game market. Digital items like gloves and knives go for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-160000-or-around-320-ps5-consoles/1100-6512356/" data-ref-id="1100-6512356">thousands</a>--if not <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-over-1-million" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">millions</a>--of dollars, but all of that changed within the last few hours as a new update completely wiped out roughly $1.75 billion in value.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/market-for-counter-strike-items-falls-1-75-billion-overnight?srnd=undefined" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new Bloomberg report</a>, in-game CS items ranging from guns to knives to gloves fell 25% between Wednesday, October 22, and Thursday, October 23. In these two days, developer Valve Corporation pushed out an update for the shooter that altered the exchange rates of these items. Immediately following this update, the prices for these items tanked, with market analytics company Pricempire estimating the losses in the billions. Ethan MacDonald, the company's marketing manager, told Bloomberg that he was stunned by the change.</p>

<p>"This was a complete shock to the community," he said. "This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike's most sought-after and expensive tier of items."</p><p>A huge number of players have been affected by this update. One 20-something trader Bloomberg spoke with had $1 million of digital items in his inventory on Wednesday, but by Thursday, he had lost upwards of $270,000. Chinese players, who Bloomberg noted are some of the game's primary traders, criticized the price shift on the ByteDance-owned, short-form video platform Douyin. This all led MacDonald to believe the "bubble" had burst.</p><p>In other Counter-Strike news, a troupe of modders announced a remake of the 1.6 version of the game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modders-announce-cs-legacy-a-standalone-counter-strike-1-6-remake/1100-6530176/" data-ref-id="1100-6530176">Counter-Strike: Legacy</a>. Slated for a release sometime this year via Steam Early Access, it appears that the project has <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-Counter-Strike-1-6-remake-CS-Legacy-runs-into-legal-troubles-with-Valve.1049861.0.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">run into some trouble with Valve</a>, with <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/63238/cs-legacy-fan-project-in-danger-of-being-shut-down-by-valve" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some reports suggesting</a> that it may be shut down.</p>
