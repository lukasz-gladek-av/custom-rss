<p>Nintendo and Lego are at it again—they've announced another collaboration today as a follow-up to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/lego-teams-up-with-nintendo-for-super-mario-brick-based-game/">the interactive Mario sets</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/this-200-lego-nes-set-features-a-scrolling-8-bit-mario/">replica Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/2064-piece-lego-set-recreates-super-mario-64-in-miniature-for-170/">unfolding question mark block</a> with the&nbsp;<em>Mario 64&nbsp;</em>worlds inside, and other sets besides.</p>
<p>The latest addition is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/super-mario-world-mario-yoshi-71438?cmp=REF-202407-Mario_Yoshi_Laun">an homage to 1990's&nbsp;<em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Mario's debut outing on the then-new 16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System. At first, the 1,215-piece set just looks like a caped Mario sitting on top of Yoshi. But a look at the back reveals more complex mechanics, including a hand crank that makes Yoshi's feet and arms move and a dial that opens his mouth and extends his tongue.</p>

<p>Most of the Mario sets have included some kind of interactive moving part, even if it's as simple as the movable mouth on the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2023/september/lego-super-mario-piranha-plant">Lego Piranha Plant</a>. Yoshi's mechanical crank most strongly resembles the NES set, though, which included a CRT-style TV set with a crank that made the contents of the screen scroll so that Mario could "walk."</p>
<p>The Mario &amp; Yoshi set is available to preorder from Lego's online store for $129.99. It begins shipping on October 1.</p>
<p>Lego has also branched out into other video game-themed sets. In 2022, the company began selling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/recapture-the-fun-of-the-1980s-game-crash-with-legos-240-atari-2600-replica/">a replica Atari 2600,</a> complete with faux-wood paneling. More recently, Lego has collaborated with Epic Games on <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/fortnite">several <em>Fortnite</em>-themed sets</a>, including<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/battle-bus-77073"> the Battle Bus</a>.</p>

In January, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">signed a controversial agreement</a> with AI voice software company Replica Studios.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following prolonged negotiations with many of the biggest companies in video games, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called for a video game performer and voice actor strike, beginning on July 26. Try as they might, the two sides have been unable to see eye to eye on the issue of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>“The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a statement to Aftermath. "The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members&nbsp;who&nbsp;bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that."</p><p>Workers can now strike at ten companies: Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, EA, Epic, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take-Two, VoiceWorks, and WB Games.</p><p>The aforementioned companies released their own joint statement:</p><p>“We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations," the companies said via a spokesperson. "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and&nbsp;additional&nbsp;safety provisions.&nbsp;Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;consent and fair compensation to all performers&nbsp;working under the [Interactive Media Agreement]. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p><p>SAG-AFTRA membership first voted in favor of authorizing a strike <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23885558/sag-aftra-strike-authorization-negotiation-video-game-voice-actors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2023</a>, which the union’s national board <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">followed last week</a> by granting Crabtree-Ireland authority to call a strike if need be. This is the second video game voice actor strike, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%932017_video_game_voice_actor_strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first</a> lasting nearly a year between 2016 and 2017. As a result, actors received a pay raise, though residuals and matters pertaining to vocal stress – other central issues at the time – did not make it into the contract, prompting criticism from some actors.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, SAG-AFTRA again faced controversy when it <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftras-ai-voice-acting-deal-was-a-powder-keg-waiting-to-go-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struck a deal with a company called Replica</a>, with the goal of making it easy for “professional voice over artists to safely explore new employment opportunities for their digital voice replicas with industry-leading protections tailored to AI technology” and “allowing AAA video game studios and other companies working with Replica to access top SAG-AFTRA talent.” This turned out to be a one-off deal with a single company rather than the broader Interactive Media Agreement over which SAG-AFTRA members had authorized a strike, but performers still felt blindsided by the decision.</p><p>Now workers are going to battle to secure their rights across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>“Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation, said video game performer and SAG-AFTRA&nbsp;Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee chair Sarah Elmaleh. "We refuse this paradigm – we will not leave any of our members behind, nor will we wait for sufficient protection any longer. We look forward to collaborating with teams on our interim and independent contracts, which provide AI transparency, consent and compensation to all performers, and to continuing to negotiate in good faith with this bargaining group when they are ready to join us in the world we all deserve."&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The strike commences at 12:01 am on July 26 (so, shortly after midnight tonight) and any game studio looking to employ SAG-AFTRA-signed talent—for voice work, motion capture performance, on-screen talent, or similar services—must sign one of the new agreements listed in the union's post.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These include the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement, the Interim Interactive Media Agreement, or the Interim Interactive Localization Agreement. According to the SAG-AFTRA site, those contracts are acceptable to the union because they include "critical AI protections for members."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="AI protections are at the heart of this strike">AI protections are at the heart of this strike</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the post notes, negotiations began in November 2022, and it lists major studios like Take 2 Productions, EA, Activision, WB Games, and more as part of the convenience bargaining group.

            <p>
Video game performers within United States actors union SAG-AFTRA have voted to go on strike starting Friday, 26th July, after "more than than a year and a half of negotiations" with major game companies over the use of AI have failed to reach a deal.
</p>
<p>
SAG-AFTRA members initially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-members-overwhelmingly-vote-in-favour-of-authorising-video-game-strike">voted in favour</a> of (but did not immediately take) strike action last September, after the union failed to reach a consensus with video game producers - including Activision, Warner Bros, EA, Take-Two, and Disney - while attempting to negotiate a successor to the Interactive Media Agreement, which covers members' work on games.
</p>
<p>
At the time, SAG-AFTRA said companies had refused to offer acceptable terms on critical issues, including wages in-line with inflation, protections around exploitative uses of AI, and job safety.

<p>
Then, this March, SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland confirmed the strike was still likely to go ahead after the union had failed to reach a deal with companies regarding AI protections. "We want to make sure the implementation [of AI] is human-centred and focused on augmentation [of production], not replacement of people," he explained, adding that "consent and compensation" for members whose work is used by AI engines is also one of the union's aims.
</p>
<p>
And now, with a deal still not agreed upon, union members have officially called a strike, effective Friday, 26th July, at 12:01am. "Although agreements have been reached on many issues important to SAG-AFTRA members," the union wrote in a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">statement announcing the strike</a>, "the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect performers covered by this contract in their AI language."
</p>
<p>
"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added in the statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."
</p>
<p>
Many video game performers, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-and-commander-shepard-stars-discuss-threat-of-ai-on-voice-acting">Solid Snake actor David Hayter and Commander Shepard actor Jennifer Hale</a>, have voiced their concerns about AI and its impact on their work in recent times. In March this year, Eurogamer spoke to several BAFTA-nominated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> actors, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">revealed the darker side of success</a>, fuelled by AI voice cloning.

<section><p>While the adaptation of League of Legends characters may be front and center, 2XKO is also making interesting changes to an established format.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">As more information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/2xko/" data-ref-id="5000-503365">2XKO</a> comes to light, most of the attention is focused on how established characters from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League Of Legends</a> are being adapted into a fighting game. And that makes sense--seeing characters from a well-known franchise enter a new realm is always interesting. That "fish out of water" feeling brings a huge appeal to crossover characters like Negan in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-7/" data-ref-id="5000-293825">Tekken 7</a> and Banjo-Kazooie in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, to name a few.</p><p dir="ltr">However, after playing a few rounds of 2XKO at Evo 2024, I realized that solely focusing on how the game reimagines classic LoL characters is a disservice to the rest of the game, which makes major shifts to the 2v2 fighting format, from modified mechanics to a philosophical shift in how we're expected to play a fighting game. 2XKO has already gained a reputation for reinventing one wheel, but in truth, it might be revamping the whole dang vehicle right under our noses.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 2XKO - Braum, The Heart Of The Freljord | Champion Gameplay Introduction</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As mentioned before, 2XKO is a two-on-two tag-based fighting game--think X-Men Vs. Street Fighter and its ilk--with a cast of characters populated by champions from Riot's ultra-popular MOBA, League Of Legends. Our demo featured six playable champions: Ahri, Braum, Darius, Ekko, Illaoi, and Yasuo.</p><p dir="ltr">Right from the character select screen, a huge change is thrown at us: When Riot says "2v2" in regards to 2XKO, they don't just mean "two characters vs. two characters." Each match supports up to four players at a time, with each player controlling a single champion. This means any given match can feature any of the following scenarios:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Team A and Team B have a single human player controlling both champions in a team.</li><li dir="ltr">Team A and Team B have two human players, each one assigning themselves a specific champion.</li><li dir="ltr">Team A has a single human player controlling both champions while Team B has two human players each assigned to one champion, or vice versa.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340584-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340584-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340584"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340584-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_09.png"></figure><p>From a competitive standpoint, this creates an interesting new level of strategy. One brain controlling two different characters presents its own set of challenges, but being pitted against a team of two human players, each with likely their own specific style and strategies, is a different beast altogether. It already asks intriguing questions about the future, like whether 2XKO events will allow players to sign up either as a single rep or as a two-person team in the same tournament, and how that will play out in real-time.</p><p dir="ltr">The character select screen also offers Fuses, which are perks that can be selected to add an extra benefit to your team. Pulse--2XKO's version of Modern controls--was recommended to us during the demo, but we also saw Double Down, which allows us to combine each character's Ultimate attack into one massive move, and 2X Assist, which gives an assisting character more options when called. We focused on the Pulse option for most of our matches, but the ones where we tried 2X Assist added a few extra and helpful tools to our toolbox.</p><p dir="ltr">Once your teams are decided, the core gameplay of 2XKO will feel very familiar to the fighting game faithful. One character for each team is on-screen at a time--you can call out your partner character for a brief assist move at any point in the match, and both characters on one side must lose their entire health bar for the round to be decided. Each match feels slower and more methodical compared to what we've come to expect from games like Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, but for the purposes of this preview at least, we'd consider that a positive--we're trying to learn the ins and outs of the game, and a breakneck pace would only get in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340585-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_08.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340585-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_08.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340585-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_08.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">There is one notable and interesting change to the core format worth mentioning, however. In previous tag-based fighters, when a character lost all of their health, they were disabled for the rest of the round/match--and that included assists. 2XKO takes that limitation away, by allowing players to continue to call for assists from fallen characters after they've gone down.</p><p dir="ltr">This changes the fundamental strategy in later portions of a match. In MvC2 and MvC3, for instance, losing those assists left players at a distinct disadvantage, as the timing of certain assists is paramount to their ability to win the match, and the player who's ahead could capitalize. With 2XKO assists always active, that safety net no longer applies, which encourages the player on the back foot to stay aggressive.</p><p dir="ltr">Each character offers a full kit of attacks and abilities, with some easier to pick up and play than others. We found the most success with the two biggest brutes, Braum and Darius, mostly because their play style is so straightforward: smash the opponent's face in by any means necessary. Yasuo was also an early favorite, but his style relies less on the brute strength of powerful attacks and more on mixing speed with attack power for max potency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340586-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340586-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4340586"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340586-2xko_vevo24_braumpresskit_06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ekko, on the other hand, has major potential, as his best combos come from his ability to manipulate his position on-stage thanks to his time powers, but we didn't have enough time to figure him out. Illaoi and Ahri fall into a similar space of being good at spatial control, especially Illaoi with her ability to summon tentacles. There's a lot to learn with each of these characters already, and we haven't even seen the full roster yet.</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear that 2XKO is vying to be a revolutionary fighting game. While it's paving new ground for the franchise it represents, the changes being made to the core concept, if done correctly, could have more far-reaching effects on fighting games as a whole. We still don't know when 2XKO will launch, but it will be one to watch for fighting game fans, LoL fans, and everyone in between.</p>

Exotic class items currently drop from chests opened in the Pale Heart of the Traveler location, including those that players earn at the end of the Onslaught activity. The adjustment will change things so that each Onslaught chest you open up will increase the chances of an Exotic class item dropping until you earn one, with higher-difficulty activities further increasing the chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Right now, any chest in the Pale Heart has a chance of dropping an Exotic class item, but those chances seem relatively small. Bungie means to downgrade those other, random loot chests as sources for class items and instead focus on Onslaught, both to encourage more players to take part in the activity, and to make farming those chests a clearer path to earning the item.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is also adding the ability to earn an additional class item on each character each week in the Dual Destiny mission, which adds another guaranteed roll if you're willing to keep replaying it--and have a partner to do so with.</p><p dir="ltr">That's good news for anybody chasing god rolls on those armor pieces, which can be a huge boon to their builds. Exotic class items, released with the Final Shape expansion, come with two special Exotic traits that are drawn from other Exotic pieces of armor, which can create some awesome combinations. But each class item's traits are random, which is why players are trying to earn as many of them as possible. Bungie said it's also looking into offering Exotic class items from activities outside of the Pale Heart, as some members of the community have requested, but didn't say it has any clear plans to do so yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Also getting a boost to its drop rates are Brave Arsenal weapons, a series of previously deprecated guns Bungie brought back as part of its free Into the Light content that it released in the lead up to The Final Shape. Bungie is bringing back attunement, allowing you to put a thumb on the scales of Destiny 2's RNG to get more of a particular weapon to drop from Onslaught, the activity that dispenses Brave weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">During Into the Light, players could choose to "attune" certain Brave weapons, which pumped up their chances of dropping as rewards from Onslaught by 50%. The new attunement system, which you can access by visiting Zavala in the Tower, increases that boost to 60%. You can also change or deactivate attunement anytime with no penalty or cooldown, which should make it a lot easier to farm Brave weapons and nab god rolls.</p>

                <p>Remasters of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I and II have seemingly been confirmed by a statue shown off at San Diego Comic-Con.</p><p>Spotted by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, a statue of characters Raziel and Kain was displayed at San Diego Comic-Con, and the placard in front of it says, "Soul Reaver: I &amp; II Remastered," along with a QR code with the Dark Horse Comics logo. Recently, Dark Horse Comics announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-making-a-comeback-but-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/1100-6524621/" data-ref-id="1100-6524621">"Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise" comic</a>, so this statue suggests that an announcement of remasters could be imminent.</p><p>On the San Diego Comic-Con show floor, Dark Horse Comics vice president of product development and sales, Randy Lahrman, told GameSpot that the statue will come out in August, and that more info will be released later. However, the company would not comment on the remasters, and the sign referencing them had been removed by the time we arrived at the booth.</p><p>Last year, developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-fans-are-convinced-the-next-game-in-the-series-is-being-secretly-tested-soon/1100-6513443/" data-ref-id="1100-6513443">conducting a closed playtest</a>, but didn't say for which game. Around that time, those who completed a Legacy of Kain survey received an email from the developer about playtests "for an unspecified new game."</p><p>Crystal Dynamics and Eidos CEO Phil Rogers previously acknowledged fan interest in "revisit[ing] the land of Nosgoth and our iconic IP, Legacy of Kain."</p><p>This convinced fans that Crystal Dynamics was making a new Legacy of Kain game, and it's possible that the new game is simply a remaster of the two Soul Reaver entries. The first Soul Reaver game came out in 1999 with the sequel following in 2001. It's been over 20 years since the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/legacy-of-kain-defiance-review/1900-6083425/" data-ref-id="1900-6083425">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a>, came out in 2003.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight-ai-negotiations-to-blame.937059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sag-aftra-members-who-work-on-video-games-to-begin-strike-at-midnight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today a statement was released by SAG-AFTRA for members that work on Video Games to begin a strike after more than a year and a half of negotiations surrounding the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) has reached no deal. The strike will begin effective July 26th at 12:01am.</p>
<p>The statement explains that negotiations began with a number of companies including Activision Productions Inc., Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., and Insomniac Games Inc. among many others. It is explained that while agreements have been reached on a number of topics that "the employers refuse to plainly affirm, in clear and enforceable language, that they will protect all performers covered by this contract in their A.I. language.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher released the following quote alongside the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies ger serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SAG-AFTRA members approved a video game strike authorization with a 98.32% yes vote. You can read the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">full Press Release on the SAG-AFTRA Website</a>.</p>
<hr><p><strong>Update:</strong> After initially posting this story Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers party, reached out with a statement in response to SAG-AFTRA's impending strike. Their statement has been added below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr><h2>What Does A SAG-AFTRA Strike Mean For Video Games?</h2>
<p>As the Video Game Strike begins all members of SAG-AFTRA will not be able to work for any 'Struck' Video Game productions. Working could include active production such as acting (whether it be voice acting, performance, or stunts), background or stand-in work, or performing camera tests. This also includes participating in auditions, authorizing your voice or likeness, or promoting any struck games you've been working on as a SAG-AFTRA performer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/ima-strike-notice-members">full list of rules for the SAG-AFTRA video game strike can be found here</a>. It's also important to note that not all Video Game productions are within the scope of the Strike Order, SAG-AFTRA has created a resource for looking up a game via it's Full Code Name or Production ID so it can be verified whether it's within the Strike Order. Looking up a game will either return to you a "Game Over!" message, or a "Let's Play!" if it is not struck.</p>
<p>Fans of TV and Movies will be familiar with the idea of a SAG-AFTRA strike after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike">almost four months of striking</a> that occurred last year.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Can I As A Fan Of Video Games Do To Support SAG-AFTRA?</h2>
<p>As with the 2023 SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes last year the first thing for everyone to understand is that depending on the length of time there may be delays to known or unknown Video Games on the horizon. It's important to remember that it's not the fault of those on strike, but of the companies that can't come to an agreement to protect the livelihood of those working in video games.</p>

<p>As part of their Strike FAQ page SAG-AFTRA has put together a list of ways that Creators/Streamers, Developers, Fans, and Podcasters can support the strike. This doesn't ask people to not play games that are within the Strike, but instead asks that you share the message of the strike and promote the importance of the strike.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA also asks that if you're sharing the message that you use the hashtags&nbsp;#LevelUpTheContract, #VideoGameStrike and #SagAftraStrong when sharing on socials. For more information on how you can engage you can explore their<a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/interactive/video-game-strike/take-action"> "Take Action" page</a>, and for more information overall for members, non-members, or just as a fan you can <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike-faq">check out their FAQ page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>SAG-AFTRA At San Diego Comic-Con</h2>
<p>For those looking to attend San Diego Comic-Con next week SAG-AFTRA has explained that they understand that due to the proximity it could cause complications so is granting an exception to the strike rules related to promotion and publicity services specifically for SDCC 2024.</p>

The strike goes into effect July 26th at 12:01AM and impacts all SAG-AFTRA actors, voice actors, and motion capture actors and involves companies like Activision Blizzard, EA, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and more. According to SAG-AFTRA’s press release, the union and video game companies could not come to an agreement regarding AI protections.</p><p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members,” said SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher in the press release. “When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p><p>In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, Audrey Cooling, spokesperson for the video game producers&nbsp;involved in the negotiations, wrote:<em> </em></p><div><blockquote><p>We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations.

Advertising for struck work is also prohibited, which would potentially impact games being promoted at San Diego Comic-Con, but SAG-AFTRA included a clause explaining games at SDCC would be exempt from strike action.</p><p>In September of last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/26/23890663/sag-aftra-strike-approval-video-game-performers">SAG-AFTRA voted to authorize a strike</a> around the same time the Hollywood actors and writers strikes were winding down. As with those strikes, the use of AI was one of the major sticking points with concerns the technology could be used to replace workers. SAG-AFTRA has already made some deals regarding the use of AI in video game production, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/10/24033258/sag-aftra-ai-video-game-voice-acting-licensing-replica-studios">signing an agreement with AI voice company Replica Studios</a>. The agreement permits SAG-AFTRA members to work exclusively with Replica to create digital replications of their voice that can then be licensed out with agreements in place for length of use and compensation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[EA and Paradox Aren’t Showing Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 at Gamescom]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite both being slated to launch this Fall, neither Dragon Age: The Veilguard nor Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be shown at Gamescom 2024 by EA and Paradox Interactive, the respective publishers.</p>
<p>With less than a month left before the beginning of the big European convention, the exhibitors list has been <a href="https://exhibitors.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-exhibitors/list-of-exhibitors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finalized</a>. Since Wccftech is attending with media accreditations, we are looking into which games will be shown there, and we can confirm that neither of two of the most anticipated games scheduled in the latter half of 2024 will appear.</p>
<p>EA does actually have a presence at Gamescom 2024. However, we confirmed with the publisher's PR department that the only game shown there will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a>, which means Dragon Age: The Veilguard is sorely missing. It feels like a weird repeat of what <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-is-at-gamescom-but-only-for-the-yu-gi-oh-tcg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KONAMI</a> is doing with the Silent Hill 2 remake, which is also skipping Gamescom 2024 for some reason despite only being a few weeks away from its October debut.</p>
<p>It's enough to make one wonder if a delay is coming, although Electronic Arts has actually shared a lot of Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">info</a> lately, which pointed to the Fall release window being respected. Moreover, earlier today, the developers <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1816511768044163410?cn=ZmxleGlibGVfcmVjcw%3D%3D&amp;refsrc=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that the game is 'making good progress' toward its Fall launch while also confirming that it is already Steam Deck verified and the Steam version will be native, which means it won't require the EA app to play the game, unlike other EA titles.</p>
<p>Another game in a similar situation is Paradox Interactive's Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. The troubled sequel is still formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinned</a> for a Q4 2024 launch, but Paradox is skipping Gamescom altogether, Wccftech was able to confirm via the publisher's PR, meaning Bloodlines 2 will be nowhere to be seen at the Koelnmesse. A delay in this case would be less than surprising, as what's been shown so far isn't quite as polished as we would have liked to see. It is far from unlikely that the developers will require more time before launch.</p>
<p>Even if both games missed their Fall 2024 launch windows, Western RPG fans would still have two high-profile games pretty much assured to debut this year: Warhorse's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>&nbsp;and Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, both of which will be shown at Gamescom.</p>

<p>Video game voice over and performance actors are going on strike over the use of AI in video game development, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SAG-AFTRA has announced</a>.</p>



<p>As of 12:01 AM on July 26, members of the union will strike after more than 18 months of negotiations between the union and game studios under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA).  It was just on July 22 that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-can-call-for-an-immediate-strike-against-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union national director was given authorization</a> to call for an immediate strike after negotiations continued to stall.</p>



<p>The sticking point of the current negotiations that ultimately led to this strike were AI protections for voice over and performance actors. According to members of the negotiating committee on behalf of the actors, they believe that game studios don’t want to protect their actors against the possible exploitation that exists with AI.</p>



<p>“We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate,” stated SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher via release.</p>



<p>“Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year – that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,” SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director &amp; Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said.</p>



<p>In response to the call for a strike by SAG-AFTRA, the video game producers involved in the IMA negotiations released the following statement via spokesperson Audrey Cooling to Insider Gaming. </p>



<p><em>“We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we&nbsp;remain&nbsp;prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and&nbsp;additional&nbsp;safety provisions.&nbsp;Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;consent and fair compensation to all performers&nbsp;working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-really-wants-to-make-a-new-vs-series-game-shuhei-matsumoto-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>One of the biggest surprise announcements this year happened during the June Nintendo Direct, when   from out of nowhere, Capcom dropped a trailer for Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. A collection that bundles together six of the games that make up the foundation of the beloved vs series, including one of the most highly regarded fighting games of all time, Marvel vs Capcom 2. </p><p>At Evo 2024, I got a chance to talk with Capcom producer Shuhei Matsumoto to ask some questions about how this collection finally came to be, the significance of its release in relation to the future of the Versus series as a whole, and also got to hear about the origins of the SNK crossover that's happening with Terry and Mai joining the cast of Street Fighter 6 as part of the year 2 character pass. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>How long has this collection been in the works?</strong></p><p><strong>Shuhei Matsumoto, Producer Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics: </strong></p><p>So we've been planning for about three, four years to make this project a reality. We've been talking with Marvel for quite a while. And back then, we just didn't have the opportunities to release this game. But now after those discussions with them, we were finally able to do so.</p><p><strong>Speaking of talking with Marvel, can you describe what Capcom's relationship is with Marvel right now?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>Yeah, it's very positive. As we mentioned, we've been in talks with them for a few years now and they've really been excited and motivated to release these classic games. So overall, it's been really good and positive.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We've been in talks with [Marvel] for a few years now, and they've really been excited and motivated to release these classic games.</p></div><p><strong>You mentioned in </strong><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/exclusive-capcoms-dream-is-to-make-more-marvel-crossover-games-2831616/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another interview</a><strong> that Capcom has big dreams for the Versus series. Can you talk a little bit about what those dreams are and what the Versus series means to you as a whole?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So yeah, this doesn't just apply to the Versus series. We have a lot of other legacy fighting games that we know fans out there really want them to be re-released again on modern platforms. And the feeling is mutual on the development side. We want people to get to know all these other classic games. So hopefully what we can do right now is to try to re-release them and so that people who may have never had the chance to play those games to get familiarized with them. And from there, hopefully we can go into bigger and better things.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Speaking of some of those classic Capcom fighting game series, Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike just had an incredible top six at Evo. That's a game that's been re-released several times over the years. Is that something that still you're looking at also kind of giving a "definitive edition" in the future? </strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So definitely. We want all our classic games to be available for modern consoles because we just want to be able to reach as many people who may have never had the opportunity to play these games back in the day. So we constantly think forward and we want to make sure that it's as accessible as possible for all audiences.</p><p><strong>So going back to Marvel vs. Capcom for a second. This is a game that means so much to fans across the world, especially popular streamers [and pro players] like Maximilian Dood and Justin Wong. I was wondering, have you seen any of those reactions and what's your reaction to how people have received the announcement of this collection?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>Yes, we definitely saw all the reactions and the comments and the positive feedback when we were able to make the announcement. And the feeling is mutual. Once we realized that we were able to re-release these games and it became green-lit and official, our reaction matched that same energy. So yeah, we're definitely excited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>It feels like a door has been opened with regards to the Marvel vs. Capcom series because we've heard nothing about it for so long. Is this the kind of thing where if this game does well, the future of the Versus series is wide open and there could be more collaborations between Marvel and Capcom or other franchises out there?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So to answer your question about whether or not we want to make a brand new Versus series title, the answer to that is yes. And the best thing that we can do right now is to re-release these classic titles that some of our fans may not be fully aware of. And of course, there's constraints, there's different schedules, it's going to require collaboration with other non-Capcom parties in order to make this happen. And that could take some time, but we feel that the best that we can do right now is to re-release these games to energize the community.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>To answer your question about whether or not we want to make a brand new Versus series title, the answer to that is yes. </p></div><p><strong>Switching gears for a second to Street Fighter 6, you guys announced recently that Terry and Mai from Fatal Fury are going to make their appearance in Street Fighter 6. How did that collaboration come about?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So Capcom has had a long relationship with SNK and we've been discussing with them for quite a while now. And actually during COVID, there was a period of time where we couldn't have any offline tournaments. But then once restrictions started to become a little looser and once Evo was able to start up again, we were talking with them to see is there anything that we can do to celebrate this moment now that we're all back together. And the idea that came out of those conversations was to do these collaborative posters where both SNK artists and Capcom artists draw each other's characters in their own style. And at that time, we were also working on actively developing Street Fighter 6, so we really wanted to see if there's any opportunity to introduce some of their characters. So we asked if it's possible to get Terry and Mai in Street Fighter 6 and they were very open about it and positive. And yeah, it started small to see what we can do in the short-term. But then through conversations, we tried to see what else, what's something that's even bigger that we can do. And we're finally to the point where both Terry and Mai are going to be coming out shortly. So hope everyone's excited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Terry is a character that fits obviously very well in the SNK style of fighting game. How has it been translating his move set and his play style over to Street Fighter? If you can talk a little bit about how he's going to play in Street Fighter 6.</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So this doesn't just apply to the SNK characters, but during our selection process for any characters that join the game's roster, we always try to think about whether or not they're a good fit in terms of the game system, game mechanics. And Terry and Mai passed that test and they felt that they would be a great add-on to this lineup. So yeah, we're very excited for them to come out.</p><p><strong>The mainline Street Fighter series has historically not included any guest characters. So I was just wondering what changed to finally open the door for guest characters to come in? And is that door open so much to the way that other fighting game properties might find their way into Street Fighter?</strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So Terry and Mai are joining the roster starting from the year two lineup, which is relatively early in the lifetime of the game. However, we were all very excited about the positivity that we saw online once we made the announcement. We're very much looking forward to actually seeing people play with these characters. And based on that reaction and based on how people are engaging with these characters, we would like to consider other options maybe in the future. So this was quite a big challenge for us to even incorporate these guest characters. As you mentioned, this is the first time. But hopefully things move forward in a positive way and there's more opportunities that open up for us.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Final question, this is something that I've been asking pretty much everyone that I've talked to here at Evo. But what do you think is the next kind of evolution for the fighting game genre? To give you an example, netcode was something that a lot of fighting games struggled with, and then rollback netcode came along and it kind of pushed the genre forward and has become largely standard among new fighting games. What do you think is the next thing that will push the fighting game genre forward? </strong></p><p><strong>Matsumoto: </strong>So to speak on Street Fighter 6, we took on a lot of different challenges and our goal was to get people as interested in fighting games as much as possible. And we feel that because of our efforts, we were able to reach an audience that might've never wanted to play a fighting game. We're seeing a lot of engaged players, especially in Japan, and people who this may be their first time playing a fighting game actually enjoying it. So whether it's technical improvements or just constantly servicing the game to provide new content, we feel that us and companies in general need to think about all these things in order to reach this audience and explain to them and get them to realize that, hey, fighting games are a lot of fun and they're worth checking out. So there's probably a lot of different things that we need to continue to think about and yeah, we hope to be able to reach more people in the future.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an Senior Producer at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>They don’t make a lot of games like <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> any more. It is a game unstuck in time, a polished, action strategy hybrid that feels more at home on the PS2 or PS3. It feels like it should not exist, and yet here it is.</p><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess </em>is an action strategy game set against the backdrop of Japanese folklore. You play Soh, a warrior tasked with protecting a priestess named Yoshiro, who is tasked with purging a mountain and the villages on it of evil spirits known as Seethe. To do this you’re going to need to do an elaborate purification ritual based on the Shinto ceremonial dance of Kagura. Gameplay-wise, this means reversing the creeping spread of evil from areas and villagers, assigning jobs to those villagers and placing them, tower defense style, down various lanes between the source of the corruption and Yoshiro.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Undoing the corruption. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>During the day you use crystals (<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guess what? They’re Orbs</a>!) to push Yoshiro forward, undo corruption, unlock collectibles and items, prepare fortifications, and strategize for night time. Every night a new wave of Seethe emerges from the Tori gates, and you must survive the onslaught. Soh acts as both a commander and a soldier, and in addition to the regular stages there are also boss battles, which switch the dynamic from linear, lane-based tower defense mode to big area fights.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Most stages will have you pushing the lane forward during the day, and defending your maiden at night. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>On top of all this, the cleared stages themselves can be visited and rebuilt by the rescued townsfolk. The base building mini game allows you to unlock materials to upgrade the individual classes of villagers, yielding potential equipment for your quest. I am a sucker for any time a game asks me to rebuild a town, and this game is no exception.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Oh you know exactly who this is for (ride or die Okami fans) Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>Playing <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>brought to mind so many games I treasure:&nbsp; <em>Pikmin</em>, <em>Odama</em>, <em>Actraiser 1 &amp; 2</em>,<em> Giants: Citizen Kabuto, Dark Cloud 1 &amp; 2</em>, <em>Brütal Legend</em>, <em>Overlord</em>. The presence of Capcom’s own <em>Ōkami </em>looms heavily over this game, not simply in its shared themes, look, and gameplay but also the fact that it includes unlockable costumes and music from that game itself. In my mind’s eye I can see a younger version of myself picking up a battered copy of this for Gamecube from an EB Games, only to find out it’s worth either $5 or $300 dollars on eBay a few decades later.</p><figure><figcaption>Look at how good this food looks. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>To the extent that there are games like <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> still being made, bizarre idiosyncratic genre hybrids, they are usually the province of either indies (like the recently released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cataclismo</em></a>, which rules) or Nintendo (they’re still making good Pikmin games), and they are rarely allowed to have this level of sheer detail, polish and care. Every inch in the game, from the grotesque movements of the Yokai-coded Seethe to the elaborate dances of the villagers, pops in the RE Engine. One of the game’s collectibles is sweet treats, which are painstakingly rendered at a fidelity akin to food in <em>Final Fantasy XV, </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ387Ozb4B0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that one burger </a>from <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>or the more recent <em>Monster Hunter </em>games. This is to say nothing of the soundtrack by Chikara Aoshima, which goes alarmingly hard and includes one track with a freakish John Zorn style sax solo.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami : Path of the Goddess - Batsu Theme/Soundtrack/Ost" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8y2L1LEpdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Perhaps a minor spoiler but this track is so sick.</figcaption></figure></div><p>This would be enough to cement the game into cult status for me, but luckily it’s also a blast to play. The hybrid fusion of tactics and action feels legitimately tight, and the game is fairly good at drip feeding you new mechanics to ramp up complexity. It keeps adding new weapon types and quirks, and many of the bosses can get tremendously challenging. You think you’ve seen what the game has to offer early on, and then suddenly it makes you do a battle entirely on boats. You are often forced to consider your army composition to react to enemy behavior and stage layout, so you can’t just use the same strategy over and over again. The lone thing I have found frustrating in my playtime is that repeating stages for challenges to unlock upgrade materials and equipment takes a while, but that’s a consequence of how long the stages take generally, and many of the challenges add new restrictions and interesting angles to previously mastered levels.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I was struck by how every level adds a new mechanic, class, or complication. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>Also, if you play the demo, be aware that progression doesn’t transfer over to the full game. So if you do play the demo, don’t spend too much time dawdling.&nbsp;</p><p>When you play something like <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, it feels closer spiritually to something like <em>Fat Princess</em>, <em>Tokyo Jungle</em> or the games that Clover and then Platinum <em>used</em> to make. It is a mutant that escaped containment, a game that feels like it should be trapped on PS3 (or the <a href="https://x.com/Kalyoshika/status/1816024266162487375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox 360</a>). It does not feel like new software, but a title you need a particularly glitchy and experimental emulator to run.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Boss battles are disgusting, and beautiful. This one drops phallus-like worms on you. Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>There is a poverty of possibility in the current game space. The people who make decisions involving money love a sure, reliable, easily repeatable release. <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> should not be a rarity, but we live in the wasteland that this over-financialized system has created. While the indies can do a lot, there needs to be space made for this type of vintage single A release. I would say that Game Pass is the perfect venue, but I also thought that about <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> and<a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> look what that got them</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: CAPCOM</figcaption></figure><p>Download <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>if you can. It’s on Game Pass, or it's like fifty bucks on Steam and PS5/Xbox. The demo is also fairly robust if you are on the fence. I hope it’s a success, and that it ushers in not only a resurgence of <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">orb-based gaming</a> but also of daring, weird, less than AAA games that are still, against all odds, being made.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is available on PS4/PS5, current Xbox consoles and Steam. As of this writing, it is included on Microsoft's Game Pass. </em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"We always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions."</p>

            <p>
Of all the changes made in the transition from Overwatch 1 to 2, the move from 6v6 battles to 5v5 was undoubtedly one of its most controversial. And now developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> has confirmed its's revisiting that decision, exploring if and how 6v6 matches could be re-introduced to Overwatch 2 in a series of upcoming tests.
</p>
<p>
All this is detailed in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/">blog</a> from Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller, who begins by explaining exactly why the move to 5v5 was made in the first place. "The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs," he writes, "but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments."
</p>
<p>
As such, 5v5 was chosen to increase individual agency, to better balance the impact each class can have in a match, to make the experience more "cognitively manageable, and - perhaps most significantly of all - to alleviate extremely long queue times. "Players generally queue Tank less," continues Keller, "leading to longer wait times for all while we wait for a Tank to free up to find a proper match." And with Overwatch 2 requiring one rather than two tanks in competitive play, average wait times for damage and support characters are now "much shorter".

<p>
Despite these improvements, Keller acknowledges that some of the changes made to Overwatch over the years have come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom", and that the team gets feedback from players saying the experience can feel "the same" from game to game. Which brings us to Blizzard's future plans. Keller says that, based on player feedback, the studio is now looking to run a series of events that'll enable it to "try out different core team composition formats".
</p>
<p>
"Because we operate as a service to our players," he continues, "we always remain open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback, to give you the best game experience we can. Rather than introduce a disruptive, permanent change to the game, we'd prefer to explore the space further and make changes based on that exploration."

<p>
One reason for this cautiousness is technical performance. Keller says Blizzard has taken advantage of the reduced technical overheads in 5v5 matches to introduce upgrades and additions - ranging from allied outlines to more technically demanding hero kits - that will likely result in lower performance on older machines if 6v6 is re-introduced. Remedying this is expected to take "at least several seasons". Additionally, the studio needs to be "openly mindful not to frustrate" those players who've only ever experienced - and like - 5v5, and that's even before considering the queue issues that might resurface if 6v6 proves popular.
</p>
<p>
"We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run," Keller adds, "and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that's a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."
</p>
<p>
Keller also believes at least some of Overwatch's perceived sameyness isn't actually to do with team sizes, but rather the composition of those teams - and so it'll also be re-examining "the ways we tried solving previous problems... We think there could be other ways of putting a team together that aren't quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue." To that end, Season 13 will feature "at least one Quick Play: Hacked based on this idea".
</p>
<p>
"This isn't the last time we’re going to be getting into 5v5 or 6v6, and we can't wait to share more about our plans in the future," Keller concludes. "In closing, we appreciate you so much, and we love seeing your passion and dedication."
</p>
<p>
Overwatch 2's 13th season is expected to get underway in October, but first there's Season 12, which'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2s-new-hero-is-space-ranger-juno-and-shes-available-to-play-today">introduce new space ranger hero Juno</a> when it arrives on 20th August.

In defense of the former, it <em>does</em> feature some of the tougher boss fights I’ve ever encountered. On the other hand, I’ve always felt like <em>Elden Ring </em>was a pretty malleable experience, and that it provided <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-summons-multiplayer-1851573539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-summons-multiplayer-1851573539">a lot of tools</a></span> to allow you to power through the game and ultimately come out the other side.

Soulslike players froth at the mouth for a good challenge run, and that’s why you’ll often see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watch-a-guy-beat-sekiro-in-under-two-hours-blindfolded-1848372079&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watch-a-guy-beat-sekiro-in-under-two-hours-blindfolded-1848372079">blindfolded showcases</a></span> or hitless boss gauntlets at events like Summer Games Done Quick. With <em>Elden Ring</em>’s immense popularity, that scene kind of exploded and moved beyond straightforward challenges like level-1 runs, where the player isn’t allowed to level up for the entirety of the game. Instead, these challenges got exponentially weirder.</p><p>I’m talking about completely alternative ways of playing <em>Elden Ring</em>. Instead of playing the game with a controller or mouse and keyboard, some have taken to modding the game to support input from musical instruments. Others have used dance pads, and some have even used their brain to just look at the game and communicate inputs via brain waves. The <em>Elden Ring </em>community has proven how consistently inventive it is, and has managed to rise to utterly ridiculous challenges in bizarre and even byzantine ways, so I thought it might be fun to rattle off some of the most impressive methods players have used to beat <em>Elden Ring </em>bosses over the years. </p><h2 id="h31231"><a id=""></a>Dance pad</h2><p>Arguably the most popular of the alternatives, dance pads have been a staple of Soulslike challenge runs for a long while, but they’ve never been bigger. That’s largely due to MissMikkaa, a streamer who’s taken it upon herself to try and beat <em>Elden Ring </em>via too many alternate methods. Her most famous runs have been ones where she’s aided (or hampered, depending on how you see it) by a dance pad. In the years since the release of <em>Elden Ring</em>, her runs have only grown increasingly more unhinged. At one point, she even took on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-twitch-ps5-pc-dancepad-missmikkaa-malenia-1850032182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-twitch-ps5-pc-dancepad-missmikkaa-malenia-1850032182">hardest boss fight twice simultaneously</a></span>, controlling one character with her dance pad and another with a standard PS5 controller. I could hardly beat Malenia <em>once</em> on a controller, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-elden-ring-stream-marathon-malenia-1851484479">Kai Cenat spent more than 24 hours</a></span> trying to defeat her without summons, but sure, show off.</p><h2 id="h31232"><a id=""></a><em>Donkey Kong </em>bongos</h2><p>Little known fact: the <em>Donkey Konga </em>rhythm series are some of the finest games of our lifetimes. I hold this to be true, even though I’ve never played them. Why then, would I make such an assertive statement? Because they gave us the best controllers ever: the <em>Donkey Kong </em>bongos.<br></p><p>I love a good rhythm game, and playing them inspired me to pick up the guitar at an early age, but <em>Rock Band</em>’s plastic drums don’t have shit on the <em>DK </em>Bongos. These utterly ridiculous controllers have been around for damn near 20 years at this point, and in that time, they’ve become a beloved bit of memorabilia <em>and </em>another popular alternative for challenge runs.

If that’s the case, congratulations, you’re skilled in ways that some people never get around to. Now, just imagine if you could harness that ability and channel it back into games. That’s what some people have managed over the years as they turned their favorite instruments into controllers and triumphed over <em>Elden Ring</em>’s numerous challenges.</p><p>That’s what Anna Ellsworth did a few years ago when she beat Margit the Fell Omen by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-anna-ellsworth-harp-margit-fell-omen-tree-se-1849071184&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-anna-ellsworth-harp-margit-fell-omen-tree-se-1849071184">plucking the strings of her harp</a></span>.

Utilizing an electroencephalogram that basically reads her brain activity, as well as some eye-tracking technology, she has been able to decimate <em>Elden Ring</em>’s gallery of godly rogues with little more than her thoughts and the blink of an eye. Talk about putting those bosses in their place.</p><h2 id="h31235"><a id=""></a>Morse code</h2><p>Though I’d heard of most of the other challenge runs featured here, this is the most surprising one I hadn’t heard about until I started doing research for this piece. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527">Spanish streamer Silithur</a></span> managed to beat <em>Elden Ring </em>a few months ago with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyImportantFriesAMPEnergy-qoSlWKhAB3tPMsSW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispyImportantFriesAMPEnergy-qoSlWKhAB3tPMsSW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morse code</a></span>! That’s right, a single button and way too many dashes and dots to count, but the guy fucking did it. He even snuck in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-elon-musk-morse-code-twitter-1851415527">dunk on Elon Musk</a></span> in the process. How do you tap out, “Holy shit, you’re a legend” in Morse?</p><h2 id="h31236"><a id=""></a>A fish</h2><p>I’m not sure what I could write that properly captures what a feat this is. This goldfish is just built different. Better than most of us, even. We could all stand to learn a thing or two from them.</p><h2 id="h31237"><a id=""></a>Full-body motion controller</h2><p>Sometimes you play a game so good you just want to live in it, perils and all. Well that’s what the streamer Luality kind of accomplished by turning her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxUZr061XE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxUZr061XE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whole body into her <em>Elden Ring </em>controller</a></span>. With the help of some motion controls, the streamer turned <em>Elden Ring </em>into a full-body experience. If she wanted to dodge, she would bob in that direction and if she wanted to attack she would make a swiping motion with her hand, as if she was actually armed. She even bound the healing flask to her making a drinking motion with one of her hands. The results are as chaotic, frustrating, and funny as you might expect.</p><h2 id="h31238"><a id=""></a>Ring Fit Wheel (and all the other wild ways this guy modded the game)</h2><p>While doing some research for this list, I came across one YouTube channel that has, over the years, put a lot of effort into playing <em>Elden Ring </em>with increasingly bizarre controllers. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperLouis64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Louis 64</a></span>’s whole thing is actually that he seems to love gimmicky controls and makes a bunch of unique ones from scratch. Boy, has he found a lot of different ways in which to play <em>Elden Ring</em>, folks.</p><p>I am most familiar with his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cC-T3a-Y0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6cC-T3a-Y0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ring Fit Adventure </em>set up</a></span>, where he uses that game’s unique wheel-like controller to exercise while also dodge-rolling and plugging away at bosses in <em>Elden Ring</em>. His contraptions don’t end there, though. Just a month ago, the guy figured out how to make a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_sgWVA7us&amp;t=657s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY_sgWVA7us&amp;t=657s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully functional bow and arrow controller</a></span> from a kids’ toy. Before that, he literally built a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfpdHdOoLU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIfpdHdOoLU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatsword from <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span><em> </em>and turned it into a controller. He’s also famously played the game with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-super-louis-64-banana-controller-emulator-bo-1848657617&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-super-louis-64-banana-controller-emulator-bo-1848657617">controller fashioned from bananas</a></span>. I don’t understand how or why he does these things, but the point is that there’s someone out there doing it, and that’s pretty neat.</p><h2 id="h31239"><a id=""></a>A mouth controller</h2><p>While most of these entries are cool optional challenge runs that folks have opted into, my favorite is this one from a disabled player who can’t use standard controllers. A tetraplegic player—meaning they’re paralyzed from the neck down— shared a video of themselves overcoming <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s motherfucker of a final boss <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ebrjwr/i_finally_beat_the_dlc_endboss_with_my_mouth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1ebrjwr/i_finally_beat_the_dlc_endboss_with_my_mouth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with a mouth controller</a></span>. I don’t know about you, but it’s maybe one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I’ve yet to get to the end of the expansion, but I’m sure that fight’s going to take me hundreds of tries to beat unless I use a very busted build. Some of the most seasoned <em>Elden Ring </em>players are fully abled and struggle against it. It literally either takes grit, complete mastery of the game, or an intense exploitation to do this fight with both hands, but here’s someone who can clear it without the use of any. That’s a goddamn hero right there. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Roughly 2,600 voice actors and motion capture artists, including talents like Troy Baker from <em>The Last of Us</em>, Jennifer Hale from <em>Mass Effect</em>, and Matt Mercer from<em> The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, have been working without an Interactive Media Agreement since November 2022.

The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games,” chief negotiator  Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a statement. “That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the A.I. use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year - that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that.”</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117">Video Game Voice Actors Are Ready To Strike Over AI.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-6v6-is-returning-in-new-tests/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>After nearly two years of the community voicing frustrations, Blizzard has announced that Overwatch 2 6v6 will be coming back. This return comes in the form of new tests to decide if the game will permanently go back to 6v6 or stick with 5v5.</p>



<p>“The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test,” game director Aaron Keller said in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on the Overwatch website</a>. “Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-hasn-t-overwatch-2-returned-to-6v6-gameplay">Why Hasn’t Overwatch 2 Returned To 6v6 Gameplay?</h2>



<p>As far as why they will run tests of the mode instead of a full scale return, Keller says there are a few reasons for the decision. The first, he says, is to make sure the game can be optimized for 12-player matches.</p>



<p>“There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game,” he said. “These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps.”</p>



<p>He added that in 6v6 play, the updates can cause performance issues on older systems.</p>



<p>The second big reason, which he says gives him “anxiety about opening this Pandora’s Box”, involves match queue times if 6v6 becomes a permanent addition to the game.</p>



<p>“The team was not able to solve this issue previously,” he said. “While we have some ideas now, there’s no guarantee that they will work. Is there a world where people are willing to live with long queue times to play this format? Maybe, but that’s a pretty risky move to make.”</p>



<p>He closed by saying that the Overwatch team’s goal is to continue to build a game “that you want to play season after season”, even if that means the return of 6v6.</p>

<p>What do you think of Overwatch 2 bringing back 6v6, at least with test matches for now?

                <p>CPU manufacturer AMD has announced it's delaying the release of its new Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs after discovering that some of the first chips to come off the assembly line were lacking in quality. Previously scheduled to arrive in late July, the processors will now become available for purchase in August.</p><p dir="ltr">"We appreciate the excitement around Ryzen 9000 series processor," AMD senior VP and GM of computing and graphics Jack Huynh <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1816210711254639031" rel="nofollow ">said on Twitter</a>. "During final checks, we found the initial production units that were shipped to our channel partners did not meet our full quality expectations. Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units. As a result, there will be a short delay in retail availability."</p><p dir="ltr">The delay affects four Ryzen 9000 series processors, all of which were initially scheduled for a July 31 launch. The four products affected by the delay--and their new release dates--are listed below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 5 9600X:</strong> Thursday, August 8</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 9700X:</strong> Thursday, August 8</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 9900X:</strong> Thursday, August 15</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X:</strong> Thursday, August 15</li></ul><p dir="ltr">"Apologies for the delay," Huynh added. "We pride ourselves in providing a high quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series."</p><p>AMD has yet to reveal how much each processor will cost, but it appears that French tech retailer PC21 has accidentally leaked some of the processors' prices (via <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-9000-processors-prices-listed-by-french-retailer-european-ryzen-9-9900x-price-converts-to-nearly-dollar750" rel="nofollow ">Tom's Hardware</a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/matteo-menapace-co-designer-of-daybreak-has-been-banned-from-spiel-des-jahres<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Germany held its annual Spiel des Jahres event. It is one of the biggest award shows in the tabletop industry, rewarding sharp game design and excellent quality. And one of its winners, Matteo Menapace, has been permanently banned from all future events. This was due to a sticker he chose to wear, and the message it sent.</p>

<p>The banning of Matteo Menapace from Spiel des Jahres was announced via post on their <a href="https://www.spiel-des-jahres.de/preisverleihung-kennerspiel-des-jahres-2024/">official website</a>. The post explains the reason for Menapace's ban. While attending the event, Menapace wore a sticker on stage in the Palestinian national colors represented as a watermelon.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/matteo-menapace-daybreak-spiel-des-jahres-award-photo.jpg?itok=iScPIyM0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/matteo-menapace-daybreak-spiel-des-jahres-award-photo.jpg?itok=Bd8z8PR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The small sticker was attached to Menapace's t-shirt during the event. During the event, the sticker was not noticed. However, shortly after, chairman Harald Schrapers and deputy chairman Christoph Schlewinski asked Menapace to hand over the sticker, forbade him to show it during photographs, and said he would no longer be welcome at future award events.</p>
<p>According to the Spiel des Jahres association, the intended message of this sticker, that of a "Great Palestine" denies the existence of the State of Israel. In context, this is an expression of antisemitism, which exceeded the limits of legitimate political expression at the event.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it goes against the organization's "Playing For Tolerance" initiative, which is against any form of racism and antisemitism. This initiative has been in place for years.</p>
<p>Matteo Menapace and Matt Leacock won this year's Kennerspiel des Jahres award for complex games at Spiel des Jahres. The award was for their climate action-focused board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334986/daybreak"><em>Daybreak</em></a> (aka <em>e-mission</em> in Germany).</p>
<p>It is a co-op experience where you and your friends control a global power. Your goal is to dismantle the causes of climate change and reduce global emissions to net zero. In addition, you must help reform and rebuild world societies that protect people from life-threatening crises. If global temps get too high or if too many people are in crisis, you all lose.</p>

Today’s <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/director-s-take-opening-up-the-conversation-on-5v5-and-6v6/">blog post from the developers</a> at Blizzard says that, finally, “we’re exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.” </p><p>Game director Aaron Keller also notes that issues like hero balancing, game performance, and what might happen to queue times if players have a choice between the two formats are questions the team needs to answer but is at least ready to start considering.</p><p>Other than making a full-priced game free to play and laying out promises about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725808/overwatch-2-hero-mode-canceled-2023-roadmap">player-vs-environment content</a> that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/19/23730369/overwatch-2-pve-hero-mode-cancellation">weren’t exactly fulfilled</a>, the shift to <em>Overwatch 2</em> also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446374/overwatch-2-preview-five-player-multiplayer-new-maps-changes">removed one tank player</a> from each team.

It’s not really that simple. I’ve played the game in all roles throughout all of these iterations, and I see arguments on both sides of the issue. There’s no question that the new game has better queue times, which the post attributes to the fact that the actual number of players queueing for each role has always more closely fit a ratio of one tank per team.</p><p>But even in the old system, I agree that the games were chaotic, and now there’s a playerbase full of people who’ve never experienced it. Good luck explaining ultimate combos to someone who might have never heard most of the voice lines from tank teammates talking to each other.</p><p>While it’s unclear when the 6v6 playtests will happen, Keller says that at least one “Hacked” event this season will try out “other ways of putting a team together that aren’t quite as rigid as a set composition, but not as loose as Open Queue,” to see how the developers can address some issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>If you can't betray your friends in the middle of an arcade or party game, are you even having fun?</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'll always have a soft spot for the games I'd play with my friends for hours at a time while we jostled each other on the couch and screamed at each other for any perceived betrayal. You know the ones: your Mario Karts and Mario Parties. Games where forging flimsy alliances against the one player who is perceived as the greatest threat, or being a filthy scumbag of a traitor who delights in chaos, are things that are not actually a part of the core gameplay loop in these games, but we as a society have decided that they should be. They are the video game Unos of the world. Racing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deathsprint-66/" data-ref-id="5000-623102">DeathSprint 66</a> is shaping up to be that kind of experience. I've played DeathSprint 66 twice now--once at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5449/" data-ref-id="2900-5449">Summer Game Fest</a> and again recently at a preview event--and both times, the game tickled the lizard part of my brain that enjoys snatching away a victory from a friend at the last minute and offering up nothing more than a coy smile.</p><p dir="ltr">DeathSprint 66 sees you and seven other players (or bots!) race around tracks at breakneck speeds, utilizing augmented suits to sprint at high speeds, drift around corners, grind along rails, wall-run, and make incredible acrobatic leaps. All the while, the track and the other players pose as constant dangers--shifting laser grids and massive buzzsaws dot each track and items like heat-seeking drones and landmines can be picked up and used by you and your competitors. It's a dangerous competition, but thankfully you're only racing as your character's clone--and you bring a handful of backups with you to each race, so every blood splatter or eviscerated limb is only a few seconds of delay in your day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340527" data-ratio="0.546875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340527"></a><figcaption>Don't worry about losing your legs--your character has several backup clones who can jump into the race.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340527-death_blood.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Nearly every aspect of DeathSprint 66 is geared around the mayhem and the process of taking advantage of others to improve your own chances of success (running directly behind a competitor and in the draft they create, for example, grants you a quick burst of speed to pass them by). DeathSprint 66 is ripe for friendly betrayal, and I felt nostalgic for Sonic Riders while playing it (the first one, obviously; not its weird sequels). It's also very approachable--though the tougher tracks are trickier to get around, DeathSprint 66 is a mechanically simple game, and a few runs around each track will give you a pretty good idea of where you can go. Once you grasp that understanding, it's just a question of practice. If you've played an arcade racer like Mario Kart or Sonic Riders, you already have an understanding of the type of game DeathSprint 66 is.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, there are a few ways in which DeathSprint 66 falls short of what's come before. The most blatant is the aesthetic variety of the tracks, which is to say there isn't any. Though each track offers a unique challenge in terms of its layout--you've got your traditional figure-eight, for instance, and then your more dastardly setups like one track that sees you needing to regularly get over huge pits of saw blades--they all take place in the same city and largely look the same. That's not a dealbreaker for me when it comes to wanting to grab DeathSprint 66, but it does interfere with any of the tracks developing any sort of personality.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340528" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340528"></a><figcaption>I'd like to see a little bit more variety when it comes to character customization.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4340528-death_racers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This issue extends to character creation, too. You can customize your character somewhat, fitting them with different racing suits and picking from a collection of different color schemes, but it's not enough--you can't easily distinguish between different racers once everyone is in motion. If someone is going to throw a buzzsaw at me, I want to know exactly who to blame before they have a chance to fake how they don't know what I'm talking about. And if I see someone wallrunning behind me, I want to be able to know exactly which of my friends I should be making a deal with before betraying said sucker.</p><p dir="ltr">These aspects of competitive arcade racers--knowing the track and being able to identify your competitors at a glance--aren't crucial to the genre, but they do make them more fun, and it's disappointing to see DeathSprint 66 not running out of the gate with that already locked down. As a live-service game, it's entirely possible new tracks will be added post-launch that are aesthetically distinct from what the game starts with, and that additional character customization options could be implemented that are more wacky and visually clear-cut than the generic choices the game is starting with. But the structure of the game is already a great time, and I can't wait to trick my friends into picking it up on the promise that it will be a chill time for all.</p><p dir="ltr">DeathSprint 66 is set to launch on PC in 2024.</p>
