            <p>It's been over a decade since Blizzard, developers of StarCraft and WarCraft, released a new real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, but not for want of enthusiasm from certain Blizzard developers. According to a report, former StarCraft 2 production director Tim Morten and unnamed accomplices pitched several RTS projects to higher-ups at Activision-Blizzard, before Morten jumped ship to co-found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stormgate">Stormgate</a> creators Frost Giant in 2020. These pitches included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warcraft-iv">WarCraft 4</a>, as you'd expect, and also a Call Of Duty RTS, as you'd probably also expect, though seemingly no new StarCraft.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from Jason Schreier, him of the plentiful journalisms and assorted newsbrokage. He's got a book, Play Nice, about Blizzard's history out on 8th October. Seeking to recruit readers for his latest tome of investo-sleuthing, Schreier has descended to the fifth circle of Hell - Reddit - and done an Ask Me Anything. In it, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1fs5nw9/comment/lpi304j/?utm_name=web3xcss">wrote the following</a> (ta, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/world-of-warcraft/desperate-to-get-another-rts-off-the-ground-blizzard-developers-reportedly-pitched-warcraft-4-and-a-call-of-duty-rts-that-got-shot-down/">Gamesradar</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Morten and his team tried for years to kick off a new RTS, making all sorts of pitches and prototypes, from Warcraft 4 to even, wildly, a Call of Duty RTS pitch. (He was desperate.) But there was no appetite among Blizzard's executive team for a new RTS game. They held out hope that if [Warcraft 3] Reforged was a massive success it might help open the doors for a WC4, but Reforged turned out to be a debacle -- the company's first bad game and a blemish in Blizzard's history.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you missed the Reforged debacle, the game shipped with a bunch of bugs, performance problems and missing features. Blizzard committed to patching the flaws initially, and then, as the player tirades continued, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-now-offering-warcraft-3-reforged-refunds-to-anyone-who-wants-one">started offering refunds to anybody who asked</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review">In her review of Reforged</a>, Alice B (RPS in peace) found it to be not quite as calamitous as all that, but definitely a disappointment. "People never entirely stopped playing the original Warcraft III, so when you think about it, a remastered version feels long overdue," she wrote in 2020. "In some respects, Warcraft III: Reforged does a serviceable job of fulfilling that need. In others, it's a bit - dare I say - underforged. In further respects still, some people might wish it had never happened."</p>
<p>You can see why Blizzard management might think twice about greenlighting anything arty-essy after all that, I guess. The departure of key staff is probably also a factor, with many ancient Star- and WarCraftspeople now gainfully employed elsewhere making spiritual sequels. Frost Giant and Stormgate aside, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battle-aces-is-a-fast-and-furious-mechabug-rts-from-blizzard-talent-that-turns-starcraft-into-a-game-of-cards">Battle Aces</a> from Uncapped Games, a studio founded by former StarCraft 2 lead multiplayer designer David Kim. Meanwhile, Blizzard continue to butt their heads against the much-aborted daydream of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">a StarCraft shooter</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure there's any need for one, but I wouldn't mind playing a Call Of Duty RTS. Predictably, I'm thinking a smaller infantry tactics affair would make more sense than a game of mass production and bases, though I do like the idea of spawning two dozen Soap MacTavishes and hearing their voice lines overlap. I can't quite see new parent company Microsoft signing off on such a thing, in these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">times of mass layoffs</a>, but if there's one thing Microsoft appear 100% committed to it's the onward march of Call Of Duty. Who knows?</p>
<p>While you foment the ole speculation, why not revisit this prototype for a COD RTS created by Vicarious Visions over 12 long years ago.</p>

            <p>
Epic has today announced major new litigation as it takes its battle against existing app store monopolies to former ally Samsung, as well as continued rival Google, in a fresh front that may see a return to the courtroom.
</p>
<p>
One key feature found on Samsung phones forms the cornerstone of Epic Games' new complaint: a setting known as Auto Blocker that users must turn off to install Epic Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The instigator of this complaint is one and only one thing: that Samsung recently introduced a piece of technology it calls Auto Blocker, which blocks side-loading of software - it blocks the installation of software from stores that aren't its own, or the Google Play store," Epic boss Tim Sweeney said in a press briefing ahead of the litigation being made public.
</p>
<p>
Epic suggests Auto Blocker is an attempt at collusion between Google and Samsung, where the former hands off what Epic deems to be anti-competitive practices to a major partner, ahead of firmer rules being enforced on Google itself.
</p>
<p>
In practice, Auto Blocker works similarly to the existing "scare screens" and additional technical steps on other phones that make downloading software outside of official sources - such as the Google Play and iPhone App Store -  more difficult.
</p>
<p>
Users attempting to download the Epic Game Store, for example, are warned in technical and scary language that they are risking the safety of their device, and required to go disable  Auto Blocker from within their phone's settings via a fairly laborious process to continue. 
</p>
<p>
Already, Android's sequence of alerts and extra steps dissuades around 50 percent of users from going on to complete the download, Sweeney said. Samsung's Auto Blocker steps add further "friction" on top of that, he continued.
</p>
<p>
"For your security, your phone currently isn't allowed to install unknown apps from this source," one alert message reads. 
</p>
<p>
"Well, Google knows what Fortnite is, they've distributed it in the past," Sweeney noted. "Google knows what Epic Game Store is, they've dealt with us. So this warning in itself is misleading."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_udQUCb4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Epic Games slideshow showing steps to install on Samsung devices, including switching off Auto Blocker. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Epic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Epic is unhappy with both Google and Samsung here, as users must allow Google's Chrome browser to install software (such as the Epic Game Store) and then deal with Samsung's Auto Blocker itself. 
</p>
<p>
"[This is] a new Samsung warning that came in after we won Epic vs. Google," Sweeney said. "A feature Samsung turned on by default for all [new] users which caught us off-guard." 
</p>
<p>
Sweeney described Samsung's own alerts during the installation process also as "misleading", as once again the generic warning message describes Epic Game Store as an "unknown app".
</p>
<p>
"Samsung knows what Fortnite is," he continued. "Fortnite has been presented in numerous of their stage presentations and streams to the public, they've been marketing it in a partnership where we've spent tens of millions of dollars together. Samsung knows Epic Game Store. And yet they're calling it an 'unknown app'."
</p>
<p>
Samsung describes Auto Blocker as a feature that helps "keep ypu safe from security threats, suspicious activity, and privacy risks" and also works to block malware in messaging apps, and warns you when unknown commands or software updates are initiated by devices connected via USB. In short, turning it off is made to sound like a bad move.
</p>
<p>
"It makes it pretty much hopeless for any store to ever compete with  the Samsung Galaxy Store and Google Play store," Sweeney said. "It's intentional. The purpose of this is not to protect the user from malware. Windows and Mac have perfectly good mechanisms to protect against malware, and Epic completely supports platforms protecting against malware. 
</p>
<p>
"What's happening here is different: it's just trying to obstruct against competition by making it super hard, and one of the key elements of this obstruction is presenting misleading messages to the user which present software as - which the platform maker know about, knows is safe and secure - [and is instead] characterising it as unknown and potentially harmful to your device. That's what our litigation is about.
</p>
<p>
"It's about unfair competition by making it seem like competitor's products inferior to the company's products themselves."
</p>
<p>
And this, of course, is a huge problem for Epic Games as it chases ambitious smartphone install targets for its storefront and Fortnite. Sweeney revealed that Epic Game Store had now hit 10m mobile installs, but the company is still chasing a much higher 100m target by the year's end. 
</p>
<p>
Epic says it is launching the legal action now following the recent move by Samsung to have Auto Blocker switched on by default for new handsets. 
</p>
<p>In a statement, Epic said its lawsuit claims the "recent implementation of the Auto Blocker feature was intentionally crafted in coordination with Google to preemptively undermine the US District Court's remedy following the jury's verdict in Epic's case against Google". </p>
<p>"The jury found that Google's app store practices are illegal, including the unlawful agreements Google enters into with phone manufacturers such as Samsung."</p>
<p>Epic says its aim with these legal proceedings is to get Auto Blocker turned off by default to "enable competition". </p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Samsung and Google for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-first-patch-notes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>KT Racing has released the first major patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>, aiming to fix the vast majority of the issues that affected the game’s launch earlier this month.</p>
<p>The update is available for download across all platforms, as of 8AM UTC today, 30th September. Alongside this, the servers are also undergoing maintenance, which started at the same time.</p>


<p>The key improvements are to do with stability, KT Racing hoping to fix the vast majority of the server errors, lobby and race disconnections and other issues affecting the online-only game. They’ve also sought for general improvements to the frame rate, while keeping the same graphics quality, and then there’s over 300 other miscellaneous fixes as well.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown:</p>
<h3>Servers/Networks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Significant server/network improvements: fixed login errors, lobbies and races disconnections, save issues &amp; other specific server-related problems.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where meeting points and POI discovery were not saved</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performances/Stability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stability improvements (fixed various crashes and freezes)</li>
<li>Performances improvements (increased global framerate while maintaining the same graphics quality)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Graphics/Interfaces(UX/UI)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added Master setting in graphical options</li>
<li>Fixed graphical tearing issue</li>
<li>Fix some cases of bad rendering in virtual garage when accessing pause menu</li>
<li>PC Only: Removed displayed menus when enabling Nvidia Ansel</li>
<li>Fixed various Live Events UI issues</li>
<li>Fix a few “NoLoca” issues</li>
<li>Fixed wrong display of turbo on the HUD.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved environmental sounds</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect audio in some languages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved support for peripherals (steering wheels, shifters, etc.)</li>
<li>Improved support for ultra-wide monitors</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc</h3>
<p>300+ miscellaneous minor bug fixes, as well as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolved cases of hardlock after the first race of the onboarding</li>
<li>Fixed ELO not decreasing when abandoning ranked races</li>
<li>Fixed suspension issues on various cars</li>
<li>Prevented several cases where player could drive through NPCs in free roam</li>
<li>Fixed cases where AI would drive in the opposite way after finishing a race.</li>
<li>Improved pathfinding of GPS</li>
<li>Removed incorrect indication of a race at lvl 3 that should not exist.</li>
<li>Updated the price of special edition cars</li>
</ul>
<p>Going forward, KT Racing is hoping to capture more of the essence of Test Drive Unlimited through the seasonal updates that will put more of the lifestyle aspects into the game. The studio released a dev diary that explored some of these topics, such as how they could look at introducing cross-play at some point down the line, but currently have other focus points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Launch Dev Diary &amp; Next Steps" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2I14V-HqOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following launch server issues, KT and Nacon have also committed to giving some kind of compensation for affected players. It seems that they are still undecided as to the best way of doing this, though they are clear that there will not simply be a handout of Solar Coins currency or cosmetic items.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown review</a>, I said, “After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</p>

            <p>Kojima Productions has shared several new snippets of footage for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach, including a look at the upcoming game's very realistic photo mode and Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion, Dollman.</p>
<p>The footage was shared as part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3XizwzhEY">Death Stranding 2 panel</a>, which was held at Tokyo Game Show this weekend. In the time since, Kojima Productions has steadily uploaded the English footage for the game to social media.</p>

<p>The first clip is titled 'Dollman &amp; Tarman Member Introductions', and here we are formally introduced to Death Stranding 2's stop motion puppet. It all takes place on board that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">submarine we also got a peak at during January's State of Play</a>, which made everyone look a slightly deathly shade of blue.</p>

<p>Anyway, this puppet is Dollman and he is also rather partial to a song or two, as shown in a subsequent clip introducing us to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-that-was-elle-fanning-in-kojimas-mysterious-new-game-teaser">Elle Fanning's Tomorrow</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-hires-deadpool-2-actress-for-mysterious-new-game">Shioli Kutsuna's Rainy</a>.</p>
<p>When these two characters are discussing babies being born, they begin singing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head, and Dollman joins in. Sam, being a good sport, removes the puppet from his waist (where he was clipped on to, I assume, a belt loop like a charm) and starts to shake him along to the rhythm. It is actually quite endearing.</p>

<p>The next clip is all about Heartman, who proudly tells Sam and Dollman he can "flatline any time, anywhere without worrying". He can also sleep standing up so has no need for beds, which does sound super useful.</p>

<p>Back to Dollman, this bit of Death Stranding 2 footage shows the puppet taking part in an in-game event video, dancing to a song called Horizon Dreamer by Daichi Miura. It is quite a bop, actually, and Dollman has moves!</p>
<p>The music for this is due to come out later today, I will keep my eyes out for it.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, Kojima Productions also gave us a look at Death Stranding 2's photo shoot event, which you can have with Rainy, Fragile (played by Léa Seydoux) and Tomorrow. </p>
<p>The three can be seen doing all kinds of poses for the camera, as well as throwing some stuffed Cryptobiotes about in a playful way. It looks really quite realistic, and I did a double take the first time this clip showed up on my feed.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> said he knew Death Stranding 2's release date already, but he refrained from sharing that news with the public. The developer said while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 appears to still be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-release-date-wont-be-revealed-until-some-point-next-year">on course for a 2025 release</a>, however. How do you think it is looking so far?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you've always thought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>'s roster was lacking something but couldn't put your finger (lickin') on it, Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada knows - it's Colonel Sanders.</p>
<p>Despite his best efforts, however, Harada hasn't been able to convince KFC to give the all-clear to include Sanders as a fighter - or, indeed, fashion a Waffle House-inspired fighting stage.</p>

<p>"A long time ago, I wanted to have Colonel Sanders from Kentucky Fried Chicken fight," Harada said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tekken-colonel-sanders-guest-fighter-shot-down-by-kfc-harada/">The Gamer</a>. "So, I asked to use Colonel Sanders and go to the head office in Japan."</p>
<p>Harada says his suggestion was turned down by a "bad look".</p>
<p>For a brief while, Harada simply concluded that KFC didn't want to share its iconic mascot with <em>any</em> game, but given he's since turned up in a dating simulator, the team has since presumed it's the fighting FKC takes issue with, not gaming itself.</p>
<p>"[Harada] went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and tried to get Colonel Sanders," game designer Michael Murray added.  "They weren't very open to the idea.</p>
<p>"[Colonel Sanders] appeared in games after that. So maybe it was just him fighting against someone [that] was posing a problem for them. But it just goes to show how difficult these types of discussions are."</p>
<p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-will-see-series-bad-guy-heihachi-return-as-dlc-this-autumn">Heihachi Mishima, antagonist of the Tekken series, is set to make a return to the series in Tekken 8 this autumn</a>.</p>
<p>Heihachi's reveal was announced at this year's Evo fighting game esports event in a new trailer, along with a new story mode chapter called The Dark Awakens. He'll be the third DLC character added to the game since its release earlier this year, following Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Some games surprise you with a novel premise that lends itself perfectly to interactivity, whilst others take a tried and tested idea and refine it. Squirrel With a Gun doesn’t fit with either STYLE, instead being a jokey meme at heart but one that results in a surprisingly enjoyable game. It may not reach the heights of the likes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/22/untitled-goose-game-review-switch-pc/">Untitled Goose Game</a> but it is far more than the five minute gag that I initially expected. Coming across like a fusion of Postal 2 and Goat Simulator, what results is a third person stealth platformer action game that mixes and fuses genres to create a flawed but fun experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Squirrel With A Gun - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLwL8ZmivQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>The opening few minutes of the game see you trying to come to grips with the ridiculously floaty jumping controls of the titular rodent. This is not the best introduction to the game, as your critter is an awkward little sod and you’ll find yourself missing seemingly easy jumps until it clicks. Even when you become familiar with the controls they never really work as they should and not in a fun clumsy way.</p>
<p>Fortunately the majority of the game doesn’t require the precision of this early tutorial so perseverance is rewarded by a more enjoyable set of mechanics. Once you navigate the series of platforms and press a number of switches you unlock the first major collectable – a golden acorn. Swallowing this whole sets off an alarm and a mysterious agent clad in a flawless suit bursts into the room. It is here that you first pick up a pistol and the game begins in earnest.</p>


<p>There is no backstory as to why your squirrel begins the game in a secure facility or how he takes to gunplay quite so readily, but some clues are hinted at through the antagonists that are introduced in the form of boss fights after the two main hub areas are unlocked. Progress requires you to collect a certain number of golden acorns, and the more common currency version, in order to unlock abilities. The first of these is a remote controlled car that enables you to zip around the levels, but getting enough golden acorns requires you to explore the suburbs and solve a series of environmental puzzles.</p>
<p>Tracking your progress is made easier through using flagpoles at each location. These show how many collectables there are and which you have picked up. Alongside the golden acorns there are various costume pieces (some of which have gameplay modifiers) and reload tokens that increase your passive reload skill. Collecting these isn’t necessary to finish the game but much of the enjoyment to be had comes from solving the mini-puzzles that conceal them. These range from carefully making your way across a living room submerged in lava to quickly eliminating a set number of enemies and the wide variety does help to maintain interest across the six to eight hours it’ll take to complete.</p>

<p>Of course, the main draw of the game’s title is the gun and there are a few to unlock and choose from as you make your way through to the end. You begin with a simple pistol, but uzis, shotguns, grenade launchers and bazookas are available later on. Unlocking these requires you to take one from an enemy and then buy them from set spots around the levels. These are obviously important to defend yourself against the enemy agents, but gunplay is also key to traversal as shooting your guns whilst jumping gives you extra distance or height. Balancing between the hovering capability of an uzi and the extra height of a shotgun is key in solving many of the environmental puzzles.</p>
<p>While far from being triple AAA or even remotely polished, Squirrel With A Gun is competent graphically. Glitches are present, but these are a key part of the game’s charm. Enemies are mostly identical with only a few different enemy agent types but the visual design of the various areas is solid enough. Sound design is functional but the main takeaway is the boss fight music that goes harder than it has any right to, with a Babymetal meets early 2000s nu-metal vibe.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Squirrel With a Gun is more than just a jokey throwaway meme game, but in some ways this is its biggest downfall. There is so much potential in the central mechanics that is held back by floaty controls and so it falls between two stools. A little more refinement and this could have been a more solid experience, but as a joke it goes on too long. That being said, there is enough here to entertain if you can look past those control issues.	</p></div>

            <p>Despite his cinephile tendencies, one thing you can’t accuse Kojima of is being precious about how people experience his work. Would Scorsese release eight minutes of a film chopped up into two minute chunks on Xitter, to be experienced fractured and contextless to anyone who didn’t tune into the <a href="https://youtu.be/3j3XizwzhEY">Tokyo Game Show</a>? Would Scorsese have the chutzpah to call a character Head Viceman or Tempted Christman? I doubt it. Irishman doesn’t count. It’s Dollman’s time now anyway. Let’s have a look at the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> scenes then. Watch them on your phone for <em>added kino</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s the “first public release of game footage,” say Kojima Productions, <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1840230233418469515">via X</a>.</p>

<p>This one shows Norman Reedus’s Sam and Léa Seydoux’s Fragile in a grimy boat, meeting a skinsuitted George Miller as Tarman, who has an inky cat with wings sitting on his shoulder. I played and liked the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> a lot, but I can’t remember any of the proper nouns, so you’ll have to forgive me for not using them. The ship’s dashboard is so wonderfully intricate I give it two weeks before Microprose make a game about it, and the ship’s wheel itself is a crisp projection that contrasts starkly with the decaying interior.</p>
<p>They have a chat about voyaging through the tar, and Fragile lights a cigarette with the hands on her top, which seems like an incredibly specific use for such an elaborate garment. We’re then introduced to floating puppet Dollman, who’s animated at a lower framerate to evoke old practical effects. I don’t use Twitter these days, although I’m almost tempted to sign up just so I can post about how the doll’s framerate ‘looks like a PS2 game lol’ and see how many people I can annoy.</p>
<p>Dollman insists he’s not actually a puppet - he’s alive! Alive or not, he certainly enjoys singing, as we’ll soon find out.</p>

<p>This one features Sam - now in full colour - still on what I assume is a ship, alongside Shioli Kutsuna’s Rainy and Ellle Fanning’s Tomorrow. Sam is wearing Dollman on his waist now. Rainy is pregnant, and they have a chat about birth and death. Again, I’ve forgotten much of the lore, but I distinctly remember Weird Baby Shit being one of the themes, so this all checks out. They have a singalong, Dollman and Sam insult each other a bit, and it’s on to clip number three. You should watch this one reflected in the back of a spoon.</p>

<p>This one features Sam meeting Hartman from the last game in a spooky lab full of goop statues.  I’m really starting to curse my memory at this point. Hartman flips a hourglass over, then collect a tear in a dropper. I remember this all being significant and interesting but I can’t remember how. I foresee many ‘explained in 10 minutes’ videos in my future.</p>
<p>Ah, I do remember this place! It’s Hartman’s house in the mountains, the trek to which was a prime example of the sort of delightful ballache that comprises much of Death Stranding. Hartman has a new device that lets him fall over at weird angles and contorts to support his body, which looks brilliant amounts of fun.</p>
<p>The last two clips aren’t really cutscenes. One is an <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1840235179761397869">excellent looking photo mode</a>, and another is a music video featuring <a href="https://x.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1840233883117465777">multiple dancing Dollmen</a>. I like what I see! But I would like to see Sam climbing a thing next, please. There’s only so many musical numbers I can take before I vow to only play Death Stranding 2 through goggles made out of toilet paper tubes, as Scorsese intended.</p>
<p>If you haven’t been keeping up, we last got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-a-trailer-and-2025-release-window-still-absolutely-bonkers">a trailer back in January</a>, alongside the announcement of a 2025 release window. Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-stranding-tells-the-worst-elements-of-open-world-games-to-take-a-hike">reviewed the original Death Stranding</a> in video form, calling it a “brilliant take on open world exploration; a full body cleanse of the genre’s worst habits.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Starfield Game Director Todd Howard was featured in a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1l54t9VcTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video interview</a> published on the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) YouTube channel, where the game designer talked about the inspirations for Bethesda's latest game.</p>
<p><em>Starfield, I mean, so many challenges. We pushed ourselves kind of in every part of the game. But the biggest challenge was, first, how do we generate these planets? Is that even a good idea? Okay, maybe at the time, no, but we made it work. You know, just, can we even generate a planet? And then once we could generate all of these, the simulation of the solar systems, around you. </em></p>
<p><em>But ultimately, it is; what's fun about that? So there's a technological challenge in making it work, but then there's a design challenge in how do you make that fun minute to minute and then hour to hour for everybody playing it?</em></p>
<p><em>When it comes to other media that's inspired us, it goes all the way from The Lord of the Rings. And then in science fiction there were so many: Interstellar, The Martian, Battlestar Galactica, the TV show. The show The Expanse, and there's so much science fiction out there. We wanted something that really felt kind of tactile that you believed how we got there from where we are today in our world to 300 years in the future.</em></p>
<p>Starfield is about to get its first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-gets-official-deep-dive-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space</a>, which will be unlocked later today on PC and Xbox Series S|X for $29.99 (owners of the Premium Edition have it included with their original purchase of the game). Here's an overview of what you can expect from it:</p>
<p><em>A mysterious force is stirring in the city of Dazra on the hidden homeworld of House Va'Ruun. Investigate a terrifying cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and equipment in this all-new adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>When a distress signal from an abandoned star station triggers a journey to Va'Ruun'kai, the veil of secrecy surrounding the worshippers of a deity known as "The Great Serpent" is finally lifted. Immerse yourself in the dark and complex world of House Va'Ruun as you navigate a tense political landscape, uncover the history of the Va'Ruun people, and help decide the fate of the faction in the wake of a cataclysmic event.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Bethesda did not send advance review codes for Starfield Shattered Space, so don't expect to see any reviews pop up today.</p>

            <p>Halloween is barely a month away and the Maw hoots and hiccoughs, demanding that I fill it up with original low-budget horror games, but I have no time for such things, because my thoughts are full of bread. Bread! There is nothing so horrible, and nothing so seductive. I'd like to cut back on the stuff to minimise middle-aged corpulence, but there's a place down the road that sells this amazing, tearable sourdough, and I can't get enough of it. Fortunately/unfortunately, there don't seem to be any bread-themed PC games out this week. Here's our round-up.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 30th September, why not take a tour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zoochosis">Zoochosis</a> - don't sweat the wall-giraffes, they're meant to do that, I promise. Alternatively, set course for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-shattered-space-looks-like-a-wise-return-to-bethesda-basics">Starfield's Shattered Space DLC</a> to engage in some reportedly "back-to-basics" Bethesda role-playing, or piratical venture <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691190/Rogue_Waters/">Rogue Waters</a> if you like turn-based broadsides and boarding actions. On Tuesday 1st October, oh wow, an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2990640/Endoparasitic_2/">Endoparasitic sequel</a>. Who knew having three limbs pulled off would make for such a bankable premise.  On Wednesday 2nd October, tinker with timelines to dissect triffids in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tarnished-blood">Tarnished Blood</a>. Or slam tilt the metroidvania in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601940/Pinball_Spire/">Pinball Spire</a>. Or stick it to Satan's legions in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-knight">Kill Knight</a>. On Thursday 3rd October, the delayed delivery of bike courier sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parcel-corps">Parcel Corps</a>. Also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3107880/Gnomes_and_Knights/">Gnomes And Knights</a>, a low-poly dark fantasia which merrily describes itself as "A REAL opportunity to FINALLY find the gnomes" whose "Low price matches the level of content's quality". On Friday 4th October, finally, the chance to kill off an entire cabin of vexingly photogenic youth in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a>, or hole up in the garden shed with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grunn-review">sounds amazing</a>.</p>
<p>You can read of more novelties and curiosities in our weekly liveblog below. If there's a novelty or curiosity we've overlooked, let us know in the comments so I can purse my lips and seethe impotently. Look at that, I went a whole paragraph without thinking about bread! But it is too late for me. There is a shop-fresh bag of Hovis multiseed in the kitchen, and I can hear it whispering to me yeastily through the plastic. Please share any great-looking games we've missed, and have a good week.</p><div data-live="true">

			<p>Games industry guru Hideo Kojima was featured in a lengthy interview <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Variety</a> ahead of TGS 2024, where he discussed most of his many projects. The first one is, of course, Death Stranding 2, which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-looks-even-crazier-than-the-first-one-in-the-new-tgs-2024-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a lot of new footage from TGS. Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">O.D.</a>, the Microsoft exclusive game Kojima says is a 'risky' project since it is a game 'like no other.'</p>
<p><em>At the same time, I wanted to do something new that wasn’t “Death Stranding,” so I teamed up with Microsoft to create “O.D.” This is a game, but it’s a game like no other. I can’t go into too much detail, and it’s also hard to explain, but it’s a bit risky and a new challenge for me within the realm of games.</em></p>
<p>O.D. is being made in collaboration with renowned film director Jordan Peele, and it's far from the only game-movie intersection Kojima is working on. To start with, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming Death Stranding movie</a>, which was also discussed in the Variety interview:</p>
<p><em>I have only ever thought of “Death Stranding” as a game. People tell me it feels like a movie, but I made it as a game – the direction, the settings, the story. So, I don’t intend to look back at it and try to see it from a movie perspective. Those works are my babies, and I love movies, so I want it to be something that movie fans will really enjoy! I’ll supervise the plot and help them make it, but I won’t direct it. I can’t right now with three ongoing projects! I’ll help by communicating with a director I really trust. There are several “Death Stranding” adaptation projects currently underway, but there is a different story I’ve written that’s intended for a movie. But I don’t have the time to direct it, so I won’t.</em></p>
<p>Finally, Kojima talked about the latest game <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, the stealth title Physint that will be made in partnership with PlayStation. There are already cross-media plans for that IP, too.</p>
<p><em>I’m in the second phase now and expanding the IP I made in all sorts of directions, but my other project, “Physint,” is like the gateway into the third phase. I’m trying to make it with people in filmmaking and industries outside of games. So, we may do a movie adaptation at the same time, but we will see. The assets are digital and can be used either way.</em></p>
<p>Which of these Kojima projects are you most excited about? Let us know below!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-gigantic-4x-texture-pack/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-gets-a-gigantic-4x-texture-pack.996015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-gigantic-4x-texture-pack/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Baldur's Gate 3 has received a pretty exciting texture mod. This mod utilizes AI tools to upscale low-resolution textures and provides an enhanced visual experience.</p>
<p>Texture mods in titles are a mainstay for PC gamers, especially in games like BG3, which has some inconsistencies in the overall texture environment. Apparently, the modder WestAard has released an HD Texture Pack for <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-real-time-combat-mod-now-allows-party-to-get-involved/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, which is around 27 GB in size, a massive number for a texture pack, but the interesting fact here is that this particular mod upscale the in-game textures by up to four times, using a node-based upscaling program called chaiNNer.</p>
<p><em>After a week of processing using a node-based upscaling program called chaiNNer, the mod is finally ready for release! It upscales textures 4x, so a 1K texture becomes 4K, and so on. For those who want high resolution textures that adhere to the vanilla vision, or a cover-all pack to serve as a foundation for custom-made textures, this will work wonders.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The modder further mentions that the texture pack doesn't include upscaling for armor and clothes, but every other mainstream graphic is upscaled through this particular pack.&nbsp; For BG3 users who are eager to go through a unique gaming experience, having this texture pack onboard is a must for them. According to the modder, if users desire the ultimate experience, they should also have the following set of texture packs equipped:</p>

<p>Below is an example screenshot with the mods installed.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>However, it's important to note that you must have an upper-range system to get the ultimate experience out of the texture packs, so low-end PCs may suffer with the frame rate if they attempt to use these mods. The modding community always does its job when it comes to revamping the overall experience of a title, and in this case, Baldur's Gate 3's set of texture packs is a must-try out. Even more mods may be designed for the game following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent release of the mod tools</a>, increasing its longevity.</p>

<p>On October 1, ‘version two’ of the second public demo for Road to Vostok will be released on Steam. It has been more than two years since the first demo was published, and since then, the game’s solo developer has worked hard to pump more content into the trial product.</p>



<p>Check out the full list below to find out what’s coming in the next Road to Vostok demo update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-highly-anticipated">Highly Anticipated</h2>



<p>Road to Vostok is one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. It’s penned as a hardcore single-player survival FPS, and having played the first demo as soon as it was released, I can tell you that I’ve been invested for <strong>a long time</strong>. I can’t wait to see how Road to Vostok unravels, and on October 1, the next iteration of the popular demo will be released.</p>



<p>Since the first demo was released in 2022, Road to Vostok has evolved immeasurably. Everything from partnerships with real-world survival gear manufacturers to map expansions have been jammed into the game, which at present doesn’t have a full release date. </p>



<p>In May, the game won  Best Creative Achievement of the Year at the Finnish Game Awards <strong>and </strong>the developer surpassed 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. There’s plenty of meat on the bones in this project, and here’s what’s coming to the second version of the public demo, available on October 1 on Steam:</p>



<ul>
<li>AI overhaul</li>



<li>Task system</li>



<li>Armor system</li>



<li>Crafting system</li>



<li>Map upgrades</li>



<li>New trader: Doctor</li>



<li>Ammo types</li>



<li>Area &amp; container based loot</li>



<li>New weapons</li>



<li>New attachments</li>



<li>New medical items</li>



<li>New post-processing</li>



<li>Indoor occlusion probes</li>



<li>Underground elements</li>



<li>Water reflections and ice</li>



<li>Starting kits</li>



<li>Updated tutorial</li>



<li>Dynamic ambient SFX</li>



<li>Limited AI map pools</li>



<li>Destroyable mines</li>



<li>Improved controller</li>



<li>Collision and bug fixes</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s such a staggering list that it hardly seems possible it’s designated to expand a demo product. </p>



<p>The demo is available exclusively on Steam and can be installed for free – the second version will go live on October 1, and <strong>I will be there</strong>.</p>

<p>Recently, it was revealed that the Call of Duty League’s minimum player salary requirement would be scrapped in favour of organisations simply aligning with their state’s minimum wage laws. As many have pointed out, this means that some players might be earning a woefully low amount to account for training, competing, and upholding a schedule to build and maintain a profile.</p>



<p>In response to the change, several key figures in the Call of Duty space surfaced on social media to make their opinions heard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-sacrifices-haven-t-been-worth-it">‘The Sacrifices… Haven’t Been Worth It’</h2>



<p>On Twitter, the CEO of OMiT pointed out that some players will earn as little as $7 an hour to play Call of Duty full-time. That’s not simply <strong>playing the game</strong> but also training with a team, following a schedule laid out by the development and coaching staff, competing all over North America, and constantly grinding to be best at their game.</p>



<p>For some, an entire season will pass by without a single win, which means the base salary of as little as $7 an hour will be the best it gets.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DREAL_JE/status/1839959207086264370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a comment responding to that post</a>, DREAL, former head coach at the New York Subliners (now Cloud9), said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t a career that a lot of millennials will think it will be, the sacrifices, time and social investment haven’t been worth it, except for a select lucky / talented few. Collegiate and having a plan B, in case it doesn’t work out<strong><em> long term.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another post on his profile, DREAL pointed out the struggles and uncertainties that the wider industry is going through at present. He pointed out that many young people are sacrificing too much to pursue an esports career in a world that’s becoming fast oversaturated. In his words, ‘most people sacrifice a lot for it, including developing soft skills and education.’</p>



<p>Since parting ways with the New York Subliners (Cloud9), DREAL has focused on his education, finishing up an MSc in Biomedical Science. He has taken to educating youngsters through talks and has been actively posting motivational and development-focused articles through his blog.</p>



<p>While the biggest personalities in the Call of Duty space have content creation and streaming as a secondary source of income, many of the league’s players don’t have a big enough following to earn from that angle. If they can scrounge up sponsorships, they’re slightly better off, but the matter of the fact is that this adjustment is going to have a huge impact on many players.</p>

<p>The BLAST Premier: Fall Finals 2024 event has officially ended. Eight of the best Counter-Strike 2 teams faced off against each other in an intense few days of competition, with only one team being able to walk as the victor. That team: G2 Esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-esports-win-blast-premier-fall-final-2-1-against-natus-vincere">G2 Esports Win BLAST Premier: Fall Final 2-1 Against Natus Vincere</h2>



<p>While G2 Esports may have swept the competition earlier on in the Fall Final (a 2-0 victory against Team Spirit in the Quarterfinals), the team had to put up quite the fight during the Semifinals and Grand Final. </p>



<p>After winning 2-1 against Team Vitality in the Semifinals, ultimately setting Vitality into fourth place, G2 knew that the Grand Final games would be no easy feat.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This perseverance, however, was enough to push the team into a heavy victory. With a 2-1 win against Natus Vincere, G2 Esports was awarded first place, walking away with $200,000 and qualifying for the BLAST World Final.</p>



<p>While Natus Vincere may not have won the tournament, their second place still awarded them $85,000.  </p>

<p>While Natus Vincere sat in second place at the end of the tournament, FaZe Esports was not so vigilant. The team ended up falling short of winning in the Semifinals, losing to Natus Vincere 2-1.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Still, both FaZe and Vitality were awarded $40,000 for third and fourth place, with Team Liquid coming in fifth place at the end of the tournament.</p>

The cushion is $299.99, and it’s available to buy now.</p><p>The Freyja is an extension of the vibration you get from gaming controllers — except instead of just jolting your hands, it buzzes several panels positioned behind and beneath you in response to things happening in a game. </p><p>The company says the cushion’s feedback comes from “multi-directional haptics powered by six advanced haptic motor actuators.” It connects via Bluetooth or through Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless connection.</p><p>Most of the time, that vibration will just be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134417/razer-kishi-ultra-gaming-controller-iphone-ipad-android-tablet-haptics">converted from the sound</a> in whatever game you’re playing, music you’re listening to, or movie you’re watching. Razer lists <em>Final Fantasy 16, Silent Hill 2, and Stalker 2 </em>as being among the games that integrate the Razer Sensa HD tech that drives the haptics.</p><p>Razer debuted a “Project Esther” version of the Freyja at CES, where it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24031161/razers-project-esther-kicked-my-butt">kicked <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister’s butt</a> in a demo during the event. At the time, it wasn’t clear if it would actually become a real thing — yet, here it is. </p><p>The company also rolled out the <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2FRazer-Kraken-V4-Pro%2FRZ04-05160100-R3U1">Kraken V4 Pro</a>, a version of its new Kraken V4 headphones that rattles your head with haptics. Like the cushion, the V4 Pro uses Razer HyperSpeed and Bluetooth, as well as USB or 3.5mm wired connections. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>The Razer Kraken V4 Pro has haptics for your head.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Razer</cite></p></div></div><p>The V4 Pro ships with a small box called the OLED Control Hub for tweaking its vibratory feedback, selecting your input, or adjusting effects (the headphones have RGB lights, naturally). The Razer V4 Pro costs $399.99 (or €449.99) and the first orders for it and the Freyja will deliver starting October 7th, according to their product pages.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Team Asobi says that while "almost 100%" of its most-wishlisted iconic Sony characters made it into Astro Bot, it finds it "difficult to comment" why <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> characters were missing.</p>
<p>Talking to journalist <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/astro-bot-playstation-icons-shadow-of-the-colossus">Stephen Totilo</a>, Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet said that despite hoping that "maybe half" of the characters the team approached would be greenlit, most "partners just raised their hand and said, "Absolutely'".</p>

<p>However, not all characters on the list made it in. When asked why there was no <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s Cloud cameo, for instance - or indeed, anyone from Nier or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> - Doucet simply said it "really respect[s] the choice of each publisher".</p>
<p>"It's difficult to comment on [why Square Enix didn't approve any cameos]," Doucet explained. "We really respect the choice of each publisher."</p>
<p>Acknowledging the delicate balance between accessible characters that almost all players would recognise and "deep cuts" that fewer people may remember, Doucet said that the team accepted that "at that point, you're talking to less people", but wanted to include more obscure characters because the players that know them "may have the fondest memories".</p>
<p>Sony and Team Asobi recently gave us our first peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bots-free-dlc-adds-stellar-blades-eve-and-a-helldiver-to-save">Astro Bot's upcoming - and free - DLC add on</a>.</p>
<p>This DLC will include five new online speedrunning levels, as well as 10 new bots to rescue. While Team Asobi hasn't revealed all of them, we did get a look at the bot-version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>'s Eve (a bot we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">suspected would be making an appearance</a>) and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> Helldiver in the new teaser trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-is-guerrillas-next-big-game-with-horizon-3-a-ways-off/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony continues to invest heavily in the Horizon franchise. While the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tv-show-is-in-the-works-by-the-umbrella-academys-showrunner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netflix TV series</a> has seemingly been stopped by the scandal involving showrunner Steve Blackman (The Umbrella Academy), last week's State of Play <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> the rumored Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It launches on October 31 for PlayStation 5 and PC with improved character models, shaders, and textures, new conversation mocap, enhanced cameras for dialogues, and more.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo will launch LEGO Horizon Adventures, a family-friendly spin-off that retells the story of the first installment in a way that's more palatable to a younger audience.</p>
<p>However, both of these are minor projects. The bulk of Guerrilla Games is working on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Online co-op game</a> and the third single-player installment, with the latter quietly confirmed alongside the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrillas-co-studio-head-angie-smets-promoted-to-head-of-development-strategy-at-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio's restructuring in April 2023</a>. Speaking on the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=R0A0ZEJ8dYE&amp;t=3300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest Spawn Wave podcast</a>, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier revealed which one will be released first.</p>
<p><em>Guerrilla Games is in an interesting place because they're working on this Horizon Online game that I'm not sure how many people want that, and so they've got this remaster coming and then the LEGO&nbsp;game coming. Part of me feels like, I wonder what happens if neither of those hit, and it turns out there isn't a ton of interest in Horizon anymore. Are they still gonna be doing the online game? I don't know. There are a lot of questions around their strategy and around that online game that I certainly have.</em></p>
<p><em>Horizon Online is their next project, not whatever the third single player game looks like, so that one might be a ways off. Sony's PlayStation's live service initiative was no joke. Everybody was like, it's live service games all around, and Horizon is one of the few that hasn't been canceled or hasn't come out and flopped the way Concord did. So yeah, a lot of questions there, but a lot of people are working on that online project.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, as Schreier pointed out, following the cancellations of games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us Online</a> and the urban fantasy game that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now-defunct London studio</a> was working on, not to mention <span>Concord's complete&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debacle</a>, Horizon Online is one of a few PlayStation live service projects still running. As such, it's not surprising that Sony is fast-tracking it compared to the third installment in the single-player</span>&nbsp;series.</p>
<p>However, it will indeed be a departure from the mainline entries, and not only because of the cooperative multiplayer. Guerrilla Games has already confirmed it will feature a new cast of characters and a 'stylized look' that didn't exactly inspire a lot of confidence in some early <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-multiplayer-early-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaks.</a></p>
<p>Is Sony making the wrong move by prioritizing this project? Let us know your opinion below.</p>

A new campaign began today, September 29, bringing back the character The Replacer, played by Peter Stormare. For anyone just catching up, the conceit of the ads is that The Replacer is the person sent in to replace the person who took a day off their job to play Call of Duty instead.</p><p>Stormare's The Replacer debuted in 2013 and has been a mainstay for Activision's Black Ops marketing campaigns over the years. The first in a series of commercials for Black Ops 6 featuring The Replacer went live today during Sunday's NFL game lineup.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 The Replacer Live Action Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is just the first of many commercials on the way, as Activision said it has put together almost 30 videos that will roll out now until the game releases. Activision teased that "some notable names" will be replaced during this latest ad campaign, but didn't offer any other specifics.</p><p dir="ltr">The new spot is pretty absurd, as The Replacer subs in for a firefighter saving a cat from a tree, a rideshare driver, and even a father at family dinner (along with a spicy conversation with the mom). Even the Pope plays Call of Duty, it seems, as The Replacer takes over his job as well for a day.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and unlike past years, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-have-campaign-early-access-activision-confirms/1100-6526378/" data-ref-id="1100-6526378">no early access to the campaign.</a> In another big change, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass at launch, but only for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-not-a-day-one-game-pass-release-for-the-new-tier/1100-6524833/" data-ref-id="1100-6524833">most expensive tiers of the service.</a></p>

		<p>Over twenty minutes of footage from Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been released from the Tokyo Game Show and it is, as you might expect, banana crackers.&nbsp; We get to meet Shioli Kutsuna’s Rainy and Elle Fanning’s Tomorrow, and they sing a nice duet while Normal Reedus’ Sam looks on with his sentient puppet pal swinging from his belt, who then joins in the song – and that’s just the first ninety seconds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death Stranding 2 NEW Trailer 4K (2025) PS5 Pro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aRvuCmbrjAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The footage then continues with the return of a familiar face and location,&nbsp; some casual tear collection and emoticons. We then skip to on board DHV Megellan and get explanation for why everyone is in shades of grey, plus another new character, Tarman, voiced by legendary director George Miller, and his pet devil tar cat.&nbsp; Lea Seydoux’s Fragile is also present,&nbsp; being as French as possible smoking a cigarette, and then the puppet is introduced (so the clips are clearly out of order) as Dollman, voiced by another director, Fatih Akin.</p>
<p>Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow then pose for a photoshoot with cuddly toy versions of the white grubs that were introduced as food in the first film.&nbsp; They then model some nice jackets and have dance on some of the vehicles from the game.</p>
<p>We’re still only seven minutes in and frankly if Bea Arthur turned up dressed as a ferret I wouldn’t bat an eyelid.</p>

<p>The video then continues with the footage from the trailer that was released in January before what appears to be a new trailer with Baby Lou (at a guess) and some sort of religious ceremony before skipping back to Fragile carrying Lou away from some sort of danger.&nbsp; Next is a shot of the DHV Megellan before we are told that a private company, APAC, is funding the project.</p>
<p>If that all seemed vaguely sensible the final shot is Baby Lou’s pod with octopus tentacles in it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/death-stranding-2-has-been-revealed-watch-the-trailer-here/">First confirmed back in 2022</a>, this sequel has now been fully titled as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach but the trailer does, thankfully, give it the snappier name of DS2.</p>
