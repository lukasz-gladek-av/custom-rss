            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prime Video and Crystal Dynamics have announced a&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>live-action series, and a very well-respected writer is on board to both write and executive produce the project.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>website, the series will boast the involvement of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose work you might recognize from TV shows like&nbsp;<em>Fleabag&nbsp;</em>and movies like&nbsp;<em>No Time to Die</em>.</p>
<p>The series will premiere exclusively on Prime Video, although we don't have an air date or even a tentative cast list for it yet, so it might be a while before we hear anything more about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-shadow-lara-totem.jpg?itok=mYvYUrwi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-shadow-lara-totem.jpg?itok=f2ULHbzE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A TV series based on&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Waller-Bridge says&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is "a huge part of [her] life", and that if she could tell her teenage self she was working on a live-action&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series, she'd "explode".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether Waller-Bridge intends to hew closer to the darker, more realistic tone of Crystal Dynamics' reboot series or to the more swashbuckling and humorous tone struck by the original games (recently revived thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">Aspyr-led remasters</a>).</p>
<p>Given Phoebe Waller-Bridge's comments about her "teenage self", though, as well as her promise to make a "bats 'n all" series, it sounds like we might be moving slightly away from the tone of the 2013 reboot and the Alicia Vikander-starring 2018 movie.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all just speculation; no cast or story setup has been revealed yet, so we'll have to wait a while before we learn exactly what kind of Lara we're getting in this series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-i-iii-remastered.jpg?itok=sQC3xLua 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-live-action-series-i-iii-remastered.jpg?itok=QAf55AZA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will Phoebe Waller-Bridge's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series be closer to the originals or the newer games in tone?</figcaption></figure><p>The new series is part of an effort to "develop additional&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>stories in streaming and film", according to the announcement, but don't worry; games aren't being left behind.</p>
<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-to-develop-and-globally-publish-tomb-raider-game">is in the works at Crystal Dynamics</a>, with Amazon providing "full support" as well as publishing the game around the world.</p>
<p>In the announcement for the new series, Amazon reiterates that the game is still in development, describing it as a "single-player, narrative-driven action-adventure" and the "next chapter to Lara Croft's legendary explorations".</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more news on that, as well as the live-action series and all other things&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>.</p>

It’s like Nintendo Switch Online except it’s on your smartphone and free. All you need are the original physical versions of the games themselves and a tool to dump the ROMs from them onto your device. And it’s all approved by Apple.</p><h2 id="h2275"><a id=""></a>A killer iPhone app 10-years in the making</h2><p>Testut and his colleague, Shane Gill, point out that emulation has always been a part of Apple’s history. Steve Jobs pitched the ability to emulate PS1 hit <em>Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/03/remember-when-steve-jobs-promoted-ps1-emulation-on-national-tv#:~:text=Gant's%20video%20shines%20a%20light,wtf).&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/03/remember-when-steve-jobs-promoted-ps1-emulation-on-national-tv#:~:text=Gant's%20video%20shines%20a%20light,wtf)." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a selling point of the Mac back in 1999</a></span>. Sony eventually took the makers of the emulator to court, leading to the legal codification of certain protections for emulation, before the PlayStation maker later bought the company outright and dismantled it.</p><p>The duo, who met years back at a <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> meetup, had been working last month to launch the AltStore in Europe, a rival storefront for sideloading apps onto iOS that had previously only been available on Windows and MacOS. Traditionally a walled-garden, new regulations by the European Union are blowing Apples’ grip on the iPhone ecosystem wide open, and the gaming emulator Delta was going to be a focal point on the AltStore. Then, in a surprise twist, Apple decided to uproot its longtime ban on emulators in the App Store just in time for Delta’s launch.</p><figure id="" data-id="3fdca3ae5bf47b414f51ab46113df588" data-recommend-id="image://3fdca3ae5bf47b414f51ab46113df588" data-format="jpg" data-width="910" data-height="512" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Screenshots show the Delta layout on iPhone.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“They never reached out to us to talk about any of this,” Testut said. He and Gill have taken some credit for the historic rules change and attributed it to increased competition in Europe from things like the AltStore. “I think we’re gonna see a lot of this stuff where there’s a cool new type of app that exists only in Europe, and then Apple will change the rules to allow it in the App Store.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate the significance of the overnight revolution in retro gaming on iPhones in the U.S. Delta, which is open source and funded via Patreon subscribers who get early access to new features, became the top app, dethroned only weeks later after Krispy Kreme promised users free donuts. Testut and Gill said they were getting millions of downloads, their community blowing up with new users, and players were making memes on TikTok and swapping their favorite gaming memories.</p><h2 id="h2276"><a id=""></a>Moving from Napster to iTunes for ROMs</h2><p>People have been emulating games on PC and smartphones forever, but Testut and Gill see Apple’s embrace of Delta and other emulators as a potential watershed moment, one that could make it go mainstream and upend the current broken marketplace for retro gaming. Everyone who played <em>Animal Crossing</em> on the GameCube remembers the first time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/someone-discovered-a-hidden-feature-in-animal-crossings-1827591135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/someone-discovered-a-hidden-feature-in-animal-crossings-1827591135">they booted up<em> Super Mario Bros.</em> on a virtual NES inside their virtual house</a></span>. Five years later, the shop channel on the Wii allowed players to download other classics from Nintendo’s back catalog. Ever since, console manufacturers have kept tight control over how digital copies of their old games were sold and distributed, making them exclusive to their own hardware platforms.</p><p>“No one’s created the market for ROMs and that’s why we say this is just the Napster moment,” Gill said, citing the briefly ascendant file sharing app that completely changed the music industry. “We’re here with the player, somebody just needs to now make the iTunes store and just be like, ‘Hey, it’s 99 cents to get like every game you’ve ever had in your life.’”</p><figure id="" data-id="183cd9851026873323b37b68196f9a84" data-recommend-id="image://183cd9851026873323b37b68196f9a84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1092" data-height="770" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a Delta user playing with AirPlay on a TV.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Except that we know at least some companies would want to charge much more. While Nintendo hasn’t ported its retro library to smartphones, a publisher like Square Enix has. On iPhone you can buy <em>Secret of Mana </em>for $8, <em>Chrono Trigger</em> for $10, and <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> for $18, each with varying levels of upgraded features and graphics. Testut and Gill think a more reasonable ceiling might be $5 for SNES games and $10 for Nintendo 64 games (that’s how much <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> was on the Wii U eShop).<br></p><p>“We’re in just this weird phase right now,” Testut said. “It’s kind of like the pre-iTunes era [where] having these games is legal, just no one’s taking it upon themselves to make a storefront that people can just buy ROMs from and then play on anything. The moment one company does that, just sells their old games, then all of a sudden the question goes away and it’s like, ‘Oh, you can just sell old games and you can just play them on things that can play games, what a concept, just like other forms of media.’”</p><p>It’s unclear if game publishers will ever agree. Calling this the “Napster moment” implies that companies may not have a choice. It’s not clear how Nintendo itself will react. The<em> Mario</em> maker currently charges players a monthly subscription to access old games on Switch, and has been on the offensive more than ever against emulators and ROM sharing sites in recent years.</p><h2 id="h2277"><a id=""></a>Will Nintendo come after Delta too?</h2><p>Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-orders-rom-site-to-destroy-all-its-games-or-1847487357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-orders-rom-site-to-destroy-all-its-games-or-1847487357">won a lawsuit against RomUniverse in 2021</a></span> and the site was ordered to pay $2.1 million and destroy all of its games. Earlier this year, the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-settled-1851306441&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-settled-1851306441">reached a settlement with Switch emulator Yuzu</a></span> in which the group agreed to hand over all code related to the app and pay $2.4 million. Gary Bowser, a man convicted for his association with a hacking group that enabled piracy on the 3DS, was sent to prison and will be paying off fines and legal fees <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gary-bowser-hacking-case-legal-jail-xecuter-1850346297">for the rest of his life</a></span>.</p><p>Testut said they haven’t heard from Nintendo at all and that in his years of working on emulation he knows what to avoid. He blames Yuzu getting targeted in part on the group’s promoting a paid Patreon, where users could access a version needed to play <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> early when it leaked prior to release. “Just don’t promote piracy and just really say, ‘Hey, this is a tool that can be used to play games you have.’”</p><figure id="" data-id="1ce4ffbea32712846ff35f7969f922f8" data-recommend-id="image://1ce4ffbea32712846ff35f7969f922f8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A GIF shows Delta for DS in action.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Delta for them is a celebration of gaming from their childhoods. For Testut that’s playing <em>Super Mario Bros. 1</em> and <em>3</em> with his dad. For Gill it’s playing<em> Super Mario 64</em> and <em>Super Mario Tennis </em>with his cousins. Having traded in lots of games to GameStop over the years like so many of us, he’s been building back up his retro collection beginning with SNES games, and was lucky to snag things like <em>Chrono Trigger</em> for just $50-60 prior to the explosion in vintage game prices. The beloved Square Enix RPG now goes for over $200 for the cartridge alone.<br></p><p>While <em>Chrono Trigger</em> is available on modern platforms, lots of lesser-known retro games aren’t. Testut and Gill said preservation is a big part of why they hope emulation on the iPhone takes off. “There’s all these old games that just get lost to time because no one’s bothered to find a way to bring them up to date,” Gill said. “They’re just in deep IP disputes and who even owns the rights to this game from the early ‘90s and stuff. There’s all these little things that should exist and be held on to because people worked really hard on them, and then they just kind of get lost to time. I’m sure if I was working on those games, I would want to see them still be played if people wanted to play them.”</p><p>DS games are the perfect case study. Reliant on dual screen displays and touch screen mechanics, only a handful have been ported to the Switch. Smartphones offer the ideal substitute, with tablets like the iPad offering an even better experience thanks to the extra screen real estate. Testut recently finished <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C59K1SlOeKD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.threads.net/@rileytestut/post/C59K1SlOeKD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all of <em>Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</em></a></span> on his Apple TV using AirPlay to stream it from his phone to make it feel like he was playing on the Wii U. The pair are working on reducing latency and adding other features as well, like remote peer-to-peer multiplayer.</p><h2 id="h2278"><a id=""></a>Retro gaming without DRM</h2><p>Where will it end? Testut said that although Apple doesn’t define what it means by “retro” in its new rules on emulators, additional programs needed to run more advanced games like from the PS2 era remain banned. Thus, while<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-a-ps1-emulator-rising-up-the-iphone-app-store-charts&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-a-ps1-emulator-rising-up-the-iphone-app-store-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a PS1 emulator was added to the store just this week</a></span>, it’s unlikely retro gaming enthusiasts on the platform will be able to move to <em>Grand Theft Auto 3 </em>or <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> anytime soon. Maybe in five years Apple’s definitions of retro will broaden to include them as well.</p><p>The barriers to a full-blown ROM marketplace remain more challenging. That idea of selling files that are easily copied and given-away has historically led to draconian Digital Rights Management (DRM). Recently, game preservation proponents like former PlayStation executive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/ex-sony-boss-shawn-layden-advises-readygg-as-it-raises-4m-for-web3-gaming/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/ex-sony-boss-shawn-layden-advises-readygg-as-it-raises-4m-for-web3-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shawn Layden have suggested</a></span> blockchain technology could be used to streamline those requirements. Testut disagrees.</p><p>“I really think that the actual solution here is a DRM-free thing to say, ‘Hey, this is just an mp3 file, it’s just a JPEG, it’s just a bigger file that you can consume,’” he said, physically recoiling when I mention crypto currency and distributed ledgers. “And then maybe beyond that, we could figure something else out, but we’ve got to start there or else we’re just gonna lock it down before it’s ever real I think.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new Tomb Raider live-action show <a href="https://www.tombraider.com/news/movies-and-tv/prime-video-orders-tomb-raider-live-action-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is coming to Amazon Prime Video</a>. The news comes 15 months after it was reported that Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-franchise-rights-allegedly-bought-by-amazon-for-600-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had purchased the rights to the IP</a> for $600 million.</p>



<p>The new series will see Phoebe Waller-Bridge of Fleabag write and executive produce. Crystal Dynamics and Jenny Robbins will also executive produce the show. </p>



<p>“If I could tell my teenage self that this was happening, I think she’d explode,” Waller-Bridge said.&nbsp;<em>“</em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. Lara means a lot to me, as she does to many, and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all.”</p>



<p>“I’m so happy to announce that we have ordered the epic, globetrotting series&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>&nbsp;from the incredibly gifted Emmy-award winner Phoebe Waller-Bridge and the team at Crystal Dynamics,” Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, said. “Fans and newcomers can look forward to exhilarating adventures that honor the legacy of this iconic character.”</p>



<p>There currently is no time table for the series’ debut. When it releases, however, it will premiere exclusively on Prime Video. It’s also part of Amazon MGM Studios and dj2’s first-look deal that will bring more Tomb Raider stories to both film and streaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tim Bender, co-founder of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> publisher Hooded Horse, claims that publishers across the industry should eliminate recoup terms and clauses to ensure developers are getting a fairer deal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During a wide-ranging interview with Game Developer (more on that soon), we asked Bender what developers should be wary of when negotiating publishing deals. He claims one of the biggest red flags you can encounter is the presence of recoup clauses that deny "critical cash flow" post-launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although he understands why recoup terms are still commonplace–he claims the idea of using them has simply become "ingrained" in the industry–he believes publishers should seriously reconsider leveraging terms that place developers at risk.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we went by what I thought was fair, it would eliminate too many good publishers. Because I believe, fundamentally, that one horrible thing that exists within the industry is the use of recoup terms in contracts between publishers and developers," he says. "These are just any term that allows the publisher to recover the vast majority, or all, of the sales before the developer gets anything."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender, who previously worked as a lawyer, claims recoup terms make "no sense" because one of the fundamental principles of sensible contracts lies in allocating risk to the party best placed to shoulder that risk. "That's an efficient contract," he says. "And publishers can bear the risk of individual projects succeeding or failing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"They have many of those projects. It's not a big deal. It's not like every project has to be a financial success for the publisher. But developers have one or maybe a couple of projects. They can't easily bear that risk. So, just from a matter of contract theory, it's fundamentally stupid to have recoup terms where publishers protect all of their downside risks and recover all the money first."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Manor Lords publisher says recoup terms harm both developers and players">Manor Lords publisher says recoup terms harm both developers and players</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explains recoup terms can make it difficult for developers to find their footing and stabilize once their project hits shelves by blocking cash flows. Post-launch, teams will need funds to retain workers and ensure they can continue supporting their project, but Bender says recoup terms can make that difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's why he feels they're also terrible for players, because they remove the ability (and incentive) for developers to support their projects. "How many wonderful game projects that could have still done well after release were buried under a recoup term that wouldn't go away? The developer has to make choices. They've got to take care of their staff, so they can't [do that] if there's no money coming in because of some giant recoup," continues Bender.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He acknowledges that recoup terms don't inherently make a publisher bad. "Even good publishers have them in their contracts," he says. "[But] this is a silly way to do business." He feels a clean revenue split is a better solution and says that's essentially the standard at Hooded Horse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our standard terms [...] where we're just doing the marketing and distribution and all of that, we have a very simple ask: 35 percent for us and 65 percent for the developer. There's no recoup or anything else. It's that split. It never changes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would challenge [other publishers] to go through and actually analyse the alternative hypotheticals and ask whether instead of having recoup terms, which are really damaging, they can think of two things as alternatives. Suppose there's a publisher that says 'okay, I want 100 percent recoup on my costs and then I want to get 30 percent long-term' [compared to] another another publisher that just says 'I just want 35 percent any no recoup.' That is a much better relationship for the developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If from a publisher's perspective, you then analyse your entire portfolio and say 'okay, let me go back for years and pretend I never did recoup terms, but instead asked for a tiny increase on that long-term rate. Let me see how I would have done.' I bet most of them would discover they would have been better off financially."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

He'd been describing the ins and outs of the game's "quirk" system, which ascribes a number of "if-then" traits to the player's car. For instance if the player turns the steering wheel, then the headlights will dim, for instance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those quirks, and many other traits, were applied to what he referred to as the car's "soul."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I cut him off. "On your car's...what? Sorry?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The soul," he replied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was a pause. A nervous laughter came from the audience. "We're coming back to that," I swore.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This exchange came from a Q&amp;A hosted by the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev/">Boston GameDev</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> meetup at MIT—I'd been asked by the organizers to host the event and quiz Rosen about the design and production process of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Rosen, free from the shackles of marketing the game (and coming off a cross-country road trip filled with plenty of spooky anomalies of his own) was game to crack open the game's hood and explain the nitty-gritty details of Ironwood Studios' driving survival game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The car's "soul" is just one of many little systems that show how Rosen—a veteran of simulation games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don't Starve </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—helped his colleagues cobble together to make the driving survival game sing. As he explained how the game systems evolved, it was fascinating to hear how so much of what makes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> special and unique wasn't all that different from any other game, but by applying familiar systems to creative director Alex Dracott's vision of a spooky driving game in the Olympic Peninsula, the team was able to make a driving game unlike any other on the market.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-exceptionally-cool-ways-pacific-drive-used-randomized-terrain-to-shape-player-goals" target="_self">Randomizing terrain with Houdini to shape player goals in Pacific Drive</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From car souls to health bars and hands-on maintenance mechanics, Rosen had a lot to say about why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> just "works." Here are lessons from the experience that can help make your game stand out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Giving a car a soul helps track all the variables that can impact it">Giving a car a soul helps track all the variables that can impact it</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, let's dig into that "soul."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s code there lays an Unreal blueprint called "IA_Internal_Soul" that tracks the aforementioned quirks and all of the car's stats. "It's the central repository for all things 'car'" he said. By storing information like how far the car has travelled, the game can calculate wear and tear on car parts and generate obstacles the player is (or maybe isn't) ready to face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a useful method for calculating where "friction" needs to be applied in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experience. Rosen is very particular about "friction" in design—he has strong opinions about survival games (which he described as generally being 'time management' games), and how friction in the player experience that slows them down and makes them fiddle with a game mechanic can be a core part of making sure the game is fun.</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trick with applying this common concept in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that the friction is often applied where players wouldn't expect to find it in similar kinds of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A good example of this is in the car's customization system—the very first design feature Rosen tackled when he joined the team. When he was asked to consult on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, customizing the player's car took place in a menu. It allowed players to quickly swap and repair parts in a quick and efficient manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Rosen's gut instinct was that this system was too quick, and too efficient. Making the player a "Zone mechanic" (i.e a mechanic who has to master the weird physics of the "Zone") was a core pillar of the game design, and swapping car parts in a menu was easy, but not necessarily fun.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He pressed the team to switch to a customization and repair loop that involved walking around the car, making parts at a work bench, and physically repairing it with tools. The process is slower, but it helps drive player investment in the car and nudges the player into thinking like a real-world mechanic. If you've played the game and wandered around the garage thinking "alright, the car needs this, where did I leave that part..." then you've felt the impact of Rosen's choice of friction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Rosen didn't see the game as just being about making easy tasks hard. Though the quirk system is meant to let every part of the car's functions interact with each other—steering, parking brakes, headlights, radio, etc.—combinations that get in the way of core gameplay are downplayed or even shut off altogether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, if the player takes the car out of park, it shouldn't go back into park. "It's a driving game, you have to be able to drive," he quipped.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Avoiding the 'plateau of stability'">Avoiding the 'plateau of stability'</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "survival" part of "driving survival" game is actually creates a surprising clash in Rosen's design sensibilities. To put it bluntly, Rosen hates survival games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okay "hates" might be a strong word—he doesn't find them to be evil or anything—but he doesn't enjoy playing most of them. To him survival games operate on a spectrum running from "treehugger" to "tree-puncher" spectrum.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A 'tree-puncher' game is a game where your entire relationship to the world is extractive," he said, an echo of many critiques of games that reinforce a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gamelab.mit.edu/research/games-and-colonialism/">colonialist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" ideology with how players interact with the world. "Treehugger games" are games where the environment has its own ecology and the player isn't at the center of it. "So much of those experiences are about [the player] figuring out how they fit into that ecology, seeing something new and poking it with a stick...to see what happens," he said. "I find that those experiences are so much more interesting."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A fascinating late twist in development that sealed the deal on the "treehugger" design philosophy had to do with item damage. With only a few months until the game had to ship, Rosen became suddenly convinced that one new mechanic would make the game sing: health bars.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Originally, when players wanted to harvest an item, they would select the tool, navigate to the resource, an animation would play, and the resource would break apart, leaving harvestable items behind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Something tugged at Rosen's instincts, and he decided to test out a new idea: giving all items in the game health bars that could be chipped away at using tools or damage from the environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It opened up all of these cool interactions," he said. If players are in dire straits and missing a key tool to harvest resources, they can use other sources of damage dealing to get what they need. If they don't have the buzzsaw-like "scrapper" item used to cut through metal, they can just ram a car into another car instead.</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a harvesting mechanic, which may feel overly extractive at first glance, but it also creates more in-world interactions that exist without the player. If a stray explosion from a Tourist (creepy exploding mannequins that move when the player isn't looking) blows up a resource in the environment, players can find useful items in the debris.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Tree puncher" games also regularly bring players to what Rosen called "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24099909/open-world-survival-crafting-games-2024">the plateau of stability.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" It's a state of gameplay where the threats that first pressured a player to gather resources and craft items aren't threats anymore. There may be some gameplay to pursue after that—using the game's tools to build a massive settlement or monument of some type—but without that tension, he feels that such games become far less interesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outer Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a game that fits the "treehugger" archetype, and he was surprised to see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> compared to it in the media coverage around the game. "In hindsight, it makes a lot of sense. It's that same sort of discovery process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game designers chasing market trends right now have every reason to chase that "tree puncher" trend. Players want to gather resources and build big bases.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But when you follow Rosen and Ironwood Studios down the path of the treehugger, you might make a game where the player hauls ass in a station wagon through the woods, running from a weird floating orb that wants to steal their bumper.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p data-characters="339" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While the majority of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-update-7-reduces-file-size-by-25gb-while-adding-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s post-launch content updates</a> have included flashy new tracks and such, Update 8 foregoes anything of the sort. Instead, it’s quality-of-life o’clock, and Turn 10 aims to deliver. Included are an improved racing AI, vinyl editing boons, a revision of safety ratings, and heaps more.</p> <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">As usual, <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s Update 8 comes alongside a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new seasonal content revision</a>, this time focusing on vehicles that walk the knife’s edge between being a full-blooded track monster and a production-tier road car. One of the most exciting new cars on the roster is the legendary Ginetta G40 Junior, to illustrate what you ought to be expecting. Oh, and lest we forget: Mobil 1 is celebrating its 50th anniversary by partnering up with <em>Forza Motorsport</em> for a series of themed Rivals events and more.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-forza-motorsport-update-8-is-loaded-with-quality-of-life-goodies" data-injectable="false">Forza Motorsport Update 8 is loaded with quality-of-life goodies</h2> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-promises-massive-improvements-2024-key-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As promised early in 2024</a>, Turn 10 has slowly but certainly been iterating upon the core gameplay loop of <em>Forza Motorsport</em> with each new update. While Update 8, specifically, isn’t as transformative of an upgrade as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsports-car-progression-rework-is-now-out-and-its-a-huge-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 6, which totally reworked the game’s caRPG systems</a>, it is quite massive when it comes to quality-of-life improvements and the general quality of gameplay.</p>
 <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="126" data-injectable="false">Notably, here’s just a short list of some key improvements that have made their way into <em>Forza Motorsport</em> with Update 8:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false"> <li>Vinyl Material Tool has been added to the livery editor, allowing you to define how matte or glossy your vinyl design will be.</li> <li>Tire Wear Scale option for private multiplayer and free-play modes.</li> <li>Featured Multiplayer modes’ Safety Ratings have been revised, increasing the number of races taken into account from 10 to 20; also improved the matchmaking algorithm to search for a narrower range of Safety Ratings in the player pool</li> <li>Several vehicle racing category revisions, with plenty more to come (such as a recategorization of Forza GT vehicles into dedicated spec divisions, slated for Summer)</li> <li>Improved the Drivatar AI’s propensity for unnecessary braking in situations of attempted passovers, wide turns, corner apex encounters, and straight racing scenarios.</li> <li>Introduced the Mobil 1 partnership with an appropriate Maple Valley race track update.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">For a more comprehensive list, be sure to check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2440510/view/4191239670803852876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turn 10’s Steam blog post</a>, but that should give you an idea of what to expect. The Mobil 1 partnership is interesting, too, though the value of this partnership will hinge mainly on the upcoming Rival events, which Turn 10 is yet to explain in greater detail.</p>
 <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">As for the new vehicles and events, here’s the full list of Featured Tour events running through late June:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"> <li>May 15 – June 26: Ginetta Juniors (Spotlight: Ginetta G40 Junior)</li> <li>May 22 – June 26: Weekend Warriors (Spotlight: 2015 Porsche Cayman GTS)</li> <li>May 29 – June 26: Kit Caterhams (Spotlight: Caterham Superlight R500)</li> <li>June 5 – June 26: Track Toys (Spotlight: Elemental RP1)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">Completing all four of these series will not only allow you to nab their respective Spotlight cars at a low price, but also the delightful 2019 Porsche Motorsport 935 #70. As for the latest Open Class Tour refresh, the final reward there is the BMW M1 Coupe from 2011. Not a bad offering, but a fair bit less exciting than the 935.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">While all of the fixes, tweaks, and improvements outlined above are already available in <em>Forza Motorsport</em> as of May 13, the seasonal batch of Update 8 content won’t be going live until May 15. From that point onwards, you’ve got about a month’s worth of time to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-two-types-of-fomo-present-in-forza-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlock all of the FOMO-bound rewards</a> until Update 9 comes out, such as the aforementioned Motorsport 935. </p>

<p data-characters="332" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that it’s officially become <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the fastest-selling PlayStation game <em>ever</em></a>, it should come as no surprise that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is bound to stay in the limelight for a good long while. Yet, the game has been going through a rough patch lately, and one developer stands out as someone keeping those conversations helpful and honest.</p> <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">Specifically, one of the Arrowhead Games’ community managers, Thomas Petersson (aka Twinbeard), has responded to a number of community questions over on the official Discord. In the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community, Petersson is widely praised and often brought up as the golden standard for communication, which has been a stellar source of goodwill for Arrowhead. Judging by Petersson’s responses, his popularity is bound to grow further still, and his methods have sparked a new round of productive conversation and criticism over on the <em>Helldivers </em>subreddit.<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-things-might-be-looking-up-for-helldivers-2-s-item-and-weapon-balance" data-injectable="false">Things might be looking up for Helldivers 2’s item and weapon balance</h2> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">Redditor povbear20 assembled a comprehensive list of Thomas Petersson’s comments and responses on Discord, rounding up everything that’s been said for Reddit. Overall, the vibe is quite positive, and folks seem to really appreciate Petersson in particular, which is good to see. </p>
 <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">The community manager has touched on a lot of community concerns, so to recap for everyone, some of those Helldivers 2 Discord conversations include topics like: </p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Helldivers 2</em> Warbond cadence being internally discussed</li> <li>The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-mock-the-games-fragile-mechs-and-manufacturer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">papier-mache mechs</a> being review</li> <li>A <em>Helldivers 2</em> test server is a possibility</li> <li>Arrowhead <em>might</em> be aware of punishing enemy spawn rates for smaller squads and solo operatives</li> <li>More player polls are coming</li> <li>Arrowhead wants to improve game balance at large, allowing each weapon to shine in a niche</li> <li>Many Arrowhead developers effectively “lost” a week to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-design-may-be-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PlayStation Network issues</a>, and had to leave in-game considerations aside to resolve it.</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">This shortlist is very truncated, of course, and I recommend reading up on Petersson’s responses properly, as posted by povbear20, if at all possible. Broadly, though, the information on offer here is well-thought-out and meaningful, and if Arrowhead manages to get back its mojo, the game should be back on track to greatness in relatively short order.</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">The idea that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-helldivers-2-pushing-forward-far-too-quickly-for-its-own-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is having trouble keeping up with its own success</a> isn’t new, of course. The fact that Premium Warbonds are coming out on a monthly basis, in particular, hasn’t sat well with the community due to the state of the new weapon releases and some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-eruptor-nerf-was-deliberate-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questionable approaches to item balancing</a>, and some feel that Arrowhead should slow things down until they get everything sorted out in full.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="false">It’s going to be interesting to see what comes of <em>Helldivers 2</em> next. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-admits-helldivers-2s-balancing-isnt-what-it-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even the Arrowhead CEO feels that the game’s balancing has gone off the deep end</a> over the last couple of weeks, which should suggest some big changes in the near future. With no firm confirmation as to whether that’ll happen or not, though, Helldivers can only wait and see what Super-Earth has in store for them next.</p>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During today’s 8th Anniversary livestream for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em>, developer Behaviour Interactive announced and released <em>What the Fog</em>, a co-op spin-off shooter. The best part is that for a limited time, you can get the game for free on PC. </p> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>‘s developer has created and released <em>What the Fog</em> for free to anyone with a Behaviour Interactive account. The game is a silly title set in the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> universe and sees players enter a cursed board game. Once inside, you’ve got to fight your way through each level, collecting Bloodpoints and repairing generators in order to progress to the next level and escape. </p>
 <h2 id="h-you-can-get-what-the-fog-for-free-right-now-and-enjoy-yet-another-side-of-the-dead-by-daylight-universe" data-injectable="false">You can get <em>What the Fog</em> for free right now and enjoy yet another side of the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> universe</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true"><em>What the Fog</em> is free on PC for a limited time to anyone with a Behaviour Interactive account. Don’t worry if you haven’t signed up already. You can <a href="https://account.bhvr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register for an account today</a>, get the game, and start playing it on Steam. The registration process is incredibly simple and will help you in the future if you ever want to claim Amazon Prime Gaming goodies for<em> Dead by Daylight</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">While <em>What the Fog</em> is free right now, it won’t be forever. The game is a free gift to fans who have supported Behaviour Interactive over the last eight years, so it wanted to give the game to them in the most direct way it could. After this initial period of free availability, the game will cost $4.99/£4.99 on Steam. </p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">Behaviour Interactive gave the press a preview of <em>What the Fog</em> last week, and it looks like a lot of fun, especially for those who hate the horror of<em> Dead by Daylight</em>. It’s fun and lighthearted, with adorable visuals and an enjoyable roguelike gameplay loop that’s built for quick sessions between friends. </p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">The focus of this game really is on playing with someone else. You can help each other complete tasks and defeat enemies, but there’s also a dedicated support mode to ensure you’re never left on the sidelines, even after death. </p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="false">Behaviour Interactive told the press that <em>What the Fog</em> is a complete package, similar to how <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hooked-on-you-dead-by-daylight-dating-sim-summer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hooked on You</a></em> was at launch. There are currently no plans for post-launch support. However, the developer did state that if there’s a huge demand for more content in the game, it can’t be ignored and may need to be addressed. This includes bringing the game to consoles because, right now, the plan is for it to be PC-exclusive. </p>

<p data-characters="238" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re getting ever closer to Steam’s big <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-steam-summer-sale-2024-begin/">Summer Sale 2024</a>. We’re still a few weeks away, admittedly, but there are a couple more events until then to keep us in the mood, and one of them is ongoing for the next few days.</p> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">Yesterday, Steam kicked off its Endless Replayability Fest, a sales event that celebrates those games that just seem to go on forever. But, you know, in a good way. Essentially, if it’s something you can play over and over again without A) getting bored, or B) having the exact same experience as the first time, then it’s probably here.</p> <figure data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Steam Endless Replayability Fest 2024: Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raIxJEFtgrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">We’ve got discounts on a bunch of games, with a few being teased in the above trailer, such as <em>Don’t Starve</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Mortal Sin</em>, and <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>. As always with these events, it goes on for a week, so this one will be ending Monday, May 20 at 10am PT.</p> <h2 id="h-endless-fun-wait-did-i-say-that-already" data-injectable="false">Endless fun (wait…did I say that already?)</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">You can see everything that’s in the Endless Replayability Fest by visiting the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/endlessly_replayable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>. I’m seeing a few titles already that have grabbed my attention, including <em>Stellaris</em>, which recently experienced a boon in popularity thanks to its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stellaris-rockets-up-the-steam-charts-as-the-machine-age-dlc-launches/"><em>Machine Age</em> DLC</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">There’s also <em>Balatro</em>, LocalThunk’s “poker roguelike” that hit the scene back in February, and has been enjoying a decent amount of success these past few months. It’s currently at “Overwhelmingly Positive” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, so it must be doing something right.</p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">There are also a couple of newer games that have been listed, including <em>Hades 2</em> and <em>Manor Lords</em>, but these aren’t discounted. They’ve just been included as part of the event. Personally, I’ve got my eye on <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>, which is 20% off at the moment. Always fancied getting lost in this simulation, because I’ve got nothing else going on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexon-q1-2024-finals-underperforms<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nexon has released its financial report for the first quarter of 2024 (since the studio operates on a January to January basis in fiscal year terms), and apparently,&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>isn't performing as hoped.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/RLCz/ukdB/n3z8.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earnings letter</a>, Nexon reports a drop in revenue of around 13% when compared to the first quarter of last year, as well as a precipitous fall in operating income of around 48%.</p>
<p>The studio puts that deficiency down to "lower consumer spending, rising costs, and an anticipated one-time loss", although it does say that its revenue and income were "stronger than expected".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-mobile-nexon-q1-2024-financials.jpg?itok=LVzPtNou 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-mobile-nexon-q1-2024-financials.jpg?itok=8BBV-aTP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC Mobile&nbsp;</em>has been successful for Nexon.</figcaption></figure><p>This performance, Nexon says, is down to the success of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC Online</em>, which is available across several Asian markets, as well as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC Mobile</em>, a free-to-play version of EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-24-achieves-145-million-active-accounts-drives-strong-financial-results">wildly successful</a> soccer game.</p>
<p>Nexon also points to the strong performance of gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Archive</em>&nbsp;as a reason for its financial results exceeding expectations in 2024's first quarter.</p>
<p>Together, these three titles make up for what Nexon calls the "lower-than-expected performance of&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em>". According to Nexon, the game's second season, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/finals-season-2">launched in March</a>, temporarily boosted player numbers, but "delivered lower-than-expected retention and revenue".</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em>' underwhelming performance, Nexon says it still expects the game to help drive a revenue increase on a year-over-year basis in 2024's second quarter, at least in North America and Europe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-finals-nexon-q1-2024-gun.jpg?itok=qerW-tIy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-finals-nexon-q1-2024-gun.jpg?itok=6yH2VFkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>hasn't turned out like Nexon hoped in Q1 2024.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to Nexon's future, the company says it's releasing major updates for "all of [its] flagship franchises" in the second quarter of 2024, including&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC Online</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, new games like&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>,&nbsp;<em>MapleStory Worlds</em>, and the Chinese release of&nbsp;<em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter Mobile&nbsp;</em>are all scheduled for Q2 or thereabouts, so Nexon will be hoping that those releases can turn its fortunes around.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether these games represent the sea change Nexon appears to need right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>A new Assassin's Creed Valhalla NVIDIA DLSS 3 mod was released online today, bringing massive performance improvements to the latest main entry in the series developed by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The mod was developed by well-known modder PureDark, who is offering the mod via their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PureDark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon page</a>. The video below showcases the modded NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and DLSS 2 upscaling implementation, and they both seem to work extremely well, as does Reflex, so the experience won't suffer from any input delay. Additionally, the mod also implements DeepDVC, which is RTX Dynamic Vibrancy, according to the modder, that can be turned on or off at will.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLSS3 mod and DeepDVC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RhH78PMATI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla launched back in late 2020 on PC and consoles and was followed by multiple expansions that introduced new maps and mechanics. Even without the additional content, the game starring Eivor is a solid open-world RPG that does the setting justice for the most part, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a definite step up for the series, thanks to the many tweaks made to the RPG mechanics that powered the previous two entries in the series, better storytelling, great atmosphere, and meaningful side-content. Even with the tweaks, however, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is still an Assassin's Creed game at heart, so those who are not into the Ubisoft open-world game design will hardly change their opinion with the game. Everyone else will probably love every second of Eivor's adventure, especially if they are into Vikings and ancient Norse culture.</em></p>
<p>The next entry in the series will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pricing-and-season-pass-dlc-plan-have-leaked/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The game set in Feudal Japan will be officially unveiled tomorrow with a new trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155725/inside-out-2-character-design-same-face-female-characters-disney-princess<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wcud5I">When director Kelsey Mann took the helm on Pixar’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems"><em>Inside Out 2</em>,</a> Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter had one big suggestion for him. Before becoming CCO, Docter directed many of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22239548/best-pixar-movies-ranked">studio’s greatest hits</a>, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8733925/inside-out-review">the original<em> Inside Out</em></a><em>.</em> </p>
<p id="9YCa6l">At an early press preview going behind the scenes on <em>Inside Out 2</em>,  Mann told Polygon that the interior world of <em>Inside Out </em>in Riley’s mind was supposed to be more “cartoony” than the realism-grounded outside world. But Mann says Docter told him the final product — 2015’s <em>Inside Out —</em> didn’t quite land the way he wanted. </p>
<p id="AjYlcq">“He said, <em>We thought we were going far with what we could do with the characters inside the mind, in terms of how broadly they moved and were animated</em>,” Mann recounts. “<em>I think we could have gone further. And I kind of regret not dialing that up a little bit. So I highly suggest that you go further.</em> I remember talking to the whole animation department pitching the movie, and saying we wanted to do that. I feel like we’ve done a lot of that on the film — I really tried to push it.”</p>

<p id="6uocju">That’s especially true when it comes to the character design. In the original movie, which centers on an 11-year-old girl and the personifications of emotions in her head, Fear and Anger have distinctly cartoony designs. Their exaggerated shapes are meant to evoke the emotions they represent. But the emotions embodied by female characters don’t capture that same feeling. Joy, Sadness, and Disgust look more generic, and apart from their bright, jewel-toned skin and hair, they could easily pass as human characters in another Disney or Pixar movie. (Joy in particular launched a <a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/113332/the-disturbing-trend-in-almost-every-female-pixar-character-br">significant discussion</a> about the longtime problem of <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a34090/disney-women-same-faces/">Disney Princesses all having the same face</a>, and Pixar following the trend, designing all its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/century-of-disney/23655196/disney-princesses-have-the-same-face-elsa-frozen-cinderella-snow-white">female protagonists with round faces and button noses</a>). </p>
<p id="q937Gv">But from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23953776/inside-out-2-teaser-anxiety-release-date">very first trailer</a>, it was clear that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment"><em>Inside Out 2</em>’s new emotions</a> would be different. The new movie introduces Anxiety, a Muppet-like emotion character with a huge, stretchy mouth and big, wobbly eyes. She’s joined by Ennui, who is represented as a lazy, drooping line, and Envy, a tiny mushroom-like blob of an emotion. And there’s also Embarrassment, a huge, hulking figure who hides his big face beneath a hoodie. Already, these four emotions (three of them female) break that round-face, button-nose mold. </p>

<p id="5Fio59">“That was a conscious decision that we made,” says Mann. He cites production designer Jason Deamer as the one who really brought those character-design discrepancies to his attention. “[Deamer said] <em>Why can’t the female characters have the same kind of design sense? It’s pushed, it’s fun.</em> And we leaned into that.”</p>
<p id="e6XtCy">“This is animation, not live-action!” Deamer told Polygon. “So let’s do what animation [can] do — really push the weirdness.”</p>
<p id="raqRnY">After <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22947922/turning-red-pixar-anime-influences"><em>Turning Red</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22535601/luca-pixar-3d-cg-animation"><em>Luca</em></a>, which both pushed Pixar in a more stylized, cartoony direction, it makes perfect sense that the filmmakers behind <em>Inside Out 2 </em>would feel emboldened to embrace a less conventional look. That’s an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23033750/the-bad-guys-pierre-perifel-director-interview-dreamworks">industry-wide trend</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23745774/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-animation-pixar-netflix-dreamworks">kicked off with<em> Into the Spider-Verse</em></a>, though some studios haven’t been as quick to embrace the movement. But movie by movie, Pixar is slowly welcoming the new. </p>
<p id="3cA8A0">“The studio [is] more open to having different directors with different sensibilities coming into the fore and wanting to pursue a very specific look,” says animation supervisor Dovi Anderson.</p>
<p id="S8MWk6">“Audiences are now more ready for that kind of animation,” adds animation supervisor Evan Bonifacio. “It’s not going to throw them to see stuff moving around in a specific way that feels pushed.”</p>

That puts it just shy of the 60 million achieved by the PS4 in a similar time frame, though the company is quick to note that the PS5 hasn’t had the benefit of a $100 price cut like its predecessor did (though Sony has been pushing plenty of discounted PS5 bundles in the last 12 months). The company expects to sell just 18 million more PS5s in the coming year, but also to make PlayStation more profitable near the end of this console generation thanks to cost-cutting and more players playing more games. </p><p> “As we enter the second half of the console cycle, we expect the number of new PS5 units sold to gradually decline,” Sony president Hiroki Totoki told investors. “However, by steadily maintaining and expanding the consistently increasing number of active users and user engagement, while also strengthening control over business costs, we believe that we will be able to steadily increase sales and profits from the PS platform going forward.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, on the other hand, has been a surprise hit. The alien shooter’s already sold over 12 million copies, which Sony says makes it the fastest-selling exclusive in a three-month period in the company’s history, even surpassing 2022's <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>. While that game benefitted from being backwards-compatible, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has clearly benefitted from being day-and-date on PC, even if Sony recently fumbled the bag with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-do-i-need-psn-steam-account-linking-1851457468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-do-i-need-psn-steam-account-linking-1851457468">Steam users over a PSN login fiasco</a></span>.</p><p>Sony seems poised to have a quieter upcoming year by comparison. The company confirmed there are still no new big-budget sequels planned to release during that time frame. One of the only big games coming in the immediate future that we know of is Firewalk’s online sci-fi shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/concord--1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/concord--1"><em>Concord</em></a></span>, though even that has only been teased with a vague CGI trailer. It seems likely we’ll learn more about it at the next PlayStation Showcase, which is rumored to be scheduled for before the end of May. </p><p>Yesterday, Sony announced that instead of replacing former Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan, it would promote two of its SVPs, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, to lead its game studio and platform business groups, respectively. Both men will report directly to Totoki as Sony seemingly reigns in the division following recent concerns around increasing budgets, longer development times, and acquisitions like <em>Destiny 2 </em>maker Bungie that have turned out to be much messier than previously expected. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/success-cant-save-your-favorite-game-studios-anymore<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The closure of Tango Gameworks adds a new wrinkle to 2024's game industry troubles.</h2></div><section><p>This week, Microsoft and Bethesda announced that they would be closing down multiple game development studios under their <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">umbrella</a>. These include Alpha Dog Games, maker of Mighty Doom, and Arkane Austin, developer of the disastrous <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/redfall-review">Redfall </a>among others. In the gaming industry, the conventional wisdom has long been held that bad games sink you and great games save you, which would lead many to drawing an unfortunate line between Redfall’s reception and Arkane Austin’s closure — but immediately stops supporting that conclusion when you get to Tango Gameworks.</p><p>Founded in 2010 by Shinji Mikami, the studio was largely known for  horror games like Evil Within until last year. As part of a shadow drop release, the cool rhythmic action title Hi-Fi Rush garnered critical acclaim from all sides, multiple awards and nominations, and was recently ported to PlayStation 5. Xbox Vice President Aaron Greenberg even said that the game was a “break out hit” in  “all key measurements and expectations.” Moreover, they did what critics and fans alike beg studios to do: make something wildly different outside of their comfort zones. </p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi-Fi RUSH was a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations. We couldn’t be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered with this surprise release.</p>— Aaron Greenberg 🙅🏼‍♂️💚U (@aarongreenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>Despite all that, late at night in Tokyo, the people who made a Game of the Year candidate were informed through an email by Xbox Games Studios head Matt Booty that they were closing the studio.</p><p>Hi-Fi Rush was, by Microsoft’s own admission, exactly the kind of game the Redmond giant has been convincing their audience to stick with Game Pass for, which sets unclear goals and expectations from the get-go. What exactly constitutes a success on Game Pass? Hi-Fi Rush topped a whopping 3 million players last year, but that clearly was <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not enough for the higher ups.</a> The lack of transparency with the general consumer on how games are evaluated internally is understandable, but it seems that not even Tango was aware of what metrics their game seemingly missed.</p><p>Despite having worked at a Japanese game studio myself, it does not take much experience to understand that creative jobs perform better when there is greater incentive beyond decidedly-unclear goals at the end. No one is working on a video game in hopes that they can get to the finish line of release so that they can continue to bite their nails over whether a nearly-90 metacritic game will result in a studio closure down the line as corporate, as Booty puts in the email, “look[s] across the business to identify the opportunities that are best positioned for success.”</p><p>Which leaves us grasping within this self-imposed murkiness for an answer to an important question: If success cannot save your studio, what can?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This is a problem that is likely on the mind of every other Xbox studio that does not produce games commanding audiences of tens of millions. With the upcoming release of Hellblade II: Senua’s Sacrifice, it is not difficult to imagine that a successful launch would not shield Ninja Theory from Microsoft’s ever-floating evaluations. Now those talented developers who have spent years toiling away on their game across multiple changes in their parent company’s focus have an ominous pall hanging over their head. It is not just enough to make a good game, nor make a game that critics and audiences both like, but you have to hope that a C-Suite executive’s nebulous plans forward include taking your studio along for the ride.</p><p>We have long assumed that corporate ownership by one of the richest companies in the industry would inoculate studios from tragic closures, but we were wrong. We thought that putting out a game with a modest budget would be protection, but we were wrong there too. And now we have learned that putting out a critically acclaimed title that said richest companies openly brag about succeeding will not protect anyone. There truly is no more shelter to hide under in the gaming industry and developers and consumers both suffer from it.</p><p>When studios are concerned for their very existence, games like Hi-Fi Rush do not have space to make it to market. Tango Gameworks bet on themselves by making something different than what they are known for and, by every metric available to them, that bet demonstrably paid off. In a situation where their head was on the chopping block the entire time, waiting for the executioner to make the call on whether their axe comes down on the back of Tango’s neck, you could not get a Hi-Fi Rush. </p><p>It is also unclear at this point what players can do to support games they love anymore. When the act of championing a game you like can only be measured in numbers too absurd for most video games, then there is no reasonable way to patronize them anymore. If three million players are not enough, why should anyone expect that four or five or ten million would be? It is no longer satisfactory to executives for a game to be a decent success, so there is little reason for audiences to become publicly enamored with what they play. In one fell swoop, Microsoft managed to undermine any grassroots marketing efforts they could have counted on for games that are not Call of Duty.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The games industry is ill and things like this, like the closure of Tango Gameworks and high-quality studios like Roll7, are symptoms. They can be written off by people as not their kind of game or reasoned with twisted return-on-investment maximization brainworms, but they do not represent an industry that is happy and healthy. The industry is now trying to redefine what success means until it skyrockets into an utterly unattainable goal post. It is likely not by intention, the decision-makers are also flying by the seat of their pants on this high-speed rocket, but ultimately that doesn’t actually mean anything. Microsoft was supposed to be the company that stepped back and said “Not past this line.” Now they’re erasing the line in the sand and hoping we don’t notice.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There's a good chance that you'll never have the funds to construct a life-sized replica of Metal Gear Rex, the iconic bipedal nuclear weapons platform and boxing ring from Metal Gear Solid. That doesn't mean you can't build a smaller replica, especially when companies like Kotobukiya offer a terrific model. Amazon has grabbed fresh stock of popular import, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Metal-Gear-Solid-Version/dp/B0BTCQBXNJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the $100 price is significantly less than what the Metal Gear Rex kit</a> often sells for (around $141).</p><p><em>You may have to click "Other sellers on Amazon" and choose to buy directly from Amazon to get the $100 deal.</em></p><p>It's worth noting that Amazon rarely carries model kits on its site--these are usually third-party deals, like Bandai Namco's Gundam line--and this is the best price you'll get for Metal Gear Rex. Strangely, at the time of writing this, Amazon's page defaulted to a third-party seller who has this model kit listed for $125, so you'll need to navigate to "Other sellers on Amazon" to find the $100 listing. You'll find this a little ways below the "Buy Now" button on mobile and desktop.</p><h3>Kotobukiya Metal Gear Models</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302692-metalgearrex%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302692" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302692-metalgearrex%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302692"></a><figcaption>Kotobukiya Metal Gear Rex</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302692-metalgearrex%282%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302685-metalgearrex%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302686-metalgearrex%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302687-metalgearrex%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302688-metalgearrex%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302689-metalgearrex%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302690-metalgearrex%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302691-metalgearrex%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302685,1300-4302686,1300-4302687,1300-4302688,1300-4302689,1300-4302690,1300-4302691" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302685-metalgearrex%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302686-metalgearrex%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302687-metalgearrex%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302688-metalgearrex%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302689-metalgearrex%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302690-metalgearrex%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302691-metalgearrex%2810%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302685-metalgearrex%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302686-metalgearrex%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302687-metalgearrex%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302688-metalgearrex%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302689-metalgearrex%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302690-metalgearrex%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302691-metalgearrex%2810%29.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Metal-Gear-Solid-Version/dp/B0BTCQBXNJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rex (black version)</a> | sold and shipped by Amazon -- $100 ($<del>141</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KOTOBUKIYA-KP409X-Patriot-Version-Height/dp/B0B8G4TJL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rex (MGS4 semi-damaged version)</a> -- $101</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Plastic-Model/dp/B07ZGQ2F5C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rex (MGS4 standard version)</a> -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KOTOBUKIYA-Metal-Patriot-KP266X-Height/dp/B0BDYD9DD1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Ray</a> -- $113</li></ul><p>As for the figure, this is a fun build.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/red-dead-redemption-may-finally-be-coming-to-pc/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=red-dead-redemption-may-finally-be-coming-to-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Last October, the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/red-dead-redemption-port-adds-60-fps-for-ps5/">ported to the PS5</a>. Other than offering the ability to enable 60fps, it wasn’t really much to write home about. What fans <em>actually</em> want is for Rockstar to release the 14-year-old game onto PC. So far nothing, but it could be happening soon.</p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">That’s according to Tez2, a user who, by their own definition, monitors the gaming world, “mostly regarding Rockstar Games titles.” Their latest datamine strongly suggests that <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> could finally be coming to the PC.</p> <figure data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">The image uploaded with the Twitter/X post shows some text that simply reads: “Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and its zombie-horror companion, <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, now playable on PC.”</p> <h2 id="h-do-we-need-any-more-hints" data-injectable="false">Do we need any more hints?</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">Suffice it to say, what Tez2 has unearthed, which they say was lifted from the Rockstar launcher, pretty much spells it out in black-and-white. Or orange, in this case. If what we see is based on truth, then <em>RDR</em> might actually make it to PC at some point.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">To ensure I tick the “journalistic due diligence” box (for such a thing exists…I imagine), it needs to be said that this is only speculation at this stage. However convincing the leak is, we can’t make any concrete claims about a PC port until Rockstar or any other official representative of the game can confirm or deny this information.</p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="false">Even if it does happen, it’s unclear whether it’ll even be a remaster of the 2010 release. There have been upscaled versions of <em>RDR</em> for console in the past, but as the PS5 and Switch releases have shown, chances are it could just be a straight port. We’ll have to wait and see what Rockstar has in store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced a major sales milestone for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series as a whole, which feels like a fitting birthday present for the franchise's 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240514.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed 100 million sales across the entire franchise, a figure to which entries like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-world-celebrates-13-million-sales-with-big-bonus-for-players">World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-13-million-sales">Rise</a></em>, as well as their respective expansions,&nbsp;have significantly contributed.</p>
<p>In fact, a quick glance at Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Platinum Titles" list</a>, which celebrates Capcom games that have sold more than a million units, shows that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>are the two best-selling games in the studio's history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-world-series-sales.jpg?itok=jUHFD0XN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-world-series-sales.jpg?itok=WJdnFtsf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed the 100 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Capcom,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>has sold over a million copies each year since the game was released, and sales for the game now stand at more than 25 million units (if the&nbsp;<em>Iceborn Master Edition&nbsp;</em>version is also counted).</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, meanwhile, which was released back in 2021, has sold "over approximately 2 million units annually" since its launch, and its expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak</em>, which was released the following year,&nbsp;has done the same.</p>
<p>Capcom says that together with the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-teases-monster-hunter-wilds-at-game-awards-2023">made last year</a>, these figures have helped drive the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise to its 100-million-sale milestone. More&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>info is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom">coming in summer</a>, too, so perhaps interest in the series will be renewed once again then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-series-sales.jpg?itok=91ntslzU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-series-sales.jpg?itok=PM8nsYIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game is rumbling into town soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 2004 with the original&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, and many sequels and spinoffs followed, spanning four console generations.</p>
<p>As well as the regular action-RPG series,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has also dabbled in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-announced-for-ps4-monster-hunter-stories-release-date-revealed">turn-based RPGs</a> and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>-style <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-is-niantics-new-real-world-game-partnership-with-capcom">augmented reality mobile games</a>, among other genres. It's also made the jump to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-movie-arrives-on-blu-ray-march-2021">live-action feature films</a> and anime, as well as crossing over with franchises like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-x-zoids-collaboration-revealed-with-actual-zoids-inspired-by-rathalos">nostalgia-riffic&nbsp;<em>Zoids</em></a>.</p>
<p>We'll learn more about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise in the coming months. For now, though, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>fan, you can rest easy in the knowledge that you're far from alone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-update-is-live-adding-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Citizen has received one of its most extensive updates yet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-team-introduces-fps-combat-improvements-coming-in-alpha-3-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha 3.23</a>, featuring many additions such as NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and a custom implementation of TSR (Temporal Super Resolution).</p>
<p>The Alpha 3.23 update also brings in a new selection of "first native wildlife" and several improvements and enhancements to the overall game mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alpha 3.23: Adventure Beckons" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMgmo8Dfslk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Meet the Wildlife, Marok and Kopian:&nbsp;</strong>Life finds a way.&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen’s&nbsp;</strong>first native animals have been added to the game, complete with bespoke behaviors fitting their evolutionary paths. Players will begin seeing the small marok bird soaring through the skies, using its proportionally enormous wingspan to travel vast distances with ease as it follows migratory fish. With the addition of humans to their habitat, they’ve been observed feeding on refuse and leftovers as well. While they present no threat to humans, the same can’t be said for the hound-like kopian. This pest creature is more than a nuisance, and brave citizens will be charged with dealing with wild packs of these hounds, just be sure to bring plenty of ammo.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mirai’s Pulse and Pulse LX Hoverbikes Brings Portable Thrills:&nbsp;</strong>It’s about the journey, the thrill. Mirai adds its signature fusion of advanced technology and functional elegance with a pair of hoverbikes that offer an unparalleled connection between rider and machine. The Mirai Pulse pushes the boundaries for what an ‘all round’ hoverbike can be, combining integrated light weapons for defense with an ultra-light frame and extreme performance capable of outrunning almost anything it can’t outgun. Shedding its weapons to improve speed and handling, the Pulse LX is a visual spectacle that brings racing prowess and sophisticated styling. Both hoverbikes are extremely portable, fitting in almost any ship’s cargo bay for terrestrial exploration almost anywhere.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Master Modes Makes its Galactic Debut:</strong>&nbsp;Flying in the ‘verse will never be the same again. Originally tested in patch 3.20, Master Modes is designed to add further intensity and strategy to ship-to-ship combat and foster exciting dogfighting scenarios. All ships now function in either Navigation Mode (NAV) maintaining a spooled quantum drive for both manual quantum travel and quick-travel to specific locations while disabling most offensive and defensive capabilities, and Standard Control Mode (SCM), with full access to weapons, shields, and devices at the cost of considerable speed. Transitioning between modes takes the flip of a switch and a few seconds for systems to power down and up respectively. All ships have been re-tuned for this significant change to space flight.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Welcome to the Distribution Center:</strong>&nbsp;Adventure Beckons&nbsp;introduces the first iteration of distribution centers throughout the Stanton system. These massive structures can be accessed from the planetary surface, with underground levels to open in later updates, and serve as mission hubs for law abiding players. Personal ground transportation is recommended for traversing these immense establishments, especially as they expand with additional underground levels.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Fly, Shoot, and Problem Solve in Arena Commander:&nbsp;</strong>New maps and gameplay opportunities have arrived in&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen’s</strong>&nbsp;‘game within a game’. Miner’s Lament is a close-quarters dogfighter's dream come true, or worst nightmare, as pilots fight through the asteroid-laden ring around Yela where the rocks are as deadly as other pilots. Going inside, a temporary Experimental Engineering Mode is available for citizens eager to test out the first iteration of engineering gameplay shown off at CitizenCon 2953, and their feedback will help shape the ongoing development of the system.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Plot a Course with the Star Map:&nbsp;</strong>The Star Map has reached its 1.0 update, rolling out a full 3D view of the system to all pilots. Locations can now be searched by name, with additional functionality to automatically plot a course from the present location. The update marks the introduction of a brand-new FPS map for boots on the ground, aiding players to navigate sprawling landing zones or even the interior layout of their ship. With the Star Map, a citizen is never truly lost.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>FPS Combat Upgrades Deliver More Immersion:&nbsp;</strong>Outside of the safety of a cockpit the ‘verse can be a dangerous place, and&nbsp;Adventure Beckons&nbsp;ensures that fighting and surviving is as engaging and enjoyable on foot as it is from ship to ship. FPS combat has never looked or felt more authentic thanks to a range of visual improvements including improved sprinting animations and a new dynamic crosshair option for a more realistic look of exactly where the muzzle of a weapon is aimed at. The feel of combat has been enhanced for additional immersion, with the inclusion of ‘backpack reloading’ for slower access to additional stored magazines, and procedural recoil for all weapons, ensuring every engagement is a truly unique experience.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>New Cloud Tech and Visual Options:&nbsp;</strong>The volumetric cloud technology in&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen</strong>&nbsp;has been updated to improve both performance and visual quality, adding ground fog and volumetric shadows as visual options. Additional performance improvements come with support for image upscaling solutions including DLSS, FSR, and an in-house developed TSR solution. Following the addition of over 20 new hairstyles in Alpha 3.22, the character customization system has been overhauled with a new user interface and many new additional customization options.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Welcoming New Players to all Landing Zones:&nbsp;</strong>The improved New Player Experience, originally released for Area18 in Alpha 3.19, has been expanded and is now supported on all starting locations. While the same core skills are taught at each location, new players can now choose to begin high in the cloud city of Orison, in the mining town of Lorville owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, on New Babbage which is both a bustling major trading hub and home to high-end electronic companies, or back at Area18’s urban downtown where bright lights attract commerce and entertainment.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With the Alpha 3.23 dropping in, one can expect a revamped experience, and the addition of exciting in-game content is undoubtedly a delight to witness.</p>

			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-game-pass-may-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the new Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-and-sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-2-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew that Lords of the Fallen would be added</a> to Microsoft's subscription service at some point, but as now confirmed, the 2023 title from Hexworks will be added to Game Pass by the end of the month on May 30. In addition, another interesting title that might do well on Game Pass is Ascendant Studios' magic shooter Immortals of Aveum - the game was already added to PlayStation Plus last month, and last year, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-xbox-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> studio's CEO already suggested that the title would be coming to Game Pass as well</a>. "Yes, we are talking to them about getting the game onto both of those services", the CEO said last year. "We don't have a date yet, I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen, though". Immortals of Aveum is being added to the service on May 16.</p>
<p>Other games that will be coming to Game Pass in the coming weeks include Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (today), Chants of Sennaar (tomorrow), NHL 24 on May 16th, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (day one on May 21), Galacticare and Hauntii on May 23, Moving Out 2 on May 28, Humanity on May 30, and both Firework and Rolling Hills on June 4.</p>
<p>Games that will be leaving Microsoft's service on May 31 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Chicory: A Colorful Tale&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Farworld Pioneers&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Pac-man Museum Plus</em>&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Railway Empire II&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you interested in the new titles joining the Game Pass library? Will you be checking out Lords of the Fallen and Immortals of Aveum? And what about the highly-anticipated sequel to 2017's Hellblade - <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-comparison-visuals-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade II</a>?

Microsoft will also add <a href="https://www.polygon.com/sub-gems/24120268/immortals-aveum-ps-plus-best-2023-shooter"><em>Immortals of Aveum</em></a> (a magic-based first-person shooter) and cloud gaming access for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23916070/nhl-24-new-controls-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>NHL 24</em></a>.</p>
<p id="RSN2li">Later in the month, expect a day-one release of Ninja Theory’s <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2, </em>but you won’t want to miss <em>Immortals of Aveum</em> or <em>Chants of Sennaar </em>either. As for <em>NHL 24</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131925/xbox-game-pass-april-lineup-ea-sports-nhl-24-manor-lords">console gamers got access in April</a>, but it’ll be available via cloud gaming now, too.</p>

Every time I so much as see a clip of <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, I’m reminded that Capcom’s hallmark fighting series is so back, and I wish I had the time to stay on that ride for the long run. But I recently got a chance to play Akuma, the classic antagonist who mirrors series mainstays Ryu and Ken’s Shoto archetype, and he made me appreciate how well this entry managed to fill out old characters’ arsenals to create one of the most robust fighting games in the space.<br></p><div data-video-id="191017" data-monetizable="false" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Hopefully Street Fighter 6's New Open-World Won't Mean Capcom Skimps On The Fighting" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="191017,192531,194842" data-current="191017"><div><p>Hopefully Street Fighter 6's New Open-World Won't Mean Capcom Skimps On The Fighting</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17131.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As a Shoto character, Akuma has a lot of staple <em>Street Fighter </em>abilities like the Hadoken fireball and Tatsumaki spinning kick (albeit with a handy, anti-air variation) that is the bread and butter of the archetype. But as a Ryu main, playing a different Shoto always feels like getting behind the wheel of a car I’m not used to driving. The fundamentals are the same, but it’s just different enough to throw me off. Akuma’s whole deal is that he gets more options at the expense of health. He’s a glass cannon, but in exchange he gets even more versatility in an already flexible fighting style.</p><p>While playing Akuma, I initially fell into the muscle memory of my hundreds of hours playing Ryu, but those slight variations would send my mind racing to new strategies. His air-based fireball and upward Tatsumaki kept me going high where I would normally have gone low, though I was swiftly punished for this in the right matchups. Facing Cammy was a particular pain point, as she could easily counter my air-based plays.</p><p>Watching <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIPTOVx6pls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIPTOVx6pls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom’s character breakdown</a></span> for Akuma demonstrates all the little nuances of his moveset I couldn’t pick up in just an hour of play, and that’s the kind of sicko shit that makes fighting games, and <em>Street Fighter 6</em> especially, so rewarding to dive into. Button-mashing through a character you’ve never played can be fun, but mastering a character makes the game so gratifying. <em>SF6</em>’s strength was in how it filled out its roster’s movesets and gave them universal tools like the Drive abilities that handled basic utilities like parrying. This freed up development space for each character’s unique abilities and gimmicks to shine through. Akuma is thriving under that design philosophy, and even if I don’t end up dropping my main for him, I want to learn his every move to best him online.</p><p>How many times can I tell myself “it’s time to go back to <em>Street Fighter 6</em>” before I finally do it? Maybe not too many more, as Akuma is launching as DLC on May 22. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-xcom-creative-director-founds-life-sim-maker-midsummer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, former XCOM developer Jake Solomon and other industry veterans launched Midsummer Studios to make a life sim.</p>



<p>Soloman is CEO and creative director of Midsummer Studios. They’re also working with Will Miller, another developer who worked at Firaxis. Nelsie Birch will lend their expertise and serve as COO and CFO. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/sbergel/status/1790374766945194130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter, Transcend’s Shanti Bergel announced their “lead investment in the oversubscribed $6M Seed round for Midsummer Studios.”</p>



<p>Reports from multiple outlets include further details about Midsummer Studio’s goals and life sim game. Solomon told GamesIndustry.biz that “what we’re really focusing on is the story aspect.” </p>



<p>The CEO showed a lot of interest in letting players make meaningful choices, with rewards and consequences. They mentioned the “drama of modern life and the conflict of modern life.”</p>



<p>Solomon also noted that “I think the danger would be if I was competing with The Sims feature-for-feature.” They say that “we have to do what we do really well; we just have to do it in a new space.” </p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/firaxis-veterans-announce-new-studio-midsummer-studio-to-reinvent-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by VGC</a>, Solomon reiterated the modern life approach with meaningful stories, but added that players could “share those stories with the world.” </p>



<p>It will also reportedly be a next-gen title, according to a statement made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-xcom-director-jake-solomon-making-a-next-gen-life-sim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via IGN</a>. At this early stage, Midsummer Studios has not confirmed a title or release window for the life sim game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/ps5-breaks-sales-record-but-still-falls-short-of-target-after-crossing-59-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed in <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_supplement.pdf">its latest financial earnings report</a> it sold 20.8 million PlayStation 5 units in the fiscal year that ended on March 31. In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq4XNbH6mtk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told&nbsp;<em>VGC&nbsp;</em>that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> in February, which is <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever-crossing-12-million-copies">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-concord-a-new-pvp-multiplayer-fps-from-firewalk-studios-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/">the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC</a>, this year.&nbsp;</p>

Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims.&nbsp;In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5M5i_ygnPo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”</p>

<p>Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.</p>

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fallout</em> has been all over the place, lately. While the Amazon Prime TV show has been a triumph (a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-fans-can-relax-as-amazon-confirms-a-second-season-is-on-the-way/">second season</a> was confirmed not long ago), <em>Fallout 4</em> has not been doing so hot. Despite the long wait for the next-gen update, many felt it was severely lacking. But Bethesda seems to want to rectify some of the issues.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">The most recent update for the game has now been sent out on all platforms, even previous gen. One of the changes that’s been added is the ability to “manage your control over the game’s graphic fidelity or performance.”</p> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">On top of this, the message above states that Bethesda has also implemented “additional fixes and improvements to address some of the feedback you provided us with on the previous update.”</p> <h2 id="h-will-it-be-enough" data-injectable="false">Will it be enough?</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">To go into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/4219387168548816722?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more detail</a>, there appears to have been a focus on three areas when it comes to this version of <em>Fallout 4</em>: display settings, frame rate target, and visual and performance prioritization. For instance, you can choose between 30, 40, and 60fps.</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">As always with patches and updates, Bethesda has fixed more than a few bugs. Some examples include: an “issue with load order that would break DLC until a restart after downloading mods” (PS5, specifically) and an issue that could “cause the Creation Club menu to not appear” in the Microsoft store.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="false">Personally, based on what a lot of people have been saying about the next-gen update, I haven’t even bothered to install it on my Xbox copy. Maybe this latest patch will appease some of the bigger concerns, but many didn’t feel the upgrade was worth the long wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155623/steelseries-arctis-nova-5-wireless-gaming-headset-price-availability<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you hate (or simply can’t be bothered) to adjust your audio profiles when setting up a new gaming headset, then you might be the target demographic for SteelSeries’ latest offering. Introduced on Tuesday, the new Arctis Nova 5 headset is supported by a dedicated companion app that features over 100 game-specific audio presets for Xbox and PlayStation 5 titles like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, which SteelSeries says have been “custom-tailored to each game by audio engineers.”</p><p>Available starting today for $129.99, SteelSeries describes the Arctis Nova 5 as an “affordable luxury.” It’s a smidge pricier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725308/steelseries-arctis-nova-4-wireless-headset-price-date">$119.99 Arctis Nova 4 wireless headset</a> launched last year, but for that, you get the ability to change audio presets in real time without leaving a gaming session, as well as cross-platform support for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, Meta Quest, and phones or tablets that support the included USB-C dongle.</p><div><figcaption><em>Users will need to connect their mobile device to the headset via Bluetooth to utilize the companion app’s audio presets.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>The Nova 5 companion app requires the headset to be connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth, but that shouldn’t interfere with the ability to receive calls mid-game. The “Quick Switch Wireless” feature swaps audio output between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth 5.3 by tapping a button located on one of the earcups, allowing users to take a call via Bluetooth while their in-game audio retains a passive 2.4GHz connection.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The design isn’t far removed from that of previous Arctis headsets. Note how the microphone slots into the earcup when fully retracted.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>And here’s a better look at the Quick Switch Wireless button, seen here on the right earcup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div></div><p>SteelSeries says the Arctis Nova 5 can last up to 60 hours per charge and that the headset’s USB-C fast charging can provide six hours of play on a 15-minute charge. It’s powered by neodymium magnetic drivers (which are fairly common in modern headsets), while a new high-bandwidth microphone chipset provides support for 32kHz / 16-bit audio to help keep in-game communications clear.&nbsp;</p><p>The microphone itself retracts into the headset when not in use, blending pretty seamlessly into the earcup. The Nova 5 also supports the same AI noise cancellation feature seen on the Nova 4 to help further reduce background noise in loud environments. Considering the Nova 5 is only an additional $10, the extra perks it provides could sway SteelSeries customers to dig around their couches for loose change to fund the upgrade.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="nSQa6n">If Amazon Studios’ teaser trailer for the second season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23329258/lord-rings-power-review-episode-release"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a> has one thing to say, it’s that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23342914/lord-rings-power-sauron-halbrand">Sauron is back</a> and it’s everybody’s problem. </p>
<p id="FdiZjC">The teaser checks in with most of our characters from season 1 — Elrond, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23327568/galadriel-the-rings-of-power-actor-lord-of-the-rings">Galadriel</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23330685/rings-of-power-dwarves-rock-lord-lotr-moria">Prince Durin</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23331596/lord-rings-power-arondir-bronwyn-elf-human-romance">Arondir</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23378700/lord-rings-power-adar-tolkien-galadriel-episode-6">Adar</a>, and even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403120/rings-power-who-is-stranger-wizard-actor-daniel-weyman">the Stranger</a>. In true “teaser” fashion, it’s light on specific plot details, but a cascade of gold rings — perhaps nine? — and a conspicuously bejeweled ring in the hands of King Durin give a hint at the season’s arc. </p>
<p id="wmDKEy"><em>Rings of Power</em>’s first had a lot of scene setting to do, as Sauron wormed his way into the confidence of elven leadership and put his mitts all over the forging of their three rings of power. Season 2 seems to continue with the two other sets of rings — the seven for the dwarves “in their halls of stone,” and “nine for mortal men doomed to die.” </p>
<p id="xzt3wx">Also: There’s a big eagle! He better talk like the ones in the books because I will not stand for another wave of “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22432394/eagles-lotr-plot-hole-mordor">Why didn’t they just ride eagles to Mordor?</a>” I’ve put in my time! </p>
<p id="zOiM43"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> will return on Aug. 29, on Amazon Prime Video. </p>

<p>When you hear the word iRacing, you probably think of sim racing and hyper-realism. What doesn’t likely come to mind are words like space, arcade, and off-road. But did you know that iRacing and in-house studio Orontes are developing a racing game with those three words in mind?</p>



<p>Meet ExoCross, <a href="https://www.iracing.com/orontes-games/exocross-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an off-road racing game</a> set roughly 100 years into the future where all forms of fossils fuels and vehicles have been banned on earth. Now, racers are controlling vehicles on other planets in deep space from the comfort of their own home. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming recently sat down with ExoCross creative director Paul Coleman to talk about the game’s development over the years, what players can expect to experience, what will keep them coming back to the game, and so much more.</p>



<p>The written interview is below, but, if you prefer, you can watch or listen to the conversation as well. ExoCross is scheduled to launch this summer on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.</p>

<h3 id="h-for-those-that-may-not-know-what-exactly-is-exocross">For those that may not know, what exactly is ExoCross?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: </strong>“Yeah, so ExoCross is an off-road racing game set in the future; about 100 years into the future.&nbsp;The premise is that the earth was getting too polluted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars, all forms of fossil fuels and transportation devices got banned. People stopped racing cars for real, but they turned to sim racing as a way of essentially scratching that itch and getting out and competing with one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So, sim racing lasted for a good 100 years, but people started to get bored of it because ultimately a new generation were coming through that hadn’t actually driven real cars.&nbsp;(2:04)&nbsp;They didn’t really know what they were simulating.</p>



<p>“So the premise with ExoCross is that to reinvigorate sim racing, we’ve explored deep space.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve looked for planets that are similar to earth in terms of gravity and flora and fauna.&nbsp;And we’ve looked for places to take our fossil fuels and essentially tear up other people’s planets instead. You’re racing remotely from earth, from your habitation pod in earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are one of the drivers in the ExoCross championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you’re racing these off-road vehicles via communication technology out into deep space.&nbsp;And you’re doing it from the comfort of your own home. </p>



<p>“It’s our kind of tongue-in-cheek take on where sim racing could go at some point in the future.&nbsp;But we’ve seen it as an opportunity to weave in a story around why people aren’t racing real cars anymore.&nbsp;But yeah, ExoCross at its core is a fun off-road racing game that’s set out in the distant future on planets that aren’t earth.”</p>

<p><strong>Coleman: “</strong>I think the first thing that came across about Orontes as a studio was the fact that it was two brothers extremely passionate about the stuff that they do.&nbsp;Super, super talented, like an amazing engineer and a brilliant artist, and they were just working together to make this incredible game as a pair. And the way they made this incredible racing game&nbsp;was to build an awesome engine,&nbsp;and the Orentis engine is essentially built out of&nbsp;their hard work, their blood, sweat and tears,&nbsp;but they’ve built it in such an incredibly forward-thinking&nbsp;and future-proof way that I think the main thing&nbsp;that the guys at iRacing saw when they approached them&nbsp;was just the opportunity&nbsp;and the sheer kind of passion&nbsp;that had been poured into that engine.</p>



<p>“But also the fact that it was so well put together and it could run at an amazing frame rate, look great, it offers huge potential, and it’s not just purchasing drag as a title and that being the end of it, which is what happens so many times when studios are bought up.&nbsp;This is actually about investing in the technology and using that as a foundation to then build a whole series of games on that tech going forwards.”</p>

<h3 id="h-how-was-blending-what-was-already-built-for-the-game-by-orontes-and-what-iracing-has-to-offer">How was blending what was already built for the game by Orontes and what iRacing has to offer?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong>&nbsp;“I think it’s one of the biggest challenges when you kind of parachute into a project is to kind of have a sit-rep, understand where the strengths are, where the weaknesses are, what the scope of the project is and what the company actually wants to get from it.&nbsp;And then you start bringing together the needs of the business, obviously the desires of the community and the players and what already exists to try and bring that together into a coherent package that really still surprises and delights the audience that are going to play it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The beauty of the engine is that so much of it was working well already, so it already had that running for it. But there were areas that we definitely wanted to play with and improve.&nbsp;iRacing as a company, anything that comes with the iRacing logo on it has to stand for great on-track action, wherever that is, whether it’s Dirt Track Racing, whether it’s NASCAR, whether it’s the simulation that the core product represents or whether it’s ExoCross, which we’re making, it has to be an excellent on-track experience and it has to represent awesome vehicles driving around tracks.&nbsp;So that was the key thing that we wanted to maintain but actually improve upon.</p>



<p>“So there are key areas with ExoCross that we have played with and we’ve improved.&nbsp;The way the vehicles drive, the tyre model, all of these things are things where we’ve brought in experts from iRacing to help with that.&nbsp;As we move towards making it a console product, one of the key areas that we’ve added is AI-based racing. So AI are coming in and they’re giving you competition to race against without you having to head online to have wheel-to-wheel action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The AI system has basically, we’ve brought over from iRacing where we know that iRacing has one of the greatest AI systems in the whole racing genre.&nbsp;So why not bring it in and use it and build on that strength? But then there’s also stuff that we’re doing within ExoCross that will hopefully then feed back into iRacing as a bigger product and hopefully improving those areas.”</p>

<h3 id="h-was-there-anything-with-drag-now-exocross-that-you-felt-needed-to-be-changed-removed-or-just-didn-t-fit-in-the-new-vision-for-the-game">Was there anything with Drag, now ExoCross, that you felt needed to be changed, removed, or just didn’t fit in the new vision for the game?</h3>



<p>Coleman: “I&nbsp;think the key thing was how it was packaged and whether that would work for a console audience.&nbsp;I think as an early access product, it showed the promise.&nbsp;It definitely gave enough challenge for players to keep coming back, keep racing. </p>



<p>“There was some good online there where players could group up and meet up and play together, but it didn’t feel like a coherent package.&nbsp;It felt like something that was still in development.&nbsp;And that is ultimately what early access is. You sign up for a product in the hope that it’s going to grow and it’s going to develop and it’s going to become more than it currently is at the point at which you buy into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Their roadmap looked good, but iRacing, I think, was one of the key missing features that was the must-have that we put on the table and said, whatever happens, we’re going to improve AI or introduce and then improve AI.&nbsp;Obviously, there’s the content-based stuff as well, like looking at the two cars that they had, they were OK. But we wanted to add another vehicle in there so that we could almost get this easy, medium and hard flavor to the game and ensure that players had more sense of progression as they move through the tiers.&nbsp;And then beyond that, making sure that there was a more broader variety of racetracks to go race on, championships to progress through.&nbsp;So ways to just essentially keep the players playing and give lots of different types of players lots of different ways to play.”</p>

<h3 id="h-what-would-you-say-is-something-that-will-keep-players-coming-back-race-after-race">What would you say is something that will keep players coming back race after race?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong> “I&nbsp;think for me, it’s a challenge.&nbsp;I think we’re not setting out to make a game that’s impossible to beat, but we do want a game that has a nice, gentle, early difficulty curve that then ramps up.&nbsp; So there’s quite a high skill ceiling. And I think that’s reflected in some of the leaderboard challenges and the ways that we’re encouraging players to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So really, the single player is an onboarding into the wider experience.&nbsp;And then going online to play with other players, going into challenges and special events to compete on the leaderboards. That’s where we see there being more longevity and more reasons to keep coming back.&nbsp;I think it’s one of the beauty of off-road racing is that it’s much harder to get a perfect lap because there’s so many more variables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Loose surface driving; how you set the car up for a corner. There’s just so much more than just picking a perfect line and nailing your braking and your throttle points that makes it off-road that much more hard to master.&nbsp;So yeah, we are all about making a game that is going to feel fun to pick up and play early on, but it’s going to have that sort of real mastery level to it where you feel like every time you drive a stage, you can do that a little bit better.”</p>



<h3 id="h-how-is-the-studio-finding-the-balance-between-controller-and-wheel-drivers">How is the studio finding the balance between controller and wheel drivers?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong> “I think probably the best way to answer that is to describe how we’ve developed it.&nbsp;So I think when you make a game that’s more focused on the realism and the simulation, you tend to do all of the gameplay balancing and refinement on a wheel and then you think about how it’s going to feel on the pads later.&nbsp;I think when you’re making a game that’s more console focused, you do a lot of the refinement and balancing with a controller in your hands and then you check the wheel later on and make sure that that’s also working well.</p>



<p>“So both ways work and both ways generally end up with the game feeling good in both scenarios.&nbsp;But by doing pad first, you are capturing what the majority of console players will be experiencing and then checking that against how the wheel feels and ensuring that the wheel does still feel fun.&nbsp;But, you know, the wheel, I would describe wheel play in this as more intensive in that you have to be more off road with your inputs, so really throw the car in. </p>



<p>“So where I think on a track racing game, you would be more gentle with your inputs.&nbsp;You’re trying to do minimal steering really with the wheel and let your feet do the steering with the rotation of the car.&nbsp;With off road, you want to kind of do similar, but you sometimes need to make that first input a bit more abrupt to just get the car to bite. And then it’s about catching the slide and maintaining the slide with delicate steering input.&nbsp;And I think we’ve got that with the wheel right now.&nbsp;So I think it’ll be fun on both. That’s that’s our goal.&nbsp;That’s what we’re setting out to do.&nbsp;But I want console players to know that it feels great on a pad and they don’t have to go out and buy a wheel to get the most out of this.”</p>

<p><strong>Coleman: </strong>“Yeah, I think there’s always that risk.&nbsp;And my hope is that we do get big enough communities on each platform for us not to have a community of players feeling isolated across these different platforms and not finding a way to play together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My hope is that each platform stands strong and the players within those platforms can enjoy themselves. There are certain challenges with cross-platform play that require a fairly significant investment in development to ensure that they work well.&nbsp;And actually, the easy part is getting platforms playing together on a server.&nbsp;The more challenging aspect comes from dealing with some of the certification requirements and making sure that Microsoft and Sony are happy with the way that their platform is being represented on the other platforms and how their players are being protected across the other platforms. </p>



<p>That’s where a lot of the development work and challenge comes in.&nbsp;So, yeah, it’s something that I think, in terms of wish lists, I’m with you and I’m with the community.&nbsp;It’s something that we should absolutely be trying to do with every game we make. But I think for ExoCross, we’re going to try with cross-generation and see how we go with that and then potentially expand into cross-platform if the need arises further down the line.”</p>
