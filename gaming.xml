            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-season-3-goes-live-with-new-details<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is making the rounds with another wave of new content as part of their newest season: Curse of the Wandering Flames. Capcom and Niantic have dropped a bunch of new information alongside its release - including a new cooking feature - which is live as of this posting.</p>
<p>For those versed in the Monster Hunter series, cooking is a known staple of those games. It's finally made its way over to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> as a feature that lets you cook using Raw Meat, which can be obtained as a supply item in the in-game shop. Cook up some Raw Meat to make Well-Done Steaks, which can be consumed to let you start a hunt with the Special Gauge at maximum for up to five minutes.</p>
<p>That said, if you mess up during your cooking session, you might end up with Raw Meat, Rare Steak, or Burnt Meat, the latter of which can still be used to hunt with a max gauge for at least one minute. Two pieces of Raw Meat can be collected daily from the in-game shop, so keep that in mind. You can also hold up to ten pieces of Raw Meat, Well-Done Steak, Rare Steak, and Burnt Meat.</p>
<p>Another addition this season in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is the introduction of the heavy bowgun, which includes Heavy Bowgun Training Quests. Complete these quests to earn Heavy Bowgun Training Tickets, which can be used to forge and upgrade the Bone Shooter.</p>
<p>This particular event will last from September 12 through November 30, 2024 at 2:59PM UTC. Other rewards include gatherable materials such as the Monster Bone+, Zenny, and Season Tier points.</p>

For a limited time, they can also claim an additional 1000 Item Box Expansion slots, 10,000 Zenny, and three Ultra Hunting Tickets through September 22.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Now</em>'s new season will also introduce new monsters on the field. By completing urgent quests, players can unlock Aknosom, Magnamalo, and Rajang. These quests will also unlock Mizutsune and Nightshade Paolumu, who have only appeared in events until now. Some monsters will temporarily disappear from the field once Season 3 begins, but they can be unlocked once more by completing the accompanying story quests.</p>
<p>The new season will also feature some social activities, including a campaign on X (Twitter). Simply check out the official account over there, help it reach 5,000 reposts and unlock an offer code. This will include a number of items such as Potions, Machalite Ore, Dragonite Rre, earth crystals, Monster Bone+, and Weapon Refining Parts.</p>
<p>There's a new streamer mode too that'll let players stream <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> gameplay online without giving away sensitive information such as location data. Simply enable this mode in Settings and your ID and location information will be restricted.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Now </em>is currently available for iOS and Android platforms. More information can be read over at the official <a href="https://monsterhunternow.com/news/season3announce">blog</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Returns Have Diminished]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-price</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-returns-have-diminished.978609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For most of the history of console gaming--and we're talking decades here--generations of and updates to machines tended to mean something. Each new batch of consoles offered substantial upgrades over those that came before. When companies began releasing updates mid-generation, those updates--from Sony especially--used to mean price cuts.</p><p>But during the Xbox One and PS4 years of the past decade, console updates became less and less noteworthy. The leaps in visuals weren't as vast, "old gen" games would stick around for longer than they used to and controller innovation became, Nintendo aside, virtually non-existent. The term we used to use with sincerity for new generations of consoles was "next gen". For the past ten years it's been more like "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=consoles+diminishing+returns&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=consoles+diminishing+returns&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDI2MzZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diminishing returns</a>".</p><p>The PS4 and Xbox One offered only marginal improvements over their predecessors, and the PS5 and Xbox Series X have offered even less. Even the last mid-cycle refresh, the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/welcome-to-the-last-generation-a-look-back-at-seven-years-of-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> proved a limited proposition</a>. But the term "diminishing returns" doesn't just suggest we get less and less with each new offering; it suggests that at some point we'll stop getting anything at all.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The PS5 Pro announcement sure feels like we're pretty close</a> to that point. In the middle of an inflationary and cost-of-living crisis, when the proposition of expensive AAA gaming has never looked worse, along comes Sony with a console that is...hundreds of dollars more expensive than the machine currently on sale? And offers so little of value to the vast majority of gamers, their human eyes and regular TV sets?</p><figure><figcaption>What are we even doing here</figcaption></figure><p>Like, what is the point here? Surely now, given the market and the climate, would have been the perfect time for a cheaper, more accessible PlayStation. Instead this is a console designed, priced and marketed solely at the kind of person who makes six figures, watches Digital Foundry videos then argues about them on Reddit.</p><p>The PS5 Pro reveal comes less than a year after the PS5 Slim's announcement; the word "slim" used to mean a price cut, a practice pioneered by Sony with the PS2, but that particular console was actually...the same price as the old one. Actually, if you went with the discless edition,<a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it was <em>more expensive</em></a>.</p><p>Christopher Dring<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-problem-with-ps5-pro-isnt-the-price-tag-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote in GI.biz earlier today</a> that the problem with the PS5 Pro isn't the price itself, and he's right. The problem is the strategy behind it, that this entire console generation hasn't yet got itself up to "full speed", with too many PS4 ports and too many big studios still on the sidelines because it costs so much money and takes so much time to make a PS5 game. Releasing a machine like this, at this time, is a move representative of a company that is caught in the same technical death spiral that<a href="https://aftermath.site/big-budget-game-development-is-not-sustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> led to <em>Spider-Man 2</em> costing twice as much to make as <em>Spider-Man</em></a>.</p><p>There are barely enough games out there making full use of the existing PS5 as it is. There will be even fewer making full use of the PS5 Pro, so the fact Sony saw this console as a need, committed resources to it and are now releasing it to market is <em>wild</em>. But it's also the only place left for companies like this to go! Hyperinflated GPU prices and the death of disc drives have killed off any chance of a cheaper console--<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-5-price-rise-raising-hike-increase-sony-1849455516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PS5 getting price <em>hikes </em>instead of cuts is testament to that</a>--so the super-consumers are the only market left for Sony to reach. Or, in this case,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/ps5/former-blizzard-boss-says-the-dollar700-ps5-pro-is-really-more-like-a-dollar350-upgrade-because-its-aimed-at-people-who-can-trade-in-their-ps5s-at-places-like-gamestop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reach again</a>.</p><p>I don't think there's been a console and price announcement this disastrous since<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/when-599-was-probably-too-cheap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> PlayStation's notorious $599 PS3 reveal back in 2006</a>. This is a machine totally at odds with the time of its release, and if the concept of diminishing returns implies that consoles (from Sony and Microsoft at least) are on a trajectory, then we're dangerously close to the flatline. If this is what Sony is offering in 2024 I can only dread what the next actual consoles will look like, and what little they'll offer. Or worse, what they'll be priced at.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24242377/valve-steam-improved-family-sharing-out-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve’s new Steam Families feature is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F593110%2Fview%2F4605582245626919823">now available for everyone</a> following a beta launch earlier this year. With Steam Families, parents are able to share games with their families, manage parental controls for their kids, and approve requests from their kids to buy Steam games.</p><p>The big improvement with Steam Families over Valve’s previous Family Sharing setup is that multiple people can play games from a shared library at one time. So if I’m playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a>, and my partner, who is part of my Steam Family, wants to play <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest"><em>Arranger</em></a><em>, </em>we can both play those games at the same time. However, if my partner wants to play <em>Balatro</em> while I’m already playing it, she’ll need to buy an additional copy. With Steam Families, you can play shared games offline, too.</p><p>Valve says that Steam Families are “intended to contain your immediate family” and that they can include “up to 6 close family members.” Each member of a Steam Family will have their own save games and earn their own achievements. Adults can leave a Steam Family at any time, but if they do, they’ll have to wait a year before they can start or join a new Family. Children can only be removed by a Steam Family by an adult or with the help of Steam support.</p><p>In <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Db248W74jcFc">a video</a>, Valve says that the old Family Sharing feature will be retired “eventually,” so if you’ve been using that, you might want to set up Steam Families instead.</p><p>You can start using Steam Families by updating Steam. The newest Steam client update has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4599952112537386541?utm_source=SteamDB">a handful of other updates</a>, too, including a redesigned screenshots manager.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I find the word “cozy” to be dreadfully overused when assigning genres to video games these days, but it’s hard to find another adjective that so perfectly captures what I love about Dragon Quest. Straightforward but rewarding turn-based combat paired with a classic hero’s journey told in a picturesque fantasy world result in a wonderfully traditional RPG experience I’ve always found so comforting. So when I was given the choice at a recent preview event to try out Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake on either PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch, the choice to settle in on the couch in the Switch’s handheld mode was an easy one.</p><p>And rest assured, Switch owners, Dragon Quest 3 looked and ran great on the aging Nintendo system. Square Enix’s other HD-2D games like Octopath Traveler and Live A Live were perfect for playing in short bursts before bed, and Dragon Quest 3 is looking to fit that mold as well. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>Unlike our first look at Dragon Quest 3’s remake which showed off how faithfully it’s sticking to the roots of the 30-plus-year-old NES RPG, the hour I played Dragon Quest 3 was spent with some of the remake’s brand-new additions. And so far, I’m extremely pleased with the new content that spruces things up without unrecognizably transforming the original experience. </p><p>First, I hung out in the revamped Monster Arena, where you can send monsters you’ve defeated and recruited throughout the game to do battle against other teams of creatures. In the original Dragon Quest 3, you could simply bet on the outcome of fights in the Monster Arena, but this remake lets you get in on the action yourself. Monster collecting has been a big part of both the main Dragon Quest games and the Monsters spinoff series for decades, and it’s great to see that legacy continue here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I entered the arena with a preset team of a Slime, Healslime, and Spiked Hare, but this side mode is clearly set up for me to make my own teams with monsters I recruit across the main game. You don’t directly command your team in the Monster Arena tournament, but rather set how they should act in battle from four distinct options: Show No Mercy, Fight Wisely, Focus on Healing, and Don’t Use MP. </p><p>For the first few rounds, I instructed my Healslime to focus on healing its allies while the Slime and Spiked Hare dealt all the damage, but once I realized I had this fight in the bag, I had my whole team go all out. This monster auto battler seems like a fun distraction from the main adventure, and I can see myself swinging by regularly to fine-tune my team and enter them in tournaments. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While watching my team do battle I found myself mesmerized by the enemy character models. I’ve felt that Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style were a match made in heaven since this remake’s initial reveal, and seeing it in action confirmed how much I love seeing these classic enemies in Square Enix’s enticing art direction. The killerpillar (an evil caterpillar, if you couldn’t guess) I faced in my first fight had a very detailed idle animation where it bounced back and forth, and the way it wriggled its entire body when gearing up for an attack made the whole turn-based fight feel so much more dynamic. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’ve felt that Dragon Quest and the HD-2D art style were a match made in heaven since this remake’s initial reveal, and seeing it in action confirmed how much I love seeing these classic enemies in Square Enix’s enticing art direction. </p></div><p>The same can be said of the awesome character models for Robbin' 'Ood and his set of Robbin' 'oodlums, the boss fight I faced at the top of Skyfell Tower. Ascending the tower was a classic, atmospheric dungeon experience filled with random encounters. Here, I was impressed with how flexible Dragon Quest 3’s combat system is. Remember those four preset orders I could assign to my team in the Monster Arena? In Dragon Quest 3’s core combat, those presets are still available to you, with the added option of “Follow Orders”. This means you can rip through the low-stakes random encounters in a dungeon by telling all four of your party members to Show No Mercy, but when a challenging boss fight begins, you can take control of every decision to ensure you emerge victorious. This, combined with the ability to crank up the battle speed whenever you like, adds to that cozy, relaxing game feel I mentioned earlier. It’s enjoyable to kick back and watch the experience points roll in during the low level fights that only take a few seconds at max speed, but when I reached the top of the tower to face off against Robbin ‘Ood, I wanted to make every choice myself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And it’s a good thing I did take control of the boss fight, because it was a nail-biter. I had to use my Priest to heal my party several times, while my protagonist and Monster Wrangler – which is a new class introduced to the remake – dealt the heavy blows. I let out a big sigh of relief when Robbin ‘Ood finally fell to the ground, and it just made me want to rush straight to the next dungeon to face off against the next big boss.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I imagine players will have a ton of fun customizing their party and making changes to it throughout the game.</p></div><p>I also want to shout out this remake’s new party customization feature. The party members in Dragon Quest 3 are blank slates, but the remake revamps Patty’s Party Planning Place, a tavern where you can design your own party members, choosing their class, name, appearance, hair color, and voice. There aren’t very many customization options, but enough to make a rudimentary version of myself that I inserted into my party. I imagine players will have a ton of fun customizing their party and making changes to it throughout the game.</p><p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is out November 14 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake arriving sometime next year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you don't have kids, it's quite possible you've never heard of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gorilla-tag/" data-ref-id="5000-580058">Gorilla Tag</a>, and if you <em>do </em>have kids, there's a good chance Gorilla Tag is all you've been hearing about for a few years now. Originally developed by one person, Kerestell Smith--known to fans by his online handle Lemming--Gorilla Tag is <em>the </em>game of a generation. It hosts a million unique players daily, up to three million monthly active users, and has been played by over 12 million people since it released in 2021. While many older players have sometimes already written off VR, players of a particular age, approximately 7-14, have flocked to a game that is simple in its gameplay loop but sneakily complex in its design.</p><p dir="ltr">As both a writer in this space and the parent of a Gen Alpha kid who's been shimmying through his bedroom as a virtual great ape for a few years now, I was excited to meet Smith and hear the complete Gorilla Tag origin story, learning why and how he believes Gorilla Tag overtook a generation, and what it means for the future of the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">"What's really funny is that I didn't set out to make a game that kids like. I just thought to make a game that <em>I</em> like," Smith told me through a laugh as part of a sit-down conversation in Seattle during PAX West earlier this month. "So I don't know what that says about my sensibilities for, like, what I want to do in VR."</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, Gorilla Tag is an aptly named game. In it, players inhabit the bodies of gorillas and join a multiplayer world with others where they--you guessed it--play tag. Due to the playground-like nature of the world, however, players have branched out to make their own games, foster urban legends about the world, and use it as an online hangout space where the loose structure lets them join up and chat. Smith even told me his team holds meetings inside the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366059-ss_c449098748fc6891d4bc337b0465df4fd9cc9fb3.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366059" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366059-ss_c449098748fc6891d4bc337b0465df4fd9cc9fb3.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366059"></a><figcaption>Gorilla Tag has become Gen Alpha's preferred virtual hangout in recent years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366059-ss_c449098748fc6891d4bc337b0465df4fd9cc9fb3.600x338.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Because of several factors--its novel gameplay intentions, its low-poly (and now heavily memed) art style, its immense popularity despite being trapped in a VR bubble--Gorilla Tag has fascinated me for years, so I asked Smith to give me the game's origin story. What I didn't expect was a nearly 40-minute answer that ate up most of our initially allotted interview time. But his lengthy answer was illuminating, and we were able to stick around long after the scheduled end point so I could get in another dozen or so questions I still wanted to ask.</p><p dir="ltr">"I always just did [VR gaming] kind of as a hobby," Smith told me, explaining that he never really had strong intentions to be a game developer. "I was just super into VR. I was playing all sorts of stuff. And then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lone-echo/" data-ref-id="5000-458484">Echo Arena</a> came out, and I remember thinking, 'Oh, I'll check it out, because it's got zero-G.' It seemed more like a sports-style game. And I don't really care about sports-style games, but after I checked it out, it was like a switch was flipped." Smith said his opinion went from "VR is the coolest video-game thing that's come out in who-knows-how-long" to realizing "there's something special about this," and that "it's not just gonna be a video-game thing."</p><p dir="ltr">As he grinded to the top of the Echo Arena competitive leaderboards, Smith discovered that the game's zero-G movement was so much like what he imagined the real thing to feel like that he became obsessed with ideas of virtual worlds that abide by their own internal logic, and do so consistently to the extent that they can immerse you in an experience unlike any other.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you have this really strong connection with your environment, if you push on the world, and the world pushes back, if it's built in a way that feels real, has this subset of rules, internally consistent rules that the game follows, that you can learn and then just be immersed in the space, because you understand it, and then you put other people there, so you feel like you're there, and you feel like other people are there," Smith said. "That kind of connection you can have is second only to what you can form in real life.</p><p dir="ltr">"And that, to me, [is] the key power of the medium. That's the thing that VR can do, that nothing else can do: give you that feeling that you're in the same place as another person. It feels like you're actually with somebody else. And those were the things that I focused on in Gorilla Tag. I tried to just cut out as much as I could and just focus on those things. Because it was like, 'I want to build something and I want to release it, so I need to make it as small as I can,' but what are the important parts? What are the things that can't be left out?"</p><p dir="ltr">This led to the formation of what he calls the Three Axioms for his studio, Another Axiom. Smith explained this conceptual trio as the direct relationship between the player and the environment, building a plausible alternate reality with consistent internal rules that players can understand, and forming a connection to other people in-game. These axioms, Smith suggested, will also help shape the team's next project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_4U75G3D8">Orion Drift</a>, which looks to build on Gorilla Tag's social structure with massively expanded multiplayer worlds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366060-ss_9bb0c13a216ed014c7a999c68694fd4e0e03c25b.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366060" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366060-ss_9bb0c13a216ed014c7a999c68694fd4e0e03c25b.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366060"></a><figcaption>Where older players tend to see VR as a hassle, many younger players have adopted it as must-have tech.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366060-ss_9bb0c13a216ed014c7a999c68694fd4e0e03c25b.600x338.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I had been playing a lot of these different VR experiences and doing all these things, and I didn't feel like I was seeing the kinds of things that hit on the aspects of the VR experiences that I was really connecting with. It was this sense of, 'I don't think the industry is moving forward as fast as I hoped it would have,' but I saw these different developers doing these different pieces. Like, all these different experiences that are awesome in all these different ways, but they weren't being pulled together and focused on. So I had this sense of, 'Okay, well, if I think I'm so smart, I'm not just gonna post on internet forums and complain and be annoying or whatever. I have to put my money where my mouth is and try and make something.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Smith said he set out to make what would become Gorilla Tag "because I cared really deeply about VR and the medium, and my hope was, maybe if I make something really cool, then a real developer might try it out and be like, 'Oh, there's some cool ideas here.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Smith's thoughts on his design intentions for Gorilla Tag were incredibly detailed, to an extent I found intriguing given how all of his purposeful planning surrounding the game's locomotion mechanic, its refusal to embed the game in immersion-breaking menus, how he determined it would work best if avatars had no legs, and more are all ultimately experienced by a young playerbase generally lacking the vocabulary to express any of it, but they likely feel it as they play, and that's why it works.</p><p dir="ltr">"Gorilla Tag, I can say very confidently, doesn't have [avatar] legs, specifically because of my experience playing Raccoon Lagoon," Smith told me. "It was a resource-gathering game, so you have the problem of, 'Okay, I chopped down the tree, and I want to collect the logs, and the logs are on the ground, so I have to bend over to pick up the logs,' and it's kind of a pain in the butt to constantly have to do that. So [developer Hidden Path] just put you at torso height, so you chop a tree down, and you can just reach your arm out and pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">"And I played it, and I noticed it didn't feel weird that I was at torso height on the ground, and the ground was right there. It felt totally fine. So it got me thinking about how we have these preconceived notions of [how] a VR game should map to your body, but because you don't have your legs as a controller, removing that actually makes it easier to interact with that virtual world." This led to Gorilla tag's arm-based mechanic where you pull yourself through the world similar to how a real gorilla moves. For those who have never seen it, it's kind of like walking on stilts, only the skill ceiling is incredibly high, which Smith discovered months after the initial concept was pieced together, at a time when he'd added a multiplayer component that wasn't initially there.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had this idea for tag, and I just threw it in there. And then all of a sudden, when you could see other people, and when you're <em>it </em>and you're chasing somebody, and your feeling is just, 'I gotta get that guy,' that's such a primal thing, right? Tag is something that all mammals play, and it felt it was the exact same feeling. I have to move quickly to catch that person. If someone's chasing you, you get kind of worried, so you end up moving a little bit more erratically, so you end up not being as fast, you're easier to catch. Like, all these different aspects just kind of came together."</p><p dir="ltr">This, Smith feels, points to the axiom of internal logic that, if made consistent, can allow players to adapt quickly. A VR world doesn't have to be like real life. It doesn't even have to look like real life, Smith said, recalling the platform's early obsession with high-fidelity visuals. Targeting the original and underpowered Oculus Quest headset, Smith knew he would need to work within his limitations for Gorilla Tag, and he told me he was inspired by a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlphaBetaGamer">Alpha Beta Gamer</a> that's dedicated to playing under-the-radar indie games, many of which featured PS1-style visuals.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366061-ss_efe8aa03e6b9f7c968e762952baac623243c7ab8.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366061" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366061-ss_efe8aa03e6b9f7c968e762952baac623243c7ab8.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366061"></a><figcaption>Smith told GameSpot that launching Gorilla Tag without monetization nearly tanked his financials early on because it was so popular and yet free to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366061-ss_efe8aa03e6b9f7c968e762952baac623243c7ab8.600x338.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I wanted to make everything for this game myself [and] that was an art style that was kind of accessible [to me], but it's almost easier to buy into the world when it has this clear visual style that is not meant to look like real life," Smith said. "It's easier to buy into this other world that looks totally different and has this completely different feel to it, but you can still invest yourself in it because your brain doesn't have this [feeling of], 'Oh, sorry, this is too pixely to be real.'"</p><p dir="ltr">It was clear, when Smith finally took a breath, that he firmly believes in VR, not just as a current tech toy or a development tool for his sudden change of career, but as a platform with a foundation already sturdy enough today that he no longer worries about its future prospects.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's so much work that's been done to really flesh out what is valuable about the medium," he said, "and now there's this path forward to say, 'Okay, let's build on what's been made before.' It's not just, 'Let's just keep trying new things and see what works.' There's enough of a body of work there that there's really stuff to build on now.</p><p dir="ltr">"Video games are kind of hitting a renaissance right now, in some ways. You're seeing all these new ideas come out. The tools are powerful enough that indie game developers can make these things that become mega, super hits out of nowhere. You know, Vampire Survivors, Palworld, all these things that are enabled by building off of what came before [...] And I'm excited because, I think for VR, we don't have to imagine anymore. You can see what's happening with the industry, and you can see what things are building towards and what people are connecting with."</p><p dir="ltr">With years of success behind him and his team's next game coming soon, Smith acknowledges a VR bubble but feels it's only a matter of time until it pops. "The way I think about it is, you know when we were really young and our parents were telling us, 'I don't get why you kids are playing these games,' right? And we're like, 'You just don't understand.' It was kind of generational, right? It's not because they wouldn't be able to have fun playing games, but they just didn't even think of themselves as people who <em>would </em>play these games.</p><p dir="ltr">"And then, as we've gotten older, everybody in our generation plays video games, right? Video games are for everybody. It's bigger than music, and movies, and TV, and all these things. Our parents didn't understand that exactly, but it wasn't that people of a certain age couldn't get it. It was just people who didn't grow up with it, who didn't understand it, who were maybe not quite as open to these new experiences. And I think it's a similar thing with VR. I think that the kids who are playing VR now are going to be playing it their entire lives." Anecdotally, I told Smith I agreed. Kids in my son's school play VR games much more often than people my age do. Most of the people I know in the games media industry don't regularly play VR games, but it seems like younger generations are much more enthusiastic about it. As headsets get less bulky and more powerful--and these kids eventually have expendable income--it does seem like there is still a future for this tech that many wrote off years ago.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366062-ss_8f004c8e4332c7c041c5089ed2f962079c28405c.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366062" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4366062-ss_8f004c8e4332c7c041c5089ed2f962079c28405c.600x338.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366062"></a><figcaption>A Gorilla Tag plush recently broke sales records on Makeship, surpassing its funding goal by nearly 27,000%.

One is because of that aforementioned foundation that he feels VR now benefits from; it's found its footing, and from there, it can only improve. The second, which he returned to more often and fervently than any other in my 70-minute chat with him, is VR's unique social dynamics.</p><p dir="ltr">"I really, truly believe in that social aspect," he said. "That ability to create communities and spaces that is becoming more and more difficult these days. It seems like it's really tough to raise kids, especially right now, compared to when we were younger. It's harder for kids to just ride their bike to their friends' houses, right? There are fewer spaces where it's okay for teenagers to hang out together outside.</p><p dir="ltr">"But VR allows people to create these communities and spaces that they can just exist in and just hang out together. One of the things that I want people to feel about the games that we make is not like, 'Gorilla Tag is really fun.' It's the feeling of being in that world with other people. It's the same way that you can picture what it's like to just hang out with your friends, or go and spend time at their house, or go visit the beach and just, you know, soak up the waves."</p><p dir="ltr">A VR game, if done well, is not just an activity, Smith believes. In a manner unique to the platform, it can deliver on a feeling of "community," he said, "and that is really powerful [...] so powerful that I don't see a way for VR to fail at this point."</p>

With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s October release looming ever closer, developer BioWare continues its slow and steady stream of blog-sized info-nuggets and teases - this time revealing a little about exploration, alongside news of a photo mode.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/exploration-across-thedas">BioWare's latest blog post</a>, The Veilguard will give players the opportunity to visit and explore places around Thedas that series veterans may have "heard whispers [of] in the past". These include Arlathan Forest, Hossberg Wetlands, Minrathous, Rivain, and Treviso - and all get their own little video tours in BioWare's post if you're curious to see more.
</p>
<p>
Locations in The Veilguard will, as you might expect, feature people to talk to, things to do, puzzles to solve, and lore to collect in a Codex - and all are accessed from a hub area known as The Crossroads, which includes puzzles and extra missions of its own. The Crossroads (overseen by The Caretaker) also connects to the Lighthouse, which in turn serves as the player's base of operations during The Veilgaurd - and it's here they'll have one-on-one chats with companions, who each have their own rooms to decorate as the story unfolds.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Rivain" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vgokq8jNbgs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Companions also have specific exploration abilities they'll utilise out in the world, giving players new ways to interact with their surroundings. You might, for instance, "come across some ancient Elven artifacts for Bellara to Tinker with while you wander through Arlathan." And if you don't have the right companion with you when you make a new discovery, that's not an issue - players can use the Lyrium Dagger to take advantage of their exploration abilities, even when they're back at the Lighthouse.
</p>
<p>
As for The Veilguard's new photo mode, details of that come <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dragon-age-the-veilguards-photo-mode-mass-effects-15-exclusive-screenshots">via IGN</a>. It features a free-roaming camera with tilt, focal length, and lens distortion options, as well as the ability to hide player characters, their party, enemies, even NPCs - all to get the perfect shot. Additionally, it comes with depth of field, auto focus, distance, f-stop, vignette, bloom, saturation, brightness, and contrast settings.
</p>
<p>
And that, then, is your latest blob of Dragon Age: The Veilguard news. Expect the drip-feed to continue as the game's Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC release on 31st October approaches.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I'm standing in the Skywatch area of the Cosmodrome, Old Russia, in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, with a few other random players, and we're waiting for enemies to spawn. A Hive Tomb ship appears in the sky right over my head and drops off exactly two enemies, and I blast away at them with a machine gun. The other players sprint over, swooping in like hawks, but I manage to snag the two kills before they can, so they jump back onto rooftops and boulders to wait for the next batch of baddies and try again. A lot of long, boring seconds pass before any more enemies spawn and we all repeat the scramble.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm shooting these particular fish in this particular barrel because it's a requirement to unlock the Legend title, a social marker of in-game achievements that appears beneath your name. Another player getting a kill means I don't, so we're all competing against each other to spend the least amount of time here. Developer Bungie added this title to the game in honor of the 10th anniversary of the original Destiny, and the objective I'm working on is a joking nod to the early days of that game. We have to kill a bunch of enemies in the Skywatch and loot "engrams," or weapon/armor drops, from them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366042-destiny2skywatch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366042-destiny2skywatch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366042"></a><figcaption>Hello Darkness, my old friend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366042-destiny2skywatch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">See, back when Destiny launched in 2014, the grind to increase your level and reach the requirements for its endgame content--the Vault of Glass raid--was awful. After a certain point, your strength was determined by the stats on your gear, so you were always chasing weapons and armor with higher levels. Gear was dolled out stingily; you could get it from playing Strike missions, but only in unpredictable fits and starts, and from random drops when you killed aliens. But the gear was never guaranteed to be <em>better</em> than what you already had.</p><p dir="ltr">Then players discovered the Loot Cave, a spot in the Cosmodrome's Skywatch where enemies would spawn almost endlessly if you killed them fast enough. So we all stood on a rock in the Skywatch, which was the correct distance from the cave to keep from interfering with the spawn rates, and just shot into the crowd. Engrams would drop randomly, but there were so many enemies that this increased the drop rate from annoyingly rare to stupidly bountiful. This was still incredibly boring, but it was at least more efficient than playing the same few Strikes over and over and getting nothing for your efforts.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in today's Skywatch, I'm standing on a rock and waiting for enemies to appear, which they do in greater or lesser numbers, for about half an hour. In that time, exactly <em>one</em> engram drops. I grab it, hoping I'm done with this uninspired callback to the worst of Destiny, and check my progress: 7%. I need another 13 engrams.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366000-20240909133908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366000-20240909133908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366000"></a><figcaption>Standing around for hours to make a number go up slightly is pretty true to the original Destiny experience.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366000-20240909133908_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em>Yup</em>, I think. <em>This feels like Destiny.</em></p><p dir="ltr">If you told me this Skywatch objective was a straight-up troll on the Destiny community for the Loot Cave, I'd believe you. Contemplating the hours I'd have to spend to complete this, I could see it being a brilliant prank, if it seemed like there was a punch line in there somewhere. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-grasp-of-avarice-dungeon-is-hilariously-salty-about-a-7-year-old-exploit/1100-6499082/">Bungie already made this joke in a funnier and more clever way with the Grasp of Avarice dungeon</a> during the studio's 30th Anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">Much more likely, however, is that the engram drop rate is just a stupid oversight that turns something fun into something disappointing--and since <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1833655242820587864" rel="nofollow ">Bungie says it'll tweak enemy density in the Skywatch</a>, it seems that's the case. Something fun turning out to be something disappointing is in keeping with the rest of Destiny's 10-year anniversary, though.</p><p dir="ltr">There's next to nothing on offer to mark Destiny's 10th year, in fact. On September 9, the actual anniversary of Destiny's launch, Bungie added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-cayde-stash-guide-how-to-get-the-destiny-anniversary-armor/2900-5757/">five secret chests you could uncover in the Pale Heart of the Traveler location</a>, all of which are barely hidden, and which give you a set of armor inspired by looks from the original game's concept art. And there's the aforementioned title, which you can unlock by completing a few objectives that recall the original game in some slightly nostalgic ways, but mostly just include wearing the armor and playing some activities--the Skywatch objective is by far the most arduous, and sooner or later, that'll see a fix. Titles are most interesting when they're tough to earn or require you to do novel things to get them, but the Legend title is so easy to nab (again, hours of boredom notwithstanding) that it's doubtful anyone would ever bother using it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364142-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_locations_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364142" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364142-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_locations_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364142"></a><figcaption>This is about all there is to the Destiny anniversary inside Destiny 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364142-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_locations_compressed_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Earning the title does come with a sort of celebratory reward--like with the 30th Anniversary, a much bigger in-game event that celebrated the studio with lots of stuff to play and earn, you get the opportunity to preorder a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-ace-of-spades-hand-cannon-has-been-nerfed-but-not-that-way/1100-6526386/">limited-edition Destiny Nerf gun</a>, which is, admittedly, pretty cool (although <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833851336607101076" rel="nofollow ">an artist accused Bungie on Twitter/X</a> of stealing their design for a physical version of the in-game weapon, created some nine years ago). Disclosure: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-banter-this-week-in-destiny-2-i-cannot-wait-to-buy-this-stupid-huge-gjallarhorn-nerf-gun/1100-6505078/" data-ref-id="1100-6505078">I bought the Nerf Gjallarhorn</a> last time this happened, and regret nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's nothing to buy in the in-game Eververse store; there are no in-game events commemorating the moment; and there is very little reason to care, overall.</p><p dir="ltr">That feels incredibly weird. It's true that this is the anniversary of <em>Destiny</em> and not <em>Destiny 2</em>, the game we're playing now, but in the ways that matter most, the distinction really just comes down to the number on the box--overall, the whole thing is, truly, just Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">What's more, we just saw the culmination of the Light and Darkness Saga, the story that first began on September 9, 2014, with what might have been the best hunk of Destiny content Bungie has made. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a>, Destiny 2 felt like it was finally achieving what Bungie had always wanted Destiny to be--combining fun shooter fundamentals with a strange and fascinating world easy to get lost in, populated by interesting characters and telling emotional stories.</p><p dir="ltr">This should be Bungie's victory lap. Instead, people seem to be wandering out of the stadium and heading to their cars.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366041-destiny-2-the-final-shape-bu-2560x1440.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366041" data-ratio="0.5605738575983" data-width="1882" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366041-destiny-2-the-final-shape-bu-2560x1440.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366041"></a><figcaption>Destiny developers delivered exactly what they promised and a lot more with The Final Shape.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366041-destiny-2-the-final-shape-bu-2560x1440.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Back when Bungie first announced the game, it did so citing a 10-year journey for players, and at the time, that seemed a bit ludicrous. But here we are, taking the final steps, and the journey has been, in a lot of ways, pretty incredible. You don't have to be a fan or player to acknowledge that, in terms of longevity, popularity, development, and influence, Destiny is in a category occupied by few others. It has invented and reinvented itself again and again, evolving toward what was envisioned from the start over the course of a decade, and repeatedly dodging the accusation of being a "dead game." Its success has had an outsized effect on the larger gaming industry--often for the worse, as happens when corporations chase trends--and continues to show what can be exciting about the concept of a "live game."</p><p dir="ltr">And truly, there just aren't that many instances of a decade-long legacy like what's happened with Destiny. There are other MMOs in this club, certainly, and multiplayer games like Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike 2. It doesn't take long before you're talking about series and franchises, though, brand names attached to games and sequels releasing for years. The Destiny 10th anniversary, despite its semantic weirdness of including a technical sequel, is still a rare accomplishment.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet despite the studio and the community taking a decade-long journey together, there's almost nothing to commemorate it. I'm standing in the Skywatch, shooting two enemies per minute, trying to unlock a title I'll never use because it feels like it was thrown together at the last second and indicative of nothing about my time spent with this game. Disclosure: I won't be buying the Nerf gun this time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366043-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_gear_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366043" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366043-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_gear_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366043"></a><figcaption>You can also get the Nerf look for your in-game Ace of Spades.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366043-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_gear_compressed_004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It doesn't seem much of a stretch to speculate as to why Destiny's 10th anniversary feels slapdash. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">Bungie cut around 220 people in July</a>, less than two months after releasing The Final Shape. That round of layoffs included a bunch of key talent, ranging from longtime executives to members of the writing staff who had helped to grow Destiny 2 into something that felt like more than just another live game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-touts-bigger-vision-for-destiny-2s-final-shape-but-doesnt-confirm-delay/1100-6518871/">Bungie had fired around 100 people</a> less than a year before in November as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Really, what's there to celebrate? Player counts are down following The Final Shape, somewhat more than the usual ebb following the high of an expansion, and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the" rel="nofollow ">The Final Shape reportedly sold less well than Lightfall</a>, the expansion before it. After purchasing Bungie for $3.6 billion in 2022, Sony seems primed to make further changes or cuts to the studio going forward. What seemed like a bright future for the Destiny franchise less than two years ago now is much, much darker, despite Bungie laying out a loose look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/">next year-plus of Destiny 2</a> in a series of blog posts dropped this past Monday alongside the in-game update.</p><p dir="ltr">A lackluster, barely acknowledged anniversary is what happens when you lay off a huge chunk of your team, right at the height of your game franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Every time I talk about the original Destiny, I feel honor-bound to loudly admit that I didn't much like it, and to discuss how much that position changed over time. As Bungie found the stride in Destiny and Destiny 2, ironing out its worst, most grindy instincts, cutting the time-wasting busywork, and leaning into the unique, fun strangeness of what it had created, I liked it more and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366044-2024_final_shape_launch_press_kit_characters_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366044" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366044-2024_final_shape_launch_press_kit_characters_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366044"></a><figcaption>The Final Shape feels like what Destiny was always trying to be.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366044-2024_final_shape_launch_press_kit_characters_compressed_004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yes, Destiny still often encompasses the many issues of live-service forever games, defined by the need to keep players on an endless treadmill of upward mobility so they'll spend a few bucks on microtransactions, but it also encompasses the best ideas, too. It could tell fascinating stories that took advantage of its sprawling world and deep lore. It was often immersive and fantastical in ways few other games could be. It showered us with inventive challenges of gameplay and teamwork that I haven't seen matched in any other game. Destiny started as something interesting, but it <em>became </em>something notable, and often laudable, in the medium of games.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two more episodes of content coming to Destiny 2 and expansions planned through 2025, so despite the massive chilling effect yet more layoffs have had on the Destiny community and Bungie itself, it's premature to say that there is no future for Destiny. But it's 10 years on, and I'm standing in the Skywatch, waiting for enemies to spawn, wondering if the future of Destiny will look much different from the past.</p>

        <p>Insider testing starts this week.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/11/new-xbox-friends-and-followers-experience/">announced</a> it's bringing friend requests back to Xbox after more than a decade, with its new "friends and followers experience" set to go live for Insiders this week.
</p>
<p>
Xbox hasn't had friend requests since 2013, when - as part of its transition from Xbox 360 to Xbox One - Microsoft introduced a social-media-style system making it possible to follow activity feeds without the need for explicit approval. If the other party reciprocates, a follower becomes a friend, so both can chat, message, and game.
</p>
<p>
Soon, though, Xbox will introduce a more traditional "two-way, invite-approved" friend request system that Microsoft says will give users "more control and flexibility". This'll sit alongside the existing "one-way" follower system, so users can still easily follow player, club, or game feeds.
</p>

<p>
Once the change comes into effect, friend requests can be sent, accepted, or deleted from the Xbox guide's People tab - and all existing friends and followers will update automatically when the system goes live, their status remaining unchanged.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's updated friend system will also be accompanied by new privacy and notification settings, giving players the tools (available both on-machine and online) to set notifications and determine who can send them friend requests or follow their account.
</p>
<p>
All this will initially launch for Alpha Skip-Ahead users on Xbox consoles, plus PC Gaming preview members on Windows PCs and handheld devices, "beginning this week". It'll then be rolled out to everyone once testing is complete. "We want to thank all the Xbox Insiders for the feedback you share with us," Microsoft adds. "Your feedback is a key part of our process."

            <p>Post-apocalyptic roguelike Neo Scavenger is one of my favourite games, but its spacefaring followup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ostranauts">Ostranauts</a>, currently in Early Access, is currently too fiddly and complicated for me. Here's some good news, then: Kitfox, masters of making impenetrable roguelikes more welcoming, have joined the project as publisher ahead of a planned 1.0 release in 2025.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ostranauts is a "hardcore noir space-sim", in which you scavenge shipwrecks in order to expand and customise your own ship. Every system onboard your vessel can be interacted with via its own panel of buttons and displays, and it's all but inevitable that you will die due to your own incompetence or carelessness. The only hope is that the death is interesting.
</p>
<p>I badly want to create a captain, hire a crew, build a ship, and go die in space, but as soon as I see a UI with 18 buttons on it, and have no immediate idea what they do, I'm out. Even if, beyond those quality-of-life issues, Nate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ostranauts-is-a-very-ambitious-space-game-but-i-think-its-going-to-work">had plenty of kind words for Ostranauts around its initial launch</a>.
</p>
<p>Hopefully Kitfox can help. They're the publisher behind the recent Steam release of Dwarf Fortress, who helped take that game from ASCII art and obtuse keyboard controls to something much friendlier, without compromising the spirit or depth of the simulation. They're also currently working on the 1.0 release of Caves Of Qud, due later this year, which is a similarly inscrutable roguelike that has been in development for fifteen years.
</p>
<p>Or maybe this is just wishful thinking on my part. Ostranauts is already more visual and legible than both Dwarf Fortress and Caves Of Qud, and there's no specific mention of work to make the game graspable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1022980/view/4584188879515294936">in the announcement of the partnership with Kitfox</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, I'm looking forward to giving Ostranauts another go with its full release. Neo Scavenger is truly brilliant: a roguelike set in a handcrafted world where you're as likely to die from eating the wrong mushrooms as from a hard-scrabble fist fight with an alien. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-combat-2014-neo-scavenger">has the best combat of any game released in 2014</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve loved it since the days of its alpha tests and I still love it now, in the form of <em>Destiny 2</em>.

My Warlock, who has stood with me since September 9, 2014, is currently donning a look that has felt annoyingly out of reach for ten years—he looks like I pictured him as a bright-eyed teenager.</p><p>Additionally, Bungie has added a new title to be earned in the game to complement the occasion. Players who finish a few perfectly reasonable tasks (and one bothersome one) can equip the Legend moniker. I’m not a Title hunter, having only earned a single one in the past, but considering the ease of it and my love for <em>Destiny</em>, I’ve begun to chip away at it. By the weekend, I should already have it. I’ll have fulfilled the first game’s tagline all these years later: “Become legend.”<br></p><p>The tasks that need to be completed to earn the Legend title are, predictably, nostalgic. For one of them, you have to fight enemies and grind for loot engrams in the Skywatch area of the Cosmodrome, the first ever destination in <em>Destiny</em>. It’s a place I know like the back of my hand after grinding away in my youth, and it’s a place I rarely visit in <em>Destiny 2</em>, which is filled to the brim with more exciting locales with ongoing stories. By comparison, the Cosmodrome feels like a snapshot frozen in time. When I jump in there, I’m suddenly back in my high school uniform and running home after last period to get back to the game that would go on to consume my life for a decade. It’s nice being back.<br></p><p>As I queued up the weekly Nightfall strike (a mission designed to be enjoyed with a full fireteam that is otherwise made harder with modifiers) the location read “Cosmodrome,” and I began racking my brain to determine which level it could possibly be. Eventually, a soft pang hit me as the realization dawned on me that I’d be revisiting the Devil’s Lair, <em>Destiny</em>’s first strike, in a move that would be a hell of a coincidence if it wasn’t definitely purposeful. Completing the Devil’s Lair back in TK was the moment where <em>Destiny </em>clicked for me— we’ve been inseparable since. I know every last beat of that mission to the point where I coast through it on autopilot, and as I ran it for the first time this week, all the while still in my <em>D1</em>-inspired anniversary armor, I felt the magnitude of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305">decade-long history and relationship with the game</a></span> crash over my body. I didn’t sob, but I did tear up. It’s been such a long ride and I can’t believe we’re still here, ten years later, running the Devil’s Lair ad nauseam.<br></p><p>It all takes me back to a time when it felt like <em>Destiny </em>had a million things to prove, and I believed in its ability to do so. I had nothing to go on but Bungie’s pedigree at the time, and as a kid, I ate that shit up. That feels significantly harder to do given the increasingly precarious position Bungie finds itself in these days and the tide having turned against live-service games like <em>Destiny 2</em>. I keep hoping against hope that it can weather the storm, if only because despite everything, <em>Destiny </em>still means the world to me. I don’t know that I’d be lost without it, but I also can’t quite picture my life or career without it.<br></p><p>As <em>Destiny 2 </em>stares down the barrel of another few <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-content-packs-no-expansions-bungie-layoffs-1851611360&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-content-packs-no-expansions-bungie-layoffs-1851611360">uncertain years</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541">reinvents itself and its formula once again</a></span>, I’m just glad to have been here at all, to have fallen for the first game’s mystique, to have plumbed the depths of the moon’s hellmouth. to have defeated countless Hive royalty and gods, avenged characters who have transcended their simplistic caricatures, befriended once enemies, explored and wielded the darkness, and made countless memories with cherished friends along the way. And to have played a small part in this wild, inscrutable, and highly inconsistent ride. This journey began ten years ago in this little pocket of Old Russia, and look where we’ve gone since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the cool features introduced with the Hero Talent tree is for hunters, which introduces the Dark Ranger Hero Talent tree that lets us live out our wildest Sylvannas Windrunner fantasy.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-recommend-id="image://1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alternative Hero Talent trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alternative Hero Talent trees." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-recommend-id="image://1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alternative Hero Talent trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The number of Hero Talent specs to choose from will depend on what class you play. For example, Demon Hunters will only be able to choose from Aldrachi Reaver and Fel-Scarred, while Druids will have Druid of the Claw, Elune’s Chosen, Keeper of the Grove, and Wildstalker to choose from.<br></p><p>With that said, most of the classes have two trees to choose from as they would for their main specialization. It is also worth noting that each of these Hero talent trees are only available for certain specs. Let’s take the Druid as an example once again: Feral and Restoration Druids have the Wildstalker Hero Talent tree as an option, while Balance and Guardian Druids have access to the Elune’s Chosen tree. This is all dependent on your current main specialization, so you will not have access to all four Hero trees as a Restoration Druid.</p><figure id="" data-id="2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-recommend-id="image://2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main ability in Hero Talents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The main ability in Hero Talents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-recommend-id="image://2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main ability in Hero Talents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each Hero Talent tree builds on abilities you currently have in your toolkit, but will also start with a new Keystone talent that can be either a new ability or based on an ability you already have.

                <p>Kyoto's Nintendo Museum is getting a special Pokémon-themed manhole cover featuring Pikachu. The manhole cover's design features the electrified rodent leaping out of a GameBoy, with pixels shooting outward in his wake.</p><p>Nintendo showed off the surprising new choice in street decor <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/08152616-4fb5-4338-8dc4-55b34debb6d5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via an official blog post</a>, giving prospective museum-goers a closer look at the design. Pikachu isn't the only character from the franchise to get a special themed manhole cover, however--a whole collection of them have been popping up in various Japanese cities, featuring other Pokémon, like Golem and Vulpix. Nintendo has even released <a href="https://local.pokemon.jp/en/manhole/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a map showing the location of each manhole cover</a>--referring to them as "Poké Lids"--along with a bit of an explanation for why they exist to begin with.</p><p>"Poké Lids, artistic covers for utility holes, have recently started to be spotted in some cities," reads the Poké Lid site's description. "Who knows if they are of Pokémonopolistic nature? It seems that not all utility holes are man-made; rumor has it that Diglett may be responsible for digging large enough holes to be mistaken for utility holes, and some artists took it upon themselves to “mark” the covers to differentiate them from ordinary ones. Where will the next 'mark' be?"</p><p>The Poké Lids are likely meant to function as quirky promotional advertising for the Nintendo Museum, which officially opens on October 2 in Kyoto, Japan. The museum sits on a property once known as <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210602.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Ogura Plant</a>, where Nintendo previously manufactured trading cards, along with offering repair services for consoles. </p><p>Nintendo fans got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-museum-will-complete-construction-in-march-2024/1100-6517725/">their first good look at the museum</a> during a September 2023 Nintendo Direct, during which it was stated that the museum would feature a "wide variety of products from Nintendo's history"--manholes included, apparently.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-should-try-a-chinese-fountain-pen.978477/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/chinese-fountain-pen-hongdian-jinhao-asvine-delike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is no experience quite like writing with a good fountain pen. Holding one in your hand makes you want to write huge amounts of&nbsp; big flowery script.&nbsp; Fountain pens are refillable, allow you to use an array of gorgeous ink, can often be customized, and will last longer than you will if properly maintained. But like many niche hobbies, pens can be a sinkhole people compulsively dump money into, particularly on the high end. And like many niche hobbies, that ecosystem has been upended by new, competitive companies from China, often (but not always) creating stylistic clones of existing pens. The clones have gotten progressively better over the years to the point where they sometimes match or even improve on the pen they are duping for a fraction of the price.&nbsp;</p><p>Before diving into Chinese pens, it should first be acknowledged that you do not need to spend a ton of money on a good fountain pen. Vendors like <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jet Pens</a> and <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goulet Pens</a> have pens at every price point you could want. German pens like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Perkeo-Fountain-Pens/ct/4319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaweco Perkeo</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/3402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pens/ct/1185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LAMY Safari</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br_0vpp6ev8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reliable</a> and affordable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1QAGbfMPoM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginner</a> fountain pens. Muji makes a fantastic metal fountain pen. The Kaweco Sport in particular is a perfect pen to throw in your bag without worrying about it breaking, and I’m quite fond of the sturdy brass and aluminum variants. Patronizing a local pen and stationary store can be a rewarding experience, allowing you to try out many models and inks to find one that truly speaks to you. Unfortunately, with some exceptions like Jinhao, many Chinese pens just were not available to me through a local pen store. Many of the new vendors' pens can only be purchased in the West on Amazon, Etsy, Ebay and Aliexpress (or Taobao and Alibaba if you do a little leg work).</p><figure><figcaption>If you just want a tested, reliable, affordable fountain pen, the LAMY Safari rocks! Credit: <a href="https://us-shop.lamy.com/en_us/lamy-safari" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LAMY</a></figcaption></figure><p>When looking up reviews of Chinese fountain pens on YouTube and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/eh1zmv/chinese_fountain_pen_guide_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, I kept hearing one refrain: these pens were shockingly good for the price. Brands like Jinhao, Hongdian, Delike, WingSung, Asvine, and PenBBs all have great offerings at an affordable price point.&nbsp; Sometimes those pens are an original design, but often they are thinly veiled duplicates or copies or remixes of popular, existing pens. Many of the copies are not exact, and some of the pens being copied are decades old. Not all affordable Chinese pens have perfect quality control, but this is also largely true for expensive pens from legacy brands. Some people are conflicted on this either ethically or from the perspective of simple manners, but the fact of the matter is these pens are shockingly good, and they’re here to stay.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Should Pilot Be Scared - New Majohn A1 Retractable Nib Fountain Pen" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDgkIhKcTwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Doodlebud is one of the best YouTubers reviewing these pens as well as many others.</figcaption></figure></div><p>You can spend an entire article just going over Chinese pens and the pens they bear a striking similarity to. r/fountainpens on reddit maintains not just a list of solid<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/eh1zmv/chinese_fountain_pen_guide_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Chinese fountain pens</a>, but also a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/oo9kqo/chinese_fountain_pen_guide_2021_part_1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> two part</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/oo9llo/chinese_fountain_pens_2021_part_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide to them</a>. I spent weeks digging through YouTube to see side by sides of countless models. There’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BGUGQe9RC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn X1 vs. Montblanc Boheme</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psX10uaBwfk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wingsung 699 vs. the Pilot Custom 823</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mUGzXevUSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jinhao Centennial vs. the Parker Duofold Centennial</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdsCCf9hW0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jinhao X159 vs. the Montblanc 149</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4TYP3fUqfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn A1/A2/A3 vs. the Pilot Vanishing Point</a>. It should be pointed out that not all Chinese pens are clones, and almost none of the clones are pretending to be the original but merely aping the style – a minor but meaningful distinction. Furthermore, stylistically cloning a pen is not uncommon or new; one needs only compare the <a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/139576-montblanc-146-vs-sailor-1911-full-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sailor 1911 to the Montblanc 146</a>. That said, some of the clones are so close, parts can be used interchangeably from the originals.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="2022 Jinhao x159 Unboxing and Review vs Montblanc 149" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NzdsCCf9hW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A Jinhao vs Montblanc comparison.</figcaption></figure></div><h4>Diving in&nbsp;</h4><p>When I started looking into the deep rabbit hole of Chinese pens, I wanted to start with something familiar. My favorite ballpoint/mechanical pencil is the german-made <a href="https://www.rotring.com/pens-pencils/ballpoint-pens/rotring-600-ballpoint-pen/SAP_2114261.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rOtring 600</a>, a sturdy metal design with a grippy, aggressive knurling that resembles an X-ACTO knife more than a writing implement. Eventually I stumbled upon the Hongdian 1861, often called the “Black Forest” or “Dark Blue Forest” depending on the color. The 1861 “Forest” series is loved by a lot of people: a sleek industrial design that bears a resemblance to the Otto Hutt Design 04. Hongdian was relatively unknown as a brand until a few years ago, but the Black Forest is also one of the top selling pens on Amazon, with more than 26,000 largely positive reviews as of this writing. Reddit reactions are glowing, although some people have complained that the finish on the pen wears a little over time. It retails somewhat on the higher end for Chinese pens, roughly $17 (although it apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stNZSpyx43M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used to be far less expensive</a>) and comes in a dizzying array of colors, including a garish iridescent color that looks like a gravity knife you’d buy at a rural gas station. I bought the Dark Blue Forest with a matching blue nib.</p><figure><figcaption>The Hongdian "Forest" line comes in many colors. Pictured, the Black Forest and Dark Blue Forest.</figcaption></figure><p>The pen’s popularity is justified. The 1861 is sturdy but not overly heavy, writes beautifully, and does not feel like it is going to spill ink over the inside of my bag. The knurling is actually quite smooth, only slightly grippy. The cap slides off instead of twists off&nbsp; and makes a satisfying pop when removed from the far end of the pen. It’s unobtrusive and thin enough to slip in the rings of a spiral notebook. It’s a pen that punches well above its weight, as does the Hongdian M2. There are better pens out there, but you could buy a Black Forest and not buy another pen for a very long time.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was now hooked, and had a thinly-veiled justification of writing this article.</p><figure><figcaption>The gang's all here. From left to right: the Majohn Wancai Mini V2, 2 Jinhao Sharks, The Hongdian Dark Blue Forest, The Majohn A2, The Asvine V200 and the Jinhao 82. Half have been given away to friends.</figcaption></figure><p>After the Blue Forest, I went on a pen shopping spree on Aliexpress. There was the titanium <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_4NKKc967c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asvine V200</a>, a weighty “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrator_pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstrator</a>” pen that a friend said “looked like it came out of <em>Resident Evil.</em>” There was the inexpensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKw_G1H0zDA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn Wancai Mini V2</a>, one of the smallest pens I have ever seen. There was also the <a href="https://youtu.be/0q3W74S7btQ?si=-0JETEyKlb3Y4NMi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jinhao 82</a>, which bore a striking resemblance to the Sailor Pro Gear Slim as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/ejkgcegEzzE?si=L3SnT-9VUBcD3TeU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn A2</a> (about $16-$17), which looked very similar to the iconic Pilot Vanishing Point ($168) – a pen that clicks like a ballpoint. There was also the Majohn/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7bA45ybCpY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delike Hunyuan</a>, a clean, weighty and industrial metal pen that comes in either smooth brass or black knurling. I got the black variant, have filled it with red ink, and refer to it as my “evil” pen. I bought a couple of Jinhao Sharks, very inexpensive pens that I have given away to friends already. And lastly, I purchased a <a href="https://youtu.be/6TV7WF_GlYQ?si=TBg2KtRZ1T70hHSZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hongdian M2</a> – one of the most beautiful pens I have ever used.</p><figure><figcaption>This is my "Evil" pen, the Majohn/Delike Hunyuan. It needs a clip desperately because it rolls around a lot.</figcaption></figure><p>What strangers on the internet had said was true: All the pens performed beautifully and were worth more than what I paid for them. Everyone who gets these pens seems to love them, but who makes them? Where do they come from?</p><h4>Untangling the world of Chinese Pens</h4><p>Chinese fountain pen brands are much harder to nail down than other companies. A few appear to be based in Shanghai, with the Shanghai Hero Pen Company being one of the oldest and most storied. Hero even apparently attempted a collaboration with the storied <a href="https://frankunderwater.com/2017/02/20/remaking-parker-45-a-cooperation-between-hero-parker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American brand Parker back in the late 70s</a>. Jinhao has also been around for a while, and they make a lot of pens that run the gamut in cost, quality and complexity. The aforementioned Jinhao Shark is a beloved pen within the pen community because it is cheap, plastic, writes fairly well, and looks like a shark (the injection point for the cap looks like a belly button). You can hand them out to a stranger as a gift and think nothing of it. It won’t win any awards for reliability, but it’s roughly 2 to 4 dollars so you can buy them in bulk if you want to test out a bunch of inks or easily gift them to someone to potentially spark a love of fountain pens. Jinhao also has a similar model shaped like a swan where the bird's bill adorably forms a little clip.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Everyone loves the Jinhao Shark, and its lesser known friend the Jinhao Swan. Credit: Jinhao.</figcaption></figure><p>I tried contacting every Chinese pen brand I could within reason. The company that owns the Jinhao brand, Shanghai Qiangu Stationery Co., was easy to contact, and they provided me with a catalog of their offerings (both the Jinhao brand, as well as a sub-brand Baoer). Further investigations into other Chinese brands got murky, as it became unclear which company produces what brand and who is simply reselling pens made from different companies. To some degree this is understandable, as a newer Chinese brand might simply not have a Western-facing presence on the internet. But there are strange overlaps in what brands sell what, and who sells who, and even people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/124mcy9/seeking_information_on_shanghai_jingdian_fountain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pen forums </a>seem to only have <a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/375932-asvine-and-hongdian/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incomplete information</a>. Many of the brands have stores on Taobao. In the West, PenBBS operates <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PENBBSOfficialStore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly on Etsy</a> and shares a name with a popular <a href="http://penbbs.com/forum.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese pen forum of the same name</a>. Hongdian appears to be the brand of the Lishui Lantian Pen Company, but the email associated with the company did not respond to any inquiries and I was unable to confirm this from them directly.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The German Kaweco Sport is iconic for a reason. Credit: Kaweco.</figcaption></figure><p>What originally had sparked my curiosity about these brands was a years old r/hobbydrama thread about a territorial dispute involving the German brand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/q3wd9v/fountain_pens_kaweco_v_moonman_or_how_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaweco and the Chinese brand Moonnman</a> (now Majohn). According to the thread, the owner of the brand Kaweco, cosmetics company Gutberlet<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_mit_beschr%C3%A4nkter_Haftung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> GmbH</a>, filed a trademark for the brand <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/W01556939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moonman in the EU</a>. The thread goes on to state that Kaweco cited similarities between the Majohn T1 and the Kaweco Sport (a pen that was invented in 1911).&nbsp; Say what you will about Chinese copies, of which there are many blatant examples, but you would never mistake the two pens for each other save for some minor similarities in the cap (<a href="https://tokyoinklings.com/episodes/037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other people in the pen world noted this at the time as well</a>). In the end, Kaweco kinda ended up looking like the dick bullying the new guy. The Shanghai Shanyin Trading Company, which claims to be the producer of the Majohn brand, confirmed this information, although I am still not certain that they are the main producers of the brand based on <a href="https://frankunderwater.com/2017/09/01/the-moonman-m1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conflicting information I have found online</a>.

But many of these pens are their equal and deserve an opportunity to earn a legacy of their own.</p><h4><strong>Inking Up</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>My new go-to, the Hongdian M2. I would love it in other colors.</figcaption></figure><p>After I spent some time with my Chinese pens, I made sure to visit <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoseka Stationery</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. If you’ve never been, it’s a gorgeous store, bustling with pen nerds excited to try out different pens on the weekend. It’s overflowing with beautiful notebooks and countless bottles of ink. Though I already had a bottle of blue <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/pilot-iroshizuku-ink-kon-peki-50-ml-bottle-ink?_pos=3&amp;_sid=f092c412a&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pilot Iroshizuku</a>, I wanted to expand my selection, so I bought a beautiful <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/sailor-shikiori-sakura-mori-ink-20ml-bottle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerald from Sailor</a> and a beautiful red that Yoseka makes called <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/yoseka-ceramics-ink-series-qing-shan-hu-red?_pos=3&amp;_sid=98466ef3f&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Qing Shan Hu</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting in line to buy the ink, I told some people that I was writing an article on Chinese pens. I showed my bounty of weird Aliexpress pens. One woman I talked to mentioned she was aware of Jinhao, particularly everyone’s favorite Shark, but was taken aback at how well the Dark Blue Forest performed. I had expected a bit of apprehension on the topic of clones and copies, but pen enthusiasts are fairly easygoing and love an excuse to try a new pen out, particularly when it’s well made. They all agreed – these were good pens.</p><p>I have spent far too much time over the last month thinking about pens, and have more questions than I do strong convictions. To what degree does originality in design matter relative to craftsmanship? Is imitation an unforgivable crime, or a natural progression that most companies go through as they develop their own style? And how much does any of this matter if it gets a new person to step in the door of a stationary store and reignite a love of writing by hand? Isn’t an affordable pen that gets someone into the hobby, like the Jinhao Shark, ultimately a good thing for the fountain pen world?</p><p>Of the pens that I have bought, I think the most about the Hongdian M2. Though the M2 has a vaguely similar form factor to the Kaweco Sport, its shape is different –&nbsp; round instead of faceted. The M2 is a beautiful pen: pocketable and sturdy with a solid nib, in muted iphone-like aluminum tones for about 20 bucks. I get the sense that I could carry it with me forever, and there’s a nonzero chance I will. Maybe one day I’ll lose it on the train, or maybe I’ll give it to a friend as a gift. At the current price, there’s little harm in giving it away.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Hongdian M2 comes in several muted colors, and at least one bright one. Credit: Hongdian.</figcaption></figure><p>The M2 feels a step above a clone or a slight revision; it feels like something new. I gravitated towards it as well as the Dark Blue Forest and the evil-looking Delike Hunyuan for that reason. I am certain these new brands are good enough to stand on their own, to be exhibited in a beautiful and bustling stationary store instead of being relegated to countless nameless sellers on Aliexpress, Amazon and eBay. I want to see what new designs they come up with, instead of simply recreating pens from 100 years ago. The world has gotten bigger, the winds are changing, and the world of pens is no different.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> have gotten some disappointing news. The official <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series, which was announced in 2019, has been quietly canceled. This news didn't come from an official press release but from one of the series' own voice actors.</p>

<p>The news of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series cancelation came from an interview <a href="https://collider.com/magic-the-gathering-netflix-series-cancelled/">by Collider</a> at this year's Toronto Independent Film Festival.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandon-routh-scott-pilgrim-screenshot.jpg?itok=8GYv-Ips 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandon-routh-scott-pilgrim-screenshot.jpg?itok=XaVYoEnC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Collider's own Steve Weintraub was interviewing Brandon Routh (<em>Superman Returns</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em></a>) for his upcoming horror comedy movie, <em>Ick</em>. Weintraub asked Routh about the status of the series since it was slated for a 2022 release. Routh's response was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm not sure. I did do a voice for it. As far as I understand, nobody's put out a press release about it, but apparently it's not happening. That's kind of old news. I'm not sure why it's surfacing again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Routh was set to voice the planeswalker Gideon Jura in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series. The series has gone through multiple producers, editors and creatives, including the Russo Brothers (<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>), Jose Melina (<em>Firefly</em>) and Bryan Cogman (<em>Game of Thrones</em>).</p>
<p>Despite being fully written and having voices fully recorded, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series was shelved alongside other animated Netflix projects. These included animated adaptations of the fantasy comic <em>Bone</em> and an animated <em>Gorillaz</em> movie directed by Jamie Hewlett.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-eye-samurai-mizu-artwork.jpg?itok=IBaK6gVr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-eye-samurai-mizu-artwork.jpg?itok=6fuDYS7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In retrospect, Netflix's shelving of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> animated series is short-sighted. Recently, one of their original animated shows, the stylized historical action revenge series <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, <a href="https://www.emmys.com/shows/blue-eye-samurai">won several Emmys</a> for Outstanding Individual Achievement, Sound Editing and for Outstanding Animated Program.</p>
<p>Given the scope of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, it is a ripe setting for stories. Larger-than-life stories of heroes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-eldritch-moon-spoilers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">monsters</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/duskmourn-house-of-horror-revealed-at-magiccon-amsterdamhttps://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ghosts</a>, eldritch horrors, angels, demons, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interdimensional threats</a> are all present and plentiful.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there has been no official statement from Netflix regarding the status of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> animated series.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow will see the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a>'s Realms Rebuilt update, which hopes to revive the ailing Early Access gaslamp survival craft 'em up. It's aiming to do that with a new handcrafted campaign, which now sits alongside the procedural worlds already present, along with new weapons, spells, boss battles, dungeons and much more, as the developers outlined yesterday in a new blog post.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The core questline of Nightingale has been completely recreated thanks to the incredible feedback we’ve received from the community," starts <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4585315413747208446">the post</a>. "Realmwalkers now embark on a more immersive and substantive quest, as Puck guides players across gravity-torn deserts, corrupted forests, and beyond, on a journey to reignite the ancient Crossway portals. Each of the new Storied Realms has been handcrafted; packed with challenging enemies, ancient discoveries, and all-new puzzles and dungeons."
</p>
<p>The update will lift some of Nightingale's build limits, allowing for the creation of "bigger and more elaborate" constructions. It also includes a new tileset for building with. 
</p>
<p>Players can also now adopt up to 20 pets, an increase on the original release, with several new pets now included. That includes cats, as per the bonnet-wearing chap in the screenshot above.
</p>
<p>There's also claims of an overhauled progression system, clothing customisation, simplified crafting, and UI improvements, according to the post.
</p>
<p>These changes do seem to take aim at many of the elements Ed criticised in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">Nightingale review</a> back in March. He criticised it as "an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind", calling it both confusing and tedious. 
</p>
<p>I'm glad that the developers are attempting to address those issues, although I'm skeptical that it will do much to attract players back to the game. Speaking for RPS, we won't be re-reviewing it before any potential 1.0 release, because there are simply too many games for us to write about them all - and I imagine many players feel similarly about their own precious time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, AMD won’t make you dive into a BIOS to reroute that power. The company’s new Variable Graphics Memory lets you turn up to 75 percent of your system memory into dedicated video RAM, just by tapping a button in AMD’s desktop Adrenalin app.</p><p>It’s only currently available for AMD AI 300 “Strix Point” laptops, and how much RAM you’ll be able to divert depends on your system’s total — <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/maximizing-gaming-performance-on-amd-ryzen-ai-300-series-with/ba-p/704594#:~:text=the%20best%20experience.-,Variable%20Graphics%20Memory,-is%20a%20newly">AMD explains</a> that the “medium” setting will turn a 32GB laptop that came with 512MB of video memory into a 24GB one with 8GB of dedicated VRAM. </p><p>You might be wondering: does that extra video memory actually make a difference? Well, it depends on the game. Some games, like <em>Alan Wake II, </em>require as many as 6GB of VRAM and will throw errors at launch if you’re short — Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go buyers have been tweaking their VRAM settings for some time to take games to the threshold of playability.</p><p>But in early testing with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop">the Asus Zenbook S 16</a>, a Strix Point laptop that’s already shipped with this feature, my colleague Joanna Nelius saw that turning it on isn’t a silver bullet for every game. With 8GB of VRAM, the laptop played <em>Control</em> notably faster (65fps vs. 54fps), but some titles had smaller boosts, no boost, or even slight frame rate decreases.</p><p>Your mileage will vary — but I’m eager to find out if it’s a big boost in particular games!</p><div><p>AMD’s also bringing its Fluid Motion Frames 2 to Strix Point laptops in technical preview today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139440/the-asus-rog-ally-is-getting-amds-fluid-motion-frames-tomorrow">after previously opening it up to desktop GPUs and last-gen notebook GPUs</a>. It increases frame rate by imagining new frames, now with less jitter and lag. </p></div><p>There, AMD says you can get substantial boosts combined with VGM, assuming you’ve got at least 50fps to work with before you apply the frame-generating technique — though AMD doesn’t say whether you’re getting any more frames with AFMF 2 than you did with the original version of the tech. </p><p>The company does claim, though, that if your laptop can already manage 39fps in, say, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, you can now play it at a (theoretically) smooth 66fps on a 2880 x 1800 laptop screen if you combine AFMF2, VGM, and AMD’s FSR upscaling tech.</p><p>In other AMD laptop gaming news, the company’s just announced <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/laptops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7800m.html">the RX 7800M</a>, a new up-to-180W chip that comes with 12GB of dedicated video memory. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-silently-launches-rx-7800m-gpu-mobile-navi-32-with-12gb-of-vram"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em> calls it</a> “essentially a stripped-down RX 7800 XT,” comparing it to the desktop GPU, but it’s also filling a huge hole in AMD’s lineup between the flagship RX 7900M and the RX 7600M XT, as you can see below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been ten long years since Dragon Age: Inquisition, which means the next game in the series - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - likely has some modern design trends to catch up on. Here's one: The Veilguard will be the first game in the series to include a photo mode when it arrives in October.
</p>

<p>IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dragon-age-the-veilguards-photo-mode-mass-effects-15-exclusive-screenshots">has the first details on the photo mode</a>, including a spread of new screenshots.

<p>The photo mode sounds like it's got a large if typical suite of camera features, including: free-roaming camera, focal length, depth of field, auto-focus, F-stop, controls for saturation, brightness and contrast, and the ability to hide the player, party members, enemies or NPCs.
</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is due for release October 31st.
</p>
<p>Optimism seems to be growing around The Veilguard, as I see more and more fans of the series getting excited based on the trailers and streams BioWare have released so far. Edwin saw the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">back in the summer</a> and came away intrigued by its characters and action, even if it's not the full party-based RPG offered by some of the previous games.

While the line-up is different, one truth remains:The debate is torture, but the posting is tremendous.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Because posting through shit on social media is the only way half of us know how to combat the existential dread of watching politicians do nothing for you, the funniest people on the planet spend the debate on their phones spinning a wild web of reactions to help cope. Those jokes often intersect with video games and other subsets of nerd culture. We gathered up a few choice posts for your amusement.</p><p>Some of the most notable joke fodder includes Trump’s quote claiming Harris wants to “do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison,” or his repeating of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/jd-vance-haitian-immigrants/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/politics/jd-vance-haitian-immigrants/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a false story</a></span> that claimed Haitian immigrants are eating people’s pets in Springfield, Ohio. It would be hilariously unhinged if this kind of false rhetoric wasn’t also likely to have real-world ramifications for people just trying to live their lives.

I’d say Trump would decline considering how weird and incoherent he was during this one, but when has that man ever shown an ounce of shame?<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
