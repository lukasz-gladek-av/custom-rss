			<p>Nintendo used to be one of the <strong>most secretive game companies around</strong>, and one of those that took the hardest stance against leakers, giving rise to the long-lasting joke that the <strong>company sends its household ninja warriors </strong>to take care of them. </p>



<p>Over the past few years, however, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">a lot of information </strong><span><strong>about the company's systems and games has leaked online</strong>&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;</span>official announcements, such as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which had been an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">open secret</a></strong> long before its<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/"> official reveal</a></strong> and release last year.</p>



<p>With so many leaks, one may think the Japanese company addressed the issue and <strong>tightened the lid</strong> on its future releases before their announcements, but this doesn't seem to be the case, as <strong>a possible new Nintendo Switch 2 model</strong> may have leaked online, and via one of the company's official websites, no less.</p>



<p>Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dootsky.re"><strong>@dootsky.re</strong></a> confirmed to have discovered <strong>something interesting</strong>. <em>"On Nintendo's Account Portal, there's an unused model code under the name "OSM". (The Switch 2's model code is BEE.)"</em></p>



<p>In addition, the portal has images for every Switch model, and <strong>requesting OSM returns the image of a Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which is confirmed not to be a random placeholder, as trying to get an image for any other combination of strings on the company's web service to generate icons returns an error message.</p>







<p>As the Bluesky user highlighted, <strong>the image for the Nintendo Switch 2 "OSM" model is the same used for the current system</strong>, so it shouldn't be used to speculate about which product OSM will be.</p>



<p>However, it's hard not to think about <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong>, especially in light of what president Shuntaro Furukawa said earlier this month regarding the company's desire to make the system more accessible to people<em> "who pick up their first console when reaching a certain age." </em></p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">current RAM shortages and price spikes</strong> <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">set </span>to&nbsp;affect many<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">tech products,</a></strong> however, it remains to be seen <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much cheaper a Lite model would be</strong>, given that the current Nintendo Switch 2 model's price could increase if the situation doesn't normalize anytime soon.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">'Nintendo has been very "leaky" over the last two years. Maybe they need a plumber?'</em> commented gamerweeb1 on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/potential-new-switch-2-model-osm-discovered-on-nintendos-internal-website.1407796/post-150113233"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ResetERA forums</strong></a>, echoing a common community sentiment with a joke. <span>Hopefully, this leak will amount to something interesting, as most of the company's leaks have in the past few years, or will, at least, make a certain plumber materialize,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-odyssey-unmissable-adventure/" target="_blank"><strong>who has been absent with his 3D adventures for quite a long time.</strong></a></span></p>

            <p>
Capcom have released a new 13 minute <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay showcase, with commentary from director Koshi Nakanishi. About 20% of it is Leon Kennedy kicking zombies in the noggin, doing Wickian dodge-shoots, or chopping torsos with a chainsaw or hatchet (the latter a subweapon that needs periodic resharpening). Another 20% consists of new, stealth-oriented character Grace creeping through ornate chambers in first person; being the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-sitting-in-a-hot-sauna">"cold bath" to Leon's "hot sauna"</a>, she doesn’t have serious fighting skills, but she does have a ‘pinch hitter’ handcannon for those times when skulking behind tableware won’t cut the mustard. There’s talk of a new crafting system, whereby Grace turns zombie blood into a vaccine to stop corpses reanimating.
</p>

<p>
A solid third of the video consists of preorder collectables, GeForce Now promotion, and a much-hyped collaboration with Porsche on the design of Leon’s car. This last bit feels like two marketing teams conspiring to justify each other’s pay rises, and is about as compelling to me as putting go-faster stripes on a jar of mayonnaise. I am, however, quite intrigued by a fleeting mention that Resi 9’s garden-variety shamblers have memories. As Nakanishi puts it, “this time there are zombies that retain characteristics from when they were alive”.

<p>
We catch glimpses of this in the footage, mostly during Grace’s segments, which are more about observation. There’s a custodian who carries on cleaning the facilities, scrubbing mirrors in a frenzy. There’s a butcher with a cleaver who mechanically growls “next” to kitchen staff who have, I assume, long since been disassembled. Some of these mundane routines are tactical opportunities for Grace. There’s a zombie restlessly working a light switch, for example, creating pools of shadow for you to sneak through.
</p><p>
I don’t think this is Resident Evil seriously venturing into the realm of pathos, let alone embracing the prospect of a pacifist playthrough. Let’s not forget Leon and his hatchet. There are plenty of partly or fully sentient named undead characters in Resident Evils gone by, and I’m not sure many of them were ‘sympathetic’, exactly. Maybe you carry a candle for Wesker – good luck with that. Still, Requiem promises to make interactions with the rank-and-file infected a little more emotionally complex. Perhaps you will feel a pang now and then while you’re wiping the offal from your boots.

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Shelter Reality Show Casting Call Unveiled]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-casting-call/</link>
            <guid>1407955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout fans worldwide are preparing to <strong>potentially </strong>step into a real-world vault to live out their post-apocalyptic dreams in the <strong>all-new </strong>Fallout Shelter reality show. The new project was recently unveiled by Prime Video, alongside a casting call for participants. The successful applicants will live with others in a ‘real vault’ and complete challenges to hopefully be the last one left in the shelter.</p>



<p>It looks like Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video plan to make the ‘experiment’ as close to a Vault-Tec test as possible. The casting call stressed that vault dwellers will be tested with ‘escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums.’</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-s-new-reality-show-starts-production-soon">Fallout Shelter’s New Reality Show Starts Production Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Prime Video wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society. Visit this website if you’d like to join Fallout Shelter, a new series full of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website for the casting call</a>, you’ll be hit with all the information you need. </p>



<p>To apply, you must be at least 21 years of age, must hold a valid passport, and will need to be free for three weeks in June 2026 for filming. The casting call form is <strong>huge</strong> and asks for a heck of a lot of information, and it’s there to allow applicants to really sell themselves to Fallout Shelter’s casting team.</p>



<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-adaptation-claim/">it was claimed by</a> an industry insider that Fallout Shelter would be getting a live-action adaptation, but not like the Fallout television series that has been running since April 2024. Instead, it would be getting a ‘reality show’ approach, taking everyday people and throwing them into a vault to complete challenges.</p>



<p>This has materialized as fact, with Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video officially unveiling the project.</p>



<p>Don’t be deterred, but the short trailer for the casting call stresses that ‘Vault-Tec assumes no liability for injury, dismemberment, or decapitation,’ but that’s just a joke… right?</p>



<p>It was said that the show will take on a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast Games’ approach, whittling down the survivors as they’re eliminated one by one. There’s a cash prize for the ultimate victor, but it hasn’t been made clear yet how much that will be.</p>



<p>Fallout is exploding once again (no pun intended) as the second season of the award-winning television show started up again in December and is set to run until February 4th. There are claims of Fallout 3 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-coming-claimed/">Fallout: New Vegas remakes</a> on the horizon, and Fallout 76 just got its biggest update <strong>ever</strong>.</p>







<p>Do you want to apply for the Fallout Shelter reality show? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you think you’d win!</p>

            <p>Amazon Games has announced that New World, its MMORPG first released in 2021, will shut down on the 31st January 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">This comes a few months after the developer "gutted" a vast number of staff late last year</a>.</p>
<p>When those cuts were first announced, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world">it was revealed on the New World website</a> that its 10th season 'Nighthaven' would be its last. Now, it turns out that season will be extended until the servers are shut down. The game has been pulled from storefronts, so only those who already own the game can continue playing into next year.</p>
<p>The statement also features a farewell from the remaining New World team, which reads: "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</p>

<p>"It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p><p>In response to this news however, a potential sprinkle of hope from COO of Facepunch Alistair McFarlane. Known as the studio behind Rust, the UK-based developer has built itself a solid foundation in the tumultuous games industry. Solid enough, it seems, to allow McFarlane to offer an eye-watering amount for the ill-fated MMO.</p>
<p>"25m, final offer" McFarlane <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011890710468071708">posted on Twitter</a> in response to the news last night. He'd follow this up with "Games should never die", indicating this to be a genuine offer (Eurogamer has contacted Facepunch to confirm).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy figure in the world of buying video game rights also popped their head up, with <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011991595273572406">Simon Collins-Laflamme of Hypixel Games writing</a>: "If you need tips about buying cancelled games, lmk". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">Laflamme bought Hytale back from Riot Games last year</a>, releasing it this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">to monumental success</a>.</p>

<p>A new leak reveals that the LEGO Zelda 2026 set is LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time; check out the price, release date, and other details below. </p>



<p>For those unaware, LEGO had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new The Legend of Zelda set late last year, with a release date window set for 2026. It seems that the Nintendo partnership is growing faster than ever, with the Great Deku Tree set in 2024, LEGO Mario in 2025, and the recently revealed LEGO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-reveals-first-five-pokemon-sets-releasing-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon sets</a> for 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-the-legend-of-zelda-the-final-battle-ocarina-of-time-set-reportedly-releasing-in-march-2026">LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time Set Reportedly Releasing in March 2026</h2>



<p>A new leak on the Brick Tap <a href="https://discord.gg/wgcCpdMk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> reveals that the next set will feature LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time. The reported pricing for this set is $129.99/€119.99/£99.99. The set will feature 1003 pieces, which include Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf minifigures. It will also include Navi the Fairy, brick-built Ganon, the Megaton Hammer, and Recovery Hearts. The new LEGO Zelda set will seemingly release on March 1, 2026. </p>



<p>The previous LEGO Zelda collaboration brought the Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set, featuring versions from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. It featured two mini-figures of Link, along with Young Link and Princess Zelda. The set featured 2500 pieces and was priced at $299. </p>

            <p>The recently teased Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> Lego set has leaked.</p>
<p>According to a Brick Tap source, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-legos-next-the-legend-of-zelda-set-will-be-based-on-ocarina-of-time">upcoming Zelda set</a> will be known as The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time, and depict, well, the final battle from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>On the box, we can see the chunky porcine Ganon standing tall and wielding his dual blades, while Link gets ready to strike down on the beast with his Master Sword. The titular Princess Zelda, meanwhile, is standing to one side, and has a Lego-fied beam of light emitting from her hands.</p>

<p>According to the leak, which was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">shared on reddit</a> earlier this morning, Lego's The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time set will comprise 1003 pieces, and retail for £100 here in the UK.</p>
<p>Along with Link, Zelda and Ganondorf (as in, in his Gerudo chief form), the set will also include a Navi model, as well as - of course - a brick built model of the boar-like Ganon, which in personal opinion looks rather magnificent.</p><p>Should this leak be accurate, we can also expect to see the game's Megaton Hammer and a number of recovery hearts to also be included on the set's release. As for when that will be, the source said we are looking at a 1st March debut, which is actually quite soon.</p>

<p>This of course isn't Lego's only collaboration with Nintendo. Earlier this week, the two companies unveiled their previously announced Pokémon sets, which include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after these particular sets went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-really-want-those-pokemon-lego-kanto-region-badges-you-can-expect-to-pay-over-100-on-ebay-thanks-to-scalpers">resale sites such as eBay became awash with the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection</a>, which was only available via Lego as a free gift for those that pre-ordered the most expensive set from the collection, the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/dreams-of-another-review/</link>
            <guid>1407940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Dreams of Another is just about the most confounding game I have ever played. There is no creation without destruction, says the game, so you use an assault rifle to shoot the world back together from the clouds of bubbles around you. Meanwhile, you’re following the footsteps of a mole who dies once you get there, picking up random engagement rings or other stuff off the floor to give to a soldier who can’t shoot a gun, who tends to reward you with some grenades. Every detail from every angle in this game is weird. Listen, I’m King Weird – I reviewed and enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/29/blippo-review/">Blippo+</a> in the last few months – but this? This has gone straight through weird and come out the other side – into bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dreams of Another - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zA1z-_pgZso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ll start with the visuals. Striking in both positive and negative ways, the clouds of bubbles coming together as you shoot them is undeniably very pretty. Unsurprisingly, this is what initially drew me to the game, that and the whole “no creation without destruction” ethos. I mean, what’s not to like about marvelling at pretty visuals whilst a slightly artsy and heady narrative plays out. Plus, it’s made by Pixeljunk, who have made some exceptional games throughout the years, incredibly playable and unique masterpieces like Pixeljunks Eden and Shooter, so no doubt they would get some interesting ideas here. But, the problem is, there aren’t any beyond that first thought. </p>


<p>You shoot clouds of bubbles, it takes shape as an object, a building, a fence, whatever. Then you do it again. &nbsp;It’s not just the environment that needs to be fixed. It’s also people, so everyone you speak to is also made out of little floating particles which means two things: one, they don’t look convincingly person-like, and; two, means you can pass your gun through them when you’re in VR and they warp around it, which is fun for a minute or so.</p>


<p>Sure, there’s floating, spiky balls of white that fly around and, if you shoot those enough, they’ll break and restore the environment around them. But, they move around at random seemingly, usually away from things I need restoring, so I’m better off using one of the 18 grenades I’m carrying. Occasionally there’s something a bit different, like a ferris wheel comes loose and you shoot the cars, one by one, to stop it, or a circle (?) rolls around on the floor but otherwise behaves exactly like a spiky white ball. The only way of interacting with anything in this game other than shooting/grenading it, is talking to it. </p>
<p>People will tell you their secrets or desires, or why they’re here, or explain about moles or something, something that usually means very little to you because you don’t know how it’s relevant. At all. Objects will tell you about their experience being objects, you’ll stand there and blink confusedly, then you move on to more wall shooting. Since you spend all your time reconstituting the environments with your gun, the wonder you initially felt at everything taking shape doesn’t make it past the first 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Now, I could forgive the light or poorly considered gameplay if there was an engaging narrative, but the way Dreams of Another progresses is completely unbelievable. You spend the first couple of hours not only shooting environments back together, but repeatedly shooting the same environments back together over and over again. There is a scene with moles climbing a wall in a sewer that I think I saw five separate times, and I had to shoot it all back together each time and sit there whilst they climbed the wall again. </p>
<p>When a scene ends, all the particles float upwards, which looks pretty cool the first time, but quickly becomes a joke as you complete scenes that are twenty seconds long with two lines of dialogue you’ve already heard in a place you’ve been to before. And it often cuts back to the main menu so you can see a person lying in a bed and select the option to continue. This menu changes depending how far into the game you are, which is presumably why it cuts back to it so you can see it, but it’s incredibly clumsy and happens so often that by the time something significant enough to matter has changed on the menu, you’ve probably clicked back into the game before you notice. Assuming you haven’t already just turned it off.</p>

<p>Dreams of Another is the least narratively accessible game I’ve ever played. It takes an hour or so for a hint of a thread connecting the scenes you’re sitting through, and the entire time it feels like the opening minutes of a game where you don’t have a clue what’s happening yet. On top of that, it’s also the least immersive game you could play, with scenes ending by melting upwards abruptly, the constant cuts to the menu, and some of the worst voice acting you have ever experienced. I don’t know, sometimes it sounds like they’re trying to speak slowly like they’re in a surreal dream, but some of them, including the very first voice you hear, just don’t work whatsoever.</p>
<p>Maybe you could play in VR, that’s more immersive right? No, you’ve fallen for my rhetorical trick! Instead, you have cutscenes play out in a window in front of you, though at least they’re in 3D even though they warp when you move your head around. You also get some pretty poor controls as well, with you picking things up by walking over them and interaction generally being fiddly. The gun has 100 rounds in a mag, unlimited ammo, and automatically reloads itself when empty with no input from you whether you’re in VR or not, unless you want to reload early. It may as well be a wizard staff.</p>

			<p>Japanese developer <strong>Cygames</strong>, known mainly for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/granblue-fantasy-relink-sold-2-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Granblue Fantasy</a></strong>, <strong>Shadowverse</strong>, and <strong>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</strong> franchises, has recently faced significant backlash from several of its otherwise staunch fans over the establishment of a subsidiary, <strong>Cygames AI Studio</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced last week</a>, Cygames AI Studio is a new division whose purpose is to pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. The company's goal is to build a '<strong>unique creative cycle</strong>' that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity. The announcement also mentioned that, with this new AI ​​Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being a company that '<strong>creates the best content</strong>.' As mentioned above, the news wasn't taken kindly by many of the studio's usual supporters. Now, the developer <a href="https://x.com/Cygames_EN/status/2011423481712517537?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has shared a public letter of apology</a> in which it vowed that <strong>no genAI assets have been used in their games</strong>, and that <strong>genAI wouldn't be implemented at all in their games</strong> without prior notice.</p>



<p><em>To all our Cygames fans and supporters, </em></p>



<p><em>Over the past few days, we've received numerous comments expressing anger and disappointment from many of you. This was because we released a simplified announcement in Japanese concerning the founding of Cygames AI Studio, Inc., without addressing any of the current problems and social debates surrounding generative AI. We sincerely apologize for the concern we've caused.</em></p>



<p><em>We would like to take this opportunity to state that art produced from genAI isn't used in our products. Furthermore, we won't implement genAI into our products without prior notice. We hold in the highest regard those who love games, as well as the dignity, passion, and heart of the creators and artists who act as the architects of gaming culture. The art for all current Cygames games and other products is crafted from the technical know-how and manual work of our many staff members.</em></p>



<p><em>Once again, we deeply apologize for causing our beloved fans much grief and anxiety. We at Cygames will continue to honor creators, as well as champion the free expression of people, and, in doing so, will continue to strive to be the best in entertainment. Thank you for your continued support.</em></p>



<p>The Japanese developer is only the latest to become embroiled in controversy over genAI. The most famous case recently was undoubtedly <strong>Larian</strong>'s: when studio founder and CEO <strong>Swen Vincke</strong> mentioned in an interview that they had been experimenting with genAI to quickly develop concept art and write placeholder text <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while working on the new <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>, a massive backlash ensued, forcing Vincke and Larian as a whole to first say that <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'a lot had been lost in translation'</a> and then, last week, to <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backtrack on any usage of genAI</a> to make concept art or even placeholder text for the upcoming game.</p>



<p>No doubt, more controversies within the industry are on the way, given the polarizing subject. On which side are you on? Speak your mind in the comments.</p>

            <p>After the undeniable success of its live-action adaptation, Amazon Prime Video has announced a reality television show based on the Fallout games.</p>
<p>The show itself is known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, and will see contestants living inside a vault set within a "high-stakes world", with those taking part competing for a "huge" cash prize.</p>

<p>"Set inside Vault-Tec's bomb-proof vaults, Fallout Shelter drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games' signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling," reads Fallout Shelter's official logline.</p>
<p>The show itself will present competitors with "a series of escalating challenges", as well as "strategic dilemmas" and some "moral crossroads" to navigate. I mean, of course! And, as this show is based on Fallout, these challenges and games will all have some kind of focus on the franchise's core SPECIAL attributes. That's strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck.</p>

<p>Those taking part will need to demonstrate "ingenuity, teamwork and resilience" to guarantee themselves not just safety, but power as well. Oh, and there is also that aforementioned cash prize at the end of it all (which after Christmas and a cascade of birthdays on this end, I wouldn't say no to right now).</p><p>Fallout Shelter will run for 10 episodes, <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a> reports, with <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting open now</a> for those over 21. Casting will close on 15th February. "Do you have what it takes to be the most SPECIAL?" the casting crew asks. Well, do you?</p>

<p>Fallout has seen quite a resurgence in popularity since Amazon's TV adaptation made its debut in 2024. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">games got a player boost with the arrival of season one</a>, a trend that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">continued with the current run of season two</a>. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming for Fallout's third season is currently expected to begin in May</a>. As for other potential Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cf9fa91b7c2eb"><a title="Zelda" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cf9fa91b7c2eb/zelda.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, LEGO</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-new-zelda-lego-set-rumour-links-it-to-fan-favourite-entry">after some rumours</a>, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-teases-a-new-lego-legend-of-zelda-set-possibly-including-ganon">teased a new <strong>Legend of Zelda</strong>-themed Lego set</a> coming in 2026.</p>
<p>Now that we're in the new year, it seems this set might have actually leaked ahead of the official reveal. As the rumours suggested, it appears to be a diorama based on the "final battle" between Link, Zelda and Ganondorf in the N64 hit, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>According to this latest scoop (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">via r/Legoleak</a>), it's officially titled '77093 The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time' and will contain 1003 pieces and the three Minifigs. Additionally, Zelda fans will also apparently get Navi the fairy, a "brick-built" version of Ganon, the Megaton Hammer and some recovery hearts.</p>
<p>This set is supposedly priced at $129.99 and is said to be launching on 1st March 2026. Here's the first proper look:</p>

<p>This build would follow the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/lego-the-legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-2-in-1-a-superb-debut-with-one-minor-irritation">Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 set</a> which arrived in 2024 for $299.99 and contained 2500 pieces. This year also happens to mark the 40th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> series, so plenty of announcements are expected.</p>
<p>This follows the official reveal of three <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> Lego sets earlier this week. These are scheduled to launch on Pokémon Day.</p>

And most importantly, we were truly grateful to see in the CBT survey that the majority of participating Star Guardians responded that they intend to continue playing after the game’s official launch.</p><p>In addition, many of you shared positive impressions across our core content, including the graphics, story, and combat.</p><p>In particular, you gave us very positive feedback for the game’s faithful recreation of the original anime, the enjoyment of open-world exploration, the story presentation that deepens immersion in the world of Britannia, and the distinctive dynamism of tag-based <a title="Genres > Action [3,329 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, noting that these elements exceeded your expectations.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Alongside the positive feedback, we were also able to identify a wide range of suggestions from those who hope to see the game continue to improve. Beyond the feedback you shared through the community and surveys, we have also been closely observing Star Guardians’ gameplay firsthand at various demo events, carefully reviewing where any points of friction may remain.</p><p>As we reviewed your feedback, we closely examined the moments during combat and exploration where you hesitated or repeatedly experienced discomfort, as well as instances where controls did not respond as intended. Based on the points where your feedback aligned with what we observed through actual gameplay, we conducted an internal review.</p><p>As a result, we have summarized the key areas for improvement that were most consistently identified through the CBT as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Controls</strong> – Feedback that character handling felt somewhat unresponsive, and that movement and targeting were inconvenient.</li><li><strong>Combat System</strong> – Feedback that the difficulty felt excessive, and that combat tempo and skill response speed were too slow.</li><li><strong>User Interface / User <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Feedback that the menu structure was complex, making it difficult to find desired features intuitively.</li></ul><p>As these points were raised by many Star Guardians, we focused our internal review and discussions on the areas outlined above and potential paths for improvement.</p><p>While some areas could be addressed relatively quickly, we concluded that many others would require more than simple numerical adjustments. They called for a broader reexamination of the game’s overall structure and improvements at the system level.</p><p>As a result, our development team spent a great deal of time considering the balance between ‘releasing the game according to the originally planned schedule’ and ‘delivering a more complete experience through meaningful improvements’.</p><p>In the end, we determined that fundamentally addressing the issues we had identified was the most important priority. In order to meet the expectations of our Star Guardians, we have made the decision to adjust the official launch schedule to March.</p><p>We sincerely apologize for not being able to meet you as promised in January. That said, we will continue to give our utmost effort throughout these additional two months to ensure that this time becomes a period of preparation through which we can deliver a higher level of quality in return.</p></blockquote><p>A more in-depth overview of the key improvements Netmarble plans to make can be read seen in the newly published “<a href="https://7origin.netmarble.com/en/news/3/59" target="_blank">Developer Notes #5</a>” on the game’s official website.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-delayed-to-march]]></content:encoded>

<p>Including updates to resolution and load times</p>

<p>Nintendo launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on the Switch 2 this week, and some video comparisons have now popped up online.</p>
<p>One of these has been shared by the <a href="https://youtu.be/MUO1BRWZ8wQ?t=24">YouTube channel 'ElAnalistaDeBits'</a>, which not only presents a side-by-side visual comparison of the Switch 2 Edition next to the existing Switch release, but also shows other improvements such as the game's loading times.</p>
<p>As Nintendo has previously noted, the Switch 2 Edition is "4K" in docked mode. As for handheld, it's 1080p (so everything looks nice and "sharp"), and both versions of the game run at a consistent 30fps. There's also a demonstration of the improved load times. Similar to the resolution bump, you may or may not notice the difference when you're playing the game.</p>
<p>In this particular video demo, you can see in one example, on Switch 2, how it takes eight seconds to get from the title screen to the game, while the Switch version takes around 17 seconds. In another test, loading from the system home menu to actual gameplay takes 16 seconds on the Switch 2 and about 30 seconds on the original system.</p>
<p>We've also shared our thoughts about the Switch 2 version's resolution, frame rate and load times, so if you haven't already read our review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">be sure to check it out</a>. Nintendo previously highlighted the Switch 2 Edition's "enhanced resolution" in the original announcement trailer.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/raising-my-daddy-rank-at-a-london-gyoza-bar</link>
            <guid>1407856</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="504b9ee386419"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/504b9ee386419/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>My gaming life can now be cleanly split into two sections: the period before I had heard the phrase "Daddy Rank", and the period after it.</p>
<p>It's one of the key features of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> that Sega was kind enough to show me at a fancy gyoza-joint-turned-preview space in London this week, and in the days since, I haven't stopped muttering it to myself whenever I do a small piece of housework.</p>
<p>Kiryu's Daddy Rank is the bread and butter of Kiwami 3's new 'Life at Morning Glory' side content — an expansion on the 2009 original's opening locale, where the ex-Tojo Clan tough guy swaps his knuckledusters for a pair of marigolds and cracks on with some chores around his self-made orphanage.</p>
<p>Yakuza is a series renowned for its constant flip-flopping between serious and silly, dark and delightful, and it always plays best to me when it leans into the latter of the two camps and embraces the brooding protagonist's softer side. Life at Morning Glory is about exactly that.</p>
<h2>What's the story, Morning Glory?</h2>
<p>The children need help with a series of tasks, and it's up to the Daddy of Dojima (as I will now <em>insist</em> on calling him) to come to the rescue.</p>
<p>In my preview, I sped through a multiple-choice questionnaire to assist young Ayako with her science homework, followed the lines of a sewing minigame to knock up a new dustcloth for Taichi, farmed and planted crops in the garden, then chopped, mixed, and scum-skimmed them into a curry for Koji's dinner.</p>

<p>At the end of each task, Kiryu holds up his handiwork (a test paper/piece of fabric/steaming plate) and smiles directly into the camera in much the same way that your avatar might in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> after catching a fish. In the game world, this is all a process of improving Kiryu's bond with each child and working out where he stands as a father figure; in the real world, it's a chance to play some super sweet minigames, then smile as a big green Daddy Rank bar ticks up the screen with each success.</p>
<p>The preview was hosted entirely on PS5, but I can't wait to take this silly little side mission on the go with me on Switch 2. It's just a taxi ride away from the open streets of Ryukyu and Kamurocho, too, so you just know that I'm going to be putting off all the brutal murders, clan wars, and shady deals to beat my stitching record back on the beaches of Okinawa.</p>
<h2>From Daddy to Baddy</h2>
<p>While I'm on the open streets, let's touch on some Baddie Battles. No, much like Daddy Rank, I'm not making this up. In another of Kiwami 3's fresh storylines, Kiryu becomes the surprise chairman of the Haisai Girls, an all-female biker gang that's engaged in a turf war with the larger-than-life Tokyo Night Terrors.</p>
<p>A lot of this 'Bad Boy Dragon' gameplay circulates around massive squad battles between the two teams, where you can put either Kiryu's classic Dragon of Dojima fighting style or the snappy new weapon-focused Ryukyu style to the test. It's also about team management. You can save people in peril on the streets of Okinawa and recruit them to your biker squad, each bringing their own skills to the baddie lineup — be that powerful attacks, rallying cries or healing abilities. Then, before diving into a head-to-head against another clan, you choose which characters will make up your squad, balancing their quirks to suit the situation.</p>

<p>In short, it's the crew recruitment system from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_pirate_yakuza_in_hawaii">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> transposed onto a biker gang, but that's no bad thing! I was informed that you can also customise Kiryu and his crew with snazzy uniforms, bike designs and banners, but I never got to see these tools in the preview — which is probably for the best, because I can guarantee that it would have gobbled up <em>all my time</em>.</p>
<p>When I wasn't recruiting baddies, the streets of Downtown Ryukyu were expectedly packed with distractions — karaoke, arcades, golf, bowling, you know the drill. There's also side missions galore, bounties to be hunted, and the chance to head back over to Morning Glory and stay on top of that aforementioned Daddy Rank. I'm not obsessed, I promise.</p>
<p>It all looks and plays wonderfully on PS5, and given how impressed I've been by the three Yakuza titles available on Switch 2 already (gosh, Sega really has been churning them out, huh?), I'd be surprised if this entry is any different. Yakuza 3 is often viewed as one of the lesser titles in the series, so seeing the whole affair brought to RGG's slick Dragon Engine with some nips, tucks, and new fighting styles, pushes this one excitingly close to the territory of being an entirely new game rather than a standard remake.</p>
<h2>Tying things up</h2>
<p>Oh yes, speaking of an "entirely new game", I should probably touch on Dark Ties, too. This came right at the end of my preview, and I've left it to the end here, too, because it felt like the addition I already knew the most about. Sega has been showcasing this prologue story starring the base game's antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, for a good few months now (our sister site, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/its-mines-time-to-shine-in-yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Push Square</a>, went hands-on with it back in September), and, shockingly, it feels like more Yakuza.</p>
<p>Mine's athletic moveset is a lot of fun — a special attack that lets you jump kick off one opponent's chest, flinging yourself into an aerial attack on another, is a particular highlight — and the underground Hell's Arena fight club gave me a good chance to see it in action.</p>

<p>Other than that, it was business as usual on the streets of Kamurocho. The Kanda Damage Control side content peppered the open world with tasks for me to complete and up my 'Kanda Rank' in the process (it's all 'Ranks' in this game) by improving Tsuyoshi Kanda's street cred, but it all felt very Yakuza-y otherwise. This is no criticism, mind you; it's always great to have more hot content to dive into.</p>
<p>I left the preview with a belly full of gyoza and the words 'Daddy Rank' still playing on my mind. From what I've seen, this feels like the biggest step up for a 'Kiwami' remake so far, packed with new content, combat styles, and with an entirely new story bolted onto the side.</p>
<p>Does it all still feel a little overwhelming? Of course it does! But come on, we wouldn't have Yakuza any other way.</p>

                <p>It's been three months since the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties/" data-ref-id="5000-696295">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2009 classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-3/" data-ref-id="5000-37569">Yakuza 3</a>. After seeing how gorgeous the game looks and plays smoothly in the Dragon Engine, on top of the newly added Mine Saga "Dark Ties", I've been desperately waiting for more content to be revealed, especially when it comes to Kiryu's island life. Last week, Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio announced some of the new features coming to Yakuza Kiwami 3 that gave me even more hope that this is going to be another awesome Yakuza game, and afterward, I finally got a chance to go into full island dad mode with an extended preview demo that left me even more excited for this remake.</p><p>Unlike all the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games out so far, Yakuza 3 sees Kiryu living a somewhat peaceful life. After the conflict with Omi Alliance in Yakuza 2/Kiwami 2, Kiryu moves to Okinawa to run the Morning Glory Orphanage with his adoptive daughter, Haruka. The first half of the game focuses on his relationship with the kids at the orphanage, watching sunsets with Haruka, and engaging in silly substories as a father figure.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes of Yakuza Kiwami 3 Gameplay | TGS 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Although it would seem like seeing Kiryu let his guard down and go into dad mode would be enjoyable, I found the orphanage content to be pretty disappointing in the original game. Slowly walking around the house felt clunky and outdated even back in 2009, where opening every door welcomed a new loading screen--it got pretty irritating, pretty fast. It was a slog having to interact with each kid, an activity that came with very little reward. I remember finishing the game and wishing there was a better focus on Kiryu's life on the island, considering it's one of the only "wholesome" parts of Kiryu's saga we get to witness.</p><p>While I didn't get to see much of the story in the part of Kiwami 3 that I got to play, I had a blast messing with the newly added "Daddy Rank" and seeing how it changes the ways Kiryu can interact with the kids in the orphanage. That's right, you read that correctly--Yakuza Kiwami 3 now gives players the full dad experience! Hawaiian shirt, silly chores, and cheesy Kiryu puns included. Not only is Yakuza Kiwami 3 packed with more content focused on the orphanage, but Daddy Rank is where you can increase your dad stats through minigames like helping with homework, sewing clothes, cooking meals, playing board games, and completing silly side quests. Having the ability to increase your rank to bond closer with the orphans is a more rewarding experience for the players and feels more meaningful compared to Yakuza 3.</p><p>In our hands-on gameplay, we start out in Chapter 3, where the ultimate dad activities begin. After Kiryu sees Haruka burnt out from doing all the chores around the orphanage, he puts his father foot down and steps in to help her out. Our first challenge is to help Ayako with her homework, which Kiryu is adorably nervous about. The homework minigame is similar to what's in the vocational school in Like a Dragon and Infinite Wealth, where you answer timed multiple-choice questions. This time, it's basic elementary-school science; I had to answer questions about different types of flasks used in science projects. It was oddly intense, but luckily, I had just rewatched Breaking Bad for the third time and managed to pass with a 70% grade. It was mildly embarrassing that I barely made it--even Kiryu broke out in a sweat at the end of the minigame. Let's just say, I am not smarter than a fifth grader.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635333-yakuza-kids.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635333" data-ratio="0.56162361623616" data-width="1355" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635333-yakuza-kids.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635333"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635333-yakuza-kids.png"></figure><p>After helping out with homework, which ended in a very adorable interaction between Kiryu and Ayako, it was time to create a new bag for Taichi in the brand-new sewing minigame. The sewing is a bit intimidating at first; you have to follow the stitch line within a thin path, speeding up to beat the timer while slowing down around tight corners, sort of like a chaotic racing game. Like most of the minigames in Yakuza/Like a Dragon games, the sewing gives off major WarioWare vibes, and Kiryu's signature "serious but silly" competitive nature really shines: ultra concentration face, full shrimp position mode, disappointing grunts at every minor mistake.</p><p>Once the homework and sewing festivities are over, it's time to cook a meal for all the kids. Not only did the developers add more challenges to how the franchise handles cooking at this point--cracking eggs and flipping multiple pans in what feels like a Whac-a-Mole-type game--but you also have your own farm and garden for growing and harvesting food, plus the ability to fish for seafood.</p><p>The little cutscenes in each minigame are so wholesome; you can tell Kiryu really enjoys helping around the house, even if he's terrible at it, because he knows what it's like to grow up in an orphanage. Morning Glory went from having very minor features to play around with to becoming almost a full cozy game in itself. I'm definitely looking forward to spending 90% of my gameplay maxing out my Daddy Rank and becoming the ultimate protective father.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635334-yakuza-city.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635334" data-ratio="0.56351550960118" data-width="1354" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635334-yakuza-city.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635334"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635334-yakuza-city.png"></figure><p>After we got a preview of Kiryu's domesticated life in the orphanage, we moved on to Chapter 4 to bring dad mode to the city.</p><p>We immediately jump into a cutscene in which Kiryu witnesses an all-male gang beating up a group of young women, one of whom ends up with bruises on her ribs. It turns out the male bullies are the Tokyo Night Terrors, a dangerous bike gang from the mainland sent to Okinawa to recruit new members, and the women are members of the Haisai bike gang, a local gang of women who protect the city from dangerous criminals. Of course, Kiryu despises any man who lays a finger on a woman and immediately steps in to fight the Tokyo Night Terrors.</p><p>It was refreshing, and oddly nostalgic, to jump back into Kiryu's original beat-'em-up style of fighting. You can tell that Kiryu is a lot younger and stronger in this game when it comes to fighting; he moves with more agility compared to Like a Dragon Gaiden and has a quicker reaction time. As someone who played through all of Gaiden as a 50-year-old Kiryu, who starts to lose his spunk in battle, this mildly tore at my heartstrings. I'm pretty familiar with his Dragon of Dojima style--I just spam Tiger Drop and throw bikes at everyone, of course--so this time I messed around with the new Ryukyu Style. I had fun trying some of the different movesets and weapons, and I love that it's inspired by Okinawan martial arts. It'll be really cool to see what ridiculous combos I'll come up with in the full release, but let's be honest--I still just want to throw bikes at everyone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635335-yakuza-confront.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635335" data-ratio="0.56213017751479" data-width="1352" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635335-yakuza-confront.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635335"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635335-yakuza-confront.png"></figure><p>After Kiryu beats up the Night Terror members, we head to Chura Bar with the Haisai girls, which is owned by the father of their leader, Tsubasa. The girls feel so safe with Kiryu around, they decide to recruit him to help drive the Night Terror gang out of Okinawa and find other "baddies" to join Haisai. They even named him "Chairman Kiryu", which I'm sure Kiryu felt a bit nostalgic for. Kiryu is now officially part of a girl bike gang, and I'm really looking forward to him going dad mode on the streets in his purple gang suit.</p><p>I spent the rest of my playtime exploring Okinawa and Kamurocho to see what other fun activities I could quickly get into. Yakuza 3 is known to have some of the best side stories in the series, and Kiwami 3 added some really silly ones, such as Kiryu finding a naughty magazine on the beach and hiding it before he gets caught by Haruka. There are a couple "dad" side stories I ran into as well, which seems to become a recurring theme in this remake. Aside from all the essential minigames, like Heaven's Golf, karaoke, and casino and bar games, the developers brought back bowling and added a Sega Game Gear in Kiryu's room that lets you play full-length games.</p><p>Once we were finished with our Kiwami 3 demo, it was time to move on to my most anticipated addition to the remake: Yoshitaka Mine's side story "Dark Ties." The new content focuses on Mine's backstory that leads up to the events in Yakuza Kiwami 3: After Mine loses his business, he seeks to make a name for himself in the criminal underworld by connecting with a Tojo clan member, Tsuyoshi Kanda.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635336-yakuza-fighting.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635336" data-ratio="0.56226971260133" data-width="1357" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635336-yakuza-fighting.png" data-ref-id="1300-4635336"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4635336-yakuza-fighting.png"></figure><p>After the trailer for Dark Ties revealed that it focuses on Mine and Kanda's relationship, many fans, including myself--who played the original Yakuza 3--were concerned about Dark Ties "humanizing" Kanda. He's a considerably vile scumbag of a character and one of the few Yakuza antagonists with zero redeeming qualities, not to mention that he's not even hot.</p><p>Luckily, in Dark Ties, Kanda's horrible reputation is unchanged, which makes Mine's main side quest pretty hilarious. Similar to Kiryu's Daddy Rank for completion points, Mine has "Damage Control," which increases by putting out Kanda's fires and getting more involved with the community through side quests and minigames. The ranks are hilarious, going from "Super Trashy" to "Trashy," and it's quite funny to have Mine clean up and constantly apologize for Kanda's actions. It's also very relieving to know that Kanda is still a garbage human in this game.</p><p>When we played Dark Ties, we started out on Chapter 2 in Kamurocho, where we are first introduced to the Damage Control mechanic and meet Zenba, Kanda's assistant, who gives you assignments to help with your rank. The first task is to investigate the underground fighting club and make your way through "Survival Hell," a maze-like battle arena similar to the underground dungeons in Like a Dragon, where you can use different weapons and hire mercenaries to survive each level. Mine's aerial kicks and "shoot boxing" fighting style are pretty fun when fighting large groups of enemies, as is triggering his "Dark Awakening" against bigger enemies and bosses.</p><div

and unlocking the underground fight club, it was time for me to roam around the city to find other ways to increase my rank. We had very limited time in Dark Ties, so I figured anything connected to the story wouldn't be revealed yet, but engaging in typical Yakuza minigames as Mine is pretty funny. Hitting a strike in bowling and completing favors for civilians as our beloved emo antagonist is already pretty hilarious, but inviting Kanda to join is even more entertaining. I invited Kanda to duet in "Bakamitai", but it just ends up being Mine singing while Kanda yells at him. I can't wait to see what other shenanigans Mine is forced into to cover for Kanda and how their relationship develops before their final interaction in Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p><p>I'm very happy that Yakuza Kiwami 3 is going to be packed with both silly and heartwarming side content for Kiryu, as he deserves to enjoy the little peace he has in his life. I'm also looking forward to playing as Mine and seeing how all the events will unfold in the final chapters in each game. Thankfully, I don't have to wait all that long. Yakuza Kiwami 3 launches on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch 2, and PC on February 12.</p>

                <p>If you've been hoping for some sweeping balance changes among the Nightfarers in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, then the day has arrived. From Software has released a new Nightreign Version 1.03.2 update that re-balances some of the weaker Nightfarers into more formidable heroes across all consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>As laid out on the official page for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1032" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring</a>, Guardians received a damage negation buff as well as an increase to the Guard Boost ability. Raiders now have faster attacks with the exception of jump attacks of dual-wield attacks. Additionally, Raiders' attack range is extended when using the Ultimate Art "Totem Stela."</p><p>Revenants are getting more attack power when using the Ultimate Art "Immortal March" or the "Summon Spirit" skill. Executors got the most love from this update, with increased attack power, guard boost, stagger damage, and reduced stamina reduction when using the "Cursed Sword" character skill. Executors also received a handful of other buffs as well.</p><p>This update was primarily focused on balance adjustments for Relics, Equipment, Sorcery, and Incantations, as well as a long list of bug fixes that went with them. This is one of the biggest updates Nightreign has received since The Forsaken Hollows DLC launched last month. If you need help navigating the DLC's new characters and new bosses, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows/1100-6536650/" data-ref-id="1100-6536650">guide to starting The Forsaken Hollows</a>.</p><p>You can find the full patch notes for the new update below.</p><h2>Elden Ring Nightreign Patch Notes Version 1.03.2</h2><h2>Balance Adjustments and Feature Updates</h2><h3>Nightfarers Adjustments</h3><h3>Duchess</h3><ul><li>Adjusted the visibility of the phantom when Duchess's skill "Restage" is triggered.</li></ul><h3>Guardian</h3><ul><li>Increased damage negation for physical and various elemental attacks.</li><li>Increased Guard Boost when guarding.</li></ul><h3>Raider</h3><ul><li>Increased the speed of various attacks, except dual-wield and jump attacks, and adjusted the movement distance of some attacks when using weapons of the Greataxes, Great Hammers, or Colossal Weapons categories.</li><li>Added an effect to the passive ability "Fighter's Resolve" that increases attack power for a certain period when HP is significantly reduced.</li><li>Expanded the attack range when activating the Ultimate Art "Totem Stela".</li></ul><h3>Revenant</h3><ul><li>Increased the attack power of the special attacks performed by summoned spirits when the Revenant's Ultimate Art "Immortal March" is triggered with active summoned spirits.</li><li>Increased the attack power and damage negation of spirits summoned through the skill "Summon Spirit" in the Deep of Night mode, scaling with the depth level of Expeditions.</li></ul><h3>Executor</h3><ul><li>Increased the attack power of critical hits while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Increased the Guard Boost while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Increased the stagger damage upon successful deflection while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Reduced the stamina reduction upon successful deflection while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Running out of stamina after a successful deflection no longer result in a guard break while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Changed the specifications to apply the effects of "Improved Skill Attack Power" and "Improved Melee Attack Power" to weapon arts while the “Cursed Sword” Character Skill is active.</li><li>Increased the power of attacks - except for "Roar" - while the Ultimate Art: “Aspects of the Crucible: Beast” is active.</li><li>Increased damage negation when performing the L2(PS5) /LT (Xbox) / Q (Steam) skill attack while the Ultimate Art: "Aspects of the Crucible” transformation is active, and added a short window where it is not possible to become critically wounded even if your HP reaches zero.

            <title><![CDATA[Mario’s Voice Actor Debunks ‘Weird Online Narrative’ About Nintendo Directs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marios-voice-actor-debunks-weird-online-narrative-about-nintendo-directs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mario’s modern-day voice actor, Kevin Afghani, debunks a rumor about his involvement with Nintendo before taking on the role of voicing several iconic Nintendo characters. He’s also discussing what it means to him to carry on the legacy of Mario, Luigi, and others.</p>



<p>Kevin Afghani began voicing Mario and Luigi with the 2023 release of Super Mario Bros. Wonder on the Nintendo Switch. He also voices the nefarious Wario. He replaced the retired Charles Martinet, the legendary voice actor who had voiced the characters for decades. However, he recently stated that, despite an online narrative, he had never worked for Nintendo before 2023. Specifically, he denied ever narrating the Nintendo Direct presentations.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll give you one. I was never in Nintendo Direct,” he told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>. There’s this weird narrative online I was in Nintendo Directs, I narrated Nintendo Directs. I never worked for Nintendo before being Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-kevin-afghani-has-nothing-but-respect-for-the-og-mario-charles-martinet">Kevin Afghani Has Nothing But Respect For The OG Mario, Charles Martinet</h2>



<p>Discussing his fandom that led him to this dream role, he says he’s living his dream, but he has nothing but respect for the man who came before him, and in his mind, Charles Martinet is Mario.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, IS Mario. He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy,” he said. “I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kevin Afghani will be back in the roles of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in the upcoming Mario Tennis Fever game, set to release in February 2026 on the Nintendo Switch 2.

<p>Ubisoft says its recent upload of the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag soundtrack to Ubisoft Music’s YouTube account was due to technical issues with some of its videos.</p>



<p>On January 14, 2026, the Ubisoft music account on YouTube uploaded 18 songs from the Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag soundtrack. Naturally, the move excited fans and sparked speculation that the game developer may be preparing to announce the much-anticipated remake of the 2013 game, dubbed Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag Resynced.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has now commented on the uploads, stating in <a href="https://t.co/WYPZTZZtZW">a community post on their music YouTube channel</a> that the songs were re-uploaded due to technical issues with some of their prior videos.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In January 2024, it was first reported that a remake of the game was in development. Insider Gaming later confirmed that the Remake, codenamed Obsidian, was on track to be released before April of this year. Sources familiar with the situation originally said that marketing for the release was scheduled to begin this month, with the release set for March.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I'm gonna need a second opinion.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Capcom is holding a Resident Evil Showcase event set to feature "brand new gameplay and news" for Resident Evil Requiem, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The showcase is taking place at 2pm PT, 5pm ET, and 10pm UK, with a post-show discussion stream to follow, though it's unclear exactly what that will be about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Reqiuem is just a few weeks away, and we've already seen quite a bit of it, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-finally-confirms-leon-s-kennedy-is-in-resident-evil-requiem-the-game-awards-2025-ign">long-awaited reveal of Leon S. Kennedy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna">who is apparently going to be playable as well</a>, and what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-reveals-bustling-city-location-in-a-what-looks-like-a-huge-departure-for-the-survival-horror-series">seems to be a tease of an open world</a>...or at least a pretty big shift in how the series has historically treated its settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that the showcase itself is over, it turns out it was actually...pretty thin as far as new information. It was entirely related to Resident Evil: Requiem, and almost fully focused on stuff you can buy in connection with the game. Here's a quick rundown of the five big takeaways from the showcase today:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-6-28-screenshot-1768516637347.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Resident Evil: Requiem's Difficulty Settings</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Requiem will have at least three different difficulty settings, and one in particular seems pretty cool. There's a Casual mode for those who just want to focus on the story, and it comes with an aim assist. And there's a Standard mode, which is just what it sounds like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the really neat one is Standard (Classic) difficulty, which is the Standard difficulty but with an added challenge, where Grace will need to collect ink ribbons for typewriters in order to save her game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-5-38-screenshot-1768516607693.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Bloody It Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A new game mechanic was revealed today related to the crafting system. In RE: Requiem, a number of items are only craftable using infected blood, which is obtained by killing zombies. Though Grace isn't much of a fighter, she does have a gun on her (appropriately called Requiem) that she uses to get out of tight jams, and she'll need to use it to take down zombies so she can get their blood and craft more useful survival tools.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-8-30-screenshot-1768516563208.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">There's a Lot of Stuff You Can Buy, If You Want</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A surprising amount of today's showcase was dedicated to stuff you can buy in real-life that ties in with the game. There's a watch collaboration with Hamilton for two different watches, one for Grace and one for Leon, that they'll wear in-game, and only 2,000 of each watch are being made for sale. There's the amiibo, which we already knew about, and a special Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller themed around Requiem. There are special Resident Evil orchestra concerts coming, and obviously, the Deluxe Edition of the game and all its bonus content. And Capcom is releasing figurines of both Grace and Leon. If you're interested in buying any of that stuff, it's all easy enough to find, but this section of the video really did feel a bit shopping channel given the circumstances.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">These Zombies Are...Different</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There's something different about the zombies in Resident Evil: Requiem. Rather than just violent and lurching, some of them seem to have other personality traits, and have carried over characteristics from their lives before. For instance, one custodian zombie continues to clean the building even after being turned. There's another man frantically pushing elevator buttons. And at the end of the trailer, there's one that straight up talks to Grace. Like, seems to be holding a normal, smooth, human conversation. What's going on here? Is this a different virus than the usual one? Mysteries!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/resident-evil-showcase-january-15-2026-14-29-screenshot-1768516505500.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Elpis</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What? Pipis? No, you said Elpis? Okay, sure. At the end of the showcase, there was a mention of some sort of "secret" Leon is carrying, referencing something called "elpis." We have...no idea what that is! We know now that it's potentially related to the murder of Grace's mother, Alyssa, and we can maybe guess that it's connected in some way to that zombie bite mark fans keep seeing on Leon in trailers. But this is another mystery that will need further investigation. Or, as Leon S. Kennedy put it in the trailer, a second opinion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil: Requiem is coming to Xbox, PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
