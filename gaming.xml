			<p>11 bit studios <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has revealed</a> its new revised roadmap for Frostpunk 2, a game that was released in September last year. Since it was released, it has been a huge success, with the developers saying that it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">profitable three days</a> after its release, with sales topping 350,000 by that point. Since then, the team has been hard at work on updating the game, adding improvements and fixes to the game, while working on some of the upcoming major updates that would be added.</p>
<p>11 bit studios did initially release a roadmap in November, where it was announced that there would be a free update, as well as console ports in the future. Since then, the studio has released a revised roadmap, which can be seen on Steam. In the roadmap, those interested can get a more accurate timeline as to when the updates and ports will be added to the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>First and foremost, the free major content update will be released on May 8. The text that announces it reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>A day to be remembered: a&nbsp;<strong>Free Major Content Update</strong> that will adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first new Londoners.</em></p>
<p>After the first major update is released for Frostpunk 2, those on consoles can expect to get their hands on the game after waiting just under a year for it. It doesn't have a set release date for console, but the developers have stated that Frostpunk 2 is set to release on console in the Summer. It's set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there is no mention of the game being ported to last-gen consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Whether it will be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 when that console releases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Aside from the free content update and the port of the game to consoles, Frostpunk 2 has a major lineup for 2025 at the very least. The Spectrum DLC is set to release in the Fall, and the developers have left the cryptic message with it that it will "help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one."</p>
<p>After the Spectrum DLC, the Aurora DLC is also slated to release this year, but depending on how the development and porting goes of the first three major highlights of the roadmap, it may end up pushed into 2026.</p>
<p>Looking into next year, there is a third DLC planned for Frostpunk 2, adding even more content to the game. It's not said yet what is planned for either the Aurora DLC or the third DLC, but more information is bound to be released by 11 bit studios in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/remap-recommends-volume-viii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-a-minecraft-server">Patrick Recommends: A <em>Minecraft</em> Server</h2><figure><figcaption><span>That movie really is going to be terrible, isn't it?</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, I said <em>Minecraft</em>, a game released all the way back in 2011, was my second favorite game that year. The reason was my oldest daughter taking an interest in <em>Minecraft</em>, which led to me taking an interest in <em>Minecraft</em>. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-best-video-games-this-year-helped-me-feel-closer-to-people/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Here's what I wrote:</a></p><p><em>"As kids get older, it becomes harder and harder to connect on the same level as them. My oldest is only six years old, and I can already sense that tension at work. [...] With&nbsp;Minecraft, my daughter and I can play in the same world together, and the power balance shifts completely. She is the one in control, the one with more knowledge than me. She’s the one guiding me from one area to the next, telling me what to do and what to build. She’s the one asking me to find this or that resource, to help build a house she’s working on. When I’m asking her to do homework, I’m a parent. When we’re in&nbsp;Minecraft, we’re peers."</em></p><p>The difference between 2022 and 2025 is that my six-year-old is now eight years old. At the time, my youngest was two years old. Today, she's on the verge of turning five years old. (Life goes <em>fast</em>, man.) <em>Minecraft</em>, to its credit, remains borderline indecipherable. You could tell me the UI is exactly the same way it was in 2011 and I'd believe you, with the major change being lots of new monetization. </p><p>(I know that's not the case, and by all accounts Microsoft's been a good steward. But it's wild how strange and arcane <em>Minecraft</em> remains.)</p><p>But another difference between then and now is that <em>Minecraft</em> has now clicked for my youngest. She can fly around the world. She can build things. She has <em>big ideas</em>. It's lead to family <em>Minecraft</em> nights, as we all sit around on the same world, and also prompted my neighbor to set up a private server, where the kids dip and out during the week, then convene on the weekend to talk about what they built. It's super cool. It's like a playground that exists in and out of time and space.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-harmonies">Cado Recommends: <em>Harmonies</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Harmonies</em> is a board game where you take random sets of wooden tokens and arrange miniature landscapes on a hex grid with the goal of creating specific habitats for animals to live in. It’s quick to learn, has gorgeous components, and yet the random elements make for a devilishly delicious puzzle each time. Every turn you choose a set of three random tiles from a central pool. You can arrange these tiles however you’d like onto your board, with some tiles (like rocks) allowing you to stack them for better points at the end of the game. One rock makes a small hill but three rocks stacked on top of each other makes a large mountain, and that mountain is worth six more points than the hill!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also take an Animal card during your turn. Animal cards have specific arrangements of tiles on them that, when created, will score you extra points at the end of the game. You score these points by placing a small animal cube on the corresponding tile when you’ve completed the arrangement on the animal card to represent that these animals have moved into that habitat.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the wonderful puzzle of <em>Harmonies </em>is then trying your best to maximize how many animals you can house at once. Once a cube is placed on a tile you can’t place further cubes or stack any more tiles on that space. Those two stacked rocks that make a medium hill are now stuck as a medium hill, but the monkey that moved into that space will hopefully make up the difference in points by the end of the game. At least you hope.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>These monkeys and fish are bad neighbors</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main tension in the game comes from the fact that Animal cards all require you to place the same animal cube <em>multiple</em> times for the most points. The first monkey that moves into my hill by the river only gets me five points, but if I do that twice I’m gaining 11 instead. But now, that hill won’t be able to grow into a mountain, and my fish wants to live in a river next to a mountain, not some dinky medium hill!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beautiful Natural Harmony</span></figcaption></figure><p>The beautiful moments come when you find two animals that love to be neighbors. These sting rays want to live in a river next to two small hills...but they only lock the river in. You can build their habitat and <em>then </em>continue to stack rocks to attract those monkeys later! It’s in finding these small harmonies (<em>haha</em>) between different animals where the game really sings, that “hell yes” moment of realizing a perfect turn of tiles and animal cards that scratch my brain’s puzzle solving centers just so. The wooden habitat tiles add that extra tactile “oomph” that a good board game needs, and the whimsical illustrations on the animal cards make each draw of the animal pile a new visual delight.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It's really a perfect storm for a game this simple, and one of the reasons I picked it up after playing it just twice at a local board game meetup. The fact that it also allows for a solo game that is just as engaging as the multiplayer mode means that I can easily play a game in 15 minutes on my own and feel satisfied with my time. </p><p>Who wouldn't want to make a home for these adorable animals to live in? Have you <em>seen</em> those ducks? Delightful.</p>

The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>. While the average trainer is probably most excited to return to Kalos in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <em>Champions </em>could fundamentally change how competitive <em>Pokémon </em>operates, and by extension open up a design space for RPGs like <em>Z-A</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195618" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s start with what we know. <em>Pokémon Champions </em>is a battle simulation game that won’t be tied to a specific RPG. Right now, competitive players battle in whatever the current mainline <em>Pokémon </em>is, so the best trainers in the scene are battling in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> in official tournaments. This naturally limits the Pokémon players can use, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">gimmick mechanics</a></span> they can utilize. <em>Champions</em>, meanwhile, will not be tied to a specific game and can import different Pokémon from the <em>Pokémon Home</em> storage app (though The Pokémon Company makes clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in its press release</a></span> that there will be some restrictions). The trailer also shows that <em>Champions</em> supports different gameplay mechanics like Mega Evolution and Terastallization, indicating that it might be possible to use different strategies that aren’t beholden to a game-specific rule set.</p><p>Just how freely we’ll be able to customize rules and party compositions remains to be seen, but The Pokémon Company creating an officially licensed battle simulator similar to the third-party ones used by competitive pros that aren’t limited to the current generation is a huge deal. This means professional players and the average fan will no longer be tied to one another. Official <em>Pokémon </em>tournaments won’t be limited to specific RPGs’ rosters, and mainline games could get more experimental without being chained to a competitive scene.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is one of the most innovative games the series has released in the past decade. It has new battle mechanics like the agile and strong style moves that let you choose to prioritize speed or power, which would be considered “broken” in competitive play. But <em>Legends: Arceus </em>doesn’t have multiplayer battles and doesn’t have to design its turn-based gameplay around whether or not something is fair to a rival trainer. As a result, some of the game’s big story battles are among the most challenging and interesting the series has ever put out. As a non-competitive player, some of the most strategic plays I’ve ever had to make in a <em>Pokémon </em>game’s main story involved making decisions about whether or not to use agile attacks to try and get in a few extra hits, or put everything I had into a strong one in hopes of knocking an enemy out in one shot. </p><p>This was a simple tweak to long-established <em>Pokémon </em>mechanics, but if Game Freak can develop RPGs without having to account for a completely different way they might be played in tournaments, it could mean cool innovations like this in future games. <em>Legends: Z-A</em> even introduces its own spin on <em>Pokémon</em> battles by incorporating positioning and area-of-effect to make use of the walkable 3D combat zones. Cool changes like this are only possible if we stop worrying about competitive viability and make space for innovative RPG design.</p><p>Severing competitive tournaments from the RPGs is a good thing for everyone, and some of the biggest names in professional <em>Pokémon </em>battling have expressed that having their own space to play and experiment could be a game changer for the scene.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions for both competitive and casual players, but the potential possibilities <em>Pokémon Champions</em> could bring to all sides of the community make it the most exciting part of the Presents showcase. I’m stoked for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but in the long run, I’m even more interested in how the <em>Pokémon </em>series could keep changing for the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-innovating-on-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98we%E2%80%99re-innovating-on-gameplay-not-monetisation-%E2%80%99-splitgate-2-ceo-says.1120818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-innovating-on-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I was fortunate enough to get hands-on with Splitgate 2 a month before the game entered the current open alpha. I also had the chance to sit down with Ian Proulx, the co-founder and CEO of 1047 Studios, the developer behind this high-octane shooter. As I explored the intense mechanics of Splitgate 2, I found myself gelling <strong>very nicely </strong>with what was on offer.</p>



<p>As questions were put to Proulx, I learned about the future of Splitgate 2, which is a direct follow-on from the shooter that was released in 2019 on PC, and then later on console. In this sequel, evolution is the order of the day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-to-do">More To Do</h2>



<p>Ian Proulx was very transparent about the areas in which Splitgate (the first game) fell short. The title had awesome short-term retention, but players dropped off alarmingly fast after realising that there wasn’t much ‘to do’ or chase in the game.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It was super fun, super simple, but it lacked variety and that staying power. </p>



<p>We had really strong short-term retention, our day one and day seven was world class – better than many of the top shooters you’ll see today. </p>



<p>But what we saw is players would come on, play for 3 or 4 weeks, and then say, ‘now what?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at 1047 Games has addressed those concerns in the follow-up title.</p>



<p>There will be more things to unlock, and as Proulx said, ‘We can keep you on the hook for longer by giving you more content over time.’ This will include seasonal events, ‘lots of live-ops stuff’, and customisation elements. </p>



<p>The game has been bolstered immeasurably by new movement mechanics, like sliding, and a massive 24-player multi-team mode inspired by Halo’s Big Team Battle mode. It’s also being released on PS4 and Xbox One to serve the last generation of players quite nicely, which is a solid touch from the team.</p>



<p>In the last few years, Splitgate 2’s potential has allowed 1047 Games to expand from a team of 10 to almost 200 employees, all of which are stoked about the impending launch of this fantastic shooter.</p>



<p>I asked Ian Proulx about the proposed operating model for the game, given that so many free-to-play shooters have launched in recent years – and not all of them have succeeded.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Splitgate 2 will be free-to-play.</p>



<p>We’re innovating on gameplay, we’re not innovating on monetisation.</p>



<p>(It’ll feature) traditional industry elements and no pay-to-win or gacha mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had the opportunity to play the Splitgate 2 alpha ahead of the release, thanks to 1047 Games. Before the session took place, I sat down with the studio’s CEO to talk about the development – and more importantly, the future – of this innovative first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Given my passion for the industry, I was eager to learn whether esports plans sat in the pipeline for Splitgate 2. My discussion with Ian Proulx, also one of the studio’s founders, revealed exciting things about the competitive future of Splitgate 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-future-is-competitive">The Future is Competitive</h2>



<p>Splitgate 2 is a phenomenal shooter with stacks of potential. When I got hands-on with the title a month before it entered the current alpha playtest, I was instantly hooked. The fast-paced gameplay twinned with genuinely enjoyable weapon mechanics had me by the throat – in a good way. I was <strong>enthused </strong>by what I experienced.</p>



<p>In a brief conversation with Ian Proulx, I dove into the competitive landscape for Splitgate 2, learning about the potential for this game to slot nicely into the esports landscape.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I would say it’s not a priority for launch, but I definitely see this game being an esport one day.</p>



<p>We like games that are fair, and that falls under the ‘fun category’ for me. We also like the fact that the game has a lot of skill expression, which nautrally lends itself to esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Splitgate 2 uses genius ‘portal mechanics’ that allow players to warp around the battlefield like never before. It adds a unique element to the pacing, which is otherwise built around a typical run-and-gun operating model.</p>



<p>Proulx continued:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, the top priority is, ‘Let’s just go and make a fun shooter.’</p>



<p>If we do that and it turns into an esport, that’s great – but if it’s just a casual thing, that’s great too.</p>



<p>That said, I would love for this to be an esport one day. It’s a post-launch thing and not something I want to force or prioritise, though.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s typically quite tough for new games to elbow their way into the esports market. It has been dominated for so long by The Big Three: Counter-Strike, League of Legends, and Dota 2. Other titles have cut their way into the wider business, but it’s tough.</p>



<p>In recent years, the most successful <strong>new </strong>game was VALORANT, but that’s backed by Riot Games, so the foothold was already there. For a new IP to break into the market successfully, a perfect storm of positive circumstances must unfold.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">Mega Evolutions will be making a return</a>, so it's possible that the starters could receive those. There's been a precendent set with Mega Evolutions where some get new typing, such as Mega Ampharos being Electric/Dragon instead of pure Electric type and Pinsir becoming a Bug/Flying type when it Mega Evolves instead of staying pure Bug.</p><p>Let's take a look at what we know about the three starters and what potential changes Legends Z-A could bring to them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="4000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290"></a><figcaption>The three starters in Pokemon Legends Z-A (from left to right): Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg"></figure><h2>Chikorita</h2><p>Chikorita is the Grass type starter from Generation 2, and is unfortunately the worst starter of its trio, as well as considered to be one of the worst starters historically. That's mostly due to the shallow pool of moves its final form, Meganium, can learn and its mediocre stats. However, a Mega Evolution or alternate form could drastically improve Meganium.</p><p>Nintendo could lean into Meganium's reptilian design and give it a secondary Dragon typing. Meganium already learns some Dragon type attacks, including Dragon Tail and Outrage, but a secondary Dragon type would also power them up by 50% due to STAB, or Same Type Attack Bonus. This would make Meganium more offensively viable.</p><p>Meganium is more defensively oriented, and a Dragon typing would be a bit of a mixed bag. It would bolster its already impressive resistances to Water, Grass, and Electric moves. However, it would add Dragon and Fairy weaknesses.</p><p>An alternate form with the Grass/Fairy typing would give Meganium the best of both worlds, defensively and offensively. Fairy is regarded as one of the best types in Pokemon so far.</p><p>A secondary Fairy type would gives Meganium an immunity to Dragon type attacks and new resistances to Dark and Fighting type attacks, while only adding one additional weakness to Steel type attacks. However, it would now take quadruple damage from Poison-type attacks instead of double. A secondary Fairy typing also cancels out Meganium's weaknesses to bug types too, making them only do neutral damage.</p><p>Offensively, Fairy is a powerful type, hitting Dark, Dragon, and Fighting types for extra damage. However, Meganium will still struggle against Fire and Poison types, as they resist Fairy type attacks.</p><h2>Tepig</h2><p>Tepig is the Fire starter from Generation 5 and its final evolution is Emboar, a Fire/Fighting type. With high offensive stats on both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, along with a versatile attacking movepool, Emboar doesn't need as much as a drastic change like Meganium. However, if Nintendo wants to switch up Emboar's typing in a Mega Evolution or alternate form, one possibility is Fire/Ground. Thematically, that would fit Emboar as a pig, rolling around in the mud.</p><p>A secondary Ground typing might actually make Emboar worse, as it would take quadruple damage from Water type attacks and lose its Grass resistance. However, it would gain an Electric immunity. Either way, Emboar is fine as it is, and it's possible that it could retain its Fire/Fighting typing if given an alternate form.</p><h2>Totodile</h2><p>Totodile is Generation 2's Water type starter. Of the Johto trio, it's the most physically offensive, making it a popular option. Its final evolution is Feraligatr, which, like Emboar, also doesn't need a massive overhaul. Feraligatr is a pure Water type, so it's possible that it could gain a secondary typing.</p><p>The secondary typing that makes the most sense thematically for Feraligatr would be Dark, as that plays into Totodile's mischievous and playful nature. Plus, Feraligatr already learns plenty of Dark type moves such as Bite, Crunch, Fake Tears, Snarl, and Lash Out. A secondary Dark typing would also give its Dark attacking moves the STAB bonus.</p><p>Feraligatr is reptilian, just like Meganium, so a Water/Dragon typing fits too. Feraligatr already learns moves like Dragon Claw, Outrage, and Dragon Dance. As long as a Mega Evolution or alternate form of Meganium isn't Grass/Dragon, Feraligatr can go down the route as a Dragon type, as I don't imagine Nintendo would want to double up on the Dragon typing for two starters.</p><p>Pokemon Legends Z-A is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">launch in late 2025 for Nintendo Switch</a>. It'll have a new take on the traditional Pokemon battle system, including real-time elements with attack moves that have a certain amount of reach. Moving Pokemon out of the way will cause attacks to miss.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-2d-no-fate-sidescroller-september<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau have announced&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>, a gritty sidescroller in which you must put a stop to the T-1000 and foil Skynet's plans before the human race is destroyed.</p>

<p>The game will allow you to play as either Sarah Connor or Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 as you fight to stop the shapeshifting android, memorably played by Robert Patrick in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em> (and in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>).</p>

<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>'s story will blend "iconic scenes" from the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>with "original scenarios and multiple endings", which sounds like a rather unique mixture.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=QITciBWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=nA9hX4xL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several iconic&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes are recreated in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we can see&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes like Sarah Connor working out in her hospital room, Arnie's T-800 duking it out with thugs in a dingy bar, and, of course, that iconic truck chase sequence.</p>

<p>We also see how the gameplay will work, and it looks like&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>will take on a sort of&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style run-and-gun feel; we can see Connor snap-aiming in various directions,&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style, as well as lots of fast-paced action rendered in crisp pixel art.</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>has a pretty pleasing SNES and Genesis-era feel to it, right down to the continue screen, which feels like exactly the kind of thing a licensed&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>game would have sported back in the 90s.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>here. It's even got a fun reworked version of the classic&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>theme for you to enjoy. Good luck getting that one out of your head once it's in there.</p>




<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>isn't the only video game based on the&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>series that's set to launch in the (hopefully near!) future.</p>

<p>There's also Nacon's&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, which, as its name suggests, is a survival game in which you must make sense of humanity's near-extinction at the hands of Skynet, scavenging for resources and navigating an irrevocably changed world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't know when that one's coming out; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in 2025</a> back in August, although it's more than possible we'll hear something about it during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">next week's Nacon Connect presentation</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on September 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>As per Tribes/Tiny Wings convention, Haste is a game of momentum, where you’ll need to build up speed on downwards slopes before launching yourself off the rises. Spend too long off the ground, though, and all that meddlesome air friction will slow you right down, thus encouraging a satisfyingly rapid-yet-graceful series of up-down manoeuvres. Like a dolphin, who’s really good at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exo-one">Exo One</a>.</p>
<p>While you don’t do much <em>except</em> run forwards in Haste, it is keen to put up more of a challenge than just finding the perfect racing line. Randomised obstacles range from simple trees and spiked vines to giant lasers, rising lava pools that obscure all but a precious few slopes, and eventually, the rocket barrages of a hefty robot you defeat by faceplanting into at 120kph. </p>
<p>Dodging all these while keeping your pace up does engage a sufficiently diverse selection of brain parts to feel worthwhile and satisfying, and fatigue is rarely an issue as each level takes less than a minute to clear. In between, you can select your next dash from a branching map, with occasional stops to refill your health or buy sprint-assisting gadgets using collected crystals.</p>

<p>Hang on a tic. Branching paths? Run-specific upgrades? Why, this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> in unusually aerodynamic parachute pants, which I guess also means we’re Wishlisting a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> for about the fiftieth time this week. Sorry for that as well. Except, again, Haste doesn’t really care about making you repeat yourself into finally achieving one ultimate, golden run. Upgrades are nice and all, but deep down it’s still a test of speed, not builds – and with some effective application of the 'glide downwards' key, there’s an awful lot of speed to be had.</p>
<p>At its best, Haste is thrillingly kinetic, repeatedly spiking you with the rush of near-missing deathtraps at Mach 1. Even the soundtrack eggs you on, its pounding electronica slowing down as you do; biff a landing or misjudge an obstacle and it starts to sound almost panicked in its haggardness, as if the music itself is begging you to spin back up the giant hamster wheel that powers its continued existence.</p>
<p>Not everything is conducive to that delicious sense of forward velocity. One of the special stages merely has you painting the colour back into a monochrome island by running around it in circles, an incongruous non-challenge given the exceedingly generous time limit. As a longtime connoisseur of go-fast hill sliding games, however, I can say that for the most part, Haste: Broken Worlds is exactly my speed. You can see if it’s yours as well with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796470/HASTE_Broken_Worlds/">Steam demo</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe it’s only recently that the manufacturing costs came down enough to make that viable. After all, why would Sony want to lose money on headsets for an ecosystem that’s barely growing? At the same time, games sell consoles, and without the clear backing of Sony the PS VR2 library never took off. How can others place big bets on the hardware if the company that made it doesn’t seem willing to do the same? </p><p> That doesn’t mean here are no games for PS VR2. Sony notes in today’s blog post that <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em>, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, and<em> Metro Awakening VR</em> all recently arrived on the platform, with <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>, and others still on the way. For now though, there still doesn’t seem to be a killer app coming down the road anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was the start of nine months of nonstop reveals of the 120 new creatures being added to the Pokédex, alongside excitement about the Nintendo Switch’s second mainline entry, following 2019's <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield. </em>And while it <em>was</em> a surprise announcement in the sense that Nintendo had kept it under wraps until that point, it was also expected that a new game would be announced, because there’s a new game every three years, right?</p><p>That’s actually only been true since 2010, following the launch of <em>Black </em>and <em>White. </em>By 2013 we had <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>(as well as the bonus of the first and only sequels, <em>Black 2</em> and <em>White 2 </em>in 2012). Then, like clockwork, 2016 gave us <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>, before 2019's <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>, and 2022's <em>S&amp;V.</em> That’s five mainline entries in a row, each three years apart, rather giving the impression that this was to be the norm. And it almost is; aside from  2006's <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>and 2010's <em>Black </em>and <em>White</em>, each coming out four years after the previous, it’s always been three years.</p><p>Seemingly, 2025 is to be another of those exceptions. What’s so odd is the complete quiet about it all. No one seems to have noticed?</p><h2 id="h895"><a id=""></a>The Three-Year Itch</h2><p>As an observer, it really rather looked like Game Freak had little choice but to get a mainline game out every third year—to the point where the clearly unpolished <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> would surely have been given more time under any other circumstances. But there’s a <em>vast</em> industry built around those games, and missing its release date would have knocked over a row of dominos that could have cost Nintendo, Game Freak, Creatures and The Pokémon Company (a confusing collection of companies who all overlap in the middle) billions.</p><p>Think about the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>. Every three years for the last 15, a new era of cards is launched, themed around the name and region of the most recent game, and highlighting the Pokémon introduced in the new generation. Those cards have to be in production long before the game’s even released, given—for instance—Japan’s first set of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> era TCG cards were released in January 2023, just two months after the game came out. The artwork alone would have been commissioned months ahead, and the intricacies of the game design based on all the new monsters worked out well in advance, too. If the game slipped, the cards would either have to be enormously expensively delayed, or come out ahead of the game and ruin twists and surprises,  and in turn knock down the next domino: merchandise. </p><p>So to shift to a four-year development cycle (and let’s be clear, they absolutely should, or even a longer one, because Game Freak employees deserve the time and space to avoid crunch and make the best game possible) has enormous implications. Ones that must be planned for, presumably years in advance. Nintendo, Game Freak, et al, are all so notoriously tight-lipped about <em>everything</em>, and it’s wildly unlikely they’d ever tell anyone such intentions, so we’re left to just guess. And my guess would be that the reaction to <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>’s dubious (and ongoing) technical state caused decisions to be made within to do two different things:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Take longer to make an open-world game that isn’t cracking at the seams</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Make it for the Switch 2 only</p><p>That latter one would have been very difficult to get away with in 2025. Sure, it’d have been an <em>amazing</em> way to sell Switch 2s over the 2025 holiday season, but the console would still be six months old at most, and most people would expect a game announced today to work on the console they own today. But next year? It’s an easier sell. In fact, it’s pretty much bog-standard for a new <em>Pokémon </em>game to release a year or two after the latest Nintendo hardware.</p><h2 id="h896"><a id=""></a>Domino Rally</h2><p>The implications are still interesting, however. The <em>PTCG </em>is going to need to run <em>SV</em> for an extra year, and it’s already looking a bit worn out. The ex era is being revamped later this year with the addition of mega evolution cards, but while that’ll change up the meta a bit and obviously give them a chance to take advantage of the current ludicrous boom in sales to sell a gazillion Mega Charizard-themed boxes, it still leaves 2026 and the first half of 2027 to fill with Generation IX. That explains 2025's year-long release of Prismatic Evolution special sets, a year earlier than you’d have expected given how the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era ended with a full year of Crown Zenith sets—it’s clearly a mid-point thing, rather than an ending. We can expect some sort of ex-celebrating bonanza next year, maybe?</p><p>Anyway, there you go. Just in case you too were thinking how weird it is that no one’s talking about this.</p><p>Unless of course they go and surprise-announce it in the April Nintendo Direct, and make me look like a complete fool.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket and a Ranked Mode would go hand in hand. Players can already battle the computer—and each other—and there are a ton of cards to choose from. A ton of features have already made their way into Pokémon TCG Pocket, and Ranked Mode needs to be one of them.</p>



<p>It’s amazing to see how Pokémon TCG Pocket has gone from strength to strength since launch.

<p>Another core gameplay mechanic Pokémon TCG Pocket is missing is Ranked Battles. Are the player’s cries being heard? Or will the wait go on?</p>

<p><strong>Ranked Mode finally debuts in Pokémon TCG Pocket at the end of March 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The long-awaited news came during the exciting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2025 Pokemon Presents</a> affair. The special presentation celebrated all things Pokémon and included breaking news and ended with a groundbreaking gameplay trailer for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>. Amidst the reveals and content drops, we were informed of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a>—a new Pokémon TCG Pocket booster set.</p>



<p>This was cool, but what was even cooler was the set’s trailer also mentioned Ranked Matches at the very end of it. Even though a specific date wasn’t given, we know for sure it’s coming at the end of March 2025. A delay could happen between now and then, so be prepared for the worst, if not, you can use your best decks to conquer opponents in Ranked Mode.</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Official Pokémon YouTube channel</a>‘s full Triumphant Light trailer below—featuring the Ranked Battles mention for the finale.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-ranked-mode-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">What is Ranked Mode in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not confirmed, but we believe Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Ranked Mode is a conventional ranked system whereby players are matched up into divisions or leagues appropriate to their skill level, and wins and losses determine if you rise or fall through the ranks.</strong></p>



<p>Let’s say there are 10 ranked divisions for Ranked Mode. if you’re in Rank 5, winning matches in a row may end up with you <strong>being promoted</strong> to Rank 4, then 3, and so forth. Consecutive losses could very well see you <strong>drop down the rankings</strong>.</p>



<p>Many Pokémon TCG Pocket decks revolve around coin flips, the cards you draw, and a lot of luck overall. So it will be interesting to see if any rules and regulations are established for Ranked Mode.</p>



<hr>



<p>Could the addition of Ranked Mode be a game-changing feature for Pokémon TCG Pocket? Have you already got a deck in mind to frustrate and defeat opponents?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-rebrand-reburn-la-quimera/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>4A Games Ukraine, one of the studios behind the Metro franchise, has revealed a rebrand and an all-new IP. It’s called ‘La Quimera’, which is Spanish for ‘The Chimera’. The game and the studio’s foundation were leaked recently, but today, a full and official announcement has taken place, with the game’s first trailer debuting online.</p>



<p>La Quimera is a futuristic sci-fi shooter set in Latin America, and it boasts a narrative-driven campaign that can be played either solo or with friends. The game has been written by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon), and it features a combination of Latin American folklore and ‘advanced weaponry and technology.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-reburn">Introducing Reburn</h2>



<p>Reburn is a rebranding of 4A Games Ukraine, and it’s an independent studio with around 110 employees. Many of these developers have worked on the Metro franchise, and some have experience going back to the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. The studio is being led by Dmytro Lymar, a twenty-year industry veteran.</p>



<p>It’s a little confusing, admittedly. The long and short of it is that in 2014, a split took place at 4A Games that left part of the company in the Ukraine while another branch opened up in Malta, but they both shared technology and teams and collaborated on games like Metro Exodus.</p>



<p>In 2020, Embracer acquired the 4A team in Malta, while the 4A Ukraine studio started working on La Quimera after landing fresh funding and becoming much more independent. While 4A Games (Malta) continues to work on Metro, Reburn is an entirely separate entity working on this all-new IP.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lymar said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series</em>. <em>We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>La Quimera is set in a Latin American megalopolis and ‘lush jungle’. Players will be able to adorn themselves in an advanced suit of armour as they battle rival factions across what looks like a gorgeous world. In a press release, it was stressed that the game has ‘tense gunplay and intimate storytelling’.</p>



<p>Here’s the announcement trailer for La Quimera:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It looks good, and it’s a wonder it has been kept under wraps for so long. The team at Reburn has been working on La Quimera for almost five years, and if the announcement trailer is anything to go by, it should be a banger of a title.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the enemies that seem to resemble the Helghast from the Killzone franchise.</p>



<p>The game can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">wishlisted on Steam</a>, but no release window has been confirmed for the game.</p>

            <p>Mario + Rabbids creator Davide Soliani believes players are looking for unique independent games that are "willing to tell different stories".</p>
<p>Soliani left Ubisoft last year after 25 years at Ubisoft and has now joined with writer Christian Cantamessa (Red Dead Redemption, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-war">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a>, the forthcoming Perfect Dark reboot) to form a new studio, Day 4 Night.</p>
<p>Along with other former Ubisoft Milan employees, the pair are working on a new "passion project", though admitted it's a risky time in the games industry to be founding a new studio. </p>

<p>"I think stupidity made us," Cantamessa told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/davide-soliani-interview/">VGC</a>, discussing the risk of a new studio. "This industry is really at a crossroads right now. We've reached the point where you have massive overheads, you need to recoup those massive investments, and it becomes really hard to sustain."</p>
<p>He explained the studio's financing, from publisher Krafton and Ed Fries' 1Up Ventures, is purely based on stock, meaning the pair have complete creative freedom.</p>
<p>"On one end, you have a situation where everyone is a bit more careful at investing money," said Soliani. "At the same time, there is a growing interest from the player towards games that are a bit, let's say, out of the chorus. They are a bit different. They are willing to tell different stories…that's what we are observing as developers and as players."</p>
<p>Cantamessa compared the current state of the industry with the collapse of Hollywood and the rise of independent filmmaking. "What you see now is the audience is aligning away from the more studio fare and towards the indie fare," he said. "So I think maybe we're in the late 60s, 70s of cinema, and we're starting to see the Bonnie and Clyde of the video game world."</p>
<p>As for the new project itself, Soliani said it's a new IP and while gameplay comes first, it's "merging with storytelling in a meaningful way".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">Soliani also discussed leaving Ubisoft</a> and assured the decision was not due to poor sales of the Mario + Rabbids Kindgom Battle sequel, Sparks of Hope.</p>
<p>"The reason I left is not because I was trying to get away from Ubisoft for any specific reason, but because I was searching for something that I couldn't find there... something that we're now creating together here [at Day 4 Night]," he said.</p>
<p>"For me, Kingdom Battle was a personal project, like the one that we are doing now at Day 4 Night," he said. "It was really a love letter to Nintendo. It's not a surprise that I'm a Nintendo lover. In my office, I currently have a huge Mario plushie that my friend sent me from Tokyo."</p>
<p>Further, Kingdom Battle was a "surprise" success, but that meant the sequel was "harder to develop". "There was too much overthinking about it all around me," he said. "So to me it was a bit…it was still a joy, it was a wonderful experience because I always loved working with Nintendo and I always will."</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-admits-mario-rabbids-sequel-should-have-waited-for-next-nintendo-console">Ubisoft's comments on the game's reception</a> were "a bit hurtful for the morale of the team" Soliana admitted. "Because we just finished working for three and a half years and were super committed to creating a very good game. So, of course, it was not the kind of message that we wanted to receive back in those days.</p>
<p>"It was a bit hurtful, but nothing crazy. I think that's normal…every development team is proud of what they are doing and always searching for encouraging words, which in that situation, was maybe needed. It was a bit harsh on the team, but nothing that we didn't solve by talking internally back when we were in the company."</p>
<p>The announcement of the first Mario + Rabbids game launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Soliani to notoriety as Ubisoft Crying Man</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft itself is going through a tumultuous time at the moment. While it has the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the horizon, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">closed its UK studio last month</a> and laid off 185 jobs across the business.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">company also looks poised to be sold or taken private</a>, after it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Chinese conglomerate Tencent was considering a buyout</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Pokémon Day stream gave us a first gameplay trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, including some huge changes for Pokémon battles and returning fan-favourite features. They’ve also re-confirmed that the game will launch this year for Nintendo Switch with a Late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The “extended” look at the game amounted to a three and a half minute narrated walkthrough of the game’s setting and key features.</p>
<p>it’s set in Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y with Prism Tower at its heart while the urban landscape undergoes a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. Once you reach the city at the start of the game, you’ll be able to choose from Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile as the three starters – pour one out for Cyndaquil fans, as Tepig replaces him in the Gen 2 line-up.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s a new frenemy to be your rival, either Urbain or Taunie, depending on the appearance you choose for yourself in the game. The hotel you stay at is run by AZ and his partner Pokémon Floette, returning from Pokémon X&amp;Y. At the head of the redevelopment plan is Quasartico Inc. and their CEO Jett and her subordinate Vinnie.</p>

<p>Throughout the city are wild zones for Pokémon to thrive, locked off by numbered green gates. Here you’ll use the same style of catching mechanics as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>, just throwing Poké Balls at creatures, and using your Pokémon’s abilities to weaken tougher targets.</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y with Pokémon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>There’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time. Maybe in April?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. has released its <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial summary</a> for the final quarter of 2024, as well as an overview of the year as whole. While most of it does focus on its other subsidiaries, such as television and film, it does discuss the earnings of the gaming division.</p>
<p>For many, it doesn't come as a surprise to find that Warner Bros.'s Gaming division did not have a good financial year at all, and revenue was down overall. According to the report, the game division's revenue had decreased by 29%, which isn't too surprising considering that the company didn't have any major releases compared to when Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 were released in the prior year quarter.</p>
<p>Aside from the company's revenue, it has released some devastating news as of late, where it was announced that three of its studios were going to be closed. These studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions</a>, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. Thus far, the reception to this announcement has not been taken well, as these studios had incredibly talented teams that produced some great games over the years, including F.E.A.R. and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, for example. A lot of the fan irritation comes from the fact that these companies were never given the opportunity to make further brilliant games like the Middle-earth titles and instead felt that they were being "sat on." Along with the news of the studio closures came the news that the Wonder Woman game that was in development would no longer be released.</p>
<p>The two major Warner Bros. games that were released in the last year both did not perform to expectations. So much so that both <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a> are both closing down as a result of this before the games had even been in general release for a year. Moreover, MultiVersus was technically in a bizarre beta-early Access limbo phase for a long period of its lifespan and spent even less time fully released to the gaming market.</p>
<p>In the report, it's also mentioned in the Q4 2024 highlights that Games content expense had decreased 20% ex-FX, which was driven by lower revenues, with it being partially offset by additional impairments. In total, it came to $50 million for the quarter, and $384 million for the year.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has been having an incredibly tough time with its gaming division as of late, and it'll need a really magnificent game to help the company pull through. There is the possibility of more potential Batman games, as James Gunn recently mentioned that he has been in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop further <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/">DC games</a>. However, it has not been stated what these games could be.</p>

<p>Back in November, 11 bit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">shared the first</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, which promised a free update, console ports, and the game's first major DLC sometime this year. Now, the studio has released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised roadmap</a> that gets much more specific.</p>

<p>First up, a major update is coming on May 8th. 11 bit simply says this update will "adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners". How mysterious!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=jlHnQTFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=P0dX5UaI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s console ports are officially coming in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the major new update and the console port release timing, 11 bit studios also announced a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s first DLC&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>. It's launching in fall, apparently.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both the&nbsp;<em>Aurora&nbsp;</em>DLC and&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s as-yet-unnamed third major expansion still don't have release windows more specific than this year and next, respectively, but at least we know roughly when the first one's coming.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive on consoles, it'll be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. You won't be getting any last-gen ports of the game, unfortunately, so PS4, Xbox One, and Switch owners are out in the cold (or not, as the case may be).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's the followup to 11 bit studios' 2018 city-building survival sim&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>tasks you with building a city and tending to its citizens' needs amidst a harsh, everlasting winter.</p>




<p>Released in September, the game took <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days to become profitable</a> for 11 bit studios, so it's no wonder console ports and DLC are proceeding apace.</p>

<p>However, things aren't quite as rosy elsewhere in 11 bit land; back in December, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">canceled its console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em></a>, while ambitious-looking upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-again-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to a nebulous point in 2025</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are due to arrive in summer.

<p>Some things I have smashed through in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/">the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a>: fire hydrants, surf boards, barns, an entire laundromat, street lamps, palm trees, garbage cans, several pedestrians, mailboxes, food stalls, fish markets, brick walls, a lookout tower, dumpsters, housewives, the city fountain, and a row of unsuspecting sunbathers. This toy-like messabout is proof of one thing. Almost every problem can be solved by driving a 1950s truck straight through it. </p>

<p>Deliver At All Costs was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deeply-destructive-driving-game-deliver-at-all-costs-will-see-you-smashing-1950s-america-to-pieces">in September last year</a>, a delivery game that's part <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, part <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>. You play as underemployed courier boy Winston, who is running odd jobs for a delivery company with some eccentric management. The trailer showed enough wanton environmental destruction that the heinous sandcastle kicker inside me was intrigued. Now it has a demo out for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>, and I can confirm: it feels good to smash.</p>

<p>That's in large part thanks to the driving. An isometric-ish perspective can work a certain magic on a driving game, I've often found. It makes vehicles feel toy-like, as if you're a nipper racing your Hot Wheels around from on-high. That's the case here. It helps that the car movement itself is smooth and satisfying. You drift in gratifying curves, your speed is never so fast you can't keep an eye on what's coming, and a certain amount of helpful braking is automatically applied just in the act of turning. </p>
<p>There's a little bit of story leading you through your time on the island of St Monique - a fictional tropical territory of the United States in the 1950s. The first mission will see you delivering a case of exploding fireworks across the island, dodging the explosions that threaten to pop your wheels if you hit a runaway firecracker. But it's fine. You can get out and repair your wheels with tools easily enough.</p>
<p>That and the forgiving respawn gives me the feeling this tire smoker is more interested in the gags it can create through reckless deliverymanship than in actually throwing big challenges your way. But the next mission is at least a little trickier. You've got to drive 60 stinking watermelons to an insecticide plant without too many flying overboard when you rush over potholes or take a corner too fast.</p>

</figure>
<p>I spent a big chunk of the demo ignoring the story mode entirely, choosing instead to drive around and explore the five zones of the island already open in the demo. I smashed through greenhouses along the tropical coast of one region and blazed through the trainyards, factories, and sheds of another more industrial district. There are also side missions you can pick up by chatting to civilians (the mayor wants me to find his body double because he can't be arsed going to budget meetings himself).</p>
<p>As for how GTA-like it gets, well, it doesn't have the same hunger for raw violence. You can run over pedestrians but they bounce harmlessly around as immortal ragdolls. Although, they will get furious and chase you down with baseball bats, and will shove you onto the ground if you step  outside the car to face them. You can't hijack any car driving around the streets, but any parked car is fair game. I could've also hopped into a phone booth and used it to recall the company truck, but by this stage it was more chaotic just to source my next fencewrecker from the streets.</p>
<p>I very much admire when a game smashes the right "gamefeel" for its theme, and going by the demo Deliver At All Costs has some of that slip-slidey <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> goodness. The full game doesn't have a release date yet. But we'll let you know when it's out for delivery.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is just getting into the hands of players, but Capcom has already revealed its plans for the game’s first title update.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the developers gave a first look at what players can expect when Title Update 1 releases. </p>



<p>Right off the bat, Capcom says that the update will arrive sometime in early April and will be free for all players. The timing, they say, allows players to have “enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges”.</p>



<p>Speaking of challenges, the update will introduce a new monster “at a level above Tempered”. There will also be a new place for players who’ve completed the game’s main story to gather with other hunters.</p>







<p>More information on what else is coming in the update will be revealed as its release gets closer.  That will include any other new features being added as well as any fixes or changes to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of the first details for Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>GOG is adding FEAR Platinum to its Preservation Program "by next month".</p>
<p>GOG announced the upcoming addition following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Warner Bros' shock closure of its developer Monolith Productions</a> this week.</p>
<p>The team at GOG stated it was initially planning on bringing  FEAR Platinum - which along with the base game also includes both expansions - to the program at a later date, but due to the studio closure it wanted to "accelerate this release to properly recognise Monolith's contributions to gaming".</p>
