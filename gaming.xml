Anyone order a free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> update? Well, whether you did or not, a free update is what you're getting. This one's quite features driven, focusing a lot of challenges and cosmetics, but there's a few new weapons and the like too. Let's take a little look-see!
</p>
<p>
For starters, this update, titled Free Ride, is due out tomorrow, November 20th, so you've not got long to wait for it. It's similar to the Free Ride mode you might have experienced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>, for a frame of reference. Included are different sets of challenges, unconnected to the story, which range from combat, stealth, and racing missions, taking place in some new areas, but also places from the base game. Completing said challenges nets you the in-game Dinari currency to buy things like outfits, weapons, or vehicles. You can also drive in first-person now! Not much to say about that one.

<p>
As every single game under the sun now has, there's a photo mode being added in. For those of you up for more of a challenge, the classic difficulty setting will also be available. 
</p>
<p>
Possibly my least favourite addition at just a cursory glance is the game's new "Cinema Siciliano" mode. Think something along the lines of the Akira Kurosawa mode in Ghost of Tsushima - the Cinema Siciliano mode also turns things black and white, adds film grain, and puts a filter on the audio so that it sounds a bit old and crappy. I understand that you're inspired by movies, it just feels weirdly fake and cheap when you slap some filters on top of things and call it a day! You'd need a lighting overall to really capture the appropriate feeling in the first place, but I digress.
</p>
<p>
The main point is, the update is free, it's coming November 20th, happy mafiaing!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Starting this Friday, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be unlocked for everyone, regardless of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-endgame-multiplayer-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign completion</a> or not. Fortunately, those who beat the story will get some rewards.</p>







<p>Released earlier this month, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has had quite the rough patch. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-responds-black-ops-7-ai-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI allegations</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-metacritic-user-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative feedback</a> have taken a lot of the airwaves for the game. Furthermore, its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underwhelming player count</a> on opening weekend compared to Battlefield 6 are not the best. However, its multiplayer modes, especially Endgame, have been recieved well. It did require one to go through a ‘garbage’ campaign, so many haven’t gotten to try it yet. Now, not even a month since releasing, the mode will be available to all.</p>



<h2 id="h-endgame-mode-available-on-friday-without-campaign-requirement-in-black-ops-7">Endgame Mode Available on Friday Without Campaign Requirement in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Co-Op Endgame mode will unlock for all Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 players starting this Friday, November 21. </p><p>Those who finished the campaign to get Endgame will receive 3x 1 hr 2XP Tokens, 2X Weapon XP Tokens, 2X Battle Pass XP Tokens, and 3x Perkaholic GobbleGums. <a href="https://t.co/i3z6j0pVll">pic.twitter.com/i3z6j0pVll</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on Twitter/X, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1991221059119415675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> stated that, starting Friday, November 21st, Black Ops 7’s Endgame mode will be available for everyone. As mentioned before, the mode was previously locked behind beating the co-op campaign. If you were one of those who beat it to get Endgame, there are rewards you’ll be able to redeem. The list can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>3x 1-Hour 2XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Weapon XP Tokens</li>



<li>2x Battle Pass XP Tokens</li>



<li>3x Perkaholic GobbleGums</li>
</ul>



<p>The mode is Call of Duty’s new answer to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dmz-is-officially-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMZ from Modern Warfare 2</a>. With an open world, Avalon, you and four friends can take on missions, secure objectives, and explore. Other teams will be on the map and you’ll compete with them, as well. </p>



<p>With the mode now available to all, it’ll be interesting to see if it has an effect on the player count. Many fans do like the mode, so without having prerequisites, it may bring more people in. Either way, the move does feel a bit sudden, especially coming just two weeks after releasing. </p>







<p>What do you think of Endgame being fully available in Black Ops 7? Is it to boost engagement? Have you played the mode? Was it worth going through the campaign?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ music</span></a><span> comes from the mind of Ejae, who also provides the singing voice for Rumi, the lead singer of the movie’s titular girl group. As such, there are demos for every song in the film with Ejae singing just about every part. This includes songs like “Your Idol,” which Rumi doesn’t perform at all in the finished film, so when we get to hear these demos, it’s like listening to an alternate version of the movie in which the girls of Huntr/x were the demons singing songs to capture the hearts and minds of the masses.</span></p> <p><span>Ejae has played snippets of the demo version of “Your Idol” before, but this is the first time we’ve heard this much of it. The singer/songwriter was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM2qmgJZPek"><span>part of an event</span></a><span> where she and co-songwriter Mark Sonnenblick talked about the making of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack and played a couple of demos for the audience. This included the Grammy-nominated “Golden” and the original “Your Idol” recording, which has some different lyrics than those heard in the film. Even if it only includes the first verse, it’s really cool to hear Rumi’s voice singing a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><span>Saja Boys</span></a><span> song. I’d take an EP of the Saja Boys singing Huntr/x songs and vice versa, but I’d settle for full releases of Ejae’s original demos as bonus tracks.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ soundtrack did get a Deluxe Edition release, but its new additions are mostly just acapella and instrumental tracks. If Taylor Swift can release dozens of versions of her albums, what’s the harm in Netflix and Sony putting out another version of the soundtrack that includes these old demos?</span></p> <p><span>For now, Ejae seems to be gearing up for her own solo debut after the success of the film. She released </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-new-song-ejae-in-another-world-video-2000638832"><span>her first single, “In Another World,”</span></a><span> last month, and will hopefully be writing songs for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-netflix-release-date-2029-2000641414"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> in the near future.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else.1358491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one thing I really appreciate about <em>Deadpool VR</em>, out now exclusively on Quest 3 and Quest 3S virtual reality headsets, it’s how the first-person action-shooter lets you know right away what it is.</p> <p>The opening minutes of the game feature Neil Patrick Harris as Wade Wilson aka Deadpool, carrying out his wild plan to use a jeep filled with explosives to blast open a hole in a large aircraft taken over by an evil group of ninjas. If you like what this opening offers, the rest of the game only gets better. But if you can’t stand Deadpool or prefer VR games that feature interactivity, you’ll likely be ripping the headset off in minutes.</p> <h2>What is <em>Deadpool VR</em>?</h2> <p>Developed by Twisted Pixel and published by Meta, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is, as the name very clearly states, a virtual reality game in which you star as Deadpool as he gets sucked into a bonkers intergalactic reality show and quickly agrees to do evil villain Mojo’s bidding while getting as many viewers as possible. If he pulls it off, he’ll be a famous star. If he fails, he’ll be canceled, which in Mojo’s world equals death.</p>

  <p>Well, actually, to get to this part of the game, you’ll have to slog through the opening level set inside an occupied Shield helicarrier that Deadpool is being paid to rescue from the Hand Clan. And this part sucks, and is the worst bit of <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Prepare for a lot of dark grey corridors filled with the same enemies. And because Deadpool is very hard to kill, you rarely feel in danger in this section.</p>

 <p>The game is also very, very slow about offering up more ways to kill and interact with stuff during this elongated intro. So you spend a lot of time flailing your swords at baddies and watching them crumple in unsatisfying ways, or slowly walking around empty rooms. At one point, Deadpool himself pipes up to point out how dull the ship is and how easy the enemies are, and while it did make me chuckle, it didn’t change the fact that this part sucked a lot.</p>

 <h2>Swords are great, guns are bad</h2> <p>Thankfully, after a fun boss fight that combines all the tools you acquire during the intro, like a grappling hook and grenades, you are sucked into Mojo’s World. This is when the actual game starts. From here on out, <em>Deadpool VR</em> is about tracking down targets for Mojo, fighting lots of baddies as stylishly as possible to gain more viewers, and then using the cash you earn from your antics to buy new weapons and cosmetics.</p>

 <p>While combat in<em> Deadpool VR</em> isn’t groundbreaking for virtual games, it works well enough and has some solid mechanics. I especially liked being able to toss a gun at a bad guy, which reloads it and bounces it back to Deadpool. Fun stuff! I also liked being able to divekick stunned enemies to pop their heads off. Oh, and flinging Deadpool’s swords at enemies is wonderful. They fly with a lot of speed, autotarget just enough that you always feel cool doing it, and pin their targets to nearby walls.</p>

 <p>However, all the guns feel weak, and enemies don’t respond to hits in a way that feels satisfying. Picking up a shotgun, I was excited to blast fools away. But it doesn’t do that at all, and it often took more than one shot with it to take down people, who then didn’t go flying back in an explosion of blood. Boo! This is a <em>Deadpool</em> game, guns should blow people up and feel awesome and powerful.</p>

 <p>And you’ll get your fill of all the good and bad of <em>Deadpool VR’</em>s combat and then some because many fights go on way, way too long. At least during these bigger encounters, you can easily fill your special meter, letting you activate a special attack that uses various Marvel character weapons, like Gambit’s cards. During these sections, the game plays different licensed tracks, and I’ll admit I bobbed my head and smiled as I used playing cards charged with energy to slice down a dozen ninjas in a level set in Japan.</p> <h2>Shut the hell up, Deadpool</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645535">©Marvel / Meta</figcaption></figure> <p>But throughout all of this, Neil Patrick Harris is voicing Deadpool, and it is a drag. He often sounds as if he walked into the booth and did one take while reading the script for the first time and called it a day. Often his voice sounds lifeless, his quips lack emotion, and he delivers jokes as well as a kid trying to explain why that one moment in the latest MrBeast video was so damn funny.</p> <p>What’s odd is that there are times when NPH actually delivers some genuinely funny lines with emotion and care. But they happen so infrequently that it makes me think he or whoever was in charge of directing his performance decided that for most of the game, Deadpool should be disconnected and nonchalant. It doesn’t work and just makes the few moments where he does come alive feel out of place. And the writing doesn’t help, with a lot of jokes and material being the kind of dialogue that would get cut from the first draft of a Ryan Reynolds-led <em>Deadpool</em> movie. I’d say the ratio of jokes that actually got a laugh out of me was about 1 in 5.</p>

 <p>I don’t even hate Deadpool! In fact, I really liked the last two movies and that Xbox-360-era game. If someone like me was struggling with some of the writing and with NPH’s performance, I’m not sure how people who truly despise Deadpool will handle playing <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Having your head strapped into a hot machine that screams Deadpool lines directly into your ear for hours might be like torture for them.<em> *shudders.*&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Ultimately, if you mostly like Deadpool, you own a Quest 3 or Quest 3S VR headset, and you don’t mind playing through levels that lack the interactivity seen in games like <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, I’d recommend <em>Deadpool VR</em>. But be prepared for a bleh intro, bad jokes, and performance hiccups that can make the game chug hard. I have a strong VR stomach and powered through these moments, but others might not make it without feeling sick. And if you hate Deadpool, well, you’ll probably feel sick for a whole other reason. So to Deadpool haters, I’d advise staying away from <em>Deadpool VR.</em> Doubt I needed to warn you anyway.</p>

                <p>Once again, Activision has reimagined one of Call of Duty's most iconic maps, Nuketown, and it's launching on November 20 for Black Ops 7. Now, Activision has released a new trailer dedicated to the map, which shows off its new look.</p><p>The new version is called <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Nuketown_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nuketown 2025</a>, and as you can see in the trailer, the map appears to be based on the same Nuketown 2025 from Black Ops 2. This makes sense as Black Ops 7 is a sequel to Black Ops 2. Whereas the original version of Nuketown from 2010's Black Ops was based on a '50s theme, this newest iteration has a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-maps-modes-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"retro-futuristic" vibe </a> that imagines what people thought the "neighborhood of the future" could look like.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Nuketown 2025 Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>A key gameplay difference for Nuketown 2025 in Black Ops 7 is that the game features wall-jumping, which affords players new ways to get around the map. Nuketown is a small-size map known for its fast and frenetic action, and with wall-jumping now in play, things might get even more hectic.</p><p>Nuketown has seen a number of updates and revisions over the years. Black Ops 6 also brought back Nuketown and offered multiple variations of it, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-6-patch-notes-detail-weapon-buffs-and-bug-fixes-for-bo6-and-warzone/2900-7124/" data-ref-id="2900-7124">"Boo-town" for Halloween</a> and a trippy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-iconic-nuketown-map-gets-a-4-20-makeover-soon-in-black-ops-6/1100-6530460/" data-ref-id="1100-6530460">"Blaze Town" makeover for 4/20.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch has announced that <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame will be available to everyone</a> starting November 21. Currently, players have to complete the campaign to unlock it.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and, in a break from tradition, Activision's first-weekend social media post about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any mention of how the game is performing compared to past releases. </a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">GameSpot's Black Ops 7 review</a>.

<p>Horii began his career as a magazine writer, including his own column in <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em>, a popular manga publication. He saved up his money and, by age 27, had enough to purchase a computer. It was with this computer that he began "dabbling in game development," he tells me. Around that time in his life, Enix Corp, as it was called before merging with Final Fantasy maker Square to create Square Enix in 2003, hosted a game development contest – Horii won an award in it, "and that's actually the beginning of my career as a developer," he says.&nbsp;</p><p>On this personal computer, Horii played a game called Ultima 1: The First Age of Darkness, a primitive RPG by today's standards but one that, when viewed, can be seen as a clear inspiration for RPGs like Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, and more. "That really inspired me," Horii says. He remembers thinking, "If I make a game like this, it'll surely become a hit." Unlike Ultima, which was a PC game, he wanted to create something like it (or like Wizardry, another game he mentions as inspirational) for the Famicom, with its 64-kilobyte limits. Specifically, he wanted to use Ultima's 2D dungeon system (versus Wizardry's 3D approach) and combine it with Wizardry's "character growth" (which we now call RPG elements today) to create something new for this new Nintendo console.&nbsp;</p><p>"Within that limitation [of the Famicom], I wanted to make something that would resonate with people," he says. "[...] I was really fascinated by the interactive nature of computer games. I wanted to create a game that was really story-focused, or had a heavy story element, because that would surely be an interesting product."&nbsp;</p><p>That product Horii had in mind would become Dragon Quest, and he quickly got to work, drawing maps, cities, and even the world's citizens on paper before fleshing out the main scenario in his head. However, this initial foundation and his computer prowess could only get him so far – to turn Dragon Quest into a real game, he needed two more people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Horii recalls how the person who would become the lead character and monster designer of the Dragon Quest series became involved.&nbsp;</p><p>"[There] was a staff member [at <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump] </em>named Torishima-san, who was also the assigned editor of someone named Akira Toriyama," Horii says, adding that Torishima told him this Toriyama person wanted to work on a video game. Familiar with Toriyama's art, Horii reached out to him and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p>Though you might associate Akira Toriyama as the visionary creator of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, Toriyama is the man responsible for the visual style of Dragon Quest. Sure, his excellent on-paper art didn't translate precisely into the 8-bit visuals of Dragon Quest – how could it? – but it created the <em>vibes </em>(and some amazing box art, too), and those vibes run like blood through the series, even today, more than a year after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/obituary/2024/03/08/akira-toriyama-creator-of-dragon-ball-has-passed-away">Toriyama's untimely death</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as crucial to the Dragon Quest puzzle as Horii and Toriyama is Koichi Sugiyama, who, prior to Dragon Quest, was already renowned outside of games for his work in movies, TV, anime, and other fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in the '80s, Square released a Shogi (Japanese chess) game and afterward, it sent out a survey postcard to everyone who purchased the game. Sugiyama responded to it, saying he was an enthusiastic player. People throughout Square took notice – "Isn't this guy a famous composer?" Horii remembers thinking. Horii and the team used the opportunity to speak to Sugiyama and get him involved in Dragon Quest, and again, the rest is history. Unfortunately, Sugiyama died in 2021 at the age of 90, but like Toriyama's art, his music defined a critical aspect of Dragon Quest, and I imagine it will continue to do so long after his death.&nbsp;</p><h2>The First Quest</h2>

<p>Dragon Quest launched on the Famicom in Japan on May 27, 1986, and it hit the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America three years later in 1989...except with a new title: Dragon Warrior.&nbsp;</p><p>“Way back then, when it originally released outside of Japan, we weren’t able to use the name Dragon Quest; we had to do Dragon Warrior,” Horii says. If you look at the U.S. box art for Dragon Warrior, you’ll notice it features box art different from the Japanese release, too; noticeably, without Toriyama’s art.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest is arguably the quintessential JRPG, a term some Japanese developers have balked at, but one Horii gladly accepts. It is a 2D fantasy game with a protagonist named Hero who must save the world by defeating monsters and evil in turn-based combat. “I’m just really happy to see everyone feel that way and have this sentiment toward the Dragon Quest series as a whole,” Horii tells me when asked about Dragon Quest’s place in the halls of RPG greats. “Attaching that story element to an RPG was considered a fresh perspective at the time, and I think that’s what really made Dragon Quest stand out from other game titles.”</p><p>Dragon Quest, the first official Japanese version, has sold 1.5 million copies, according to this <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Quest#cite_note-magicboxjapan-2">sourced Fandom chart</a>, with Dragon Warrior selling roughly half a million copies.&nbsp;</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Tanks for the memories</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> European</p>
</section></header><section><p>Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives series is back with another cabinet classic on Switch 2. I got to check out Jet Ski racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-aqua-jet">Aqua Jet</a> back in August, which was a lovingly crafted port. This time I'm revisiting the destructive tank combat of Namco's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Tokyo Wars</a>, which served as inspiration for The 3DO Company's N64 classic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/battletanx_global_assault">Battle Tanx: Global Assault</a>.</p>
<p>Aqua Jet was notable for having a cabinet containing a replica Jet Ski, something which can’t really be recreated on Switch (without some serious hardware modding). Tokyo Wars had a similar hardware quirk that provided a satisfying kickback to simulate your tank firing its payload. A feature that is, bafflingly, not emulated with the Switch 2 controllers' haptics.</p>
<p>Aside from the complete lack of feedback when unleashing shells on enemy tanks, this port is as clean and generously featured as I've come to expect from Hamster Corp.</p>
<p>The premise couldn't be simpler: Rival factions battle it out in the streets of Tokyo. You choose from White Force or Green Force and roll around the map, shelling any opposing tank you find, while avoiding your team’s armour. This was a great game back in the day and it's worth experiencing now, even if there isn't much to do in its two arenas.</p>
<p>This 1996 title looks as polished as it possibly could be, outside of being remastered. Visuals and audio are crisp and suit docked and undocked modes equally, with many format options to tweak the experience to your liking. Special mention goes to crisp presentation of Akihiko Ishikawa's insane music, which makes you feel like you're at a sweaty Japanese rave instead of a warzone.</p>
<p>Both English and Japanese versions of the game are playable in all available modes. Caravan time attack makes a return and can be played in split screen. Other modes can also be played in up to four-player local split screen.</p>
<p>Much like other games in the Arcade Archives, all the content in Tokyo Wars has to offer can be experienced in minutes. An additional Multiplayer mode is the only thing that would extend the lifespan of this slight experience.</p>
<p>Enjoyment comes from improving on your own performance and competing with others, as is usual with an arcade title. That said, the more of these Arcade Archives titles that Hamster Corp puts out, the more it becomes evident that an 'Arcade Archives 2 Collection' would be much more value for money than individual releases.</p></section></article><div><p>Ken Talbot has been playing games since they came in the form of cassettes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> new line of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> has had both highs and lows. The Switch RPG’s wave of superpowered transformations has its fair share of undisputed bangers like Mega Drampa, who turns from its wise old dragon form into a younger, battle-ready one, and Delphox, who defies gravity while flying on a witch’s broom. Still, there are a handful, like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>long-legged Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, that have split the community. Another of those less widely beloved Megas is Feraligatr, one of the game’s starter Pokémon, though some fan artists have been creating their own interpretations that show the design isn’t beyond salvage; it just looks kind of dumb as it’s presented in-game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000642463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642463"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642463">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When Feraligatr mega evolves, it gains a large red dorsal fin on its back that, when combined with the new spikes on its arms, creates what resembles a giant Totodile mascot head. A lot of Mega Evolutions have elements of a Pokémon’s previous evolutions, like Mega Raichu’s fur reverting to Pikachu’s signature yellow or Mega Chimecho growing a massive Chingling-shaped ornament. Mega Feraligatr’s big Totodile head is one of the most extreme examples of a Mega Evolution following this design philosophy. However, it ends up looking absurd because the giant fin on Feraligatr’s back stays flipped open like a toilet lid.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, this giant Totodile mask can bite down 10 times harder than Feraligatr’s actual jaw, so it makes sense that the water dragon would keep its fake jaw as extended as possible until it attacks. Poor guy runs around with this flapping fake jaw behind it, but as fan artists and animators have discovered, one small tweak actually improves the design significantly: just put the hood down.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">mega Feraligatr but the Totodile head doesn't flip back <a href="https://t.co/wLeCXyMCzh">pic.twitter.com/wLeCXyMCzh</a></p> <p>— doodlelotl (@Doodlelot) <a href="https://twitter.com/Doodlelot/status/1980380003952169372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">making renders of Mega Feraligatr and it would be my favorite new design if it permanently leaned into the camouflage look like this instead of the toilet seat lid <a href="https://t.co/cotsIVL85C">pic.twitter.com/cotsIVL85C</a></p> <p>— Lewtwo (@Lewchube) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1983534993638089104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Feraligatr but it actually commits to the Totodile disguise <a href="https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y">https://t.co/eviPglsE9Y</a> <a href="https://t.co/TXlOHfRaLw">pic.twitter.com/TXlOHfRaLw</a></p> <p>— Yisuno ⚝ | MEGA ENJOYER (@TheYisusOne) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheYisusOne/status/1990072615533228531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>No matter how you slice it, Mega Feraligatr’s design looks pretty silly, but it’s much easier to buy when it looks like the alligator is using the fake head as a type of camouflage rather than as if it’s&nbsp; sporting an unclosed toilet. Maybe when Mega Feraligatr appears in games and media outside of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, The Pokémon Company will give it different idle animations that could help communicate the idea better than what we’ve got. For now, we’ve got fan artists who are singlehandedly turning folks around on the design.</span></p>

<p>Twitch, on Wednesday, announced changes to how the company will tracking views for clips in order to “better reflect genuine viewer engagement”.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1991208256614854719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the company is making five specific changes that will track more views more accurately. It also continues the company’s recent efforts to combat view botting that has plagued the site for a while. </p>







<p><strong>“While clip views may initially appear lower, you’ll now have cleaner and more consistent cross-platform clips data that will ultimately help provide you with better insights into clip performance,” </strong>Twitch said. </p>



<p>As far as the specific changes go, those include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixing a technical issue that was inadvertently inflating clip view counts</li>



<li>Including clip views from Stories in clip view totals</li>



<li>Making view counting more consistent across all platforms (web, iOS, Android)</li>



<li>Better filtering out of bot traffic</li>



<li>Enabling improved clip analytics and laying the groundwork for us to explore new analytics features</li>
</ul>



<p><strong> “Going forward, we’ll continue to fine-tune our clip view counting system on an ongoing basis,”</strong> they added. </p>







<p>What do you think of the changes being implemented by Twitch for views tracking on clips?

Well multiple retailers will be selling the Prismatic Evolution Figurine Collection out of the gate. Here are the details on when I think they'll be on sale and where:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Walmart: <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2do0?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Today at 6 p.m. PT / 9 p.m. ET</a></li><li>Target: Online should drop around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDr5PW?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">10 p.m. PT on Nov. 20</a></li><li>Best Buy: Preorders never went live, so an <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdpo2x?object_uuid=2dbde68a-fca4-406a-bf06-9146eb5d5f0d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">online drop may rock up on Nov. 21</a>.

Ahead of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/aliexpress-early-black-friday-sale-2025-starts-now">Black Friday</a>, Arzopa is hosting some big markdowns on its popular lineup of portable USB monitors via its official AliExpress storefront. Combined with some general AliExpress coupon codes, these deals are the lowest prices I've seen all year long. All of the portable monitors listed ship free from the United States, which means you don't have to worry about tariffs or long shipping times.</p></div><p id="magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-l"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The L">Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230696"><div id="230696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The price on this has already dropped by nearly $100 to $455.88 compared to yesterday, so now is a better time than ever to get your preorder locked in. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and its fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-annive"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Annive">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230603"><div id="230603" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>FINAL FANTASY I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Nintendo Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Final Fantasy fans who haven't played the 2D old school games, or for those who are fans of the sprite-based RPG vibe, this is the deal for you. It features a re-arranged soundtrack by original series composer Nobuo Uematsu, improved gamplay, a user interface overhaul, auto battle options and more quality of life improvements. 47% off makes this collection a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Dragon Quest HD-2D Remakes</h2></p><div><div id="230773" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div><div id="230774" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div><div id="230775" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest I, II and III HD-2D remakes are all out now on Nintendo Switch, with I and II also out on Nintendo Switch 2.

Well it's a real deal, and here's how to do it. Start by applying for a Amazon Visa card, then if accepted you'll get an instant $60 Amazon gift card added to your account, which means free Booster Bundles, Premium Collections and Booster Blisters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're after something more expensive and want to knock the price down before using the $60 gift voucher, you'll need an AMEX or Discovery card. By paying $1 on your Pokémon TCG items in your basket, you'll receive an automatic discount up to 50%. So whatever you need to pay after the gift card is cut in half. That's not bad when you're talking Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Boxes.

Details about the hot fix, which were published in <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X/Twitter</a>, highlight a fix for those pesky defibrillators, as well as tweaks to the new limited-time Sabotage game mode and additional challenges changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players took to social media to complain of inconsistent defibrillators following the launch of the Battlefield 6 California Resistance update yesterday. Where previous versions of the game had players using the Support gadget to slide and dive in for last-second saves, changes brought about by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1120-patch-notes-include-aim-assist-tweaks-and-bloom-adjustments-as-season-1-continues"><u>update 1.1.2.0</u></a> instead asked players to slowly and precisely use the tool if they wanted to revive their friends. It’s resulted only in confusion, as the demanding requirements left teammates with what has been perceived as either a new bug or a bizarre nerf without any explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At first I thought it was just a pointless range nerf,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1p0yjlv/comment/npn1bdq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comment</a> says, “but it's also <em>much</em> more inconsistent and easy to get bodies bugged into a state where the defib doesn't work at all, and you have to grab / drag them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overall, I hate it, but that second part of it makes me think it wasn't really intentional.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team didn’t clarify what caused faulty defibrillators to pollute matches, but it sounds like they didn’t like the change either. Today’s hotfix reverts the gadget back to how it was before yesterday’s update by increasing hit-boxes and range.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Sabotage game mode has had its AFK kick timer increased from 60 seconds to 180 seconds.

                <p>Fortnite's Simpsons season is apparently about to become a landmark for Epic Games' metaverse for reasons nobody could have expected--by reportedly offering the first shirtless character sporting visible nipples. The skin in question is <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an additional version of Homer Simpson</a>, separate from the one in the battle pass, who's wearing nothing but his tighty whities.</p><p>The discussion about Fortnite skins lacking nipples goes back to 2019, when a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/terrycarter/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-nipples" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gigantic, shirtless and nipple-less digital version of Travis Scott</a> performed a concert in Battle Royale. Since then we've gotten plenty of other shirtless guys as skins--but none have had nipples. It's not really that hard to figure out why that's been the norm, though, since Fortnite's art style is not realistic or detailed enough for nipples to be anything other than weird. But with Homer, who's cel-shaded and not very detailed, they can draw a couple circles on his chest that don't look upsetting the way that more detailed nipples on, say, the Mr. Savage skin probably would.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240"></a><figcaption>This mostly-naked version of Homer Simpsons is reportedly going to be an item shop skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Homer in his underwear is a topic because this week's update added some loading screens, like the one above, that indicate pretty clearly we'll be facing off against a Giant Homer before the season ends--likely controlled by a player, similar to the Megazord and Godzilla events earlier this year. That this Giant Homer will also be a skin sold in the item shop is just a rumor for the moment, and it's possible that the model that has been datamined is merely the giant one that will roam the Battle Royale island.</p><p>But the leaker who broke this one, Dr Cacahuette, <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991079736726970702" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims</a> it has associated accessories, a Lego style, and support for kicks, all of which point to it being a player skin. It's possible it will be free, like the cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin was before the end of Remix season a year ago, but since Epic is already giving away the Cuddle Team Rider skin in a separate event, Underwear Homer is likely to be in the item shop.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/24/tales-of-berseria-review/">Tales of Berseria Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tales of Berseria review, Miguel said, <em>“Tales of Berseria feels like a Tales game made just for me. There’s so many games in the series now, and I’ll never play them all, but the characters and the narrative and the combat mechanics of Berseria just click with all of my tastes so well. For some, the lack of gameplay innovation might be a turn off, but for me, a classic Tales gameplay system combined with a unique narrative led to a fantastic experience. Fans both new and old would be doing a disservice to themselves if they didn’t check this game out.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sucker Punch has announced that a free update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will release next week, adding a New Game Plus mode, new trophies, new cosmetics and more. The patch will launch on 24th November</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - New Game+ | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New Game Plus will be playable once you’ve beaten the main game, and it does exactly what you’d expect. You get to start the game over and start off with all the skills and weapons from your first playthrough. So you’ll have a gun right from the start.</p>
<p>Of course, the point is that you’re then playing the game on a higher difficulty, and this adds two new Trophies</p>
<p>A new currency is also being added –&nbsp;Ghost Flowers –&nbsp;which can be exchanged for 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. There is also an additional tier of upgrades for existing armour sets and weapons.</p>

<p>For the game generally, the patch will let you replay content in the post-game after finishing the main story, and there’s a new stats display for this. New button mapping is available in accessibility settings, and new Photo Mode features like shutter speed and a composition grid.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly typical post-launch update that we often see for big budget games, but there’s more exciting stuff coming in 2026, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-is-coming-in-2026-as-a-free-update/">the multiplayer Legends mode has been promised</a> for then –&nbsp;again as a free update.</p>
<p>Aran was full of praise for&nbsp;Ghost of Yōtei in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">our review,</a> saying it “is an excellent game with an engrossing story, a great lead, deep combat and a land that has so much to discover with a lot of details. This is a truly worthy successor to Ghost of Tsushima.”</p>

            <p>
Ark is one of those strange series to me that seems to have a ridiculous amount of cash to dispense, what with its star-studded cast in the animated adaptation. Gerard Butler and bloody Michelle Yeoh are in it! Not to mention David Tenant, Elliot Page, Russel Crowe and Vin Diesel, the final of whom is meant to be in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-will-hopefully-release-in-early-access-by-2027-once-studio-wildcard-crack-the-dark-art-of-soulslike-combat">borderline MIA</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a>. But some of those voices will be appearing in-game through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended's</a> next expansion, Lost Colony, which now has a release date!
</p>
<p>
Said release date is a little over a month away on December 16th, and according to a press release makes direct connections between Ark's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a> and Genesis expansions, and Ark 2. It's a little bit of prep work, essentially.

<p>
Yeoh is back in her role from the animated series, alongside Tennant as his, as well as cast members like Madeleine Madden (Wheel of Time), Auli'i Cravalho (Moana), Katie Sackhoff (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a>) and Keith David (Coraline).
</p>
<p>
While this feels like an odd way to put it, Lost Colony adds in the first "canonical" expansion map into Ark: Survival Ascended, though I'm sure the presumably many Ark loreheads can speak to that better than I can. Once you start up the expansion, you'll find yourself in a big ole city where something's hunting you down. 
</p><p>
There'll be new abilities, gears, building systems, the usual expansion affair. And from today until the expansion launches, a new dino, the Ossidon, will be wandering around cold-biomes in Ragnarok, Valguero, and The Center. The trailer above puts a spotlight on this admittedly nasty looking beastie. Happy Arking, Arkers! Or Survival Ascending? You get what I mean.

                <p>David Anthony Burke, who began his music career as D4vd after uploading <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> montages to YouTube with his own original songs in 2021, has reportedly been identified as a suspect in the murder of Celeste Rivas.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/11/18/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas-death/#continued" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, law enforcement said that despite there being no official paperwork classifying Burke as a suspect yet, "investigators are looking at [him] as a suspect." Those same investigators reportedly claimed they're viewing Rivas' death as a homicide while waiting on toxicology results from the medical examiner's office.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas/3806178/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Los Angeles report</a> corroborates TMZ, stating that an LAPD officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said Burke has been uncooperative with the investigation and that he likely had help with dismembering and disposing of Rivas' body this past spring. According to law enforcement, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/decomposed-body-found-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-los-angeles-rcna230159" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who spoke to NBC News</a>, Rivas' remains were not intact when discovered.</p><p>Sources told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/singer-d4vd-considered-suspect-investigation-teen-found-dead/story?id=126591951" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News</a> that, although the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, investigators have contacted multiple people they believe were involved with the case in some way. This includes Burke.</p><p>Celeste Rivas disappeared in the Lake Elsinore area last year. She was reportedly last seen on April 5, 2024, in the western Riverside County community in Southern California. Family members said she knew Burke, and her brother, Matthew, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/body-of-teen-girl-found-in-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-what-we-know/3826873/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told NBCLA</a> that she was on her way to see a movie with him the day she disappeared.</p><p>Rivas' body was found in the front trunk of a Tesla parked in an LA tow yard on September 8. Workers noticed a foul odor coming from the vehicle, which was registered to Burke, and notified nearby authorities. Officers came through and discovered the remains in a bag, later to be identified via forensics as the missing teenager.</p><p>Burke was a rising star in the alternative R&amp;B scene, but he started as a gamer. He uploaded various Fortnite montages and anime compilations to YouTube under a channel called "ant" in 2021, but his videos kept getting copyright strikes because of his music choices. To combat this, he started creating his own songs to pair with his videos, which eventually led to his D4vd persona, which he claimed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbF7opVBnHQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Zach Sang Show interview</a> was both for SEO and the four cinematic universes (and the characters) he was building.</p><p>He quickly found popularity on TikTok and eventually signed a record deal with Interscope Records' Darkroom label. He'd then produce a single for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-calls-out-netflix-for-disrespectful-ai-made-arcane-season-2-poster/1100-6527972/" data-ref-id="1100-6527972">Arcane Season 2</a>, record the official Fortnite anthem "Locked &amp; Loaded," perform at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards in December 2024</a>, and go on a world tour in August 2025. The remaining tour dates have been canceled following Rivas' death.</p><p>According to ABC News, investigators believe that the medical examiner's office will determine the official cause of death soon. Sources said this will be a vital step in making an arrest and finalizing the charges.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragons-dogma-2-sales-top-4m-capcom-reveals.1358365/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that its open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, so if you're hoping for more titles in the series, this should hopefully serve as a strong motivator for the publisher.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1990948257384526335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media earlier today, Capcom announced that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>sales have hit four million. That, naturally, includes all of the platforms on which the game is available, as well as both physical and digital shipments.</p>

<p>To celebrate the new milestone, Capcom also released a new piece of artwork thanking players who've already picked the game up. It's pretty heartwarming, so feel free to give yourself a pat on the back if you're one of the "Arisen" the artwork is thanking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=9iNNBoim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-sales-4m-artwork.jpg?itok=fq_TzvMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has reached four million sales around the world.</figcaption></figure><p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass another 1.5 million sales for itself since last count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>, so it's selling pretty steadily, if perhaps not quite as meteorically as some of Capcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">other titles</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>, it's the sequel to the 2012 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>, with that game's director Hideaki Itsuno returning to direct (although he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">since departed Capcom</a> to join Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios).</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>is a sequel (the clue's in that number after the name), it's perhaps better thought of as a reboot or a followup; it takes place in a parallel world and doesn't require any knowledge of the first game to enjoy.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of the Arisen, who must command Pawns in order to slay a dragon, all while exploring a vast open world littered with sidequests and locations to discover.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-mode-coming-next-week.1358362/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Sucker Punch have announced that open-world action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>is getting a New Game Plus mode next week, so you'll soon be able to start a fresh run tooled up to the nines.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony reveals that New Game Plus is coming to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>on November 24th (that's this coming Monday at time of writing). As you'd expect, it'll allow you to start a new run with all of your armor, abilities, and weapons from your previous playthrough.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s main story before you can enjoy New Game Plus, but once you've unlocked the mode, you can also look forward to two extra difficulty levels to challenge you even further, plus two new Trophies to earn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-duel.jpg?itok=XXSCSW_d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-new-game-plus-duel.jpg?itok=81XRKgb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to jump into New Game Plus mode in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>New Game Plus will also bring a new Ghost Flower currency that can be exchanged for new cosmetic armor sets and weapon dyes, as well as ten new charms and an extra tier of armor and weapon upgrades.</p>

<p>This update isn't just bringing New Game Plus goodies, however. It's also introducing replayable content once you've finished the main game, and a new stats screen will tell you just how well you did when you replay said content.</p>

<p>New accessibility options, including directional button remapping, are also on the way, along with enhanced Photo Mode features like a new composition grid and adjustable shutter speed to help you snap that perfect shot.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, it's the second game in what is now Sony and Sucker Punch's&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>franchise. It serves as an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">indirect followup</a> to 2019's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, pitting new protagonist Atsu against the Yotei Six, who slaughtered her family years before the game's narrative takes place.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-new-ghost-in-familiar-tale" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-finals-ps4-support-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-when-season-10-begins-in-march.1358359/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Embark Studios has announced that its competitive FPS&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>will be losing PS4 support next year, so if you're still playing on Sony's last-gen console, it might be time to upgrade.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/reachthefinals/status/1990810282529046592" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Embark says that PS4 support for the game will be coming to an end on March 18th, which is also when the shooter's tenth season is set to start.</p>

<p>Embark says it's retiring the game on PS4 in order to "focus [its] support on current generation hardware", and it's far from alone in making that decision; it joins illustrious company like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow"><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s HoYoverse</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG</em>'s Krafton</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-gold.jpg?itok=bqZXBdA4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-finals-ps4-support-ending-gold.jpg?itok=CeCk3NWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>is losing PS4 support soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If and when you do decide to make the leap from PS4, all of the progress you've made on&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>will be stored in your Embark account, so you'll be able to pick up where you left off wherever you are.</p>

<p>This news also doesn't affect players on current-gen platforms or PC, nor does it affect Xbox One owners, because, well,&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>never got itself an Xbox One release. In fact, judging from <a href="https://x.com/jordychinchin/status/1990914208905515479" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of the <a href="https://x.com/0xmikubeam/status/1991020255057961288" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">replies</a> to Embark's social media message, many people were unaware&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em> was available on PS4.</p>

<p>News of <i>The Finals</i>' sunsetting on PS4 comes as Embark Studios celebrates another major success, namely extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, which launched last month to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" rel="nofollow">very strong sales indeed</a>.</p>

<p>That game looks set to become part of Embark's regular stable alongside <em>The Finals</em>; it's already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-cosmetics-duos" rel="nofollow">received a major update</a> lowering some of its cosmetic prices and rebalancing duo queueing, and more updates and patches are planned for the future as well.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-lore-youtube-book-2000645459</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/over-20-hours-of-elden-ring-lore-is-about-to-become-a-400-page-book.1358353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The lore-YouTuber-to-book-publisher pipeline is alive and well. <em>Borderlands 4</em> has another busted exploit, and fired Rockstar devs aren’t going quietly. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. According to a handful of Polymarket weirdos, <em>Half-Life 3</em> has a 56 percent chance of being announced before 2027 but only a 7 percent chance of arriving before the end of 2025. Fans are <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">getting ready either way</a>.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s unofficial YouTube lore master is putting out a 400-page book</h2>  <p>Michael “VaatiVidya” Samuels’ YouTube channel is where everyone who loves FromSoftware games but can’t make heads or tails of their stories while playing goes to figure out what the hell is actually going on. He’ll now be boiling down dozens of hours of video into a more digestible form, assuming you belong to an age cohort that’s still literate. <em>Lore Bound: Elden Ring Explained</em> starts at just $42 for the softback version and comes with a magnificent cover.</p>

 <p>“This book will bind together everything I’ve learned from <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, and <em>Nightreign</em> into one single volume,” VaatiVidya <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkxxl2QfRJDpRsk_HP0kzlQBg9jYy1PQU6D">said on YouTube</a>. “My old video scripts will be updated, new illustrations will be commissioned, and every effort will be made to ensure each page is clear and engaging.” It arrives just in time to explain the games before the upcoming Hollywood adaptation arrives. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-movie-alex-garland-hidetaka-miyazaki-atari-2000620675">I’m sure Alex Garland will be buying a copy</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> glitch lets you speedrun the skill tree</h2> <p>Normally, you have to invest tons of points per Vault Hunter to unlock their strongest abilities at the bottom of their skill trees. There’s a shortcut, however. YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Joltzdude139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joltzdude139</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-glitch-unlock-late-game-skills-without-wasting-points/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>) explains how it works. The glitch revolves around repeatedly using the “dump all points option” and reversing it to trick the game into thinking you’ve spent more points than you have.</p>

 <p>Time consuming though it may be, it eventually unlocks the whole tree without using all your points to engineer more busted builds, at least until it <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1990927794000572519?s=20">gets patched out</a>. The full video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwmTrfhPuhw">will take you through all the steps</a>.</p> <h2>Fired <em>GTA 6</em> devs are still protesting outside Rockstar</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fired GTA 6 devs held a protest outside the Rockstar offices in Edinburgh and the Scottish Parliament</p> <p>"GTA 6 will make billions… But I want people to think of the human cost" <a href="https://t.co/pssbIt30LK">pic.twitter.com/pssbIt30LK</a></p> <p>— Dexerto (@Dexerto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1990857470000967749?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I was scared at first, I was apprehensive to join,” one of them said outside the studio’s Edinburgh office this week, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/fired-gta-6-devs-speak-out-about-working-conditions-at-rockstar-at-protests-outside-offices-3284831/"><em>Dexerto</em> reports</a>. “Like many of my colleagues in QA I always felt a bit more dispensable and a bit less skilled than workers in other departments,” he said. “I thought that by joining the union, I could be putting a target on my back. No one should ever feel this way when organizing in their workplace.”</p>

 <p>The studio has yet to elaborate on the firings beyond accusing the developers of leaking company secrets. The matter is currently awaiting review before the UK’s employment tribunal. <em>GTA 6</em> is currently set to release exactly one year from today.</p>

 <h2>Having trouble reviving friends in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? You’re not alone</h2> <p>The shooter’s latest major patch apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1990751823146389872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1990751823146389872%7Ctwgr%5Ef30118f2c4253b9223e8b70a1499cb41306c14da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbattlefield-6-defibs-broken-latest-update%2F">broke defibrillators</a>. Many players have reported “watching friendlies try and revive right now and so many of the hits are failing.” The game’s designers are already <a href="http://I've seen quite a few reports yeah, will investigate what's happening">investigating the issue</a>, so a fix might be on the way by this weekend. <strong>Update 11/19/2025 1:27 p.m. ET:</strong> that was quick! A <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339?s=20">new update</a> is already live.</p>

 <h2>Where is <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>‘s big expansion?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">YOU'RE WELCOME NOW GIVE US DLC PLEASE <a href="https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e">https://t.co/PaN5bzYr0e</a></p> <p>— FightinCowboy (@Fightincowboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fightincowboy/status/1990950415048061015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans are still hoping for a <em>Dark Arisen</em>-style DLC now that the friction-filled action-RPG has sold 4 million copies. Hideaki Itsuno left to join Tencent’s LightSpeed Studios shortly after release, however, so who knows what Capcom is planning.</p> <h2><em>Dragon Quest 7</em> is being reimagined as a shorter game</h2> <p>Usually, remakes add more content. <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> will take some out. The PS1 version was already over 100 hours. The 3DS remaster was a bit shorter. Square Enix is cutting even more content to streamline the latest version. “Some of the [stories] have now been made optional, so you can play them in any order you want,” producer Takeshi Ichikawa <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/at-100-hours-dragon-quest-7-is-an-enormous-jrpg-so-in-the-reimagined-remake-a-few-of-the-stories-which-werent-100-percent-relevant-to-the-main-storyline-have-just-been-cut-entirely/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>.” He added, “a few of the stories which weren’t 100 percent relevant to the main storyline have just been cut entirely.” I hope the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> team isn’t listening.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"><em>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> campaign is very weird and very bad</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/morsels-roguelike-binding-isaac-pokemon-2000645175">Morsels, on the other hand, is super surreal and incredibly cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103">Is the center of gaming really moving from console to PC?</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
