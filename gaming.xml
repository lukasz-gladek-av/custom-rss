			<p>Half-Life 3 fans were not nearly sated by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware announcements Valve made last week</a> (the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller, all due sometime early next year). They believed before those announcements and their faith was renewed when several insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> to the game's existence and potential imminent launch. Now, though, more sources have added fuel to the hype, just as the franchise celebrates the 27th anniversary since the release of the original Half-Life.</p>



<ul>
<li>Insider Nate the Hate, who has a solid track record, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990879872751735291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that his sources also spoke about Half-Life 3. However, he received some conflicting information on the announcement timing; one of the things he heard was that it was going to happen at noon yesterday, which obviously wasn't the case.</li>



<li>Shpeshal_Nick, who has a slightly more checkered track record, <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1990890439633682499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>: <em>Last week I got a DM that Valve was showing off hardware “this week” (last week) and software “next week” (this week). This software was allegedly Half-Life 3.</em></li>



<li>The Verge journalist Sean Hollister was among those invited to Valve's headquarters for the aforementioned hardware announcements. In a brief story <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the website</a>, he noted that the developer's halls were strangely filled with security guards, which never happened on his previous visits. The story also included a picture of a Steam Machine visually customized with several memes, including a title that starts with H and is 'censored'. Fans took it as a tease from Valve that soon, it might not be censored anymore, at long last.</li>
</ul>



<p>Traces of a game project codenamed HLX were discovered through extensive data mining and references across Source 2 engine updates. Tyler McVicker alleged <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as early as this past May</a> that the project believed to be Half-Life 3 was almost at the end of its development. </p>



<p>Needless to say, an announcement on the anniversary of the debut installment in the franchise would make a lot of sense. Besides, Valve unveiled its upcoming hardware exactly a week ago, so if they did want to space their news evenly, today would be the day for the next announcement.</p>

            <p>Sometimes things happen that you can't control. That's now been the case for developers Permadeath and their 2D sandbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/385380/Planet_Centauri/">Planet Centauri</a> twice on Steam, with first a wishlist bug and more recently the reveal of Valve's new hardware landing at just the right time to make the devs' task of getting eyeballs on their game more challenging than it would normally be.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/planet-centauri-steam-machine-announcement-valve-daily-deal-sale/">Polygon</a>, Planet Centauri's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/385380/view/519699831627710608?l=english">1.0 launch</a> in December last year saw it run into what its developers were later informed by Valve to be "a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent". Oof. Valve, to their credit, did offer Permadeath a make-good in the form of having the game pop up as one of Steam's daily deals, which the steamy storerunners hoped would "help make up for lost visibility" from that launch day bug.</p>
<p>The studio were reportedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/">initially hesitant</a> to take up the offer, but ended up picking November 12th from a selection of dates Valve offered. That day rolled around and boom: Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-a-new-steam-machine-steam-controller-and-the-steam-frame-vr-headset-and-ive-played-them">announced</a> a new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and the Steam Frame VR headset. Naturally, Valve switched up the Steam storefront to blare that big news front and centre, making it much more difficult than usually might be the case for any deals or sales to stick out and catch folks' attention.</p>
<p>Laurent Lechat, one of Planet Centauri's devs, says they've had to chalk this up to yet another instance of "bad luck". They know they couldn't have expected Valve to offer a heads up by blabbing their big Steam device news to the studio ahead of time. "The day was chosen more or less randomly on our end," Lechat said. There's perhaps an argument that, depending on when it locked in that date for the big reveals, Valve could have blocked out the 12th as a no-go zone for deals, so whichever games might have been in line to be featured during it didn't end up in a battle they'd not expect.</p><p>Though, Permadeath's devs make clear that they did still get some traction out of the daily deal, despite the tough eyeball competition. A little over 5,000 copies shifted on that day, which is less than the studio hoped and apparently less than the bump in coverage when the news of the bug affecting Planet Centauri's 1.0 launch netted them when it broke a couple of months ago.</p>
<p>Despite that, Lechat stressed that these sales will still aid in the studio's efforts to keep on trucking, saying: "what seems like a small amount will be a great help because it's enough for us to survive for at least a year and allow us to finish our second game, which is currently in development." That game's a 2D roguelike which'll be getting a demo when it's ready and won't be following Planet Centauri's early access path.</p>
<p>What the latter's fate in terms of further updates ends up being depends on how well its fresher sibling does. Permadeath aren't against returning to it, even if Lechat understandably has "the feeling that Planet Centauri is cursed" given just how much fun it's run into over the past year and a bit.</p>

            <p>The developer of indie game Megabonk has withdrawn from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game.</p>
<p>Following the nominations reveal earlier this week, the developer of the game has admitted Megabonk is in fact not his debut game - he's been making games under different studio names.</p>
<p>"I'm withdrawing from The Game Awards," the developer shared on social media. "It's an honour and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'. I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game."</p>

<p>He added: "I really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. You should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! Thanks again! new megabonk update coming soon."</p>
<p>The post is signed off as John Megabonk and includes a disguised face emoji. That's because the developer himself is something of a mystery, which has inevitably, confusingly, led to this nomination.</p> <div>

            <p>A new Battlefield 6 update has extended the time required to capture objectives in one of its major game modes, and has gone back to fix an ongoing issue with its challenge system. In addition, somehow, many players had their controls reset. Accidentally, one assumes.</p>
<p>The major game mode change comes to Escalation, a new mode to Battlefield 6, where large teams of players fight over a limited number of control points. When one of these is captured, a control point is removed from the match.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1990799899080688037">The official statement</a> released alongside this change states: "Following your feedback to our communication last week, Escalation now has had its time increased for capturing objectives by roughly 20 percent, extending the length of each phase for a smoother, more tactical flow. This change gives your squad more time to react, reposition, and coordinate vehicle spawns while maintaining the mode's fast-paced intensity."</p>

</figure>
<p>Next up, a fix to challenges not being registered as completed despite players reaching the required milestone. This appears to have been a consequence of the widespread challenge adjustments made a short while ago, shifting them to be easier to finish in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">player frustrations at how difficult completing some challenges were</a>.</p><p>The statement explains this should  now be remedied in the latest update. It reads: "We've also deployed backend fixes for challenge rewards not unlocking correctly. These updates address issues where completed challenges could fail to grant rewards or appear multiple times. Participating in a match should now reward you with any outstanding rewards from challenges."</p>
<p>Finally, a fun little change to kill-death statistics has been made, so kills made against computer-controlled bots no longer count for player statistics (often used as evidence of player skill). Funnily enough, deaths to bots still appear to be counted, so bots may still be able to make you look <em>worse</em> at Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The Battlefield update statement concludes with: "Additionally, we have also rolled out a small change to how Player Kill/Death statistics are shown within your Player Profile. Going forward Portal Kill/Death Statistics will no longer be listed within the Kill/Death amount on your profile and Kill will only showcase Human Kills. Portal statistics will be shown in a different capacity in a future time."</p>
<p>Then there's what is clearly an unintended consequence of this update, which are widespread reports of reset controls following its addition to Battlefield 6. Across social media and community hubs like Discord and Reddit, users are complaining about their own custom control schemes being reset to the default. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1p0ef5a/comment/npibpyw/?context=3">Take Spetsnaz_420</a>, who wrote: "You left out the part where you reset our controls".</p><p>This marks the latest in an extensive spree of updates made to Battlefield 6. It was just over a week ago when Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-update-fixes-recon-drone-exploit-letting-players-ride-them-into-the-sky-without-a-care-in-the-world">killed the Recon Drone bug</a> letting players float far up into the sky. All while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the game remains incredibly popular</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/report/823233/fortnite-epic-games-unity-creators-developers-tim-sweeney-matt-bromberg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-getting-unity-games.1357636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is teaming up with arguably its biggest game development rival, Unity, to bring games made using Unity’s engine into <em>Fortnite</em>. The change will mean that Unity games could sit alongside Epic’s own suite of experiences as well as those created by third-party developers using the Unreal Editor for <em>Fortnite</em> — and it opens the door for significantly more games to be available to play within <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>“Just like the early days of the web, we believe that companies need to work together in order to build the open metaverse in a way that’s interoperable and fair,” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney says in a statement. “Working alongside Unity we’re helping developers build fun games, reach bigger audiences, and find success.”</p><p>The change represents an important step in Epic’s long-running vision of turning <em>Fortnite</em> into an open metaverse that’s a big 3D social space with a huge number of experiences to participate in with your friends. Epic has been marching down this path for years with <em>Fortnite</em> itself by putting an increased focus on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">creator-made experiences</a> and making browsing through those experiences in the Fortnite lobby feel like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/11/23912919/fortnite-creator-made-maps-youtube-redesign">scrolling YouTube</a>. You can even check out experiences on the web — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223669/fortnites-item-shop-is-now-on-the-web-too">buy new <em>Fortnite</em> outfits in your browser, too</a>.</p><p>Right now, <em>Fortnite</em> is a closed ecosystem, meaning that creators can only make games for the platform using Epic’s tools, can’t (yet) easily drop those games into Unreal Engine to bring them to other platforms, or bring experiences built on other engines into <em>Fortnite</em>. But even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652928/tim-sweeney-interview-epic-games-fortnite-metaverse">in 2023</a>, Tim Sweeney was telling <em>The Verge</em> how much he believed in the future of interoperable game engines being key to his vision.</p><p>Epic has had some success expanding <em>Fortnite</em> from being a battle royale into a broad, <em>Roblox</em>-like ecosystem with games from outside creators. By the end of last year, it <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?lang=en-US">had 70,000 total creators</a> that published nearly 200,000 “islands,” or <em>Fortnite</em>’s term for experiences. But the Unity Editor, which is designed to help developers build their games once and run them across multiple platforms, has more than <a href="https://unity.com/our-company">1.2 <em>million</em> monthly active users</a>. Even a fraction of those developers also bringing their games to <em>Fortnite</em> could add a lot to the platform.</p><p>The plan is to allow Unity games to come to <em>Fortnite</em> next year, Matt Bromberg, President and CEO of Unity, tells <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>The partnership potentially gives developers another potential avenue to find an audience and monetize their games, which could be a lifeline for smaller developers amid continued <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">industry struggles</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">layoffs</a>. It could also consolidate even more power into <em>Fortnite</em>, which is already a behemoth. But Sweeney actually envisions a world for <em>Fortnite</em> that’s much more decentralized — more like the open web.</p><p>“<em>Fortnite</em>’s still this big thing operated by Epic completely,” Sweeney says. “But there will be a day when you can, from the program that’s currently called <em>Fortnite</em>, go to other sites that are completely controlled by other companies. We have nothing to do with them. We make no revenue from them. We don’t have commercial agreements with them. They’re just like websites on the web.” Today’s news with Unity is the first opportunity for “the rubber to meet the road” of engines that are operating together.</p><p>For now, whether a creator makes a <em>Fortnite</em> experience using <em>Fortnite</em>’s tools or with Unity, Sweeney says there will be a review process to ensure that it’s “ratings-compliant and works adequately.” But in the future, “as this evolves into a completely open system, we’d only have reviews for stuff that we host, and anybody would be able to put anything anywhere, and people would be able to browse to it like you do in a web browser today.”</p><p>Allowing Unity games will “greatly expand the developer base,” Sweeney says. “The challenge of building content in <em>Fortnite</em> today is you start from scratch.” You can’t currently take an Unreal Engine game and deploy it into <em>Fortnite</em> — that’s something that Epic is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/5/24262376/epic-unreal-engine-6-fortnite-metaverse-plans">aiming for with Unreal Engine 6</a>, which is likely years away. Ironically, Sweeney says, “publishing Unity games into <em>Fortnite</em> will happen before publishing standalone Unreal Engine games into <em>Fortnite</em>.”</p><p>There’s a second component to today’s news, too: Unity will bring support for Unreal Engine to the commerce management platform <a href="https://unity.com/news/unity-launches-native-cross-platform-commerce-management-for-game-developers-worldwide">it announced last month</a>, which lets developers manage their digital storefronts across many platforms from all inside Unity Engine. That was pitched at the time as a way to make it much easier to deal with the complexities of different storefronts and payment processors.</p><p>Bringing support for Unreal Engine to the platform gives developers “more choice around how they build stores and how they manage those stores,” Bromberg says. “Ultimately, I think the thing that Tim and I couldn’t agree any more strongly on is that having more choice and more places where developers can build things and giving them more control over their destinies is the most important thing we can do to help the gaming ecosystem.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/823233/fortnite-epic-games-unity-creators-developers-tim-sweeney-matt-bromberg]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has proudly announced that its latest new release, the city building strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, has registered a record launch for the franchise. There have been seven Anno installments released throughout 25 years, but none captivated the audience as much as the title that launched last week.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft Mainz (previously known as Blue Byte), Anno 117: Pax Romana secured the second spot on last week's Steam chart, beating even Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which launched only a day later. You don't have to take the publisher's word for it, as SteamDB <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1990789664811172057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the news with the following Steam Top 5 chart for the week between November 11 and 18:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Anno 117: Pax Romana</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6 </li>



<li>Steam Deck</li>
</ul>



<p>Granted, Black Ops 7 famously delivered its own records, albeit negative, when it comes to the Call of Duty franchise. On Steam, the game only reached a concurrent player peak of around 100K users, whereas Black Ops 6 peaked at 315K when it launched last year.</p>



<p>That has, however, little to do with Anno 117: Pax Romana, whose developers are right to celebrate. Even critical acclaim is unprecedented so far, with a Metacritic average of 85 and 94% of OpenCritic reviews recommending the game. Perhaps the most important data point is that users are playing it a lot: the average daily playtime is 3,7 hours.</p>

<p>Stéphane Jankowski, Executive Producer on Anno, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana officially sets sail, marking a new chapter for our beloved franchise and for everyone who poured their passion, creativity, and countless hours into it. We are humbled by the incredible response from our player. Our team remains dedicated, continuously listening to feedback and striving to deliver the ambitious Year 1 content expanding our game world to the province of Egypt!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent video uploaded to YouTube, iconic Vietnamese League of Legends pro player, Đỗ “Levi” Duy Khánh, announced his official retirement from active competition. He cited wanting to spend more time on himself and start a family, and suggested he can’t do that while he continues to compete professionally.</p>



<p>Instead, Levi will step away and focus on content creation and streaming, continuing to contribute to the League of Legends scene by broadcasting content to the hundreds of thousands of followers he has amassed over the years.</p>











<p>Levi has been competing in the League of Legends space more or less since the game’s esports scene blew up. He’s been a solid player since 2013, and in his recent farewell video, Levi explained that League was ‘the answer’ to what he wanted to do with his life.</p>



<p>He would go on to become known as one of the most effective junglers in League of Legends.</p>



<p>In his video, Levi said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that, in the future, I’ll be happier, smile more, and continue to be with you all. It’s time to say goodbye to the professional League of Legends Levi and welcome the beginning of the streamer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Pacific region, especially, Levi is something of a legend, and he’s arguably the best player to ever emerge from Vietnam.</p>



<p>Here’s Levi’s full farewell video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mình chính thức giải nghệ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GVw842VlpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Like many other retired esports competitors, Levi will now turn his attention to content creation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I love streaming. Even while I was competing, I spent a lot of my free time streaming and interacting with everyone. I love making people laugh. I’ll still play League of Legends and watch official matches.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-age-estimation-feature-users-concerned/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-adding-new-%E2%80%98age-estimation%E2%80%99-feature-that-has-users-concerned.1357600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Roblox is taking another step into the realm of child safety by setting up an age estimation feature that <strong>must be used </strong>before users can chat to anyone within the ecosystem, it has been revealed. From December, users worldwide will be forced to complete an age estimation process if they want to use Roblox to message any other player, but not everyone is pleased.</p>



<p>This is because the age estimation is being achieved via an AI-supported platform called Persona. Users will need to upload a picture of themselves, which is then analyzed by AI, and subsequently placed into an ‘age group’ that remains inherently restricted.</p>



<h2 id="h-good-not-great">Good, Not Great</h2>



<p>The Roblox Corporation has been closely scrutinized over the last year or so, with several significant lawsuits being filed against the company because it does not do enough to protect children using the platform. It has been claimed numerous times that Roblox is a breeding ground for predators, and even Chris Hansen came out to make a damning documentary against the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The latest ‘safety standard’ will see Roblox introduce an age estimation process that will start being deployed as early as next month.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent release</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become&nbsp;Trusted Connections&nbsp;with people they know.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It begins in regions like Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, but by January, the rest of the world will be pulled into the optional age estimation check. If you want to chat on Roblox, you <strong>must </strong>verify your ‘age group’.</p>



<p>The Roblox Corporation explained how this will work:<br></p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of our ongoing consultations with child development experts, we’ve defined common-sense limits on who can chat together on Roblox. After users complete the age check process, we will inform them of their assigned age group: Under 9, 9-12, 13-15, 16-17, 18-20, or 21+. Users will be able to chat with those in their own age group and similar age groups, as appropriate.</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Elisa (estimated age 12):&nbsp;</strong>Elisa has access to chat with users aged 15 or younger in Experience chat. All users 16 or older are prevented from initiating or engaging in chat with her.</li>



<li><strong>Marcus (estimated age 18):&nbsp;</strong>Marcus has access to chat with users aged 16 or older and could add a younger sibling as a Trusted Connection, as long as they are 13 or older.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Roblox claims that more than 145 new ‘safety innovations’ have been deployed this year alone, but critics remain sceptical. This latest evolution has users concerned about uploading images of children to a platform powered by AI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The recent Flank Invitational has been perfect for allowing fans of the Call of Duty League a glimpse at how pro players are getting to grips with Black Ops 7’s movement mechanics. The near-future title boasts wall-hopping, faster pacing, and a more technical theme that allows the movement kings of the COD League to really finesse their opponents.</p>



<p>In a recent clip that surfaced on social media, OpTic Texas’ Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was seen dunking on Envoy, Abuzah, and Neptune in a slick 1 v 3 that seemed effortless for the recent world champion.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-optic-texas-make-history-again">Can OpTic Texas Make History Again?</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas is moving differently in Black Ops 7, despite Shotzzy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/">having early concerns</a> about the game’s aim assist mechanics. This game facilitates slick, fast-paced movement, which fits nicely into the wheelhouse of these players.</p>



<p>Huke, especially, is having a brilliant time, with fans recognizing a callback to the Advanced Warfare and Infinite Warfare era of competitive Call of Duty, otherwise known as the ‘Jetpack’ era.</p>



<p>Here’s a clip that surfaced recently on Reddit showing Huke piecing apart a more than capable trio during The Flank’s Black Ops 7 Invitational tournament:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Months ago, Huke was a pivotal part of OpTic Texas securing back-to-back world championship titles, and even more recently, he was part of the squad that secured the top spot at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>Going into the CDL 2026 season, the OpTic Texas roster is looking <strong>white hot</strong>, and there are high expectations for the team in the coming months. Could this be a third consecutive COD League Championship for the organization?</p>



<p>Let me know what you think OpTic Texas’ chances are for a three-peat next season on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-19">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 19)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #892:</p>



<ul>
<li>SQUAT</li>



<li>SHEPHERD</li>



<li>PIT</li>



<li>FALL</li>



<li>LUNGE</li>



<li>LEAD</li>



<li>SKINK</li>



<li>SOLID</li>



<li>HUSKY</li>



<li>CASK</li>



<li>DIRECT</li>



<li>COLONY</li>



<li>GUIDE</li>



<li>THINK</li>



<li>MASQUE</li>



<li>HEARTH</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>All straightforward descriptors for a compact, sturdy build.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Clear verbs meaning “to show the way” or “influence direction.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>“The Cask of Amontillado,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” “The Masque of the Red Death,” “The Pit and the Pendulum.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each is a valid word formed from a body organ plus a single trailing letter.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 19.</p>

        <p><em>Bang! Bang! Bandits</em> is a completely original gun shooting game that, while preserving the tension and exhilaration of the classic gun shooting game genre, features simple rules and controls, bright pop-style characters, and an easy-to-understand world, allowing people of all ages to play with peace of mind.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Simple Rules and Controls Enable Anyone to Play</strong> – Using the Joy-Con like a handgun, simply hold it in one hand, aim at the enemies on the screen, and shoot! With unlimited ammo, you can shoot endlessly and stress-free. Plus, since field movement is fully automatic, you can focus entirely on attacking. In addition, the rules are simple and straightforward—your score is based on the coins you collect by defeating enemies and destroying obstacles, so even young children can play with ease.</li><li><strong>Packed with Fun Across 12 Stages and Two Leagues</strong> – The game features 12 distinct stages set in environments such as a jungle, city, ruins, and caves. After clearing all stages in the standard-difficulty “Normal League,” the max-difficulty “Wild League” awaits!</li><li><strong>Unique Enemy Characters Wreak Havoc All Over the Screen</strong> – As you defeat enemies called “Goomins” that rain down on you one after another, make your way to the end of each stage, where a brutal boss awaits!</li><li><strong>Enjoy Two Gameplay Styles with Challenge Mode and Battle Modes</strong> – In “Challenge Mode,” you start from lower-level stages and work your way up to the most difficult ones. You can play solo or in a team of two to four players, cooperating with family and friends to clear each stage. Additionally, two to four players can compete for the high score in “Single Battle” (individual play), or two teams of two players each can face off in “Team Battle.”</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/bang-bang-bandits-nintendo-switch-2-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking to Australian <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in/">game website Stevivor recently</a>, Requiem's producer Masato Kumazawa revealed there is currently "no plan" to make a demo accessible to the general public "at this stage". The team instead wants to focus its energy on "finishing off the game", which is due out early next year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our development team is just doing its best to make sure that it's creating the best quality game; to make sure that it's a fine product."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there's seemingly no demo planned for digital stores in the lead up to release, there has already been Requiem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">demos at events like the Tokyo Game Show</a>. Past Resident Evil titles, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a>, have also received demos to reel players in, and Capcom has even offered other game demos on the Switch 2 like one for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>So, no demo for now. If you are eager to see something before then, below is some handheld gameplay we captured at TGS this year. You can read more about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">entire experience in our hands on preview</a>. Resident Evil Requiem will launch for Switch 2 and other platforms next year on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're curious to see what other demos are available on the Switch 2 eShop, be sure to check out our Nintendo Life guide.</p>

<p>How do you feel about Capcom potentially not offering a demo for this title ahead of its Switch 2 release? Will you be getting it day one, or are you going to hold out and see what critics and fans have to say if you can't test it out for yourself? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 is Going Free to Play From November 25 for One Week]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6, the latest ambitious shooter in the legendary first-person franchise, is preparing to go free-to-play for a week, starting November 25. In a recent blog post, Electronic Arts (and associated studios) revealed the free trial period that’s opening up for Battlefield 6, which will likely be accompanied by a considerable discount on the game as Black Friday surfaces.</p>



<p>This limited-time, restricted-scope offering will allow players to experience a fair chunk of Battlefield 6 without investing a penny in the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-free-trial-coming-soon">Battlefield 6 Free Trial Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a blog post on the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA website</a>, the Battlefield 6 free trial period was revealed by the team. It was promised that ‘more information’ will be published soon, but for now, we have a description of what the free trial entails:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free** for everyone. Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield’s iconic massive scale warfare in Conquest or Breakthrough. Go head-to-head destroying enemy cargo in Sabotage. Engage in pure high-intensity close-quarters combat in Team Deathmatch. This is your call to squad up. Make it count.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free trial showcases Battlefield 6’s new mode, Sabotage, which was released in the latest update just days ago. Typically, first-person shooters like Call of Duty and anything else in that vein offer free trial <strong>weekends</strong>, so an entire week for Battlefield 6’s free trial window is obviously above and beyond.</p>



<p>It’s widely assumed that the progress you rack up during the free trial week will roll over into the full game, should you choose to upgrade at any point. In a week, you can grind the living daylights out of the game and unlock stacks of content, so you might be persuaded if a good enough sale goes live to accompany the trial.</p>







<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/">Battlefield 6 review</a>, we said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you plan on playing Battlefield 6 during the free trial week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Game Awards Removes Nomination for the First Time Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-megabonk-nomination-withdrawal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-removes-nomination-for-the-first-time-ever.1357510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time ever, a nomination has been revoked from The Game Awards. The game in question, Megabonk, was disqualified with permission from the creator after a misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Since 2014,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>&nbsp;have become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, it’s become home to several big reveals and moments, especially for Game of the Year. With a year as big as 2025 was for games, the competition is sure to be worthy of watching. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a> came out earlier this week and had some snubs and surprises. However, it seems there’s already been a shakeup with one of the nominated games.</p>



<h2 id="h-megabonk-disqualified-from-best-debut-game-at-the-game-awards-2025">Megabonk Disqualified from Best Debut Game at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to vedinad</figcaption></figure>



<p>The situation unraveled after The Game Awards nominations earlier this week. Megabonk, one of the games’ up for Best Debut Indie Game, was a pretty popular title when it released. However, the creator, who, <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the Tweets</a>, goes by John Megabonk, asked to be removed from the nominations. As for why, he said the following:</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m withdrawing from The Game Awards. It’s an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don’t think it qualifies for the category ‘Debut Indie Game,’</strong>” the creator said. “<strong>I’ve made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game.</strong>“<a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603"></a></p>



<p>The category, Best Debut Indie Game, is reserved for those who’ve published their first-ever game as a studio, so those who have, even under a different name, shouldn’t count. Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later posted on Twitter</a> that, after the creator’s comments, that <strong>Megabonk would be taken off the list</strong>. This now leaves&nbsp;Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Despolete, and Dispatch as the sole nominees. While it is shocking to see, at least the creator was honest about the situation. Unfortunately, Megabonk was only nominated for the one category so, while they won’t be going home with anything this year, at least it was on a good note.</p>







<p>What do you think of Megabonk being disqualified from The Game Awards? Do you agree with the withdrawal? Did you think it could’ve won the category?

Next year, instead of a new game, the company will opt to release a paid expansion for <em>F1 25</em> as part of “a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">EA says</a>. The next full <em>F1</em> game, a “reimagined” experience, will arrive in 2027.</p><p>The 2026 DLC for <em>F1 25</em> is a “premium content update” that will “align with the sport’s major changes for the 2026 season, bringing fans new cars, sporting regulations, teams, and drivers,” <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/EA-SPORTS-Announces-Plans-for-Future-EA-SPORTS-F1-Experiences-Including-2026-FIA-Formula-One-World-Championship-Season-Expansion--All-New-F1-Game-in-2027/default.aspx">according to EA’s press release</a>.

              <p>Merry Christmas! But sorry, I think you must have been bad because all I have to offer you is this new Walmart commercial starring <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-news-goggins-wrapped-done-filming-2026-1851779855">Walton Goggins, aka the Ghoul from Amazon’s<em> Fallout</em> series</a>, in a crass attempt to cash in on millennial nostalgia for that Jim Carrey Grinch movie.</p> <p>Yup, Walton Goggins took what I assume was a sizeable paycheck to star in a new, very expensive-looking Walmart ad that is clearly inspired by Dr. Seuss’ holiday classic <em>How The Grinch Stole</em> Christmas, and more specifically by the 2000 film adaptation starring Jim Carrey. (Nobody tell Amazon that Goggins is in a Walmart ad!) Goggins not only looks like Carrey’s Grinch, but even (mostly) does a solid impersonation of the comedian’s famous portrayal of the Christmas-hating monster. Here’s the ad:</p>

  <p>It’s better than the animated movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch,that you likely forgot even got made, but come on, Goggins. How much money do you need? Really,&nbsp;I can spot you a fifty if that helps you avoid shit like this.</p> <p>As I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-59-best-ads-celebs-ford-keoghan-selling-out-1851759498">we really need to once again start bullying celebrities and actors who do TV commercials</a>. Selling out isn’t cool, kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/dS5N8EAOtVE">Back in my day, you’d go to Japan and do ads there</a> to hide the fact you were a sellout. And in fact, you get put on the naughty list for doing it.&nbsp; True story, I asked Santa Claus and he confirmed it to me. He also said being a games journalist gets you on the naughty list, too, and then complained that my<a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198"> <em>Black Ops 7</em> review</a> was too harsh and slammed the door in my face. Anyway, this commercial is gross! Bah, humbug, I say!</p>

There are more powerful upgrades the game doesn't tell you about, and there are some helpful tools and tricks to help you keep your Wonder Vehicle in good shape.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606863" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606863"></a><figcaption>Ol' Tessie</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4606863-bo7-rfl-zombies-019.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to always keep moving when you're driving Ol' Tessie on the connecting roads. She's fragile in her beginning state, so you don't want her breaking down and leaving you stranded on the roads. You can repair her with salvage or let her regenerate health over time, but it's really hard to do this and stay alive, especially in a solo match.</p><p dir="ltr">There are glowing plant pods scattered all throughout the roads of the map, and you'll want to swerve around and avoid these, as they explode and deal a lot of damage to your truck. Ravager enemies will also latch on and deal damage, so don't stop until you get to the next POI, and then the Ravagers will disappear.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_fully_upgrade_Ol__Tessie">How to fully upgrade Ol' Tessie</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="T_E_D_D__upgrade">T.E.D.D. upgrade</h3><p dir="ltr">The initial quest markers will guide you to the T.E.D.D. part in the spawn area, so you get your first upgrade quickly in your match.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s push to make Windows 11 a fully AI PC operating system continues, with the company planning to roll out new AI agents that can complete tasks and make changes on your behalf. But the company isn’t turning the AI feature on by default because there’s a risk of it downloading and installing malware. Oops!</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware">As spotted by <em>Windows Central</em></a><em>, </em>Microsoft recently published a lengthy warning about the AI agents it will soon add to Windows 11. In the post, Microsoft explains that agents will have their own accounts on your Windows 11 PC. They’ll also have “limited access to your user profile directory” and, if needed, will be granted read and write access to certain folders, including Documents, Downloads, and Desktop. And while Microsoft claims that all AI decisions must be approved by a human and all actions will be logged and reported, the tech giant acknowledges that activating these agents could be a bad idea.</p>

 <p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">In the warning,</a> Microsoft straight up says that its AI agents introduce “novel security risks” like, oh, I don’t know, being able to send off your data without you realizing it, being tricked by online commands, or even installing harmful software. Here’s the full warning:</p> <blockquote><p>As these capabilities are introduced, AI models still face functional limitations in terms of how they behave and occasionally may hallucinate and produce unexpected outputs. Additionally, agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.</p></blockquote> <p>Now that seems very bad to me, a person who likes to keep malware off my PC. And Microsoft agrees, because when these agents are added in a future update, they will need to be manually activated by the user. So at the very least, if you are running Windows 11, you don’t have to worry about AI agents installing some malware on your PC while you’re off grabbing a snack. For now. Microsoft is pushing AI hard in all its products, including Xbox, and I wouldn’t be surprised if one day these AI agents in Windows 11 are just turned on by default. Anyway, remember how Xbox is teasing that its next console will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox/607616/microsoft-amd-next-gen-xbox-pc/">basically be a Windows-powered PC?</a>&nbsp;Cool stuff. So happy about that.</p>

                <p>If you've accepted the Our Presence Up There quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to visit the Pattern House on Dam Battlegrounds and perform a few quick tasks. It's a relatively straightforward quest, but knowing where each objective is located can make things move much more quickly--which can be important in a high-traffic area like the Pattern House.</p><p>You don't need to extract to complete Our Presence Up There, but you'll be pretty close to an extraction point, so you might as well try to get out alive if possible. Additionally, the Pattern House is often home to a lot of really good loot (especially during a Night Raid), making it worth trying to haul some stuff back to Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to get started on Our Presence Up There, follow the guide below.</p><h2>How to complete Our Presence Up There in Arc Raiders</h2><p>To complete Our Presence Up There, you'll need to head to the Pattern House POI, which is located at the northern tip of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This is a spot a lot of folks visit for blueprint farming, as well as a common spawn point, so keep an eye out for other raiders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606794" data-ratio="0.56268958543984" data-width="1978" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606794"></a><figcaption>Pattern House location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606794-share_20251118_0807400.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Pattern House, enter through the front and head to the staircase on the bottom floor.

This extraction point is usually crawling with ARC and is often camped by other raiders, though, so approach it carefully if you're carrying anything particularly valuable--and be ready for a fight if necessary.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"i really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Vedinad, developer of Megabonk, has withdrawn his game from The Game Awards following its nomination for Best Debut Indie Game, saying it doesn't qualify for the category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1990856468615061603?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post to Twitter/X</a> from the official Megabonk account, vedinad made the announcement today:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm withdrawing from The Game Awards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's an honor and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately i don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game 🥸</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"i really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. you should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"thanks again! new megabonk update coming soon ✌️"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 2.23pm PT: </strong>Megabonk was listed as a nominee under Best Debut Indie, along with Blue Prince, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Despelote, and Dispatch. Since this statement, The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley has shared a statement of his own acknowledging the request and stating that Megabonk would be removed <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1990899068022005881?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a Twitter/X post</a>. At the time of this update, Megabonk was still listed on The Game Awards website as a nominee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"@MegabonkGame, a nominee for Best Debut Indie Game, reached out to clarify that he is an established solo developer who had been presenting himself as a new creator under the name Vedinad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’re grateful for his honesty. As a result, MegaBonk will be removed from the category.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He’ll share more about his story when he’s ready, but we respect that he didn’t want to take recognition away from other debut teams — even though the game itself is outstanding."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Original story continues below:</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, Best Debut Indie is awarded to the "best debut game created by a new independent studio." So what counts as a new, independent studio? This definition certainly can get a little fuzzy - game dev teams are often Ships of Theseus, with certain groups sticking together, hiring others, and rebranding. For instance, Dispatch was made by AdHoc Studio, and is the team's collective first original game. However, AdHoc was founded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-reportedly-began-as-a-new-splinter-cell-game-by-the-dispatch-developers">by a team of former Ubisoft and Telltale developers who had previously been working together</a>. Cocoon, by Geometric Interactive, won Debut Indie back in 2023 and was arguably in a similar situation with former developers from Playdead. But by that logic, it's also unlikely anyone's "first game" would ever make it to The Game Awards, as most people's first projects are small, student, or experimental.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vedinad's argument at least makes a bit more sense for himself, given that he is effectively a solo developer and has worked on other projects under other names. But even solo developers have help: Miguel Angel, for instance, is credited with the OST, Giovanni Fim made the Steam art, and there are a handful of names listed as playtesters, as well as a "special thanks" to vedinad's mom. Vedinad seems to be as close to a solo dev as anyone really gets. What really is a game studio, anyway?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What this ultimately seems to boil down to is that there's at least some level of confusion about what the categories of The Game Awards actually mean. This isn't the first time this has happened. In 2023, Dave the Diver - a game made by a subsidiary of Korean gaming giant Nexon - was up for Best Indie, leading <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TGA creator Geoff Keighley to respond</a> that indie can "mean different things to different people," and even the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> director admitted the nomination was confusing</a>. We've also seen some oddities like Sifu being up for Best Fighting Game in 2022 (it's an action beat-em-up), and even some recent eyebrow raisers like Monster Hunter Wilds being nominated this year for best RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Define it all however you want, but Megabonk's developer has spoken, as has Keighley.

Specifically, I'm talking about Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Air Bender. Not only are there some exciting restocks, but the potential savings today are literally ridiculous.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collector Booster Boxes for Avatar have been restocked at Amazon, with Phastasmal Flames and Mega Evolution restocks coming in heavy too. I've included where's the best to buy at face value alone in today's article, but the heavy hitting discounts on Amazon come from applying for an Amazon Visa card and using AMEX or Discover to pay $1 on your order to get over 50% off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means free Booster Bundles, Blisters, Premium Collections and Boosters with just the gift card alone. But when considering Booster Boxes, such as Phantasmal Flames or Avatar Collector Booster Box, you'll halve the price left to pay. Let's get into it and i'll guide you through exactly how to do it.</p><p id="magic-the-gathering-avatar-the-l"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The L">Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="557a02f2-4ec9-4aa6-9a32-ddd48a579c5d" id="230696"><div id="230696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering | Avatar: The Last Airbender Collector Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the best things Nickelodeon put out when I was a kid, and it's fandom still beats strong. This Universes Beyond MTG set hasn't only got me back into Avatar, but it's got me on MTG Arena to learn the game, not just collect it when I can. Collector Boosters aren't for playing, it's for those who want some solid binder material with far better pull rates than standard play boosters. There's a premium for that of course, but Amazon won't charge until it ships, which means you'll probably have a day or two to get the money you need together.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article"> Up to 50% off Pokémon TCG and Free $60 Gift Card</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imagine getting Pokémon TCG Booster Bundles for free, or paying $20 to $30 for an Elite Trainer Box, cool right? Well it's a real deal, and here's how to do it. Start by applying for a Amazon Visa card, then if accepted you'll get an instant $60 Amazon gift card added to your account, which means free Booster Bundles, Premium Collections and Booster Blisters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're after something more expensive and want to knock the price down before using the $60 gift voucher, you'll need an AMEX or Discovery card. By paying $1 on your Pokémon TCG items in your basket, you'll receive an automatic discount up to 50%. So whatever you need to pay after the gift card is cut in half. That's not bad when you're talking Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Boxes.

Buy something, get 10% back as in-store credit. With sets like Mega Evolution and Phantasmal Flames finding new floors, this is 100% the best time to fill those gaps in your binder.
