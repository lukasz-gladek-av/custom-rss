            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s first major event for 2025 in the form of Cursed Hollow, which will give you the chance to unlock all kinds of unique rewards when it debuts next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on April 17th, Cursed Hollow will operate in a similar manner to other seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a> or Winter's Jest, and the event will also sport a number of improvements based on feedback received for previous updates.</p>

<p>The new event will task you with "identifying ghosts, completing objectives, and discovering the totems scattered across [<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s] maps". Activating totems will affect "that which haunts you - the Forest Spirit", and those effects might be boons or drawbacks for you and your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=6byqXshq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=kox7Cc9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cursed Hollow brings creepy totems and a Forest Spirit to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Rewards for the event will be split into two categories: Community and Personal. Community goals will essentially work the same way as previous&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>event goals have, while Personal goals will be "unique to the player".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cursed Hollow will be a little different to previous updates thanks to changes based on community feedback. These include a map rotation system, a shorter duration for the event, and gameplay modifiers similar to those introduced in Crimson Eye.</p>

<p>Of course, it won't just be the seasonal event that debuts in the Cursed Hollow update; Kinetic Games says there will also be a number of permanent gameplay improvements and quality-of-life tweaks, all of which will be revealed in the patch notes next week.</p>

<p>Released in Early Access all the way back in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>also got its long-awaited console release in December last year, with the game going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies on consoles</a> in just over a month.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-devil-may-cry-has-already-been-renewed-for-a-second-season.1160580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s Adi Shankar, has been renewed for a second season just a week after its initial air date.</p>

<p>In a fairly simple <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1910331989678338091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix confirms that season 2 of&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is coming "soon", although the streaming giant stops short of announcing a date for the second season's airing. The announcement is accompanied by some appropriately edgy-looking artwork of protagonist Dante.</p>

<p>Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2018</a>, with the showrunner affectionately referring to the show as part of his "bootleg multiverse" alongside his animated&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=JJhw132b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=9FHh7YFA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adi Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will be returning for a second season.</figcaption></figure><p>We got our first look at the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">back in late 2023</a>, when a debut trailer was released alongside an initial look at Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>animated series.</p>

<p>Following that, it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series would debut in April this year, and indeed, the series' first eight-episode run premiered on April 3rd to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/devil-may-cry-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mostly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The show revolves around longtime&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series protagonist Dante, who comes into conflict with a terrorist known only as the White Rabbit while also battling the government organization DARKCOM.</p>

<p>Given that the show's timeline doesn't quite seem to match up with the games' story, it's reasonable to assume that the show isn't part of the games' canon, although Shankar could well prove me wrong on that front with the second season.</p>




<p><em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is just one of the shows based on video games to debut in recent years. Others include the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>and its sequel series&nbsp;<em>Nocturne</em>, as well as shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, shows based on properties like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">Pacific Drive</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>(yes, another one) are also reportedly in the works, although the UK's Daily Mail cast some <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doubt</a> on the latter earlier today.</p>

<p>You can check out all eight episodes of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>on the streaming platform right now. The show's second season doesn't have a release date or window yet.</p>

<p>Devil May Cry is a new Netflix animated series by Adi Shankar that was released a week ago and has already climbed up to the top 10 most-viewed series for the week on the platform. Devil May Cry Season 1 is globally ranked at the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fourth spot</a> this week, sitting behind the likes of Adolescence, Gone Girls: The Long Island Serial Killer and Pulse. Devil May Cry has garnered over 5 million views and 21 million hours viewed in the first week, and fans will be excited when it <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1910331989678338091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">officially returns</a> for a second season.</p>

He is an orphaned demon hunter who has made it his life’s mission to avenge his mother’s death by killing all demons.</p>

The exclusive announcement trailer above introduces us to hero Fenrix Haven, a demon hunter who makes a deal with an angel for immortality, and the hordes of foes he'll have to slice and dice to prevent the resurrection of an ancient and pesky archdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat looks heavily inspired by Hades, and there are ranged weapons, melee attacks and special attacks called Celestial Blessings.  In the trailer we also get a glimpse of some of the other mechanics that will aid Fenrix on his journey, from a skill tree called The Grace of the Arbor to artifacts like a magically levitating hoverboard called the Jelly Engine. Weapons like silver-infused hammers, swords and a darkness cleaving shadow dagger can all be unlocked in the Magic Forge. This kit should come in handy when facing bosses - called Sealed Tyrants - as well as the Archdemon Asmodeus’s army of minions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ember and Blade First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game can be <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470500/Ember_and_Blade/__;!!AEH8rfA!yJrQDDnnvpE219JT_B04ODzEPOpYMedii6whg8kk9PUlem-18nRnGVPujVSuosiGm5sXUu_ERmJUElE$" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlisted</a> on Steam now ahead of its 2026 release, and developer Line Games is promising a playable demo in the second half of this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

like software and services. And over time, various efficiencies typically help to reduce the cost of producing the consoles themselves.</p><p>Nintendo famously bucks this trend, and most recently claimed the original Switch was not sold at a loss. Whether or not that's going to be the case for the Switch 2 remains to be seen. Nintendo will hold its next earnings briefing in May where the company is expected to face numerous questions about the console.</p><p>The impact of tariffs is a major question in all of this. Switch 2 units are produced in places like China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. While US President Donald Trump recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-remains-in-limbo-as-new-tariffs-reduced-and-paused-with-one-major-exception/1100-6530739/" data-ref-id="1100-6530739">lowered tariffs in Vietnam and Cambodia to 10%</a>, he increased tariff rates to 125% in China, and both are effective immediately.</p><p>Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu said if the tariffs remain at 10% in Vietnam and Cambodia, Nintendo will keep the Switch 2 priced at $450 and take a hit on margin. Had the original tariff plan been seen through, Zhu said Nintendo could have raised the price of the Switch 2 hardware by as much as $100.</p><p>Trump's new tariffs are now in effect as part of a 90-day pause to his original plan. Assuming the 90-day countdown began on April 9, it would come to an end on July 8, which is after the Switch 2's launch on June 5.</p><p>Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser recently said Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-stock-is-already-in-the-us-as-nintendo-prepares-for-launch-demand/1100-6530675/" data-ref-id="1100-6530675">had already shipped some Switch 2 units to America and they are now in warehouse awaiting delivery.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US were expected to begin on April 9, but Nintendo delayed preorders due to the tariff situation. Now that things are somewhat settled in that respect, everyone is waiting for Nintendo to announce a new preorder date.</p><p>Adjusted for inflation, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, which launched in March 2017 for $300 USD. Explaining the price increase, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">everything in life gets more expensive with time, and new Nintendo consoles are no different.</a> Others believe Nintendo is raising prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because it can, knowing people will pay it.</a></p>

            <p>Netflix has renewed Devil May Cry for a second season.</p>
<p>The adult animation series was created by Adi Shankar, and is - of course - based on Capcom's video games. Now, just a week since the first season's debut, the streaming service has announced a second season is on the cards, writing: "Let's dance."</p>

</figure>
<p>The first series followed demon hunter Dante as he was pitted against the powerful White Rabbit who had ideas to unleash hell on earth, because things just aren't bad enough already.</p>
<p>The show made its debut on Netflix on 3rd April, and is currently the fourth most watched series on the streaming platform. According to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv">Netflix charts</a>, Devil May Cry has already been viewed 5.3m times, equating to 21m hours.</p>
<p>Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>. Sharing the news of Conroy's inclusion in Devil May Cry earlier this year, series showrunner Adi Shankar said that the actor's lines were "recorded before he passed", and no AI was used.</p>
<p>"Mr Conroy gave it [an] amazingly nuanced performance," Shankar wrote on social media. "It was both a pleasure and an honour to work with him."</p>
<p>The first season's end credits include a dedication to Conroy.</p>

<p>Devil May Cry is not the only video game-related animated series to be returning for a second round on Netflix. Towards the end of last year, the platform announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft was also getting renewed for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>While more details remain slim for now, Netflix confirmed Sam Nishimura - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">a character first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot</a> - would be a part of the next series.</p></div>

			<p>Marathon will not require a PlayStation network account to play on PC and Xbox Series X and S, Bungie confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on the game's official Discord server, as reported by KAMI on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1910157799314555338%7Ctwgr%5E64f43be216d92c4fc74c8f4f6bfdfce19b582d77%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FOkami13_%2Fstatus%2F1910157799314555338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, a rep for the game's development team confirmed that an account will not be required to play on platforms other than PlayStation 5. This is definitely good news, considering that multiplayer games like Helldivers 2 still require a PlayStation Network account on PC, essentially making the game unavailable in regions that are not supported by the PlayStation online service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will not require a PlayStation Network account on PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Gameplay reveal this Saturday, April 12th @ 10AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marathon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Marathon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarathontheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarathontheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/cE0kYS830H">pic.twitter.com/cE0kYS830H</a></p>
<p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1910157799314555338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Over a year after its official announcement, Marathon will finally be unveiled later this week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-saturday-april-12/">April 12th</a>. Very little is currently known about the game other than the fact that it will be an extraction shooter featuring multiple different characters called Runners, who will all come with different abilities and some customization options. The game also promises to provide players with plenty of tools to achieve their objectives, such as weapons that alter character stats and more. Player action, additionally, is said to influence the game's persistent world, although it hasn't been specified in which ways and how it will impact the experience as a whole. Hopefully, these mechanics, alongside every other core mechanic, will get detailed in the game's grand reveal in two days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/masumi-naoe-role-assassins-creed-shadows-never-heard-of-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-masumi-landed-%E2%80%98naoe%E2%80%99-role-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-without-ever-having-heard-of-the-game.1160496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/masumi-naoe-role-assassins-creed-shadows-never-heard-of-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I had the phenomenal opportunity to catch up with Masumi, the talented performer behind Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Naoe. The shinobi character took my expectations and firmly exceeded them, so much so that I labelled her the best Assassin’s Creed character we’ve seen in many years.</p>



<p>As I chatted with Masumi on the red carpet, I was curious to learn how she came to land the role of Naoe, given that it was her first ever job in video games.</p>



<p>What she revealed was quite surprising – but as I’ve learned, not entirely out of the ordinary.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Naoe's Actor Had Never Heard of Assassin's Creed - Masumi at the BAFTA Games Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ka6jOA7y1Fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-a-gradual-realisation">‘It Was a Gradual Realisation’</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has delivered on bold promises made by Ubisoft. It’s a stunning game with a solid amount of meat on the bones, and it’s a turning point of sorts for the series. My only hope is that Ubisoft can capitalise on the game’s success and keep the ball rolling.</p>



<p>I asked Masumi, who plays Naoe in Shadows, about how she landed the role and how it felt to be such a pivotal part of this transformation. This is her <strong>first video game role</strong>, after all.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m so honored. I <strong>didn’t know what Assassin’s Creed was</strong> before I booked it, because I don’t play video games, so actually, it was like a gradual realisation of what I’m a part of, and I just feel so excited and honoured.</p>



<p>I got an audition for it but I prepped the role just like I would for film or TV. I had to spend two years – actually I’m still on it, so it’s like a long time – developing this character, so I got to really dive into Naoe, which was amazing. It was so layered, her character was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also discussed some of the more controversial topics, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">‘shrine destruction’ theme</a> that was aired ahead of the game’s release. She explained how she didn’t know those elements were present in the game, but they ‘hurt her heart’ to see them.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be expanded in the coming months by expansions, and I, for one, am very excited to see them and to continue down this path with Masumi’s character.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about Masumi’s performance on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

		<p>Sassy Chap Games and Team17 have confirmed that the bonkers dating game Date Everything! will be launching on June 17th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch. When the title says Date Everything! it means you can date any object in the house you are in. Ever wanted to become closer for your sofa? You can do that. Your toilet has already seen everything, so why not treat it to a conversation?</p>
<p><iframe title="Date Everything! Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LRZe30oSy9A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Date Everything you will build up different relationships depending on how your conversations go, and how your stats stack up. Those will lead to three relationship outcomes; love, hate, or friendship. Whatever one you end up on will give you points to improve your own stats, opening up more avenues to explore with your household furniture. All you have to do is put on your special glasses and shoot love beams at the object of your desire. There are over 100 characters to date all of which are fully voiced by the likes of Felicia Day,&nbsp; Ben Starr,&nbsp; Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, Neil Newbon, Troy Baker, and Ashley Burch plus a few others. Between them there are 70,000 lines of dialogue to hear as you get to know the objects in your house on a deeper level.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games.1160466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-responds-to-the-crew-lawsuit-tells-prosecuting-players-they-never-owned-their-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-misleading-players-by-shutting-down-the-crew">November 2024</a>, two gamers from California sued <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-executive-says-gamers-have-been-slow-in-getting-comfortable-with-not-owning-their-titles/">Ubisoft</a> over the company's decision to shut down servers for <a href="http://wccftech.com/ubisofts-open-ended-racing-game-the-crew/">The Crew</a>. The two argued that Ubisoft shutting down the servers was equivalent to buying a pinball machine, then years later, the pinball manufacturer storms into your house, removes the pinball paddles, bumpers, balls, everything that makes it playable and leaves an empty shell.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-faces-lawsuit-for-allegedly-misleading-players-by-shutting-down-the-crew">alleged</a> that Ubisoft "<em>misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access the game." </em>The plaintiff's pinball comparison also came from one of them having bought a physical disc for The Crew, which was rendered useless plastic once the servers shut down.</p>
<p>Following player backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">announced</a> that The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest would receive an update that added offline modes for each game. This would allow players to continue to enjoy both games even after the servers for each were shut down in early 2024. The same effort has not been extended to The Crew, which was taken offline entirely in March 2024, another point of issue the prosecuting players took up with Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, Ubisoft has responded to the lawsuit, firmly telling the prosecuting players that they should have known they were never buying a game to own when they each purchased a copy of The Crew and that it was clear they were buying a license.</p>
<p>"<em>Frustrated with Ubisoft's recent decision to retire the game following a notice period delineated on the product's packaging, Plaintiffs apply a kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers,</em>" Ubisoft wrote in its response.</p>
<p>Ubisoft also argued that the plaintiffs had gotten more than their fair share of use out of The Crew, playing the game for years before the announcement of its shutdown in December 2023 and the actual closure in March 2024.</p>
<p>"<em>After making their purchases, Plaintiffs enjoyed access to The Crew for years before Ubisoft decided in late 2023 to retire and shut down the servers of the ten-year-old video game. Plaintiffs received the benefit of their bargain and cannot complain now that they were deceived simply because Ubisoft did not then create an offline version of the discontinued video game.</em>"</p>
<p>Following Ubisoft's response to the lawsuit, the prosecution amended several of their complaints, including a particular rebuttal against the claim that the players got their fill of The Crew. The plaintiffs claimed they had no reason to believe the servers would ever be shut down.</p>
<p>Late last year, before this lawsuit was filed, Valve <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-now-warns-players-theyre-only-buying-a-license-to-a-game-at-checkout/">issued a new warning</a> on Steam telling players that they were only purchasing a license for the games they bought and did not directly own the game. This was the first time a digital storefront had been directly clear about players purchasing a license to play the game, not the game itself.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-review.1160463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <em>Infinity</em> universe,&nbsp;PanOceania is the most powerful faction in the Human Sphere, boasting the most planets, a thriving economy, and cutting-edge technology. Standing against them are the combined nations of Yu Jing, united under the powers of the ruling Party and the Emperor, each backed up with their own military force. The Incincible Army makes sure the designs of the Party are adhered to, and the Imperial Service does whatever it takes to see that the desires of the Emperor are met. In this article, we'll take a look at the new <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service Action Pack, and what lengths this determined group of enforcers will go to.</p>

<p><em>Infinity N5 </em>launched last year with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Operation Sandtrap</a> box, and those who've been reading my articles for a while will know that I started my own <em>Infinity</em> journey with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-jsa-army-pack-review-take-to-war-with-cyber-ninjas-and-samurai-power" rel="nofollow">JSA launch box</a> back in 2018 when the JSA broke away from Yu Jing and became a non-aligned army, before finally becoming their own standalone faction in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</p>




<h2>The Dragon's Claws</h2>

<p>The Imperial Service is made up of&nbsp;tactical units of Judicial and Military Police, criminal regiments, units transferred as reinforcements by the State Empire Army, and special troops in direct service to the Emperor. Its outward-facing mission is to preserve the rule of law and order and defend Yu Jing from any internal or external enemy. The rule of law and order they follow is that directed by the Emperor, and if that ever comes into conflict with anyone else, even the Party, they will do whatever is required to see their goals met.</p>

<p>This means that the Imperial Service is made up of empowered bad guys, given free rein to see that the wills of the Emperor are enforced, and their playstyle shows this. The Imperial Service has a combination of infiltration and camouflaged troops, as well as solid attacks when they need to eliminate their target.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=M12RYUR5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-3.jpg?itok=hZmMp_CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service Action Pack includes some brand new and redesigned miniatures for <em>Infinity</em> N5.</figcaption></figure><h2>By Any Means Necessary</h2>

<p>The Imperial Service Action pack includes 9 Imperial Service units, some of them unique to the Imperial Service sectorial, and others can be used in other sectorials, and the wider Yu Jing faction. The action pack contains:</p>

<ul><li>3x Celestial Guards - The core line troops of the Imperial Service, armed with combi rifles.</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Crane Rank - Armed with a heavy machine gun, this is the Lieutenant of the set, but I would look at replacing them with Sun Tze (who is an absolute beast).</li>
	<li>1x Imperial Agent Pheasant Rank - The backup Lieutenant armed with a red fury. They also have tactical awareness which gives them&nbsp;an extra order token each turn.</li>
	<li>1x Bayara with Light Shotgun - This unit is actually 2 units on the same base. Their purpose is to hunt down intruders into the palace, so their profile comes armed with several ways of discovering hidden foes.</li>
	<li>1x&nbsp;Wu Ming - This profile comes armed in this set with a submachine gun, and has its own Fireteam named after it. It can join&nbsp;up with a Zangying and the Imperial Agents if required for the fireteam bonuses they provide.</li>
	<li>1x Koga Ninja - I'm a huge fan of the ninjas in JSA, and this Imperial Service ninja doesn't disappoint. With all the usual sneakiness of ninja units, the Koga&nbsp;is armed with all kinds of electro-magnetic weapons, the target of their attacks has to make 2 saving throws per hit and half their usual saving throw bonus.</li>
	<li>1x Jinyao Drop Unit - This assault unit can super-jump for maximum board mobility and comes armed&nbsp;with a boarding shotgun and para mines, which can immobilize units that set them off.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=Wt1J6tU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-4.jpg?itok=hk5U31gA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Also avvialble as part of the Imperial Service revivial for&nbsp;<em>Infinity N5&nbsp;</em>are the Longwang TAG and specialist Dragon Lord.</figcaption></figure><h2>His Will</h2>

<p>Realising alongside the Imperial Service action pack are the Longwang, Imperial TAG police, and a special launch miniature, the Dragon Lord, Imperial Service Judges. The Longwang is an armored TAG unit, accurate at range with its heavy machine gun and its immobilizing adhesive launcher, and deadly up close with its para close combat weapon. It also gets a bonus order token to get things done. The Dragon Lord is a specialist troop to help you complete mission objectives, they're decent in close combat, and their ranged nanopulser is a template weapon for anyone trying to close with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=Vrbx2wOt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-5.jpg?itok=3bFgtFiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our recomended <em>Infinity</em> units to bolster&nbsp;your Imperial Service force are Sun Tze and Su-Jian.</figcaption></figure><p>If I were looking to play into the Imperial Service more, I'd pick up Sun Tze as mentioned above, who if made your Lieutenant, gains an additional order ontop of their Lieutentant order, and also has the ability to deploy 2 decoys, so your opponent will have to guess where they actually are. I'd also look to pick up a Su-Jian, who can fireteam up with another Su-Jian or the Longwang, and has 2 forms. Using a movement action to change between them, the Su-Jian has a high-mobility form, which allows them to close the distance quickly, and then change into the combat form when they're ready to bring the pain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-2.jpg?itok=lSooVl44 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-imperial-service-action-pack-2.jpg?itok=WwkSbH14 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The full list of Imperial Service units avialable in <em>Infinity N5</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Infinity Imperial Service Action Pack Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Imperial Service action pack is a decent box, with some fantastic-looking miniatures. It goes some way to showing what the Imperial Service is capable of and combined with the Longwang, gives them some presence on the table. You will need to add some units to get the most out of them though, and they're not a super straight-forward faction to pilot if you're a brand new <em>Infinity</em> player. But they are fun, and have a lot of tricks and ways to hunt down hidden enemies, plus this box has the new Koga Ninja, who is pretty awesome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-date-everything-release-date-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romantic dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a brand new release date, and Team17 and Sassy Chap's "star-studded" adventure is arriving on PC and current-gen consoles just in time for summer.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 17th. The game was due to launch on what would have been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again" rel="nofollow">ideal date for its arrival</a>, but it was delayed (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">not for the first time</a>) in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!</em>, you're equipped with a pair of "Dateviators", glasses that essentially allow you to see objects in your home as dateable people. It's probably best if you don't think about the implications of that too much.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=ZNzcEnaP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/date-everything-release-date-summer-keyes.jpg?itok=MIlY9Vg0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has a new, and hopefully final, release date.</figcaption></figure><p>Equipped with said Dateviators, you'll be able to romance over 100 characters, with inanimate objects like laundry baskets, pianos, and vacuum cleaners available for romantic relationships. You can even date concepts like existential dread.</p>

<p>Not only can you date lots of characters, but you can also explore a "fully interactive 3D overworld", as Sassy Chap says, and the world of the game will change based on choices you make throughout your run.</p>

<p>Sassy Chap is also promising lots of branching dialogue and multiple endings for each character (not just for the game itself), as well as full voice acting for the game's romanceable roster.</p>

Plaintiffs also take issue with the fact that Ubisoft did not offer to create an 'offline, single-player option of the Game, otherwise known as a 'patch' when it shut down The Crew’s servers in March 2024," Ubisoft's lawyers wrote. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The [essence] of the plaintiffs’ complaint is that Ubisoft allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game. But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The response further adds that the Xbox and PlayStation packaging contain a "clear and conspicuous notice — in all capital letters — that Ubisoft may cancel access to one or more specific online features upon a 30-day prior notice."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has now filed a motion to dismiss the case. If that fails and the lawsuit does proceed, the two plaintiffs have demanded a jury trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Storefronts including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-now-warns-customers-theyre-buying-a-license-not-a-game-before-they-continue-to-payment">Steam now include an up-front warning to customers that they’re buying a license, not a game</a>.
