                <p>It's been five years since Naughty Dog released The Last of Us: Part 2, and with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunners-tease-season-3s-new-direction/1100-6531811/" data-ref-id="1100-6531811">Season 3 of the HBO series in the works</a>, the anticipation and clamoring for a Part 3 has never been higher. However, showrunner Craig Mazin admittedly knows just a hint of the story for the potential game, but isn't sure if it'll ever happen.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__flfZc9JCc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAFTA</a> about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351">Season 2</a> of The Last of Us, Mazin said game creator and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann told him some ideas he had for a Part 3, but would be okay if the game never came into fruition.</p><p>"I am familiar with some concepts that Neil has kicked around for a potential third game. I don't know if he's zeroed in on one of them. I don't know what will happen there," he explains, adding that although he'd like Part 3 to happen, he also thinks maybe less is more. "Sometimes I think, maybe you should just be happy. Don't be sad it's over--be happy that it happened at all! I think Naughty Dog is an incredible game studio. They make beautiful art, and their ability to convey what we can do in television through animation is pretty remarkable."</p><p>He continued with how he could be selfish and beg Druckmann to make Part 3, but feels as though he would rob the studio of other potentially great games it could make instead.</p><p>"It's not like what I want is going to matter. They will do what they do, and all I know is that I'll be there on day one to play Intergalactic. If there's another Uncharted, I'll play it. If there's another Last of Us, I'll play it."</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent comments about The Last of Us: Part 3 from Druckmann himself said he's not ruling it out, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/">he's not confirming it either.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more [The Last of Us games]. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog is currently working on multiple games. Alongside Intergalactic, a mystery second game is in development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-launch-ever-in-the-uk-but-it-still-didnt-beat-the-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>, data firm NielsenIQ shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest Nintendo console launch in the UK ever. Still, it's not the biggest console launch in the region ever, with the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series consoles still ahead of it.</p>
<p>While the report doesn't provide a specific number, The Game Business says the Switch 2 beat out week-one launch sales in the UK for the Nintendo Switch "<em>by more than two to one,</em>" and also pointed out that the Nintendo Switch managed to sell a little more than 80K units in the UK when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo 3DS, which used to have the record for the best UK launch for a Nintendo device, sold 113K units in its launch.</p>
<p>The Game Business also listed the top-10 console launches in the UK by sales units, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly in fourth place. Here's the full list, per The Game Business:</p>
<ol>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>Xbox Series</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2</li>
<li>PlayStation 3</li>
<li>Xbox One</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Xbox 360</li>
<li>Xbox One X</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports from the PS5's UK launch claimed it sold more than <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-ps5-was-the-uks-biggest-ever-console-launch/">250K units in just two days after launch</a>, and more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-best-selling-next-gen-uk/">450K by the end of 2020</a>. So, until any actual sales numbers are reported, we know that the Switch 2 sold more than 113K units and less than 250K.</p>
<p>It didn't set the all-time record for the UK, but there's no denying that somewhere between 113-250K is a very strong launch for just one region. The Switch 2 also might've set all-time records elsewhere, as it's currently claimed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/">Switch 2 is now France's fastest-selling console ever</a>, and that Nintendo moved 200K units in France in the console's opening weekend.</p>

<p>That's according to data from NielsenIQ shared by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>. Switch 2 has reportedly outsold the original Switch at launch by over two to one in the UK and has also beaten the Nintendo 3DS, which was previously the company's biggest launch.</p>
<p>While NielsonIQ doesn't share numbers, for comparison the original Switch sold over 80,000 at launch in the UK, and the 3DS sold 113,000.</p>

<p>It's an impressive start, then, as the company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">predicted globally Switch 2 will sell 15m units</a> from release until the end of the financial year - about on par with the previous console.</p>
<p>However, in the UK at least, Switch 2's launch sits behind its rivals.</p>
<p>In terms of the biggest UK console launches of all time (excluding handhelds), Switch 2 is the fourth best-selling in terms of units - it's behind the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, the Switch 2 is the third best-selling console in the UK - it's beaten the PS4, which was sold for a lower price.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait for official word from Nintendo until we find out the full global numbers for the Switch 2 launch.</p>
<p>At the least, in France the Switch 2 has reportedly sold over 200,000 units in its first weekend to record the best ever console launch in the country (according to <a href="https://x.com/GyoJvfr/status/1932014842652590330">French content creator Gyo</a>).</p>
<p>The news comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the price of its games and accessories around the world.</p>
<p>As for the previous console, Nintendo stated in its previous financial report it expects to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">sell a further 4.5m Switch units this year</a>, which would see it overtake the Nintendo DS as the company's best-selling hardware ever.</p>
<p>Globally, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-shipped-an-impressive-4-7m-in-four-months">original Switch sold 4.7m units in its first four months on sale</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has announced Splatoon Raiders, the first spinoff game from the popular ink-splatting shooter, which is coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. There’s also a Switch 2 enhanced update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> coming later this week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Research Report from Squid Research Lab - Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splatoon Raiders will take player to the Spirhalite Islands alongside the splat-tacular Deep Cut trio, casting them as a mechanic to aid in their adventure.</p>
<p>More details will be coming in the future on what this game will actually be like, though it’s no doubt got something to do with the community-led decision in the final Splatfest from last summer.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there’s some fresh love for Splatoon 3, with an update that adds more content and some Switch 2 enhancements.</p>

<p>The new update for Splatoon 3 will give the game on Switch 2 more detailed visuals and smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds, without affecting play across generations.</p>
<p>All players will also get access to the Splatlands collection. This adds new weapons from the Barazushi and Emberz brand that are based on previous ones, but have been combined with new sub and special weapons. 30 new weapon kits are being added. Oh, and what’s this? Urchin Underpass from the original Splatoon will be added to the stage rotation, too.</p>
<p>All very exciting for Splatoon lovers especially as Splatoon 3 had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/the-final-splatoon-3-splatfest-takes-place-in-september-and-it-could-have-big-implications/">its final Splatfest last summer</a>. I’ll admit that Splatoon 3 is a game that I wish I’d played more of. For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3 review</a>, I wrote: “Splatoon 3 is a bit like your mum making your favourite meal when you head home for the holidays. It’s been a few years since the last game —&nbsp;while there have been some great improvements and additions, it’s the same old Splatoon we know and love, and that’s still pretty great.”</p>

<p>The app was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-gaming-acquisition-rac7" rel="nofollow">reported to be in development by Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, but in a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games-app/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Apple confirms that the Apple Games app is available now in developer beta, with all iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users getting the new app this fall.</p>

<p>Apple Games will consist of five distinct tabs: Home, Play Together, Arcade, Library, and Search. Home shows things like highlights, "personalized recommendations", and "editorial selections", as well as friend activity and other game-related info.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-games-app-what-the-clash.jpg?itok=hyXJVi5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-games-app-what-the-clash.jpg?itok=CTbpJOGQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple's new Apple Games app is coming this fall.</figcaption></figure><p>Play Together is, as you've probably guessed, a tab that shows you what your friends are up to, while Arcade is the place to go if you're a subscriber to the Apple Arcade service.</p>

<p>Finally, your Library tab collects all of your games in one place, and the Search tab lets you look for specific games, collections, or charts. It's all pretty self-explanatory stuff, really.</p>

<p>With Apple Games, it looks as though Apple wants to create a unified hub for all things gaming on your iOS or macOS device, so if you're the kind of person who routinely whips out your phone for a quick go on an Apple Arcade game, this app is for you.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Apple Games yet, but it's likely that it'll roll out alongside iOS, macOS, and iPadOS 26, so whenever that major update for your device's operating system arrives, that's also when you'll be able to check out Apple Games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-games-ios-26.jpg?itok=sN__kk2l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-games-ios-26.jpg?itok=-KL3HeXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple Games will likely roll out alongside iOS 26 this fall.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside Apple's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Sneaky Sasquatch&nbsp;</em>developer RAC7 last month, it seems that this new app is part of a wider push towards gaming. Could this all culminate in the release of a dedicated Apple gaming console? Probably not, but we can dream, right?</p>

<p>In other Apple-related gaming news, Epic's battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">finally restored to iOS devices</a> last month following a protracted spat between the two companies. Epic previously alleged that Apple blocked the release of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on its devices, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">causing a worldwide outage</a>.</p>

Details of the deal haven’t yet been released, but the union says it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-actor-strike-ai-sag-aftra-zenless-zone-zero-1851769447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-actor-strike-ai-sag-aftra-zenless-zone-zero-1851769447">includes “necessary AI guardrails”</a></span> as companies adopt tools to copy, replicate, and alter the work of actors. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197582,197580" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The 10 companies involved in the agreement are Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc. SAG-AFTRA says more about the deal will be shared after members vote to ratify it in the coming weeks. The two sides are still hashing out the terms of the strike suspension agreement, however, so actors will remain on strike for a little longer. <br></p><p>“Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike,” SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a press release. “Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179">The strike began last July</a></span>, and while it involved demands for pay raises and better onsite working conditions, the biggest sticking point throughout negotiations was the role AI might play in voice recording and performance capture. While actors are currently paid on a session by session basis for specific performances, AI models would make it easy for companies to take that data and replicate an actor’s voice or movements, either altering their creative output or replacing it altogether. </p><p>Back in March, Ashly Burch who plays Aloy in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashly-burch-ai-strike-aloy-horizon-zero-dawn-sony-1851770412&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashly-burch-ai-strike-aloy-horizon-zero-dawn-sony-1851770412">shared her concerns</a></span> about AI replacing actors after an internal tech demo at Sony showed an AI-controlled Aloy having a conversation with a player. SAG-AFTRA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sagaftra-ai-darth-vader-ulp-voice-actor-strike-1851781401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sagaftra-ai-darth-vader-ulp-voice-actor-strike-1851781401">recently filed an unfair labor practice</a></span> against Epic Games for using an AI-voiced Darth Vader in <em>Fortnite</em> while still in negotiations. Meanwhile, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-npc-epic-disney-1851783545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-npc-epic-disney-1851783545">has said he foresees a possible future</a></span> in which all NPCs are AI-controlled. </p><p>As the strike continued throughout last fall and into 2025, actors in some games saw themselves replaced by other artists in projects like<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, as game companies sought to continue releasing updates. Games like <em>Destiny 2</em>, meanwhile, simply left some characters completely silent who would have otherwise voiced dialogue. Some SAG-AFTRA actors voiced their frustration with the duration of the strike in recent weeks. </p><p>“I hope SAG-AFTRA is aware that, either intentionally or through negligence, an environment has been created around IMA negotiations whereby it is impossible to express a good-faith disagreement without being dismissed as anti-union, a management shill, or both,” voice actor William Salyers, who voiced Otto Octavius in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, wrote on Threads last week. “The damage being done by this will persist long after the strike is settled.” Jennifer Hale, best known as Commander Shepard in <em>Mass Effect</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1930733720547545454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1930733720547545454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a></span>, “Vilifying those differences only divides the community.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This should reset the console battery, and it can be done by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Make certain that your Switch 2 has the latest system update</li><li>Power off your Switch 2 completely</li><li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the power button <strong>once</strong> to turn the system back on</li><li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears</li><li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the power button until it turns off</li><li>Power the console back on</li></ul><p>Our testing confirms that this method does work--my Switch 2 would only charge up to 82% with the power-saving mode enabled but it now reaches a charging percentage of 89%--and there is a second solution here just in case this one doesn't work.</p><p>This requires a few more steps, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo advises charging the Switch 2 to 100%</a> and then letting the battery drain until it is <em>almost </em>empty--a complete drain is harmful to overall battery life--and then charging it back up to 100% again.

                <p>Get your Splattershots ready--Nintendo's beloved shooter series Splatoon is getting its first spin-off game. The Nintendo Today app shared the announcement of Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off featuring the Deep Cut idol band from Splatoon 3. It's coming out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, while Splatoon 3 is receiving a free Switch 2 update this week.</p><p>The Splatoon Raiders trailer depicted Deep Cut members Shiver, Frye, and Big Man on a helicopter, discussing their next treasure-hunting destination, the Spirhalite Islands. Their helicopter crash-lands, setting the stage for an island adventure. Players will take the role of a mechanic, exploring the mysterious new locale with Deep Cut.</p><p>While the Nintendo Today video showed some action, it didn't share any specific objectives or details about the gameplay loop of Splatoon Raiders. The video also lacked any details about a release window.</p><p>Watch the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ve2zWmkEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, scheduled for June 12, will freshen the game up for Nintendo Switch 2. Along with improved visuals and performance, especially in hubs like Splatsville, which were capped at 30fps on the original Switch. More importantly, this version 10.0.0 update for Splatoon 3 includes new weapons.</p><p>The Splatlands Collection of 30 weapons features familiar ink-splatting artillery but with different loadouts of sub- and special weapons, along with unique visual designs. And for the more hardcore competitive players, the upcoming patch includes a new stat in the ranked Anarchy Battles called Series Weapon Power, which tracks win/loss ratios per weapon and matches players with others with similar ratings.</p><p>The Splatoon 3 update is a welcome surprise, considering Nintendo only planned to add new content to the game for two years after its September 2022 launch. It's also another fun addition to the growing list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Switch 1 games getting a free update</a> for the new hardware. And while Splatoon Raiders isn't necessarily a proper fourth installment, the spin-off may satisfy Splatoon players, especially all those Big Man fans out there.</p>

<p><span>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland writes in a press release. "Patience and persistence have resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In the same press release, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher wrote, "Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world's most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified, we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The aforementioned strike began last July after </span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/26/sag-aftra-members-vote-yes-to-authorize-video-game-strike"><span>SAG-AFTRA members approved a strike authorization in September of 2023</span></a><span> with a 98.32% yes vote.

<p>Elsewhere in today's Squid Research Lab Report, Nintendo revealed that version 10 of Splatoon 3 is on its way. It will feature the Splatlands Collection, which consists of 30 weapons from the series' past but refreshed for the game. Plus, weapon freshness caps will be raised, and players can earn new in-game badges. And in the Anarchy Battle Series, players can utilize the Series Weapon Power, a new stat that tracks your effectiveness with a weapon based on your win-loss ratio in battles. It will also be used in matchmaking to put you up against players with similar stats.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not all, though. Nintendo also revealed that Urchin Underpass, a map from the first Splatoon game, will return to the rotation of Splatoon 3. And for Switch 2 players, an upgrade will bring improved visuals, including better resolution and more. The company says this update won't affect play capabilities between Switch and Switch 2 players when it launches this week on June 12.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for this update, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/splatoon-3/multicolored-mayhem"><em>Game Informer's </em>Splatoon 3 review</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope Splatoon Raiders is?

            <p>Early access life sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> will be releasing on Mac this August, the team has announced.</p>
<p>Those interested in picking up InZoi via Mac are able to pre-order now, with the site touting a 20th August release date. "Let your imagination lead the way," the <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1932241322573983768">team wrote on social media</a>, sharing the news.</p>

<p>InZoi was initially released in early access this March, quickly going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">on to break records for publisher Krafton</a>. It crossed the 1m sales mark one week after its debut, however since then the game has struggled to keep its player numbers as high as they were not even three months ago.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, the game currently has a peak concurrent player count of 87,377, which it reached during its launch period. Since then, player numbers have sharply declined, with its current 24-hour peak sitting at a comparatively tiny 1,753. That is a player decline of 97.99 percent (so, 98 percent).</p>
<p>While declining numbers are to be expected following a game's launch, this is a big drop in a pretty short period of time. To compare, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> currently has a 24-hour player peak of 35,871, so InZoi evidently isn't the 'Sims killer' (at least not yet) that some had wondered if it could be.</p>

<p>Even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>, which initially released in June 2009, currently has a similar player count to InZoi, which given that game debuted 16 years ago is quite eye-opening.</p>
<p>Maybe its release on Mac will turn InZoi's fortunes around.</p>

			<p>Big news today for Splatoon fans, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/splatoon-raiders-the-first-ever-splatoon-spinoff-game-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo announced</a> the first Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Splatoon game with Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off game where players will head to the Spirhalite Islands as a mechanic along with the Deep Cut trio. Nintendo also announced that a new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/">Splatoon 3</a> will be available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on&nbsp;<strong>June 12, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Nintendo announced the news through its Nintendo Today! mobile app, with a short teaser trailer introducing the new adventure. There's not much we know about Splatoon Raiders, like whether it'll be a single-player adventure or if it is a multiplayer-focused game, but the emphasis on the game's core party of characters in this announcement, like the protagonist and the Deep Cut trio, and the short bits of gameplay shown in the trailer seem to suggest it's a narrative-driven title in some sense.</p>
<p>According to a post from the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1932423796964606143">Splatoon America account on X</a>, our protagonist for Splatoon Raiders is "<em>an expert mechanic with a mysterious background. That ink tank and walking robot look rather intriguing, wouldn't you say?</em>"</p>

<p>Nintendo also failed to mention when we can expect to see Splatoon Raiders on store shelves, though, as a Switch 2 exclusive, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo prices the game. Since it's a spin-off title, will it come in closer to, say, $50, or will it be the latest Switch 2 exclusive to be priced at $80?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Splatoon world, and in the same video following the Splatoon Raiders announcement, Nintendo confirmed that Splatoon 3's version 10.0 update will launch later this week, bringing along with it the return of the Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon game, a new set of weapons and cosmetics from the Splatlands Collection, new stats for players to track, and most importantly for Switch 2 owners, "<em>more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds</em>" when playing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The update will also add support for Splatoon 3 cross-play between Switch and Switch 2.</p>

Players will be able to play against each other on both platforms. The update will be available for free.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The New York Times</em>’ games team is trying something new: it’s about to start testing a <em>Scrabble</em>-like game it calls <em>Crossplay</em>, but instead of folding the game into the main NYT Games app, <em>Crossplay</em> will be a standalone app. The game is soft launching in New Zealand on iOS on June 10th.</p><p>I was recently shown a demo of the game by Jonathan Knight, head of games at <em>NYT</em>, and I think it will look familiar to any fans of <em>Scrabble</em> or <em>Words with Friends</em>. The game takes place between two players. Each turn, your goal is to build a word out of the up to seven letter tiles on your tray and the letters already on the board. Every letter has a different point value, and you can boost your score by taking advantage of bonus tiles on the board that multiply your letter or word scores.</p><p>(The <em><em>NYT</em></em> did not provide screenshots I could publish; Knight says that a screenshot of the game right now doesn’t represent where it will be when it launches more widely.)</p><div><p>“We’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game”</p></div><p>The <em>NYT</em> has a few of its own tweaks to differentiate <em>Crossplay</em> from similar games, including different positions for bonus tiles and a different letter distribution, Knight says. The end of the game has a clever twist, too: after all of the letter tiles have been drawn from the virtual bag, each player gets just one additional turn instead of having to clear their tray of tiles to end the game.</p><p>Knight argues that <em>Crossplay</em> is its own app because it’s an experience that would be hard to fit in another app. “We’re very specifically wanting to reach all new audiences with this game,” particularly people that love to compete and love word games, he says.</p><p><em>Crossplay</em> requires a free <em>NYT</em> account to play, and your friends from the main <em>NYT</em> Games app will carry over, Knight says. “Certain aspects” of the game will be exclusive to paid subscribers, such as a feature that will help you review your matches. But he says <em>Crossplay</em> won’t have many of the things that can make other free mobile games frustrating.</p><p>“In a world where mobile games have become little mini casinos, and it’s often hard to find the game itself behind all of the treasure chests and friction and aggressive monetization tactics and coins and all of that, we’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game that you can just get in and enjoy without all that business,” Knight says.</p><p>The <em>NYT’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">acquisition of <em>Wordle</em></a> arguably kicked off the race for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle games</a>, with places like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle">Zynga</a> putting their own stamps on the genre. Overall, the <em>NYT’s</em> games business is growing, according to Knight, including “tremendous downloads,” growing app use, and subscriptions.</p><p><em>NYT</em> puzzles were played 11.1 billion times in 2024, according to statistics shared with <em>The Verge</em> by <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen. <em>Wordle</em> was played 5.3 billion times, “3.3 billion successful <em>Connections</em> were made,” and <em>Strands</em>, the <em>NYT’s</em> word search game, was played 1.3 billion times.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> games team is still developing new puzzles for the main games app, such as <em>Pips</em>, a logic game, that it started beta testing in Canada in April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’ll include improved visuals and performance and feature cross-gen play with people on the original Switch. Both games will also get the free Splatlands update that day which adds new weapons and raises Freshness caps. The Urchin Underpass map from the original Wii U game will also return. </p><p>Here’s the full description from Nintendo’s press release:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><div><p> The update features the Splatlands collection, consisting of new weapons from the Barazushi and Emberz brands. Based on previous weapons, these new additions have fresh looks with different sub and special weapons. There are a total of 30 new weapon kits in this collection. A returning stage from the original <em>Splatoon</em> game on Wii U, called Urchin Underpass, will also be added to the stage rotation.</p><p>&nbsp;Plus, all weapon Freshness caps will be raised and players can earn new in-game Badges. A new stat will be added for Anarchy Battle (Series) called Series Weapon Power. It will track a player’s effectiveness per weapon based on their win/loss ratio in battles – and will then match them with players of a similar power. This makes it possible for players to try new weapons without being disadvantaged and push the limits their favorite weapons.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Further, with this new update <em>Splatoon 3</em> players on Nintendo Switch 2 can enjoy more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds. Today’s trailer also confirmed that <em>Splatoon 3</em> players will be able to play together across both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Mario Party is a game lots of players love, but often not without reservations. The big knock against the series has long been its late-game antics, which can render strategy meaningless by creating huge swings that can suddenly shuffle the standings, regardless of how well or poorly you've been playing all along. Handing out bonus stars like Oprah gifting her audience with cars just doesn't make for a good virtual board game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also not so predictable which of the many categories of minigames will be involved in any Mario Party endgame moment, and as a result, not always so much fun to play, even while the rest of a session might be enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-party/" data-ref-id="5000-681517">Lego Party</a>, a similar minigame-laden multiplayer party game, is intended to be similar to Mario Party but without that annoyance for players, allowing them to strategize more reliably.</p><p dir="ltr">The team behind Lego Party removed the concept of bonus stars (gold bricks in this case) from their take on the party minigame genre, because the team understood that having late-game bonuses that can invalidate playing well in the early game is not an enjoyable mechanic. "I just don't like them," SMG Studio project director Mark Fennell told me bluntly. It feels like randomness added where it doesn't belong. And I can say its absence was appreciated in my Lego Party demo at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2PgTclraWk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A2PgTclraWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only pain point Lego Party seeks to address as a party "board" game. Like in Mario Party, you can steal items, including highly valuable gold bricks, from other players, if the right conditions are met. In Mario Party, you can decline to buy a star when offered, but you can't decline to steal from another player (either a star or coins) if you land on the board game space that says you have to do so. In Lego Party, that's not the case. Since the Lego Party team expects the game to have an audience of players with mixed experience levels, or parents playing with their kids, the change leaves room for the game's older or more mature players to show mercy to younger ones.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did over 100 playtests, and we had some tears," a developer told me, speaking to the times when kids would cry because they'd suffered a loss in the game. Lego Party was re-tuned with this feedback in mind. The option to steal gold bricks can now be declined by the pilfering player. If you're a parent trying to go easy on your kid, you'll have the opportunity <em>not</em> to go through with the action that's going to upset them. It's a nice touch that makes the game kid-friendlier. And of course, if you <em>don't</em> want to go easy on another player, you can just choose not to.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet another small tweak to the rules results in big changes to how games unfold. The player turn order isn't static, like it is in Mario Party, where it's chosen at the beginning of the game. Instead, each turn is given a new order based on the most recent minigame results. If you were just a space away from scoring a star in Mario Party and you're first in the turn order, you can rest assured you'll get it after the next minigame, no matter what happens. In Lego Party, however, you're gonna need to lock in, because the winner of the minigame gains turn priority. That means they could beat you to the gold brick when your group returns to moving around the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party will launch with four boards and over 60 minigames, and those I saw were a fun mix of play styles and objectives. My favorite was one in which players would need to grapple up to a moving platform--a small dancefloor, really--and amass points for staying on it and grooving away. I also saw games like a rally race, a memory test, and a familiar one where players compete for painted space on the ground, constantly painting over each other's brushstrokes.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party benefits from being recognizable; it's "Mario Party but Lego," for the most part, and though that's a fun proposition, its merits may come down more to how it differs, and in particular, how it improves on Nintendo's long-standing party game.</p>

<p>In addition to Splatoon Raiders, Nintendo also has <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> version 10.0.0 inbound. This will add new weapons, badges and more to the base game. As per the video shared via the Nintendo Today app, Splatoon 3 players will soon find 30 new weapon kits, the arrival of Urchin Underpass, new stat tracking options for weapon power, while the weapon freshness limit is being increased.</p>
<p>On top of all that, Nintendo has also talked of improved visuals and frame rate for Switch 2 as part of an update coming on 12th June. It has assured that those playing on Switch 2 will still be able to play against those on the original Switch console, as well.</p>
<p>Splatoon 3 was initially released back in 2022, and we here at Eurogamer were rather taken with it. "There are few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3's multiplayer or campaign, but it is the best Nintendo's spectacular series has been to date," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Eurogamer's Splatoon 3 review</a>.</p>
