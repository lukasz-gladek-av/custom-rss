        Review: new expansion adds to an already vastly improved game.

<p>When we reviewed <em>Diablo IV</em>, the latest installment in the long-running action roleplaying game series last year, we said it was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/diablo-4-review-off-to-a-hell-of-a-good-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">off to a hell of a good start</a>. But ARPGs live and die by their endgame loops, and it was far too early at the time to accurately assess the game’s true staying power.</p>
<p>Sadly, after that confident first step, like so many loot-hunting games before it, <em>Diablo IV</em> fell flat on its face. I’ve seen plenty of boneheaded updates to live-service games, but <em>Diablo IV</em>’s first major patch, released a couple of months after the game’s release, was still pretty shocking. By that point, a consensus had emerged that the endgame was a bit barren, and getting to the game’s level cap of 100 was a tedious slog. But that’s the great thing about live-service games, right? Tweak some numbers, throw in a couple of fun high-level activities, and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">baby, you’ve got a stew going</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game’s developers at Blizzard had other plans. The patch notes for that first update read like someone had systematically gone through the game and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801426/diablo-4s-season-1-patch-1-1-nerfs-community-reaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed anything that could be considered fun</a>. Almost every character build had been mercilessly nerfed, and worst of all, the game became even slower. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1534z13/patch_11_is_essentially_a_slowdown_to_every/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fans were incensed</a>, and <em>Diablo IV</em> floundered like this for its first three <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Season_(Diablo_IV)">seasons</a>. I mostly lost interest.</p>
<p>On the release of the game's first expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, we're checking in on the state of the game—and we're pretty happy with what we've found.<br>

<h2>Loot reborn</h2>
<p>There were many problems with <em>Diablo IV</em>'s endgame, but the most pressing concern was the loot. There were too many possible “affixes”—random properties on pieces of gear—and they were way too specific. You’d have a sword that gave you, like, extra critical hit chance to enemies below a certain health threshold or a helm that gave you a chance (of a chance) of healing on hit. Players started calling these hyper-conditional affixes "damage on Tuesdays" effects.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And because any rare item—a misnomer, as they’re very common—could be converted into a legendary (the items you actually want), you had to pore over every stat on every piece of gear to avoid missing an upgrade. Believe it or not, that was the tip of the iceberg—I’ll spare you an explanation of the game’s strange and infuriating implementation of “legendary aspects.”</p>
<p>It was all so confusing and tedious that looking through loot—what should mark a nice break in the action as you see if you got an exciting upgrade—became an impediment to playing the game. Often, when faced with a full bag of loot to sort through after some adventuring, I’d let out an exhausted sigh and log off.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Diablo IV</em> got its “loot 2.0” update in season 4. (If you're remembering <i>Diablo III</i>’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/two-years-later-reaper-of-souls-is-the-diablo-iii-we-always-wanted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reaper of Souls expansion</a> and feeling déjà vu, yeah, it was like that.) That season was focused entirely on fixing the loot situation, and… it actually worked.</p>
<p>Affixes were pared down to an understandable and easily scannable minimum, and the game added some light but engaging crafting systems to let players further customize their gear. It’s impossible to overstate how much the loot changes improved the game.</p>
<p>There were plenty of other updates, too. Endgame activities were added and tweaked (we saw a return of <em>Diablo III</em>'s Greater Rifts in the form of "the Pit"), and the game generally found its footing. Now, Blizzard is going further.</p>

<h2>Haters welcome</h2>


<p>The cheerily named Vessel of Hatred picks up where the base game lets off. The story, told through the usual combination of cutscenes (both breathtaking and pedestrian) and fairly standard “go here and kill monsters” questing, is on par with that of the base game, which is to say it’s atmospheric and engaging enough, but you’ll probably play it once and then skip it in future seasons to focus on the monster slaughtering. I’ll be frank: I don’t care a whit about the story content of ARPGs, and I’d recommend looking elsewhere if that’s all you’re interested in. But it’s fine.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The new Amazonian-themed region of Nahantu brings a bit of color to <em>Diablo IV</em>’s intentionally drab and dreary map. As much as I enjoy the muddy fields and desolate wastelands of the base game, I’ll admit that a splash of color really livens things up. It still feels like Diablo, though, which is great.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>The expansion's new Nahantu region has great art direction.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>Easily my favorite part of the expansion is the new class, the dexterity-based Spiritborn. The Spiritborn calls on the spirits of four creatures—jaguar, gorilla, eagle, and centipede—to rain down destruction on its foes. Any worries I had that the class would be too similar to the base game's animal-centric Druid class were dispelled when I actually got my hands on it. I didn't have time to try out all of its archetypes, but I specced into the fiery jaguar and poison-spreading centipede trees and found a lot to love.</p>
<p>There's a level of thoughtfulness and polish to the class that shows Blizzard really took its time in designing it. I'd love to see the company give all the classes some similar love—and while I'm wishing, I hope the next big thing Blizzard tackles is all of the game's skill trees. There are some mild tweaks in the new update, but the trees still feel a bit simplistic overall.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>The new Spiritborn class harnesses the power of creatures to do damage.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>Also new in the expansion are mercenaries, a return of sorts of the "follower" system we had in <em>Diablo III</em>. Choose from four NPC mercs—a tank, a fighter, an archer, and a fire-wielding demon—to fight by your side, and level them up to unlock abilities and a new bartering system. I generally prefer a more lone-wolf style of gameplay in these types of games, but the mercenaries seem helpful, and they don't get in the way too much. I'll take their help.</p>

          
                  </div>

<h2>Room for activities</h2>
<p><em>Diablo IV</em>'s endgame activities had already reached a much healthier state before the new update, but <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> adds even more ways to get sucked in.</p>
<p>The Kurast Undercity, a new multi-stage time-attack dungeon, was a big standout for me. You start with a timer of 100 seconds or so, and you fight through several levels of a dungeon, killing specific elite monsters along the way to extend your timer and enhance your rewards. There are several ways to tailor the rewards to your liking, and the whole thing feels like a healthy burst of adrenaline.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>The Kurast Undercity is a new multi-stage time-attack dungeon.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>I didn't get a chance to test the Dark Citadel, the Diablo franchise's first multiplayer "raid" experience, but it's a big leap for the series. There are three "wings" to the dungeon, each culminating in a boss fight, and you can complete a wing and come back later for the others if you want. But you <em>will</em> need a party to play—at least two people are required, and four are strongly recommended. Teamwork mechanics, the hallmark of any raid, are a big part of the experience.</p>

<p>Diablo is a distinctly single-player experience for many players, so this mode may fall flat with a large part of the audience. If you want to play with others, though, the game's new party finder will help you group up with fellow adventurers, and not just for the raid. You can specify activities, though this isn't automatic matchmaking; the finder just helps you find a group of like-minded players. Regardless of your thoughts on raiding (I'm generally not a fan), the party finder is something people have been asking for since the game's launch, and I'm glad to see it finally arrive.</p>

<h2>2.0</h2>

          </p>
  </div>
        </figcaption>
            </figure><p>
The new version of <em>Diablo IV</em> is essentially a rework of the entire game, including progression and difficulty systems. The game now has eight difficulty levels (four standard and four unlockable "torment" difficulties), allowing for more granular control over your experience while giving you milestones to shoot for. It's a much better system than the convoluted "world tier" system we had previously.</p>
<p>The level cap has been lowered from 100 to 60, but there are now more points available for the Paragon system, which lets you continue leveling in the endgame. The Paragon system still feels a bit unwieldy to me, so hopefully Blizzard can continue to refine it in the future.</p>
<p><em>Vessel of Hatred</em> also brings back&nbsp;<em>Diablo II</em>'s "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">runewords</a>," though the system is different in <em>Diablo IV. </em>Essentially, you can now slot two runes into any piece of gear that supports them, with one (a "rune of ritual") being a condition you need to meet to get a resource called "offering" and the other (a rune of invocation) determining the effect you'll get when you spend that resource. It's essentially a way to create your own skills. Cast a skill or travel a certain distance, for instance, to increase your critical hit chance or even get access to other classes' skills. The system seems fairly barebones at the moment, but there's plenty of room for expansion here, especially if Blizzard can balance all the effects.</p>
<p>Because Blizzard is once again shaking up several core systems, and because the community needs time to chew up and spit out the endgame, I can’t guarantee that hidden issues won’t start cropping up. I'm especially concerned about the fact that the game's pinnacle "ancestral" legendary gear seems to be a bit rarer than one would hope. Progression speed needs to stay snappy; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/are-diablo-fans-getting-too-old-for-the-old-school-item-grind/">no one wants a return to tedious grinds</a>.</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>What I <em>can</em> say is that Blizzard’s launch-era “we know best” attitude has given way to a much more open and community-centric position. The developer has introduced “public test realms” to the game, pre-season servers that let players test new updates before they go live. They're available for anyone to play and give feedback on, and Blizzard has shown it's listening—most of the complaints that arose during the past two PTRs were addressed by the time their seasons launched. This, more than anything else, gives me confidence in the game's future.</p>

<p>Cosmetic microtransactions are still a thing, and they’re still the worst part of the game. You can ignore them completely, but designing a game around selling skins has unfortunate knock-on effects, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/im-still-worried-about-diablo-ivs-cosmetic-only-microtransactions/">I’ve complained about before</a>. If you’ll brook no microtransactions in your full-priced game (though the standard price for the base game has dropped from $70 to $50), you can safely move on with your life—nothing here will change your mind.</p>
<p>The expansion will get you the new class, new region (including new dungeons), new campaign, mercernaries, the raid, the Kurast Undercity, and the runewords system. Everyone who owns the base game will get all the new systems updates, including the new difficulty system and new gear.</p>
<p>Here’s my recommendation: If you bought the game and dropped off at some point, or if you were waiting for Blizzard to iron out the kinks, there’s never been a better time to check out the base game. If you find yourself enjoying it and want more,&nbsp;<em>Vessel of Hatred</em> is here and waiting for you.</p>
<p>With the impending Early Access release of the much-anticipated<em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/">Path of Exile 2</a>&nbsp;</em>coming in November, Blizzard needed to nail this. Diablo fans can rest assured that it did.</p>

            <p>A little under two years since it first debuted on Valve's PC storefront, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> has finally got itself those lovely Steam Achievements.</p>
<p>Back in December 2022, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-assassins-creed-valhalla-wont-get-steam-achievements">Assassin's Creed Valhalla wouldn't be getting Achievements on Steam</a>. This led to a certain amount of upset from the community, which argued Achievements were a key feature of Steam.</p>
<p>However, fast-forward to today, and those Achievements are now there.</p>

<p>As shown on Assassin's Creed Valhalla's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2208920/history/">SteamDB</a> page, the team added in Achievements for the game last night.</p>
<p>The addition of Steam Achievements in Assassin's Creed Valhalla marks another step forward in Ubisoft's full return to the PC storefront. Last month, Ubisoft announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">new releases are set to launch day one on Steam</a>, something the company has eschewed for a while now.</p>
<p>This will all begin with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which is set to release on 14th February next year. Meanwhile, Ubisoft recently announced last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-comes-to-steam-this-month-as-ubisoft-returns-to-valves-storefront">Assassin's Creed Mirage will also be coming to Steam</a> later this month.</p>

<p>For more on Assassin's Creed, a recent report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode-in-development-report">Ubisoft is working on a co-op mode for Shadows</a>. Should this report prove accurate, it would mark the studio's first foray back to Assassin's Creed co-op gameplay in over a decade.</p>
<p>As for Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-families-officially-launches-out-of-beta">Valve opened up Steam Families to the wider public</a> last month. Steam Families replaces both Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View, giving users a one stop shop to manage who can access what and when.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> won't be as powerful as the current generation consoles from Sony and Microsoft, the upcoming system will support every Unreal Engine 5 feature, possibly even the recently revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/">MegaLights</a>, although with some caveats.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry replied to a fan question asking if the next Nintendo console will support the latest UE5 features, saying that features like Lumen, Nanite, and Virtual Shadows Maps will surely be supported by virtue of the architecture of the system alone. Even MegaLights could be supported, as all that matters are the performance targets. In addition, there could be some Nintendo Switch 2-specific versions of all these technologies that will allow them to run decently on the system with some obvious trade-offs, and if they are not too memory intensive. Even hardware Lumen could run on the system with the proper tweaks.</p>
<p>Given how much third-party support the original Switch received, something that was made possible by the system supporting the Unreal Engine, and that most of these developers are moving onto the new version of the engine, there's no doubt that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support the vast majority of the Unreal Engine 5 features. Not every game will scale well, and some will have some compromises, but looking at what has been accomplished on its predecessor, there's no doubt that we will see some impressive showcases for a mobile platform on it.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also commented on how the Nintendo Switch 2 handheld mode performance differences with the Steam Deck could impact the platform. According to the tech experts, there won't be much of an impact, as the two platforms offer substantially different experiences. The Steam Deck is a little clunkier to use and, most of all, lacks the Nintendo games that drive the sales of its platforms. On the other hand, developers aren't targeting the Steam Deck specifically, while Nintendo Switch 2 games will be optimized to run on the system and take advantage of its feature set, which is said to include the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-custom-dlss/">NVIDIA DLSS upscaler</a>. The only scenario where a difference in performance could matter is in a drought situation where multiplatform games fill in the gap left by the lack of first-party releases</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>Atlus' RPGs - the likes of the Persona series and this week's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> - are well known for their stylish menus, but it turns out they're "really annoying to do".</p>
<p>That's according to director Katsura Hashino who discussed the menu design with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>"In general, the way most game developers make UI is very simple. That’s what we try to do as well - we try to keep things simple, practical, and usable," said Hashino.</p>

<p>"But maybe the reason that we’ve achieved both [functionality and beauty] is that we have unique designs that we make for each and every menu. This is actually really annoying to do. We have separate programs running for each of them as well. Whether it’s the shop menu or the main menu, when you open them up there’s a whole separate program running and a separate design that goes into making it. It takes a lot of time."</p><p>From selecting options in battle to evolving Persona or Archetypes, the menu designs in Atlus' games have been praised for their balance of flashiness and usability, so perhaps that annoyance is all worth it. On the other hand, some players are put-off by how busy they are.</p>
<p>Over time, Atlus has evolved its menu style to achieve that balance. "How we achieve both of them together is by the know-how that we built up over years," said Hashino.</p>
<p>For instance, there were angular elements in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>'s menus that hindered legibility. "It was impossible to read at first," he said, "so we did lots of tweaking and adjusting so it became legible."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/travellers-hymn">Traveller's Hymn</a> is a top-down, grid-based, open-world adventure game (and breathe), set in a dark fantasy land. The tileset is lovely, as are the little dialogue boxes and menus and the gentle bob of your backpack-ridden character as they walk. Basically, it looks like it's worth everyone's time, particularly because there's one big twist here - it's entirely free.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers Aquatic Ranger Studio were asked over on <a href="https://x.com/AquaticRangerGS/status/1842763992659304902">Xwitter</a> why the game was free, considering people likely would've paid good money for something that looks so breezy. They said that it's their "first attempt at gamedev", and that "we've only spent 4 months on it because it started as an experimental project". Essentially, they felt like the game was good enough to publish, but the "contents are a bit lacking", so didn't want to charge for it.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The devs say the game clocks in roughly at "4-5 hours" and it'll see you explore, battle, and loot for some nice rewards. What's staggering is that there are over 20 unique locations, over 100 enemies and NPCs, and over 100 items. All from a three-person team in the space of a few months? Outrageous. Apparently there's also a hunger system but we can pretend that doesn't exist.</p><p>There aren't any plans outlined right now for further development, but presumably, they're going to see how it does and decide whether it's worth investing the time to turn it into an actual, full fledged release, perhaps over Steam early access. We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>If you want to give it a try, Traveller's Hymn is out sometime today over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249180/Travellers_Hymn/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Epic Games has won a major victory in its ongoing legal battle against Google, which a US judge has now ruled operates an illegal monopoly via its smartphone app store. 
</p>
<p>
Google - which is appealing the verdict - has been ordered to allow third-party storefront apps such as the Epic Games Store to be made available from the Google Play Store in the US next year. 
</p>
<p>
For at least the next three years, Google will also be forced to allow users to pay via alternate means, rather than just Google Play Billing, from which Google takes a 30 percent cut. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">statement</a> released in response to the verdict, Google said it would push back against the ruling and request a pause on its required changes "to maintain a consistent and safe experience for users and developers".
</p>
<p>
Google has argued the verdict should be reviewed as it appears to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-trumpets-resounding-victory-in-epic-anti-trust-lawsuit-appeal">contradict the ruling of Epic's less-successful Apple trial</a> - and that because it exists in competition to Apple, it does not have a monopoly either.
</p>
<p>
"The Epic verdict missed the obvious," Google spokesperson Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote. "Apple and Android clearly compete."
</p>
<p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, meanwhile, had this pithy pun:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Google has pointed to Android already being "open" - and more so than iOS - as it allows side-loading and lets users download the Epic Games Store currently. 
</p>
<p>
This is true, of course, though Epic Games' fight here has been to streamline the process of getting to the Epic Games Store - which currently requires a fiddly process where users see various "scare screens" designed to put them off. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-launches-major-new-lawsuit-in-app-store-fight-this-time-against-samsung-and-google">Epic Games has already launched a fresh lawsuit against both Google and former partner Samsung</a> for, it says, pre-emptively making the process to download the Epic Game Store on Android phones more difficult.

            <p>Sonic Rumble, Sega's forthcoming mobile and PC game, won't have gacha mechanics because they're not popular in the west.</p>
<p>The 32-player battle royale will be free-to-play but won't be pay-to-win, with a season pass as its main monetisation.</p>
<p>"We're aiming for a casual system that allows you to just buy what you want quickly for a small, fixed amount, rather than a gacha system that gives you a certain probability of obtaining items," game director Makoto Tase told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-avoided-gacha-and-pay-to-win-mechanics-in-sonic-rumble-because-they-know-overseas-players-dont-like-them/">Automaton</a>.</p>

<p>Added Sonic franchise lead Takashi Iizuka: "In the Japanese and Asian markets, it's common to have to spend tens of thousands of yen [in a game] until you draw a rare character and finally get to move on. But this is not the case in the global market, especially for an action game like Sonic Rumble, where players should be able to enjoy the game on an equal footing. The starting point of this project itself was to make it a mobile game that would sell globally. Therefore, the monetisation model was designed from the beginning based on global standards."</p>
<p>Instead, players will spend in-game Rings on cosmetics, which will be updated daily. Rings are obtained through play to raise your score and double as in-game currency.</p>
<p>Monetisation through gacha mechanics - that is, spending money for a random item - have "not been very successful when it comes to games targeted towards worldwide audiences of all ages," said Tase. "Also, such mechanics tend to be shunned overseas, so we didn’t think it was the right choice for this project."</p>
<p>Sonic Rumble has been developed with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> studio Rovio, which Sega acquired in 2023. Company profits have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-acquisition-of-angry-birds-maker-rovio-helps-boost-profits-by-1815">since been boosted significantly</a>.</p>
<p>The game is a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque battle royale with multiple modes for players to race through or battle for Rings. It's set for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-sonic-and-dc-comic-collaboration-at-sonic-central-stream">release across mobile and PC this winter</a>.</p>
<p>The gacha comments are certainly interesting when compared to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-turns-square-enixs-best-into-an-avalanche-of-money-grabbing-tactics">Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis</a> game is rife with money-grabbing tactics, although the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sales-drop-year-on-year-despite-release-of-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">latest financial report</a> states its mobile games have seen declining sales "due to weak sales of existing titles".</p>
<p>The company has recently closed a number of mobile games in the west, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>, which included gacha mechanics - notably the Japanese version will remain in service.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Tiny deck builder Combo Critters exhibits the winning combination common to both small games and radical breakfast cereals - it’s very crunchy, but also bright, sugary and moreish. If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/27/kelloggs-ceo-cereal-for-dinner">Thaddius Cornflakes</a> had recommended struggling families play Combo Critters instead of eating Cookie Crisp for dinner, I imagine the backlash would have been far more reserved. Cookie Crisp tastes like like someone poured Splenda on a packing peanut fished out from a puddle. Combo Critters, though? Pretty tasty, and also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free</a> from <a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/combo-critters">Itch here</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Combo Critters is the latest from PUNKCAKE Délicieux, of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shotgun-king-is-roguelike-chess-with-a-shotgun">Shotgun King</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-mathematical-tactics-rpg-is-like-the-countdown-numbers-round-with-added-violence">Super Algebrawl</a> fame. Each level, you form a team of six critters by drawing and discarding, then try to beat your opponent’s score. Each critter has a score, an alignment, and a special effect. Some critters play nice with each other, some don’t. I currently have an ice cream in my hand that adds fifteen to its score if paired with another critter called Cloud, but I also need at least one other ‘sugar’ type critter to score at all. Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote>Welcome to Combo Critters, a unique strategy game where the smallest creatures pack the biggest punch! Build a team of tiny yet powerful critters, each with unique abilities and traits. Maximize their interactions and synergies to achieve the highest possible score and outwit your opponents.</blockquote>
<p>Also, get this: It’s not a bloody roguelike. You get to a NEW stage and if you FAIL the stage you just START that stage over and TRY AGAIN. Is this legal, I ask?</p>
<p>I do have to whine briefly though: Combo Critters refuses to explain itself whatsoever, including what certain status effects and other terms mean. This feels like such an obvious oversight that I’m wondering if it’s a deliberate choice - the proverbial dump in the cereal. Perhaps it’s a ploy to command your full attention and teach you an important lesson - for how many people do we look at, but never really see? A lesson on empathy? Pretty rich coming from the bastards who couldn’t even empathise with my need for a tutorial, that. Anyway - cool game, lovely soundtrack, very free. Enjoy!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a week since the free-to-play Unreal Engine 4-powered MMORPG Throne and Liberty launched globally on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, and publisher Amazon Games has now shared the first promising figures on player numbers. According to Amazon, over three million players have ventured into the world of Solisium during the first seven days of availability. Altogether, they have spent more than 24 million hours in the game, an average of eight each. The game fared well on Twitch, too, with more than 11 million hours watched on the streaming platform.</p>
<p>Christoph Hartmann, VP at Amazon Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Bringing Throne and Liberty to players around the world has been a huge shared undertaking by our team and our friends at NCSOFT, and we’re so pleased to see the results as players join the game. We’re only getting started, and we have a series of updates planned including our first castle siege coming soon.</em></p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-pre-launch-qa-new-weapons-and-pvp-modes-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Daniel Lafuente (Globalization Design Manager at Amazon Games), who teased some of the upcoming updates for the MMORPG. According to the official roadmap, November will see the first major guild events in the form of the first Tax Delivery Event and Castle Sieges. Amazon Games is also planning to launch Arena Season 1 for the 3v3 mode and possibly the two-star co-op dungeons as well.</p>
<p>The Korean version of Throne and Liberty already saw the introduction of a whole new mountainous region called Talandre, where players can even exploit water currents to get an advantage during conquest battles. In Talandre, players will find four new field bosses and two new arch-bosses to defeat. There are also new systems called Runes and Trait Resonance. All of these things will be added in due time to the global version.</p>
<p>Amazon Games isn't new to big launches, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-had-over-1-million-players-on-day-one-character-transfers-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-had-over-4-7-million-players-says-amazon-who-wants-to-be-the-most-customer-obsessed-company-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Ark</a> both setting records right away. However, both games saw massive reductions in the respective player bases over time, especially New World. Still, the latter game largely suffered because of a lack of content, and this likely won't be an issue with Throne and Liberty, as noted above.</p>

			<p>Kalypso Media and Claymore Game Studios announced the release of a demo for the upcoming real-time tactics game <a href="https://wccftech.com/commandos-origins-gets-new-trailer-ahead-of-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commandos: Origins</a>. The demo is available only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3137720/Commandos_Origins__Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/commandos-origins-demo/9nq8p31k009d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series S|X</a>, although the full game is also launching on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>In this test mission, players will step into the iconic boots of the Green Beret and Marine and be immersed in the heart of tactical warfare. They have to sabotage a cutting-edge German radar system responsible for a shocking surge in RAF casualties. The Green Beret is adept with both his combat knife and his Colt M1911. However, sometimes, it's just more effective to use a sound decoy to distract the soldiers and slip past unnoticed. The Marine, on the other hand, uses his throwing knives with deadly precision and is an expert at throwing a simple rock to distract guards.</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the Channel Islands during World War II, the Commandos will use their unique skills to sabotage a German radar system, showcasing the exciting gameplay that Commandos: Origins promises.&nbsp;This demo-exclusive test mission, Operation: Prelude, is a sneak peek at the intricate gameplay mechanics and stealth tactics that await players in the full release.</p>
<p>The full game will include fourteen missions set in authentic World War II environments, ranging from the barren Arctic to the African desert. Players will be able to select six Commandos: Jack O’Hara “the Green Beret”, Thomas “the Sapper” Hancock, Francis T. “the Sniper” Woolridge, Samuel “the Driver” Brooklyn, James “the Marine” Blackwood, and Rene “the Spy” Duchamp.</p>
<p>Commandos: Origins is still scheduled to launch in 2024, even though there's only a couple and a half months left before the end of the year. It will be added to Game Pass PC and console on day one.</p>

<p>Rejoice, Fallout fans – there’s a new trailer for Fallout: Nuevo México, and it comes months after concerns surfaced that the project was going to be cancelled. In the latest trailer, which is a meaty three minutes long, we get a new look at the game-sized mod that promises to breathe a fresh lease of life into Fallout: New Vegas.</p>



<p>It’s potentially more ambitious than Fallout: London, which was released recently on the Fallout 4 platform. Building Fallout: Nuevo México in Fallout: New Vegas’ engine has proven to be a trifle tougher than manipulating the tools available in Fallout 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-viva-mexico">Viva México</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, concerns surfaced regarding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the future of Nuevo México</a>, a game-sized Fallout: New Vegas mod with huge potential. It was announced that the project was on an ‘indefinite hold’ following the departure of Zapshock, the mod’s lead developer. It came mere weeks after the indefinite cancellation of Fallout: London, a similarly ambitious mod for Fallout 4.</p>



<p>However, Fallout: London would go on to be released weeks later, while Fallout: Nuevo México has been shrouded in silence for months.</p>



<p>This latest trailer helps to dispel fears that it’ll never make it to the market:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout: México - Official Reveal Trailer | 🇲🇽" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zoh5HxjV81M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Per the mod’s synopsis on YouTube:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mexico City is the largest city in North America and serves as the biggest hub in Fallout: Nuevo México. While still largely under development, we are thrilled to finally reveal this iconic wasteland. </p>



<p>Once the vibrant heart of a massive metropolis, Mexico City now lies in ruin, a battleground for factions struggling for dominance and survival. From the decaying colonia of Chapultepec to the submerged canals of Xochimilco, the city is a haunting blend of beauty and brutality.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The update doesn’t mention the recent hold, nor does it address the radio silence that has been in place for the last few months. It’s just solid news that the mod is moving forward once again, and not only that but it looks brilliant on-screen.</p>

<p>In 2018, Detroit: Become Human hit the market and delivered an emotional, heart-wrenching experience to fans worldwide. As one of the best ‘choice-and-consequence’ games out there,e Detroit: Become Human puts players in control of several characters, all of whom can ultimately become intertwined through a dramatic and immersive story.</p>



<p>It was remarkably well received, and to this day, people are still raving about it. Recently, the team at Quantic Dream revealed that the game has officially hit 10 million (paid) copies sold across PlayStation and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-a-little-while-longer">Just a Little While Longer</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human offers one of the most engaging stories you’ll ever play. From the perspective of several characters, you’ll embark on an intense journey that details the uprising of ‘synths’ or ‘androids’ against human oppressors and masters. </p>



<p>Whether you’re playing as Kara, a protective housekeeper, or Connor, a conflicted investigator who must align closely with human law enforcement officers, you’ll be exploring multiple angles of a story where one wrong choice could mean the irrevocable death of a character.</p>



<p>Think Beyond Two Souls or Heavy Rain but in a universe that could one day be our reality.</p>



<p>In a recent post on X, Guillaume de Fondaumière, the CEO of Quantic Dream, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The entire Quantic Dream team is joining me to proudly announce that (Detroit: Become Human) has now sold in excess of 10 million (paid) units on PlayStation and PC. </p>



<p>We are extremely grateful to each and everyone out there who played the game. You mean the world to us and we couldn’t have achieved this incredible milestone without every single one of you!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Around the time that Detroit: Become Human was released, Quantic Dream came under fire for allegedly fostering a toxic working environment, which forced a reform at the studio. Despite that, fans were – and still are – hungry for a follow-up title to Detroit: Become Human, which would perfectly translate into a live-action adaptation at any time.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-trailer-launch-gameplay/</link>

<p>It’s almost time to dive into one of the most highly anticipated Call of Duty titles in years. On October 25, Black Ops 6 will be released worldwide, marking the arrival of a game that expands a story that was kicked off way back in 2010. It’s a game that makes history in a couple of ways, but on a more basic level, it’s a solid shooter with an intriguing story.</p>



<p>That concept was explored in the most recent Black Ops 6 trailer published by Activision.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-truth-still-lies">The Truth (Still) Lies</h2>



<p>The one-minute trailer released by Activision gives us another glimpse at the story that awaits us in Black Ops 6. It’s the most conspiracy-laden and controversial campaign created in Black Ops history, playing with stories that massively impacted our own world over the last few decades.</p>



<p>Check out the latest Black Ops 6 gameplay trailer here:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Global Launch Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0uxvKUjsj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s a mixed bag, that’s for sure. We’re seeing scenes of subterfuge and sabotage mixed in with guns-blazing, high-octane action. From dream sequences to blasting out bridges from the gunner seat of a chopper, Black Ops 6 looks like it’ll offer one of the most diverse and intriguing stories in years.</p>



<p>Speaking subjectively, the Black Ops 6 has always done better regarding the story element of the Call of Duty series. Modern Warfare’s reboot failed to captivate audiences since 2019, and the most recent release, Modern Warfare 3, boasted an unforgettable campaign that could be completed in just two or three hours if you rushed.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is the first Call of Duty game in history to be available on Game Pass at launch, so you can invest in this year’s title without parting ways with a penny.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred’s release is delayed no more. As of October 8, 12:18 AM ET, the expansion is available for all players.</p>



<p>“QA verification complete,” Blizzard’s Adam Fletcher said. “Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is NOW LIVE across all platforms!”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/theadvnt/status/1843499732288827811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those on social media</a>, the update came in at <a href="https://x.com/Johay90/status/1843500911248679092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">around 40GB</a>, even for those who predownloaded.</p>



<p><em>Update 1 and Original story is below…</em></p>



<hr>



<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred remains delayed, but a release could finally be happening soon.</p>



<p>“The new update is nearly finished uploading to our servers,” Blizzard’s Adam Fletcher posted at 11:30pm ET. “We will be giving the greenlight once the update is finished and available for PC [Battle.net] users to download.</p>



<p>“During this time, we will be running last minute QA verifications before we turn things on.”</p>



<p>The update was originally scheduled to release at 7pm ET but has been delayed due to technical issues “on the back end”. </p>



<p><em>Original story is below…</em></p>



<hr>



<p>Diablo 4’s Vessel of Hatred’s launch has been delayed. The expansion was scheduled to launch at 7pm ET on Monday, October 7, but didn’t happen for players.</p>



<p>Around 5:30pm ET, Diablo 4 global director of community Adam Fletcher <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/adjustment-and-delay-to-vessel-of-hatred-launch-start-time/191713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted online</a> that Blizzard was looking at a “small delay” for the launch. At the time, he said that the developers were “tackling a small issue on the back end” but they still expected it to launch Monday evening.</p>



<p>As time passed by, the update still hadn’t released, though players were being removed from the game and logins were being locked around 7pm ET. This was to prepare for the deployment of Vessel of Hatred. However, it still wasn’t released.</p>



<p>The latest update came around 9:30pm ET</p>



<p>“[I]t looks like it will be about upwards of two hours until we launch Vessel of Hatred,” Fletcher said. “Additionally Battle.net players will need an additional sizable update before playing.</p>



<p>“We will let you know when this update is available. We apologize for the delay and look forward to seeing you in Nahantu soon.”</p>



<p>For what was hoped to be just a “<a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1843407297634283968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">couple hours at most</a>” has turned into several for fans who have been patiently waiting for the release. As of publishing at 11pm ET, the update still wasn’t available to download.</p>

<p>In the world of Valorant, popular pro player, Bang (bangzerra) has officially joined Sentinels, the massive esports organization. The news of the 20-year-old Valorant pro’s signing comes just days after he officially left 100 Thieve’s Valorant team.</p>



<h2 id="h-bang-joins-sentinels-s-valorant-team">Bang Joins Sentinels’s Valorant Team</h2>



<p>With the VCT in its off-season, many teams are acquiring new players, trying to prepare for the 2025 season. Sentinels are no different. </p>



<p>After coming in second in the Red Bull Home Ground North American Qualifier, the team has officially signed Bang. The player not only played on 100 Thieves but was at one point a player for TSM, making him quite the decorated Valorant competitor.</p>



<p>While having played for various big esports teams, Bang has never actually won a Valorant Champions. The player, however, seems to be quite determined with his new start at Sentinels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“I’m ready to f**king win,” said Bang in Sentinels’s announcement video. In fact, these were the only words the player expressed, showing that his drive is focused solely on being the best.</p>







<h2 id="h-bang-leaves-100-thieves-just-days-ago">Bang Leaves 100 Thieves Just Days Ago</h2>



<p>The competitor left 100 Thieves’s Valorant team just a few days ago, making his signing to Sentinels an extremely fast turnaround. </p>



<p>“Hardest decision of my career,” said Bang on Twitter when announcing he was leaving 100 Thieves. “I know this makes some people happy and some people sad. I wish I helped 100T win more, but in the end, I’m proud of what we accomplished.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hardest decision of my career, I know this makes some people happy and some people sad.

</div></figure>



<p>Bang’s words resonated with 100 Thieves fans, and fans of his own. It will be exciting to see what this new chapter brings for the competitor as we approach the end of the year, heading into the 2025 VCT season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki Preview - Open-World Fun Meets Fashion]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion.1003320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/infinity-nikki-preview-open-world-fun-meets-fashion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> somehow expertly combines open-world exploration and coziness with a fashion-forward story that both new players and Nikki veterans are sure to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a chance to check out the <em>Infinity Nikki</em> closed private preview, and as a longtime <em>Love Nikki</em> enthusiast, I had very high hopes. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/infinity-nikki"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a> exceeded these expectations, crafting a stunning open-world game with incredibly fun exploration and gorgeous aesthetics.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/early-infinity-nikki-cutscene.jpg?itok=f48VqLFF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/early-infinity-nikki-cutscene.jpg?itok=IlBy-uP6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>starts off with incredibly powerful and beautiful scenes.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Opening Story&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> starts with Nikki her longtime pet pal Momo exploring Nikki’s attic. There, they find a few dresses that belonged to Nikki’s mother. One teleports them to Miraland, where Nikki is tasked with crafting Miracle Outfits to save a mysterious woman named Ena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along the way, Nikki meets an incredible cast of characters that are both gorgeous visually and have well-done voice acting. The story itself is interesting, but it’s nothing that stands out compared to other live-action open-world titles. However, it sets the stage to let the characters and aesthetics shine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riding-a-bike-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=3DqS1Cd- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riding-a-bike-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=WrkR8wAf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are plenty of ways to get around the stunning world of&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Shining Open World with Plenty to Do</h2>
<p>The world contains a plethora of things to do, including fishing, crafting, minigames, and even grooming animals. These smaller things are ways to relax in Miraland while crafting different outfit pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These outfits are used for both aesthetic purposes while exploring and for competitions that are reminiscent of other <em>Nikki </em>games. There are groups that players can find and challenge, and these challenges are putting together an outfit that fits certain criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grooming-cat-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=mCm9uDkX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grooming-cat-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=gv-JH--n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grooming animals in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is adorable, and the animals themselves are absolutely precious.</figcaption></figure><p>While exploring the open world, players can find Whimstars, which are used to craft Miracle Outfits that unlock special abilities. These are generally found through light platforming, which is actually intuitive and feels good to play. There’s also some combat, but it’s just clicking the mouse while aiming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hesitant about how this would feel in a <em>Nikki </em>title, but I was impressed. I’m generally not someone who explores much even in open-world games like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, but I found exploring satisfying in a way not many other games hit for me.</p>
<p>The world is packed to the brim with things to explore in the early area, meaning there’s plenty of content when players are done with the story or trying to level up.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Beautiful and Bone-Chilling Aesthetics and Outfits</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resonating-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=bpgw7eeg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resonating-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=L5cjvkWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The gacha mechanic has a gorgeous animation.</figcaption></figure><p>All of these things were great and well done, but the true magic of <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is, of course, the fashion and aesthetics. <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is an absolutely stunning game, both in cutscenes and regular gameplay. The sights are breathtaking, and even the music gave me cold chills at one point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course, fashion contributes to this. Each item of clothing, from three-star items to five-star items, is more detailed than I’ve ever seen in a video game. Each item has been crafted with love, and there are endless outfit combinations to make with each unique piece.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outfits-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=fLgykK75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outfits-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=yUEb7_5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of the first outfits I created in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, combining low and high rarity items.</figcaption></figure><p>The Miracle Outfits are all able to be broken down into components and used to create stunning outfits. Players can also craft outfit pieces and use the resonate-gacha system to get more pieces as well.</p>
<p>While some might scoff at the gacha aspect, it’s one that <em>Nikki </em>games generally do well. There are a lot of great items to pull, and the opportunity for free pulls exists at every corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had so much fun creating outfits, and Nikki looked stunning in them all. Running around the overworld with several different outfits honestly contributed to how great the exploration felt. There’s something special about in-depth character creations that can change how a game plays for me, and <em>Infinity Nikki</em> absolutely nailed it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Players of all Levels can Join In</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/boss-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=pKLN9PdU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/boss-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=iAag-Wvr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The boss designs were incredible and fit the world of <em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>well.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this was to be expected – it’s what the <em>Nikki </em>series is about. And the game knows its audience well. For those who may not have played an open-world game, the tutorial at the beginning is incredibly detailed. So much so that players who are accustomed to open-world mechanics might think it’s overkill.</p>
<p>However, the in-depth tutorial makes the open-world game feel less daunting for those who are coming to the series as mobile <em>Nikki </em>players.</p>
<p>Considering <em>Nikki </em>has only ever been a mobile game prior to <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it’s very likely that some players haven’t played an open-world game at all. Developers accounted for this very well, and I was impressed because it’s often an area in games that’s looked over.</p>
<h2>Infinity Nikki Preview Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/adorable-dragon-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=sTLPEEfZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/adorable-dragon-in-infinity-nikki.jpg?itok=x_CtPQnX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>were lovely.</figcaption></figure><p>All in all, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> knocks every other mobile open-world game out of the park. With fun, simple mechanics, and absolutely stunning aesthetics, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is perfect for anyone with a passion for fashion. In fact, any open-world game lover should try it out. There are so many things it does right that it’s a fun play even outside the outfits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Nikki&nbsp;</em>games also historically have great PvP content and events that reward stunning outfits. There were no events going on for the closed beta of course, but the potential of these in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has me very hopeful that it will become an everyday, staple game in my rotation.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>Infinity Nikki</strong> was previewed over approximately 15 hours of gameplay on PC with a key provided by developers. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>
