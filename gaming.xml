			<p>The announcement of the long-rumored Final Fantasy IX may be imminent as Square Enix is gearing up to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Earlier today, a new <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary news page</a> went live on the series' portal website, revealing some of the projects that will mark the occasion, including new figurines, plushies, and a commemorative record featuring a newly recorded version of the Melodies of Life theme song called Timeless Tale. Interestingly enough, a couple of months back, a Reddit user called<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i2putn/comment/m7gztwq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TomAto314</a> revealed they knew of this record, and the information in their possession suggested that the music contained in it was for a game, so there's a good chance this new version of the theme song could have been recorded for the yet to be announced remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake is one of the very few projects by Square Enix revealed via a massive GeForce Now leak a few years back that has yet to be announced. According to rumors, the remake will be quite <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-faithful-modest-budget/">faithful to the original</a>, so we shouldn't expect a massive overhaul in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy. Unfortunately, it seems like we will have to wait a few more months to see Zidane and the gang back in action, as the remake isn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-remake-active-development/">expected to release this year</a>, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy IX remake has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a lot of different side activities that reward players not only with experience points but also with all sorts of items, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-get-resources/">resources</a> that can be used to improve the Hideout and Legendary equipment, and Knowledge points, which are used to unlock new parts of Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees.</p>
<p>Among the activities that Naoe alone can complete to earn Knowledge points, as well as unlock a specific achievement, are Kuji-Kiri, quick time events where Naoe meditates while sitting in some rather stunning locations. If you're having trouble finding all 22 Kuji-Kiri locations, you have definitely come to the right place, as the maps below, divided by region, will help you pinpoint the locations with ease without having to look behind every nook and cranny of the game's massive map.</p>

<p>16 - On Mount Hiei, to the north of Sakamoto. During the meditation, you will be attacked by The Pond Yamabushi, a Level 40 enemy. As such, you will want to leave this Kuji-Kiri for when you are at a higher level, closer to the end of the Assassin's Creed Shadows campaign.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250328172235_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gets-new-details-from-official-website/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is, without a doubt, one of the most anticipated games scheduled to launch in 2025. Its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, was the fastest-selling new IP debut for Sony's PlayStation 4 console when it launched, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> over 2.4 million units sold in the first three days on the market. It was so successful that Sony even fast-tracked a movie adaptation, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2021, only a few months after the game's debut. The film is being directed by Chad Stahelski of John Wick fame.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was an excellent game, as I said multiple times <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a> at the time. Interestingly, Sucker Punch has decided to make a spiritual sequel rather than a direct sequel. Ghost of Yōtei takes place in another place and another time, featuring a new main character. Now, Sucker Punch and Sony have shared a few more details by updating the game's page <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/ghost-of-yotei/?country-selector=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation website</a>.</p>
<p>The new protagonist, Atsu, lives in 1603, at the very beginning of the Edo period, in the lands surrounding the titular Mount Yōtei, the stratovolcano located on the snowy island of Hokkaido. At that time, this area was not officially part of Japan, making it somewhat of a wild frontier.</p>
<p>It is in this context that Atsu's life is upended when her homestead is burned to the ground. Following this tragic event, she undertakes a path of vengeance not unlike that of Jin Sakai, the protagonist of the previous game. According to the website, side content like bounties will provide Atus with the coin needed for the journey, but how she fights, survives, and evolves is entirely up to the player. The developers had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-feature-a-less-repetitive-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at users having more control over Atsu's story, so this could suggest some level of player choice. Could Sucker Punch allow users to choose how to complete some quests? It certainly sounds like it.</p>
<p>The website also promises new gameplay mechanics and improvements as well as new weapons, such as the ōdachi, kusarigama, and dual katanas. The environment will vary from sprawling grasslands with vegetation that reacts to the wind to snowy tundras, all the while gracing players with skies featuring massive sightlines. Of course, Ghost of Yōtei is being developed for PlayStation 5, though it will be best experienced on the PlayStation 5 Pro with enhanced visuals and performance.</p>
<p>The game has no release window yet. Like most publishers, Sony may be waiting to see if GTA VI really launches this year. Stay tuned to get informed when the launch date will be made official.</p>

            <p>"Alien Ant Farm or we boycott," reads the top comment on Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1905290954191298620">recent reveal</a> of the next wave of tracks for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> - a response to the revelation that the upcoming remasters have both been hit <em>and</em> struck by some soundtrack changes, which hasn't gone down completely smoothly with fans. You could almost say they feel making alterations to such classics is criminal. OK, I'll stop. For now.</p>
<p>It turns out these changes come straight from the large Hawk himself. “It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in THPS3+4 OST,” he wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/tony-hawk-explains-controversial-pro-skater-34-soundtrack-changes-it-was-my-choice/">Very Gary Computing</a>. “I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride. More to come… both old and new.”</p>

<p>I'm not sure I entirely buy this, for no substantial reason other than I've grown too weary to accept such chummy reasoning for anything a publisher the size of Activision does ever. Still, I reckon you've got a point there, Mr. Tony 'Tony Hawk' Hawk. The original games's role in introducing US skate punk and hip hop to a huge audience outside the states was undeniable, as was its influence on baggy jean and wallet chain sales. Giving exposure to some lesser known bands is no bad thing, even if I'm personally devastated by the<a href="https://youtu.be/yFA7c7uK5Ks"> loss (or lack of mention so far) of AFI</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/hDolkBP98Mg">Del Tha Funkee Homosapien</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose this might have gone down better if it wasn't for the already announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-career-mode-timer-1851768305">changes to THPS's career mode</a> (Kotaku), which is getting replaced by time challenges ala the prior games, though there'll reportedly still be a free skate option. </p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545710/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_3__4/">out on Steam</a> July 11th, 2025. I assume so much licensed music means they'll be a robust option for streamers. Otherwise they might get copyright-struck down. Possibly in the bedroom. It'll be their doom, presumably.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the weekend, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> team announced the second wave of music set for the upcoming remakes, but some noticed a few omissions from the original games. However, there is a good reason for this, with none other than Tony Hawk himself taking responsibility.</p>
<p>"It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Hawk wrote on Instagram</a>. "I’m hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place. So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>

<p>Hawk closed by assuring fans there is "more to come… both old and new", so keep your eyes and ears out for those.</p>
<p>As for that second wave of music, it includes tracks such as Hollywood Baby by 100 gecs and 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-soundtrack-details-rolled-out">Previously confirmed tracks coming to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> include Ace of Spades by Motörhead (of course!!), Damaged Goods by Gang of Four and Collard Greens by Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar, to name just a handful.</p>
<p>You can check out the full soundtrack (so far) over on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaaNnBQwFy3CDZKngGhvo-xQ3sKyjajcgV6i1mG3EL6vTaTiXQt-NhjNQT8_aem_QZupxh6pl3kr_nPv5OsN3Q">Spotify</a>.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July, 2025. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>On its release, there will be some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-is-switching-up-how-thps4-works">changes to how things work in the remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will feature in the upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake</a>, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster. This was all supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rumours of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake have been remaking themselves part of the discourse for several years now, sparked by the announcement of an animated series and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hopes-for-god-of-war-on-pc-stoked-by-leaked-nvidia-list">Nvidia leak back in 2021</a>, and stoked by manifestations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-tactics-ogre-reborn-leak-brings-screenshots-and-a-release-date">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-finally-announce-chrono-cross-remaster">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Squeenix</a> games from the leaked Geforce list. Now, Square Enix have added a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">dedicated 25th anniversary</a> page flogging figures, spectacles, and other charming tat to their website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s 25th cake day isn't until July 7th, but this new page <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1888418337790534097">lines up with claims</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a> leaker NateTheHate that we're getting closer to an announcement, if not a release. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-reportedly-real-and-happening-giving-hope-for-one-of-the-series-finest-to-finally-come-to-pc">has also claimed</a> that the Final Final Tactics remaster is still being worked on - a rumour that's been twinned with the FF9 one for about as long as it's been floating about.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For now, all we have are Quina plushies, Garnet figures, and a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">lovely looking graphic novel starring Vivi</a>. I've come to love Vivi over the years, as well as as FF9 as a whole. I must confess that, when the game released, I was <em>that guy</em>. You know, that guy who had just played as brooding big-sword Cloud and brooding big-sword Squall and wasn't thrilled to be handed a whimsical monkey boy named after a footballer with dodgy chibi proportions. "What is this magical, fanciful tomfoolery!" I cursed. "I want to shoot motorbikes at my rival's floating child soldier training facility!". Thankfully, I have seen the error of my ways. Final Fantasy 9 is lovely.</p>
<p>If you don't fancy waiting for a remake that might not exist -  like some sort of hopeful but deeply disorientated salmon smashing itself repeatedly against a rock jutting out from a crystalline stream consisting mostly of frothy leaker saliva - then the beautifying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-9-has-never-looked-better-than-it-does-with-the-moguri-mod">Moguri mod</a> may be for you. You get some extra frames (15 to 30), alongside high-resolution textures. Flap in anguish no more, noble salmon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> was arguably one of the biggest surprises out of The Game Awards 2024. There was no prior rumor that CAPCOM would revive a long-dead franchise whose latest installment launched nearly twenty years ago. Still, fans of the action/adventure franchise were definitely elated, especially after learning that they wouldn't have to wait too long, given the 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Japanese publication Famitsu recently <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/37453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the Producer Akihito Kadowaki and Game Director Satoru Nihei, who shared several details on the game's structure and length. The Producer said:</p>
<p><em>I want to make it a satisfying volume for a single action game. It's not a game where you defeat the same boss over and over like "Monster Hunter," so I think it will take about 20 hours to complete. It hasn't been decided yet, though. Basically, the story progresses as you clear stages. It's not an open world.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Kadowaki said that while the timeline won't change, the location may change, although it will still be mainly focused on Kyoto in the early Edo period (seventeenth century). Regarding difficulty, the two suggested Onimusha: Way of the Sword won't be a super challenging game:</p>
<p><em><strong>Satoru Nihei — </strong>We want a wide range of action game fans to enjoy the game, so we are proceeding with a policy of not making it extremely difficult. However, if the bosses are easily defeated, it will be boring, so we are continuing to make adjustments every day.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Akihito Kadowaki</strong> <strong>— </strong>Having a difficulty setting hasn't been decided yet. I'll say it again, but I want action fans to enjoy the game to the fullest, so I don't want to make it too difficult, and I want to pursue the appeal of being able to feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat it.</em></p>
<p>Lastly, the two stated that the setting has been completely reimagined, including the Oni and Genma clans. As such, there's essentially no direct connection to the previous installments, which also helps introduce newcomers to Onimusha: Way of the Sword.</p>

            <p>In its first month of release, Capcom's latest Monster Hunter game has passed an impressive milestone.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250331.html">shared by the company</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has surpassed 10m units since its release on 28th February, 2025.</p>

<p>Celebrating this success, Capcom said Monster Hunter Wilds "provides an environment where a wider range of players can enjoy the game together with the introduction of crossplay, a first for the series, and a simultaneous release on Playstation 5 system, Xbox Series X/S, and PC".</p>
<p>It added the "introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems" allowed players to experience a more "immersive gaming experience".</p>
<p>Capcom also credited "the fusion of numerous new elements with Monster Hunter’s appeal" for generating plenty of fan excitement, "all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10m units sold".</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the company highlighted Monster Hunter Wilds' first free content update, which is set to release later this week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">bring leviathan Mizutsune and more to the fray</a>.</p>
<p>A second title update will then be released later this summer, Capcom said, adding it plans to continue to release updates that "delight" its players.</p>

<p>On its release in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam</a>, before breaking through the one million concurrent players milestone on Valve's platform.

			<p>This morning, CAPCOM announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has now surpassed the milestone of 10 million units sold across all platforms. This is a new first-month sales record for the publisher, making it a historic occurrence.</p>
<p>The achievement is, however, not at all surprising after the incredible success enjoyed by Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise, which have reached 21.30 million units and 16.70 million units, respectively, and occupy the first and second positions in the Japanese publisher's all-time sales chart. Monster Hunter Wilds seems poised to surpass them both in relatively short order, especially considering that CAPCOM has a lot of plans to continue updating the game. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-adds-new-challenges-and-more-on-april-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first free update</a> will go live this Friday, adding the new monster Mizutsune, which can be hunted starting at Hunter Rank 21. At Hunter level 41 and above, Tempered Mizutsune will also appear in the environment overview.</p>
<p>Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests will also be introduced in Title Update 1. Challenge Quests and the newly introduced Free Challenge Quests will only appear as temporary event quests. Arena Quests and Challenge Quests can be completed by up to two players using pre-defined equipment. Meanwhile, Free Challenge Quests have no equipment restrictions and can involve hunting parties of up to four players. All of these quest types can be completed solo, cooperatively in cross-platform online multiplayer, or with the help of support hunters. Replay for faster completion times and earn a spot on the Expedition Record Board for special pendants as rewards. New Event Quests will continue to appear on the Quest Board, offering opportunities to earn special armor, quickly increase your Hunter rank, collect cooking ingredients, and more.</p>
<p>Lastly, the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds update also introduces the Grand Hub to the Monster Hunter Wilds - a massive gathering space for hunters to engage in new ways, such as competing against each other in the Hunter League. Players will unlock the Grand Hub after reaching Hunter Rank 16 by speaking to Tetsuzan in Suja. The entrance to the Grand Hub will also house the Expedition Record Board, which will display the fastest global clear times for the newly added Arena Quests, as well as limited Arena Quest bounties. Each season, the Grand Hub will host a unique celebration. These begin with the Festival of Accord: Blossomdance, which runs from 23 April to 7 May. During the festivals, the Grand Hub will change its appearance and the food available, and hunters will be able to obtain limited-time equipment, gestures, pop-up camp decorations, and more.</p>

<p>Since 2020, fans of the Call of Duty esports scene have questioned the downsizing of the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem. When the Call of Duty League was created, it was cut to accommodate just twelve franchised teams, which has long been a sticking point with viewers and competitors alike.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, LA Thieves’ Dylan ‘Envoy’ Hannon spit some home truths about the state of play in response to his chat talking about ‘expanding’ the CDL. He’s of the mindset that an expansion would just yield more ‘dogsh**’ teams and that there isn’t enough talent to flesh out a broadened COD League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-even-more-uncompetitive">‘Even More Uncompetitive’</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty League has long had a problem with competitive integrity or ‘balance’. The best example of this right now is the split between Atlanta FaZe and the Vegas Falcons. The former team has claimed two of two Major tournaments this year, while the latter org is yet to <strong>win a single series this season</strong>.</p>



<p>There are teams in the CDL that just cannot compete against the top-tier squads, and Envoy argues that adding more teams to match the days of the Call of Duty World League wouldn’t solve the problem. If anything, it’d make the situation worse.</p>



<p>That’s because there just aren’t enough good players coming up to fill rosters.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Expansion is not needed. That s*** is dead. You think some of the matches are boring to watch now?</p>



<p>The talent is just not good anymore, bro. It’s straight up. Like, some of the talent nowadays is better and the teams are structured better, but there is way less talent.</p>



<p>For CWL, last time there were sixteen teams, the bottom six teams were still dogsh**. These matches will be even more uncompetitive. It’s unfortunate for like, the Falcon boys and stuff. They’re obviously making switches after they tried out their roster, but like…</p>



<p>If you added four more teams, it would all be like that, unless you just added like — you made like a <strong>draft</strong>. It doesn’t change that all the top teams have the best budget, most resources.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/SpawnUpgg/status/1906386964175061340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpawnUp for the clip</a>)</em></p>



<p>He argued that the lowest teams in the Call of Duty League are on par with Challengers teams, which is the circuit that operates <strong>beneath </strong>the CDL.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft’s VP of Esports went on record stating that, without <strong>new talent</strong>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-vp-of-esports-no-new-talent-games-die/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">esports games <strong>will die</strong></a>. If there isn’t enough fresh talent passing through the rotation to keep rosters stacked and the scene competitive, titles will simply die.</p>



<p>Do you think the COD League has a balancing issue? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has revealed why the publisher is keeping Rockstar's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s release date such a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is "the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property", but said that whilst some publishers reveal their publishing plans "years in advance", Zelnick would prefer to "maintain the anticipation and excitement".</p>

<p>"The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times," Zelnick explained right at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>"I've been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials <em>relatively</em> close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," he added.</p>
<p>"I don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we're trying to do."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September, given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Riven developer Cyan Worlds has cut its staff count by half.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the Washington studio - perhaps best known for the Myst series - said "despite its best efforts", "industry conditions" had forced it into a "tricky spot [where] the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025" left it with no choice but to lay off half its team.</p>

<p>"Today we would like to share with you some very unfortunate news," the statement began. "Despite our best efforts to avoid it, Cyan has made the difficult decision to reduce our overall staff size - resulting in the layoff of 12 talented staff members, roughly half the team - effective at the end of March.</p> <div>

<p>"Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025. Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us."</p>
<p>The studio said it has "done [its] best to pad the landing for those affected" with severance packages and is now committed to securing funding for its next project to "restabilise" the studio.</p>
<p>"We've been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before," the statement concluded. "Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver."</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Tomb Raider developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics similarly made the "difficult decision" to layoff 17 "talented" staff</a>. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/">1200 game developers have lost their jobs</a>, on top of around 14,600 in 2024, and 10,500 in 2023.</p></div>

<p>According to an image shared on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">newly released Nintendo Today app</a> yesterday, the live-action film will make its debut on 26th March, 2027.</p>
<p>"A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise[,] The Legend of Zelda follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness," writes the blurb on <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Production List</a>, which posits filming will begin this November in New Zealand and wrap in April 2026.</p>
<p>"The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce - an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest."</p>
<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie back in November 2023</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution). Wes Ball is lined up to direct.</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad - whose previous game-to-film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">last year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a> - is also on board.</p>
<p>Along with its Zelda adaptation, Nintendo also has a sequel to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">hugely successful Super Mario Bros. film</a> in the works. The full release date for the animated film sequel will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">3rd April 2026</a> in the US, 24th April 2026 in Japan, and a less specific "April 2026" window for "other countries and regions".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
