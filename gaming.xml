            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>What does “Xbox” mean? Some might say it can only refer to a box-shaped Microsoft game machine. Others will argue it’s a collection of Xbox-native titles like <em>Halo, Gears</em>, <em>Forza</em>, and <em>Fable</em>. I think most would probably agree it’s a game console experience, a way to kick back and easily play the latest games without thinking too much. Press the power button, play, press it again to pause.</p><p>The 7-inch Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X gaming handhelds, on sale tomorrow, don’t meet that bar. The cheaper one doesn’t even come close.</p><p>They run Windows 11, and they never let you forget it — not during their lengthy setup process, not when you’re trying to navigate their menus, and not when you want the latest games to “just work.” They also don’t play Xbox games designed for an Xbox console, only Xbox games ported to PCs; when <em>GTA VI</em> comes out next May <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">without a PC version</a>, you won’t be playing it here. Not unless you’re streaming from the cloud.</p><p>To be fair, <em>no </em>Windows handhelds meet that bar, and the $999 Xbox Ally X is better than many! But these first “Xbox” handhelds were supposed to be Microsoft’s answer to the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch. They were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">supposed to combine</a> “the best of Xbox and Windows together” by reimagining Microsoft’s operating system. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">We were told</a> the new Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) “isn’t just surface-level changes.”</p><p>So why does it look so much like lipstick on Windows, with a sluggish UI that feels designed for a mouse? Why are Microsoft and Asus shipping these handhelds today when they’re buggy and clearly not ready for launch?</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk5Njk5"><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great grips</li><li>Good speakers</li><li>Windows is somewhat easier to control with joysticks</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Cannot trust it to sleep, wake, or charge unattended</li><li>Worse performance that cheaper Steam Deck</li><li>Unintuitive, half-baked new Windows UI</li><li>Lots of launch bugs</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk5NzAy"><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great grips</li><li>Enough power to play most any PC game at low spec</li><li>Good speakers</li><li>Windows is somewhat easier to control with joysticks</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Unintuitive, half-baked new Windows UI</li><li>Lots of launch bugs</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The white $599 Xbox Ally and black $999 Xbox Ally X officially arrive tomorrow, October 16th.</p><p>Both are the same size, shape, thickness, and weigh roughly the same 1.5 pounds. On paper, the only differences between the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally are the processor (Z2 Extreme vs. Z2 A), storage (1TB vs. 512GB), memory (24GB LPDDR5X-8000 vs. 16GB LPDDR5-6400), battery (80Wh vs. 60Wh), and whether you get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2013/5/21/4353378/hands-on-xbox-one-controller">impulse triggers</a> and a USB 4 port or not.</p><p>They both supposedly ship with the new Xbox Full Screen Experience, which should let you boot into a desktop-less Windows 11 that suppresses startup apps, saves memory, lets you navigate by gamepad controls instead of requiring you to touch the screen, and puts your Xbox, Steam, and titles from other stores all in one handy interface, with the desktop still a click away if you want.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hopefully you will only experience this once if at all — an hour-plus process that locks your handheld to an update screen before you can use it at all.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In reality, it seems that Microsoft and Asus didn’t actually ship its units to stores with that version of Windows installed — or necessary BIOS updates, graphics drivers, and more. Reviewers like me spent hours and multiple reboots waiting for those updates to install before we could play a single game; even after I was done, I still couldn’t navigate Windows without some smudging of the touchscreen and fighting with the gamepad controls.</p><p>I want to say something nice about the Xbox Ally and Ally X before I continue to amuse and warn you about their failings, so let’s start with these: Despite each weighing around 1.5 pounds, both Allys are pleasingly comfortable to hold. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776797/xbox-ally-x-prongs-comfort-editorial">Prongs rock!</a>) The front-facing speakers might be the best I’ve heard on a handheld — loud, clear, and with lots of stereo separation — and I love that Asus continues to ship every Ally with a piece of cardboard padding that doubles as an excellent stand but you can totally recycle. The fans spin up more than I’d like, but the grips are well isolated.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Comfortable prong-shaped grips.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And while I’m a little tired of Asus putting a 7-inch screen into what feels like an 8-inch handheld, with dramatically oversized bezels compared to rivals, I can’t entirely fault it for picking the same 7-inch, 1080p 500-nit, 120Hz variable refresh rate display it’s used for the past three years to make Ally games feel smooth. It just doesn’t feel like a flagship screen anymore, not after the Steam Deck OLED, MSI Claw 8, and especially the incredible screen in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">(pricier) Legion Go 2</a>.</p><p>But the Xbox Ally X, with its AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, extra memory, and big 80 watt-hour battery, is quite serviceable in the games I want to play. I can get two hours of smooth whipcracking and Nazi-punching in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, one of the most intensive games on PC, if I’m willing to play at low settings with AMD’s FSR “balanced” upscaling, which uprezzes an 1129x635 image to 1080p.</p><p>Parrying foes in <em>Expedition 33 </em>was no trouble at an XeSS-upscaled 900p resolution, where I get about two hours at 50-70 fps. I can also get nearly eight hours of the least intensive games like <em>Balatro</em>, around six in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong, </em>and around four in medium-weight games like <em>Blue Prince</em> by lowering the chip’s TDP.</p><div><h2>Battery life vs. performance</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X fps</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X battery

The handheld charges fast, too, at up to 100W of USB-C PD power if you have such a charger available.</p><p>And — most importantly, the thing I’ve been wanting from every Windows handheld for years — when I press the power button on the Xbox Ally X to put it to sleep, it doesn’t wake itself up! Not in a bag. Not on a table. Not when I wiggle the joystick, shake it, or press all its buttons.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Very meaty triggers with a smooth, long throw; better for gunplay than Silksong dodges.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Last week, I paused a game of <em>Indiana Jones</em> by pressing the power button. Nine hours later, my game was exactly where I left it. I put it to sleep again, and 38 hours later, I picked up playing exactly where I left off.</p><p>Unfortunately, I can’t <em>always</em> trust it to wake. Twice now, it’s stayed in a coma until I hard-reset the system, losing a little game progress.</p><p>And I can’t trust the white $599 Xbox Ally to stay asleep at all. I’ve complained about Windows’ sleep modes for years, but this is the worst I’ve tested. My colleague <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> and I have watched it repeatedly wake up right after telling it to sleep. I saw it randomly turn on three hours after going to sleep, just sitting on a table. Twice, I woke up to find the white Ally had drained the vast majority of its nearly full battery overnight.</p><p>Twice, I walked over to a plugged-in white Xbox Ally that had been on the charger for hours, only to discover it hadn’t charged at all. And that’s just one of the extra bugs I ran into with the cheaper version of this handheld.</p><p>But fixing the bugs won’t be enough to save the $599 Xbox Ally. Microsoft, Asus, and AMD would also need to fix its performance — because even the two-year old, $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> is beating Microsoft’s brand-new handheld by an average of 13 percent in my tests.</p><div><h2>720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X</h3></th><th><h3>Lenovo Legion Go 2 (Z2E)</h3></th><th><h3>MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z1E, SteamOS)</h3></th><th><h3>ROG Ally X (Z1E, Windows)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>39</td><td>50</td><td>51</td><td>41</td><td>51</td><td>57</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>41</td><td></td><td>69</td><td>55</td><td>60</td><td>73</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>73</td><td>62</td><td>71</td><td>79</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td><td>67</td><td>76</td><td>82</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>75</td><td>70</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>43</td><td>50</td><td>77</td><td>67</td><td>77</td><td>86</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td>61</td><td>75</td><td>75</td><td>79</td><td>74</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>58</td><td></td><td>92</td><td>88</td><td>93</td><td>92</td><td>84</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td><td>99</td><td>105</td><td>99</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td><td>106</td><td>114</td><td>100</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>93</td><td>106</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>58</td><td>61</td><td>106</td><td>108</td><td>119</td><td>102</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>24</td><td>25</td><td>42</td><td>37</td><td>40</td><td>24</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td></td><td>47</td><td>43</td><td>48</td><td>30</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td><td>45</td><td>52</td><td>32</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>51</td><td>46</td><td>54</td><td>33</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>50</td><td>47</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>26</td><td>25</td><td>51</td><td>47</td><td>56</td><td>34</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>51</td><td>57</td><td>70</td><td>61</td><td>55</td><td>62</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>55</td><td></td><td>80</td><td>72</td><td>66</td><td>83</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>83</td><td>80</td><td>73</td><td>89</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>83</td><td>87</td><td>81</td><td>93</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>85</td><td>90</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>54</td><td>57</td><td>93</td><td>93</td><td>81</td><td>96</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>HZD Remastered, 15-watt TDP</td><td>26</td><td>33</td><td>31</td><td>28</td><td>31</td><td>37</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>20-watt TDP</td><td>27</td><td></td><td>33</td><td>32</td><td>37</td><td>47</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>25-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>33</td><td>32</td><td>42</td><td>50</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>30-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>33</td><td>32</td><td>44</td><td>52</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>35-watt TDP</td><td></td><td></td><td>33</td><td>33</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>27</td><td>33</td><td>35</td><td>36</td><td>46</td><td>55</td><td>34</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>All games tested at 720p low save Cyberpunk at 720p Steam Deck mode; not all handhelds offer all power modes.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>This is a “you had one job” moment, because the AMD Ryzen Z2 A in the $599 Xbox Ally is <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-z2-a-apu-for-hanhelds-confirmed-as-aeirth-plus-powered-by-zen2-rdna2">basically the same chip you’ll find in the Steam Deck,</a> only with a 20W turbo mode when you plug it into the wall. (Valve’s tops out at 15W.) But as you can see above, it usually didn’t beat the Deck even when I plugged it in.</p><p>I can’t say whether that’s because the drivers are immature or because Windows is holding it back — but seeing how half-baked Microsoft’s changes to Windows have been and how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">Lenovo’s SteamOS handheld beat its Windows one</a>, I wouldn’t be surprised if it were the latter.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hold down the Xbox button for task switching (or swipe up from bottom of screen). </em></figcaption></p></div><p>To be clear, Microsoft <em>has</em> made some real improvements! It’s very nice to be able to enter my PIN and finally use a modern Windows on-screen keyboard with gamepad controls, and the new Xbox button, the first on a handheld, is genuinely useful. Hold it down, and you can quickly switch between all your open windows, and close them, with your gamepad controls alone. I love using it as a fly swatter to smack down pop-ups and game launcher windows I’m no longer using, with just a flick of the stick and a smack of the X button.</p><p>And when the Xbox app works, you can see the silhouette of what could someday be a compelling Xbox-like experience. My colleague Tom Warren has been testing how the Xbox Ally devices sync with an Xbox library and console, so here’s a few thoughts from him:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass or you’ve purchased a lot of Xbox Play Anywhere games, the Xbox Ally devices are really seamless at syncing cloud saves and making it easy to pick up where you left off from a console, and vice versa. Most of the Xbox games I’ve been playing on the Ally X are Xbox Play Anywhere, meaning all my saves, game add-ons, and achievements just sync between Xbox and PC. I made progress in <em>Silksong </em>on the Xbox Ally X, and then easily picked up and continued on my Xbox Series X console.</p><p>Microsoft also has a new “Play history” section on the Xbox app on PC that’s essentially a list of recently played Xbox games across PC, Xbox consoles, and Xbox Cloud Gaming. This is all great if you live in the Xbox world, but the Steam library integration into this Xbox on PC experience is very basic — it’s just a launcher and Steam games won’t show up until you install them from Steam first. You’ll need to be playing Xbox Play Anywhere titles for all of the slick sync features, and if you’re switching between Game Pass titles and Steam ones it feels a lot less slick.</p><p>I like how Microsoft has attempted to recreate the Xbox console UI within the Game Bar on the Ally X, though. It’s the one part that feels like it’s designed for a controller, and it lets you avoid the Windows desktop to control Wi-Fi, shut the system down, and more.</p></blockquote></div><p>But the rest of the interface never quite feels like a game console. The main Xbox interface just isn’t snappy or remotely feature complete, and much of it isn’t made to be navigated up, left, down, right on a gamepad like every Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo in modern memory. “When you switch to Steam Big Picture Mode it immediately feels like a better experience,” says Tom, and I agree — except that Microsoft owns the Xbox button here, so most of Steam Big Picture Mode’s hardware shortcuts don’t work.</p><p>There’s also no tutorial on how to use the Xbox Ally, even though some of its hardware buttons are downright confusing.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Xbox Ally X’s B button isn’t my favorite, a little too easy to press wrong — but I do enjoy how the “ROG XBOX” print reads “XOXO RGB” if you read it horizontally.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I can’t count the number of times I’ve tapped the tiny button with three vertical lines right next to the tiny button with three horizontal lines, which can be a problem, because one of them pauses your game and and opens in-game menus, while the other kicks you out to your game library to launch a new game without pausing your game at all. If you press the library button a second time, it doesn’t take you back to your game, so you probably have to long-press the Xbox button to get back to your game, but not the Library button or the Control Center button because those will summon AI assistants instead, and if you understood everything I just wrote and found it reasonable then boy do I have the operating system for you.</p><p>And gosh is it infuriating when I tap the other dedicated button that pulls up Asus’ new Control Center widget in the Xbox Game Bar to adjust brightness or wattage or toggle other controls, only to discover the button or widget completely unresponsive because the Game Bar or some other Windows component has decided it’s time for a silent update. (That happened to me with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">MSI Claw 8</a>’s Game Bar widget as well.)</p><p>Microsoft also doesn’t have an obvious way for gamers to install and add <em>non</em>-game apps like Discord to the Xbox interface, so any time I game and chat with friends, I have to do it in desktop mode. But frankly, I might <em>stay</em> in desktop mode, because I haven’t seen many concrete advantages to the Xbox Full Screen Experience so far.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t implemented best practices like letting me scroll a long list of items to the “OK” button at the bottom using an analog stick — instead, I’ve gotta go line-by-line. Microsoft doesn’t always surface pop-ups and error messages front and center in the full-screen interface automatically, so I’ll often dumbly sit waiting for a game to launch that won’t until I go find them. I’ve had many moments where full-screen apps mysteriously don’t have focus, so gamepad controls don’t work until I touch the screen or Alt-Tab.</p><p>That’s not to mention some of the actual crashes and freezes I saw, far more than with other recent handhelds I’ve reviewed.</p><p>And in terms of performance and battery life, I saw no significant difference between desktop and full screen modes — no more than 1fps, and no more than half a watt, well within my margin of error. If you were hoping to see a performance difference between desktop and full-screen Windows like the difference between Windows and SteamOS, I’m afraid it’s just not there.</p><div><p id="whats-next"><h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m willing to accept that the Xbox Ally handhelds, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">like the original Steam Deck in 2022</a>, are a work in progress — that buyers are paying to beta test a potentially better future for handheld Windows gaming.</p><p>Microsoft’s reviewer’s guide hints as much: “Both handhelds were designed with ongoing innovation in mind, and your feedback will help us shape where we go next,” the company writes, alongside a list of upcoming features that aren’t available at launch. For instance, Microsoft is promising premade game profiles that automatically balance performance and battery life by the end of the year, and a game save sync indicator next year alongside “automatic super resolution” and AI-recorded highlight reels for the Xbox Ally X specifically.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review#:~:text=The%20Verge%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20review%20gadgets%20on%20potential.%20We%20review%20what%20we%20can%20see%20and%20touch.">But like I said in that Steam Deck review</a>, <em>The Verge</em> doesn’t review gadgets on potential. We review what we can see and touch, and the devices we’ve touched aren’t ready, shipping with software that’s being finalized at the very last minute, which doesn’t remotely live up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">the lofty expectations that Microsoft set</a>.</p></div><p>And unlike the original $399-and-up Steam Deck, this beta will cost you a serious chunk of change. At $599 and $999 respectively, the white Xbox Ally and black Xbox Ally X are the priciest “Xboxes” ever made. Yes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">everything is more expensive these days</a>, and it’s hard to even find the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">MSI Claw 8</a> that I’d otherwise recommend over the Xbox Ally X. But I’d personally wait until the dust has settled here — unless you’re willing to pay $1,000 to beta test what could be Microsoft’s vision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">for the future of consoles</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience]]></content:encoded>

              <p>We’re getting more <em>Halo</em> games, but which ones?&nbsp; Can <em>Battlefield</em> really threaten <em>Call of Duty</em> for the military shooter crown? And is the future of OpenAI really a porn bot service? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming culture and news. I’m getting this one out extra early to make up for yesterday. <em>Tron: Ares</em> bombed at the box office with a $33 million debut that Hollywood insiders <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jared-leto-tron-ares-box-office-1236401068/">believe will doom Jared Leto and the franchise</a>. That’s a shame because I saw it last night and it didn’t suck nearly as much as I expected. I would even say the first half of it was pretty great!</p> <h2>OpenAI is getting ready to unleash “erotica for verified adults”</h2> <p>A big sexting update is coming to ChatGPT in December, Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128">teased on X</a> this week. “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,” he wrote. “We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.”</p> <p>Having unfurled the aircraft carrier “Mission Accomplished!” sign despite <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147">ongoing wrongful death lawsuits</a>, Altman says it’s time to embrace easily outmaneuvered age-verification tools and treat people like grownups. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,” he concluded. It sounds like the trillion-dollar bubble is going back to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-gpt-5-world-warcraft-destiny-2000616944">chattier and more sycophantic version</a> of ChatGPT that paying users got hooked on earlier in the year.</p> <h2>Master Chief’s voice is teasing a big <em>Halo</em> announcement</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Repped for our girl, <a href="https://twitter.com/jentaylortown?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jentaylortown</a>, in Chicago this past weekend!

              <p>Halloween is just around the corner, and if you’re looking to host a spooky party or just shopping ahead for the upcoming holiday season, having a solid party speaker is a must to entertain yourself and your guests. Good speakers bring in good vibes, and hardly any brand does sound better than JBL.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/">The good news is, we’ve just spotted the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 going for $450 on Amazon, after a $150 drop from its $600 price.</a> This deal is available on the black color option. The white version is discounted too, but it’s going for $600 after a $30 discount on its retail price of $630. Regardless of the color, both discounts are only around for a short time, so grab yourself a speaker before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Party on Wheels, Literally</h2>
<p>JBL took “bring the party home” quite seriously with this one. This portable speaker looks like a rolling suitcase with a telescopic handle and durable wheels to take it around wherever the party goes. You’re getting two 6.5-inch woofers and a pair of 25mm dome tweeters that deliver deep, rich bass even when you have the volume turned all the way up. Music won’t distort at higher levels, meaning you can go all out with your favorite tracks, among your favorite people.</p>
<p>The speaker also gets you a futuristic light show with your beats defining the rhythm of the lights. And since it’s also IPX4 splashproof, you won’t have to worry if things get a bit messy. Place it by the pool or take it to the beach; it can handle a few splashes and spills without throwing a fit.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 18 hours of continuous listening on a full charge, which is more than enough for an entire night of fun. Recharging the speaker won’t take forever either, and it will be up and running again in no time. There are also some handy connectivity options, such as the dual microphone inputs and guitar input for live performances. On top of that, the PartyBox Stage 320 supports Auracast, so you can link it with other JBL speakers for even bigger sound.</p>
<p>Overall, if you’re looking for a music solution that can bring life to any party and is easy to carry around, the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 speaker is one of the best options out there.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/"> It now costs $150 less than its usual price, so grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is one month away, and the game’s Steam presence is building up energy as the date comes ever closer. It was revealed earlier today by Battlestate Games that Escape from Tarkov now has over 500,000 wishlist spots on Steam, which brings the game one step closer to hitting a successful launch window on the platform.</p>



<p>It marks the first time in history that the core Escape from Tarkov experience will be available on a platform <strong>outside </strong>Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher and storefront. The post from BSG also confirmed that you can now link your Battlestate Games account to your Steam profile.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-soon">Tarkov is Coming to Steam Soon</h2>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Escape from Tarkov has managed to hit 500,000+ wishlists just a couple of weeks after going live on Steam. For a decade, it has been a spearhead extraction shooter that has risen to popularity and sat at the top of the table since 2020.</p>



<p>That’s when the game experienced a boom, attracting hundreds of thousands of players and becoming a staple shooter ever since.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games confirmed that users will need to <strong>own a copy of the game on Steam </strong>to be able to play Tarkov on Steam. That means that if you’ve already purchased a copy of Escape from Tarkov from Battlestate Games, you <strong>won’t </strong>automatically qualify for a copy on Steam when it launches.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Get ready — the release is coming! Mark your calendars for November 15!</p><p>Over 500,000 players have already added Escape from Tarkov to their wishlist: <a href="https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM">https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM</a><br>Thank you for your trust and support!</p><p>You can now link your existing Battlestate Games account to your… <a href="https://t.co/IgzTMnPRLJ">pic.twitter.com/IgzTMnPRLJ</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1978418639540777244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Many are sceptical about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">impending 1.0 release</a> of Escape from Tarkov, as some feel that the game ‘isn’t 1.0 ready’. The version of the game being played now <strong>is not </strong>the version we’ll have when that time comes next month.</p>



<p>Further, there’s quite a bit of negativity surrounding the Steam launch, with naysayers claiming that Battlestate will suffer under the weight of refunds when people buy the game through Steam and lean on the platform’s lenient refund policy to kick it back to Battlestate. </p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released in full on November 15. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re picking it up on Steam.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is the culmination of years of work from several studios flying the Electronic Arts banner. It was seen as a potential resurgence for the series after the lacklustre delivery of 2021’s Battlefield 2042 (and the divisive launch of Battlefield 5 in 2018).</p>



<p>In the run-up to the release of Battlefield 6, players had their expectations stoked by an immensely successful beta period, bolstered by the introduction of Battlefield Labs. The full game is finally in the open, and millions of players are diving head over heels into what is a mixed offering: a magnificent multiplayer platform marred by a pretty catastrophic campaign portion.</p>



<p>Read on to check out my full Battlefield 6 review.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-s-dire-campaign-is-carried-by-the-multiplayer-modes">Battlefield 6’s Dire Campaign is Carried by the Multiplayer Modes</h2>



<p>I said many a time before the launch of Battlefield 6 that I was hugely excited to get my hands on the new campaign, given that Battlefield 2042 <strong>didn’t have one</strong>. I love a Battlefield campaign, as in the last decade, they’ve been focused on authentic replications of emotional battles, telling a story beyond the run-and-gun traditions of games like Call of Duty.</p>



<p>Sadly, that’s not what we received in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>The Battlefield 6 campaign is hindered by poor storytelling, a predictable theme, shallow objectives, and a lack of any entertaining depth. It’s a simple thing that can be completed in a few hours, and even hunting for collectables adds almost nothing to the game’s meatiness – or <em>lack of</em>.</p>



<p>It plunges players into the action and doesn’t ever slow down, but the only redeeming feature of the campaign is that there’s plenty to shoot at. It’s a mundane, thoughtless thing that almost always has you pushing through an extremely linear area, gunning down endless sorties of enemies, while heading to a simple objective.</p>



<figure><figcaption>They’re no Bad Company, that’s for sure</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best part of the campaign is a single mission that gives players a semi-open environment to traverse, allowing them a little choice and spreading them further than the linear missions do.</p>



<p>And my <strong>word</strong>, those linear missions <strong>are linear. </strong>If you deviate from your path by a few inches, you’ll be given a timer prompt and ordered back into the fight.</p>



<p>I ultimately found the visuals to be a bit dated, the AI to not have much of a clue, and the gameplay loop seemed like an afterthought. Pick up weapons, gun down enemies, and move to objectives. That’s it.</p>



<p>Look at last year’s Call of Duty offering, Black Ops 6. In that, players had a variety of missions that presented them with sabotage, subterfuge, exploration, and multiple perspectives. The most diversity you get in Battlefield 6 is when you’re thrust into the command of a tank for all of about five minutes.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-battlefield-6-multiplayer-redeems-the-entire-project">The Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Redeems The Entire Project</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is back in the multiplayer aspect, that’s for sure. I strayed from Battlefield with the launch of 2042, opting instead to stick with older titles like Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5. What has been presented in Battlefield 6 is something phenomenal, and I’m having <strong>a blast</strong>.</p>



<p>From the ground up, Battlefield 6’s multiplayer is a return to form for the series. It’s a cry back to bygone days of the ‘peak’ era represented by Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and everything from the maps on offer to the spread of classic and new modes has me thoroughly entertained.</p>



<p>There are a few gripes, sure. The TTK feels out of balance, there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-glitches-exploits-ea-working-overtime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than a few glitches</a>, and levelling up weapons is <strong>a grind</strong>, which is why so many XP farms have popped up across Battlefield Portal. But even with all that being said, I’m still having a great time in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Most of my gameplay loop has seen me occupy my time in Breakthrough. I’m a veteran Rush player, and Breakthrough gives me the same vibes while also offering better area control, rather than sitting next to a single MCOM station. I can’t complain about the game’s mechanics, and I haven’t had too many issues with the maps (except for Sobek…).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I’m loving the open class system, which allows me to level up my weapons across whatever role I want to play. That’s how I play; I adjust to the scenario presented to me and adapt on the fly. If I’m playing as a support gunner and want to switch to an engineer role to tackle vehicles that have shown up, I should be able to keep grinding the same primary weapon – <strong>and I can</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though I no longer have the reflexes or gunny to dominate at Battlefield, I’m having fun in Battlefield 6. It’s a satisfying multiplayer platform that accommodates all kinds of play styles, and it’s highly customizable and considerate. I’ve also played and installed Battlefield 6 on the new ROG Xbox Ally X, and it runs like a dream on there, too.</p>



<p>The only thing I’ve not ventured into is Portal, because I’m led to believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/">it’s jam-packed with XP farms</a>, and that’s not my kind of thing.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion-don-t-buy-battlefield-6-for-the-campaign">Conclusion: Don’t Buy Battlefield 6 For The Campaign</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 isn’t at all worth it for just the single-player offering, but the multiplayer is enough of a redemption that you should consider picking it up. There’s plenty of juice in the tank where the multiplayer platform is concerned, and Electronic Arts’ studios will keep it plugged full of content for a while. The first season starts before the month is out.</p>



<p>Also, the free-to-play battle royale component is incoming, so if you don’t appreciate either the multiplayer <strong>or </strong>the campaign, you can give that a go and enjoy Battlefield 6 from some perspective without worrying about spending a penny.</p>



<p>I’m more inclined to give Battlefield 6 a higher score when looking at the project holistically, as I feel that multiplayer should have much more weighting than the campaign in a series like this. As Battlefield 6 has a stellar multiplayer platform, I’ll be generous.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict-4-5-great">Verdict: 4/5 – ‘Great’</h2>

With no PvP component, Borderlands 4 is mostly about solo players — and occasional groups of co-op players — farming bosses for loot that makes their build ever so slightly better each time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate"><u>IGN recently interviewed a Borderlands 4 player who spent 150 hours on over 3,000 boss kills to find out the game’s true drop rate</u></a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Builds based on the crit knife, for example, can essentially delete bosses even on Borderlands 4’s toughest difficulty, making farming for loot a trivial endeavor.

Others argue it’s bad for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this debate isn’t isolated to Borderlands 4. I’ve seen it crop up over the years in countless loot games, from Diablo to Destiny. But it always presents a tricky balancing act from developers who want to keep their players happy while also sticking to their guns in their response.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“What is the problem with these interactions in a mostly single-player experience?

The gun builds that use the crit knife have other options and will have more options coming soon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Timmins then chimed in on the crit knife, <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1977748287001182653" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a>: “Our intent is always to expand the number of builds, so any adjustment we make is in service of that goal.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o2t1yl/honestly_i_love_this_dev_team/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most in the community appear to agree with Gearbox’s stance on this</a>, calling the nerfs necessary if Borderlands 4 wants to survive as a live service game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They can't release Invincibles in a context where absurdly overpowered stuff that one-shot bosses exist,” said redditor LascarCapable. “Otherwise people will just gravitate towards the few builds that can do it, the same pieces of gear, and everything else will be irrelevant. Also, it would make the game a borefest; it's funny five minutes to one-shot bosses, but beyond that point it just removes all the fun of the main gameplay loop.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With a game like Borderlands 4, which has billions of guns and enormous scope for varied builds, fans will always find ways to generate enough damage that makes a mockery of boss fights. The question for Gearbox will be how it manages those builds, while taking care not to come across as the fun police.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is something Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead has struggled with as it works to maintain the challenge in its explosive co-op shooter while also preserving the fun. It’s fair to say the studio hasn’t always got it right, leading to discontent within its community and, on occasion, apologies from its developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are now on Gearbox to see what changes it has in store for not just Borderlands 4’s crit knife build, but any build it believes relies on an “unintended interaction.” A major patch is expected soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, Gearbox revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-reveals-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-the-first-seasonal-mini-event-an-invincible-boss-and-more">Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, the first seasonal mini-event for the game, the aforementioned Invincible boss</a>, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> launched to impressive player numbers just last week, but EA’s latest entry in the long-running FPS series is facing one issue that has players missing more shots than they should be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As players across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S poured into Battlefield 6 in the days following its October 10 launch, they were met with a launch build that holds up much better than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/04/dices-plan-to-fix-battlefield-4s-online-issues"><u>some of the more infamous launches of the franchise’s past</u></a>. It’s not been without its problems, though, with one particularly annoying bug seemingly affecting hit registration for some guns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only a few clips analyzing the issue have managed to bubble to the top of online discussion, but each has drawn more examples from other individuals faced with the same issue. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4eams/alright_which_one_of_you_loaded_up_my_rifle_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>KaiKamakasi</u></a> was one of the first to bring their concerns to the table, showing a clip from Battlefield 6’s New Sobek City map that sees them firing more than 20 bullets directly into an enemy and getting nothing to show for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They joke that someone must have loaded their rifle with blanks, but the video seems to be especially damning evidence that something else is afoot in Battlefield 6. Each shot seems lined up perfectly with the enemy, so much so that blood can even be seen spurting out from the soldier as each bullet hits. The other player then kills KaiKamakasi and seems completely untouched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I had this today as well,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4eams/comment/nj35896/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one comment</u></a> added. “You can even hear it when the bullets hit a body so you know are hitting them. I was playing with a mate and asking him if classes have different armour that I'd never seen because some people just appeared to be bullet sponges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I knew I was clearly hitting them and they just wouldn't go down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4vrkl/often_it_feels_like_hit_registration_just_doesnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cjoux</u></a> took an even closer look in their own video by counting each bullet for a zoomed-in, slow-motion video of a close-range gunfight. This time, hit markers definitely show hit registration behaving as expected, but despite being trained directly on the target, only some of the nine shots actually land. Other Battlefield 6 players, again, chimed in with their own stories of similar hiccups, and we here at IGN have also experienced phantom bullets that seem to phase right through enemies, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I’m not crazy?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o4vrkl/comment/nj5xi6x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one reply</u></a> added. “I’ve BEAMED people with a controller. I could literally see that I was on point with my reticle and still lose the engagement somehow. Always one or two bullets just MISS somehow when my gun felt like it shot more than enough to kill someone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s either hit registration or I’m not used to the spread and weapon balance in this game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, EA is on the case. Florian Le Bihan, Principal Game Designer on Battlefield 6, <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1977698663427133659" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say BF Studios is investigating the issue. "It is commonly observed with the target being visibly hit (blood splatters) but no damage is confirmed in the HUD (no hit indicator etc...)," he explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6 multiplayer review,</a> then visit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6">IGN's Battlefield 6 guide</a> for a complete <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/All_Dog_Tag_Collectibles">list and video of all campaign collectible locations</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-6/Multiplayer_Tips_and_Tricks">tips for getting an edge in multiplayer</a>, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

Originally we had planned to launch winter 2025, but despite great development progress this year, we’ve made the difficult decision to shift the release into next year.</p><p><em>Witchbrook</em> is a big project—and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Map of Mossport</strong></p><p>So far we’ve been quiet about the size of the game world, but today we’d like to reveal the first look at our map of Mossport! While the map highlights the sheer scale of the physical world you’ll be exploring, we’re also hard at work filling the world with spellbinding stories, captivating quests, and enchanting systems to enrich your time at Witchbrook College.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Witchbrook-World-Map_10-15-25.jpg"></a></figure><p>(View the full interactive version of the map <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.)</p><p>It’s really important to note here that the colored areas you see here on the map are playable areas!</p><p>Whether it’s hiking through the peaceful green trails of Shadhollow Forest with its concealed paths and ancient secrets, or breathing in the salty sea breeze on the golden beaches of Parasol Sands, Mossport is full of natural beauty and diverse locations.</p><p>Often home to festivals and markets, Mossport’s high street is the lively heart of the city, with shops to browse, delicacies to sample, and friendly faces to meet. Whilst the Student Village buzzes with energy beneath the grand facade of Witchbrook College, housing a lively community of young witches.</p><p>When you need a step back, Shadbrook Cottage and its verdant garden offer a quiet retreat to transform how you see fit. Just down the lane you’ll find peaceful farmlands, and even a secluded spot to fish along the winding river. Each area connects naturally to the next, creating a world that feels lived-in, warm, and ready for you to explore.</p><p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p><p>The extra time we’re letting the cauldron bubble has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned! More details on this as soon as we can share them.</p><p>We’re hoping this glimpse at the map conveys the scale and variety of places you’ll be exploring in <em>Witchbrook</em>, when it releases next year! We’ll be sharing more development updates this side of the year with a blog focused on character customization arriving in the next few weeks. Also word on the street is that there’s another “The <em>Witchbrook</em> Oracle” already in the works. We can’t wait to share more.</p><p>Thank you for your patience, passion and continued support.</p><p>—Chucklefish</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/witchbrook-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation's troubled concert tour has cancelled a number of European dates, following previous cancellations and delays across the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-playstation-the-concert-arena-tour-in-uk-next-april">arena tour was announced last October</a>, featuring music from across PlayStation's 30-year history and "state of the art production". Music from the likes of God of War, The Last of Us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> were expected.</p>
<p>However, gradually a number of tour dates have been cancelled, presumably due to low ticket sales. The UK leg of the tour was back in April this year.</p>

<p>The latest cancellations are across Germany, Belgium and Switzerland (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/now-playstation-the-concert-has-seemingly-started-cancelling-2026-dates/">VGC</a>), all set to take place next March.</p>
<p>Performances at the ING Arena in Brussels, PSD Bank Dome in Dusseldorf, Hallenstadion in Zurich, Olympiapark in Munich, and Uber Arena in Berlin have all either been officially cancelled, or no longer appear on venue websites.</p>
<p>Websites for the <a href="https://ing.arena.brussels/en/show/playstation-the-concert-2/">ING Arena</a> and <a href="https://www.olympiapark.de/en/events/playstation-the-concert-n4669">Olympiapark</a> performances now include the following statement: "Due to unexpected reasons beyond our control, we regret to inform you that PlayStation | The Concert, scheduled for 9 March 2026 at the Olympic Hall in Munich, will not take place. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience and thank you for your understanding. Refunds are available at the original point of purchase."</p>
<p>All these dates remain on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/theconcert/#tourdates">official concert website</a>, but many with links to ticketing sites no longer available. Some US dates remain "coming soon".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a number of US dates were cancelled. A <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-quietly-cancels-remaining-playstation-the-concert-2025-tour-dates-in-the-us/">statement</a> from organisers GEA Live to VGC reads: "It is with great regret that we have cancelled the PlayStation The Concert 2025 tour dates in North America.</p>
<p>"Our team has spent a considerable amount of time developing this project, and we share in the disappointment of fans who will no longer be able to attend. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the show and appreciate your understanding in making this difficult decision."</p>
<p>This follows a number of other cancellations and delays of performance announced back in April.</p>
<p>There now remains just one European date at the Laszlo Papp Arena in Budapest, where the vast majority of seats are currently still available to purchase. There are also still US dates planned, though for how long remains to be seen.</p>

						<h5>ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X</h5><p><span>October 16, 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>Before I sat down in front of a television set with a controller in my hand to play a video game, I played games inches away from my face while squeezing my Game Boy for hours on end. There's many a childhood photo of me with my face buried in a handheld device, with a personal favourite being one where I'm deep into my Game Boy Advance SP on a beach. Those handheld beginnings and the handheld-focused gaming upbringing I had make me, in theory, one of the many who would get a lot of use out of a device like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>That is why I was honestly surprised to be so repulsed by the device when I finally had it in hand earlier this month. That repulsion died a bit before I spent some time checking out the new Xbox-branded ASUS ROG Ally at <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">an afternoon event in my hometown of Toronto since</a>, by that point, I had spent a week with the device. ASUS generously sent it over for this review, and I have now spent three weeks with it at the time of this publishing.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Full disclosure, I don't own a PC handheld myself - I've kept an eye on the Steam Deck, the ASUS ROG Ally and others like them, but beyond the fact that there are more important things than gaming hardware to spend money on at the moment, I flat out do not need one. I have a laptop and a desktop that get me by just fine, a PS5, an Xbox Series X, and a Nintendo Switch covering whatever games I may need or want to play. For myself, I can't justify the cost of any of them, let alone the newest and one of the most expensive ones on the market.</p>



<p>That's why getting to spend some serious time with one of these devices has been eye-opening. I have started to understand the appeal beyond the shallow level myself, and any other enthusiast is capable of seeing just from reading and hearing about these devices. It's simply an impressive thing to walk around with a device in my hands, playing games that I would have just a few short years ago never anticipated being playable in a handheld form factor. </p>



<p>Sure, it's old hat for the small millions of people who've already had their Steam Deck or ROG Ally or Lenovo devices for a couple of years now, but I'll admit that despite my initial distaste (which I'll explain), this is a truly impressive and, surely for some, a worthwhile device to own. I don't know who that person is, though, and even if you have $999 USD (or $1299 CAD) burning a hole in your pocket that can only be spent on video games and gaming-related things, I'd still caution you from picking one up yourself.</p>

<h3 id="h-initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h3>

</p></figure>



<p>Let me begin by addressing why I was repulsed by the device at first. On a superficial level, right out of the box, I just don't think it looks that nice. I wouldn't go far enough to call it ugly, but it's not the slickest device out there. Maybe it's something about the controller-style grips on either side, but when looking at it head-on, it struggles to shake the 'controller they slapped a screen in the middle of' allegations.</p>



<p>To their credit, the controller grips on either side make holding the 715g device comfortable for any extended period, which you will almost certainly be doing thanks to an impressive battery life, even when playing on its Turbo 25w setting.</p>



<p>Backing up a bit to when I took it out of the box, inside you get a 65Wh charger to keep the Xbox Ally X fully charged and ready to go (it also boosts to a 35w Turbo-Turbo mode when plugged in), your bog standard manuals and warranty card, and a little cardboard stand stuck to the top of the box on the inside. After taking off the plastic covering the device, I had my initial repulsion, as we discussed, and I started getting it set up, which took far longer than it would have compared to anyone who just picks one up themselves.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I had to do several pre-release updates and follow a guide specifically because the unit I got didn't come with all the prepared day-one updates. Of course, you won't have to do that, but right away, even with an Xbox button on the side, it was clear that this is definitely not an Xbox.</p>



<p>It loads into the Xbox PC app, specifically the new UI refresh that's releasing with this device and its sibling ROG Xbox Ally, and will also be coming to the original ROG Ally and ROG Ally X devices as an update, and that certainly helps it feel like an Xbox and achieve the console-like experience it's going for. I also have to shoutout the fingerprint reader on the power button, which makes jumping back into the device extremely simple.</p>



<p>The buttons on the back are satisfyingly clicky, and the thumbsticks are comfortably placed. The ABXY buttons have a stickiness to them that I'm not a huge fan of, but it's not too jarring. The triggers have a smooth pull, and the D-Pad, I'm very happy to say, as someone who loves platformers, works really well for even the more intense platforming titles like Celeste. Which is probably the game I've been playing on this the most in my time with it, both because it's an excellent game and because the D-Pad is great to use.</p>

<p>What I do not like about the layout, however, are the buttons on the top corners of the device on each side of the screen. There are five of them, two on one side and three on the other. It's at least two too many buttons. Either get rid of the Armoury Crate button, or the Xbox button on the left side. We don't need both, especially since they open the same side menu, and the Library button on top of the Menu button on the right side can go. I pressed it accidentally more than a few times, and once again, it brings me to an Armoury Crate menu I can get to through the Xbox button or the Armoury Crate button.</p>



<p>ASUS also sent over its official 2-in-1 hard-shell carrying case for the device, which does a great job of protecting the ROG Xbox Ally or ROG Xbox Ally X when you're tossing it in your backpack or something. It also comes with a small pouch attached to the back of the case via velcro, so you can easily take the charger with you. It's a simple, solid black case, though the strap that holds the ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X in place does make it a little cumbersome to remove and put back quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-tech-specs">Tech Specs</h3>

<p>A little overview of the technical specifications, the chart below includes the tech specs for the ASUS ROG Ally, Ally X, Xbox Ally, and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is now the new top-end device for the ROG Ally line of handhelds, with its latest Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which doesn't add more cores but does seem to add plenty of value in terms of battery efficiency. It has faster memory, but the new processor, memory, improved USB ports, and the new console shape with the controller grips on either side are about where the hardware upgrades stop, compared to the ROG Ally X. Oh, and the addition of an Xbox button, of course.</p>

<h3 id="h-benchmarking-battery-life">Benchmarking/Battery Life</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X houses the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Beginning with battery life, after an hour of Red Dead Redemption 2 on Turbo mode, the battery was only down to 50%. Only losing half of the battery after starting with a full charge, while pushing the device on Turbo after an hour of playtime, might not sound like the best, but it's not bad in my book considering the fact that I've found I really don't need to be at the Turbo setting all the time to get solid performance out of whatever I'm playing.</p>



<p>When set to the 17w Performance mode, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X handled just about anything I've thrown at it, and while Turbo is impressive, knowing I can squeeze a significant amount more time out of the device, without having to tone down my playing experience, is one of the ROG Xbox Ally X's biggest features.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Part of that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I learned when I spoke to ASUS's Whitson Gordon and Sashca Krohn</a>, comes from the company's focus on ensuring that battery life is a priority, which meant not going with an OLED screen, and not giving up its power-efficient IPS display. As much as I'll always love an OLED display when I can get it, I can't knock the IPS display here. The 7", 1920x1080p, 16:9 IPS display at 500 nits with a 120Hz refresh rate is more than servicable. Would an OLED be nice? Sure. Would it make the device even more expensive and difficult to recommend than I already think it is? Undoubtedly. All that to say, I'm not miffed about the lack of an OLED.</p>



<p>Getting into some of the benchmarking I did, for context, I'm no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a>. I'm not able to provide analysis on that level, but I can share internal benchmark results from the games I tested that have internal benchmarks. To that end, I tried to test a good mix of games: Forza Horizon 5, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Red Dead Redemption 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>



<p>In all of these games, save one, the common thread was that I could find ways to hit above 30 FPS, or even 60 FPS+, but keeping the frame rate consistent was always an issue. Forza Horizon 5 was the one game where I saw the game hit a consistent, smooth 60 FPS.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 5 benchmark test on the ROG Xbox Ally X, settings on High.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The built-in VRR helps smooth out the experience, but some games, like DOOM: The Dark Ages, I would just flat out not recommend playing on the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure><figcaption><em>Even at Low settings, I was unable to get it to a solid 60 FPS. Also, it looked awful.</em></figcaption></figure>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>My Red Dead Redemption 2 benchmarks were much more promising. I consistently hit 40 FPS on the 17Wh power mode, even with the graphics settings at Ultra. It was only when I switched to the Silent 13Wh power mode that it dropped to 30 FPS.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Tomb Raider was a similar story in that the higher settings would be able to hit around 40 FPS on both the 25Wh and 35Wh Turbo mode and the 17Wh Performance mode, though, of course, it started to falter much more when dropped down to the 13Wh Silent mode. Still, it only dropped to 30 FPS, and if you're like me and you don't balk at something when it hits lower than 60 FPS, the fact that I could play a game like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, even at 30 FPS, on this machine's 13Wh Silent mode is impressive.</p>

<p>Horizon Zero Dawn was, once again, the same story, with closer to 40 FPS on the 17Wh Performance battery mode, and 30 FPS on the 13Wh Silent battery mode. What separates Horizon Zero Dawn from the rest (besides Forza Horizon 5), however, is that you can run the game on its Favour Performance graphics settings, enjoy a slightly higher, closer to 50 FPS frame rate on the 17Wh mode, and it'll still look and feel great.</p>

<p>There were other games I played to test them out, like God of War (2018), Elden Ring, Dying Light: The Beast, OlliOlli World, and Hell is Us. Elden Ring, for whatever reason, crashed almost every time I tried playing it. The first time, it was seemingly just because I used the volume buttons on top of the device. Two more times, it was seemingly because I tried to navigate the menu with the LB and RB buttons. Another was just in the middle of gameplay, for no discernible reason.</p>

<p>I also crashed in Dying Light: The Beast, and that one was caused by going outside into Old Town from the Town Hall safe zone. Thankfully, that only happened once, but crashes aren't necessarily the ROG Xbox Ally X's fault.</p>



<h3 id="h-this-is-an-xbox">This Is An Xbox?</h3>



<p>At least to me, it's not. It's a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 and a special Xbox UI that makes it feel and behave more like a console. But it's not a console, and you shouldn't expect to pick one up and have a console experience with it.</p>



<p>You might have a console-like experience, heavy emphasis on 'like,' but it's a PC handheld, and even without having spent a lot of time with the full suite of PC handhelds out there, this definitely feels like one tailored for me, the console player who started seriously playing PC games within the last five years.</p>



<p>Having access to my full Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG library on the go in this form factor is awesome. It's not my full Xbox library, though, which is one reason it's only a 'console-like' experience. When I scroll over to the games that I 'Own' under my Xbox account, I don't see my full library.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Task switching in the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally with the new Xbox UI. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I'm not talking about not seeing games I have on physical discs; I'm talking about the original Xbox and Xbox 360 games that are playable on my Xbox Series X but don't appear here. Or any game that I know is available on my Xbox console but, for some reason, isn't on the Xbox PC app. It flat out is not my full Xbox library wherever I want it, and is only games playable through the Xbox PC app and Cloud Gaming.</p>

<p>It's honestly a small element in the grand scheme of it all. I know not everyone is going to be as miffed about this as I am, but it's another straw to add to my pile labeled, 'What am I paying $999 for then?' I also still really don't know who this device is for. If you're so invested in playing games that you'd be spending that kind of money on this device, you probably already have another means of getting your gaming time in. I get that portability is the big thing you're paying for here, but besides the fact that there are cheaper devices you can accomplish that with, your pre-existing PC and console can more than cover your gaming needs.</p>



<p>The price of this handheld is exorbitant; there's no other way to put it. In fairness, an overly expensive Xbox-branded PC handheld <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-game-pass-price-hike-laura-fryer/">aligns perfectly with Microsoft's current Xbox plans</a>. Still, compared to other popular PC handhelds, including ASUS's own ROG Ally products, I'm not sure this is the upgrade to go for.</p>



<p>If you already own a PC gaming handheld, ROG Ally or not, this doesn't seem like enough of an upgrade to drop $999. If you're looking to grab your first PC gaming handheld, you absolutely do not need to jump to the top-end of the price chart to get what you want out of a device like this. Just pick up a case that has grips on either side to match its built-in grips.</p>



<p>Credit where it's due, this is still an impressive piece of technology. I definitely understand why devices like this have become popular, but I don't understand paying that much when you can get comparable experiences, particularly on ASUS's own devices, for less.</p>

				<p>The ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X is a powerful, capable, and comfortable PC handheld device, with a smooth user experience thanks to the new Xbox UI. It's really like taking your computer on the go, with all of your PC games in your hands. For its mix of improved hardware, user experience, and battery efficiency, it's arguably the best PC handheld device to buy on the market. It's not an entirely smooth experience though, with plenty of PC gaming hiccups interrupting the 'console-like' experience the device is supposed to provide, the fact that it actually doesn't let you play all your Xbox games, and what I still believe to be an exorbitant price tag, when cheaper devices can provide comparable experiences.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%9Cthis-is-the-way-forward-for-us%E2%80%9D.1325227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, I spent an afternoon at the Steam Whistle Brewery in downtown Toronto. A short walk away from the CN Tower, Scotiabank Arena, and the Rogers Centre, I didn't cross the tourists in this bustling hub to play hooky for a beer or two at the downtown brewery. I was there on behalf of Wccftech to spend a little more hands-on time with the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, as well as hear from Whitson Gordon, ASUS's head of content for ROG and senior manager of marketing content, and Sascha Krohn, the global director of technical marketing at ASUS.</p>



<p>By this point, I had already spent a week with the ROG Xbox Ally X for my review of the device, (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which you can find here</a>), but having one at home meant that while I was at the event, I was more interested in seeing what Gordon and Krohn had to say about the device than getting to spend a little more hands-on time with it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The CN Tower in downtown Toronto, steps away from the Steam Whistle Brewery where ASUS Canada held the ROG Xbox Ally preview event.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So after they both gave presentations, when I got the chance to sit down with them (or more accurately, stand outside with them while we all stood around a wooden barrel operating as a showtable for some of the laptops ASUS was showing off), I knew I had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">start by asking them about the price</a> of the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>As a reminder, the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally, the lower-spec'd, cheaper version of the new ASUS and Xbox handheld, comes in at $599 USD (or $799 CAD), while the higher spec'd, top-end, more expensive Xbox Ally X costs a whopping $999 USD (or $1299 CAD). For context, you can take home the original ASUS ROG Ally for $499 USD, and the ASUS ROG Ally X for $799. So it's a $100 price increase if you're going from the ASUS ROG Ally to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally, and a $200 increase if you're going from the ASUS ROG Ally X to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had multiple ROG Xbox Ally devices and accessories for the handhelds on display at the event.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There are hardware differences between each device, with even the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally getting the next-generation AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor compared to the ASUS ROG Ally X's AMD Ryzen Z1, but these are absolutely not cheap devices. There's a lot you can buy for that kind of money, so I was curious as to how ASUS and Microsoft reached those prices, and if the fact that firms like Circana are reporting that 30% of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">US consumers will spend less on video games and entertainment</a> as the cost of essentials continues to rise is a concern for them when pricing devices like this.</p>



<p>But just before I got into any of that, I had to ask a much simpler question. What is this thing even called? And by that I meant, what do these marketing executives for ASUS call a product with a far too long, and far too confusing name?</p>



<p>"<em>I usually just call it the ROG Xbox Ally X</em>. <em>Or the Xbox Ally X. I try not to call it the Ally X, because then it gets confusing with the ROG Ally X,</em>" Gordon replied. It's a mouthful, I pointed out, and a confusing one at that. Krohn added that from his point of view internally, particularly when speaking with internal engineering teams, he addresses the two variants as the "<em>XA</em>" and the "<em>YA</em>," with the XA representing the ROG Xbox Ally X, and the YA representing the ROG Xbox Ally. He also mentioned that he will sometimes refer to them as their project codenames, which were Omni for the ROG Xbox Ally, and Horeseman for the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>

<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had laid out its ROG Ally line of devices, including the new Xbox Ally handhelds, broken down across long table.</em></figcaption></figure>

<figure><figcaption><em>A look inside the ROG Xbox Ally X.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>The blue motherboards are for the ROG Xbox Ally devices, and the red for the ROG Ally devices.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>ASUS even had the molds it made that helped shape the handheld's design during its conception phase.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>For me, at least, this hastened my resolve that the devices' actual names are atrocious. Even Gordon's answer showed that they're very confusing when compared to ASUS's other products. Especially when you start getting into the weeds of what is and what isn't an Xbox, and the importance of Xbox software and services like Xbox Game Pass to the ROG Xbox Ally line. And speaking of Xbox Game Pass, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/">recent price increase that saw players rush to cancel their subscriptions</a> led me right back to talking about the pricing for the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>"<em>I probably can't give you the detail that you want, because that starts getting into business contracts, and in general, we don't discuss those kinds of things</em>," Gordon began when answering how ASUS and Microsoft reached their pricing for the ROG Xbox Ally handhelds. "<em>Geopolitics</em>," added Krohn. "<em>What I can say,</em>" Gordon continued, "<em>Is that,</em> <em>especially for the ROG Ally series of handhelds, trying to hit a good, affordable price has always been a big priority for us. We have had people ask us in the past, 'Oh, I want this big list of super premium features, can't you just release a $1500 handheld, I would pay for it.'"</em></p>



<p><em>"The reality is, if you're trying to really introduce a new form factor to the gaming world, if you want to really build that volume of people using the device, you've got to hit an affordable price point. And it's one of the reasons we have two SKUs now, is to make sure that we can cover as many of our bases as possible that and as many people can access this new era of handheld gaming</em>."</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The full ASUS ROG Ally and Xbox Ally line laid out, including the screen found in each display and the batteries.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was at this point that I brought up the aforementioned Circana report, because having two SKUs does at least give people options, but $599 USD still puts the ROG Xbox Ally in the premium range, especially since that's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">right in between the cost of an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S console.</a> It's also more expensive than a base PS5 and slightly more expensive than the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-oled-announced-reservations/">512GB model of the Steam Deck OLED</a>. The ROG Xbox Ally X, for its part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-official-amd-ryzen-z2-extreme-1049-usd-price-hands-on/">is $50 off from the Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>, which is due out at the end of this month. Gaming has never been a cheap hobby, but it's arguably more expensive than ever, at a time when everything else seems more expensive than ever. So, where does the cost of living and what people have to pay for fit into pricing discussions?</p>



<p>"<em>That's absolutely always on our minds</em>," Gordon begins. "<em>We know that cost of living is a thing that's on everybody's minds, that's one of the reasons we want to try and hit as affordable a price point as we can. We just know that's an economic reality of the world</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Maybe don't necessarily look at it as a replacement for the devices that we have in the market</em>," Krohn adds. "<em>We already have the ROG Ally and the ROG Ally X in the market right now, and I think this is a trend that you see in recent years with all sorts of devices: phones, laptops, and even graphics cards and CPUs. The new generation that comes out doesn't necessarily replace the previous one, but it adds to the product stack and sits on top of the product stack. That's the new stuff, and the previous generation stuff still sticks around for a little bit. So I think that's one way of looking at it, and I would say it's not necessarily replacing what's on the market right now, it's just adding something to it. And there's still a lot of value in the devices that are on the market right now.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had also brought all the ROG Xbox Ally accessories to showcase.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>At least as long as those are still on shelves</em>," Gordon interjects. "<em>And that's true with all of our products, you see the same thing happen with laptops, the last generation is always around for people who want to get a good deal on that, until the new generation kind of supplants them, and that cycle continues.</em>"</p>



<p>It was clear to me that Gordon and Krohn wanted to send the message that if you're concerned about the pricing of these new ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, the older generation is always there for you. But it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTAKSBvuT-A&amp;t=13s">wasn't exactly a Don Mattrick moment,</a> because it's not like some of the new features coming to the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are going to be exclusive to those devices. Namely, the software and UI upgrades that the Xbox Ally devices come with out of the box; those are coming to the ROG Ally and Ally X as updates on the Xbox Ally/Ally X launch day.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>This new Xbox UI is arriving on ROG Ally and ROG Ally X devices as an update when the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X launch. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>That's precisely why we had the discussion,</em> <em>and ultimately decided, both us and Xbox, to bring the full screen experience, not just to the latest handhelds, but also the existing ones</em>," Krohn said. "<em>So, like I said, it's more like we're viewing this as a complete lineup of ROG Ally handhelds, which starts with the original ROG Ally, and then the ROG Ally X on top, and then you have the ROG Xbox Ally X at the very top, and the ROG Xbox Ally, with the Z2 A, really great battery life and efficiency, somewhat on the side, like between the Ally X and the OG Ally, and we have those different price points, different performance tiers, battery life tiers, so we have four devices in total, and the current generation is absolutely still in play, and super interesting, especially from a price-to-performance perspective.</em>"</p>



<p>So that's the case for now and for the short-term future of these devices, since ASUS is not likely to release a ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X hardware refresh or upgrade within the next year. But what about beyond that? I asked Krohn and Gordon very directly if these new ROG Xbox Ally devices are now their own line of hardware running alongside the ROG Ally line, or if the ROG Xbox Ally is now overtaking the ROG Ally line.</p>



<p>"<em>No, this is the way forward for us. The ROG Xbox Ally is the direction that we're headed with this lineup of products</em>," Gordon said very definitively.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Gordon's statement is definitive that the ROG Xbox Ally is the future of ASUS's ROG handheld line.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>So if these devices are the way forward, and, as Gordon had mentioned several times in his presentation earlier that afternoon, this device is meant to provide a console-like experience and be a way into the PC gaming handheld space for console gamers, I wanted to hear more definitively about who Gordon and Krohn thought this device was for. (I touch on the question of who this handheld is really for more in my review, and why it was important for me to ask this question, which you can go check out now as a reminder.)</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's for PC gamers, Xbox gamers, anyone who wants to play these latest titles that are popular on current-generation platforms, and we're seeing all these platforms sort of start to merge together</em>,<em>" </em>Gordon began. "<em>Sony games coming to PC, Xbox games coming to PlayStation. Overall, the gaming ecosystem</em> <em>is really coming together in a way that we haven't seen in the past, and it's kind of freeing, right? Anyone who wants the best handheld experience on the go, to play all of these games, this is it.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>ASUS had also set up two TVs connected to ROG Xbox Ally devices that were connected to ROG XG Mobile GPUs. But at this point, it feels worth pointing out that you might as well build a PC since these eGPUs can cost thousands.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>I would say it's a lot of things for a lot of different people</em>," Krohn added. "<em>It's two different devices that we are launching right now, and they're fairly different in their application, and what their strength is, what they're meant for, and what people find interesting about them, and I would say for anybody who is into PC gaming handhelds, what the ROG Xbox Ally X is: more performance, longer battery life, better erganomics, and much improved user interface." </em></p>



<p>"<em>For an Xbox console user, it is 'Wow, I can now take all my games with me, on the go, and I can even have access to game modding,' which is maybe something they're interested in. And they now have access to different catalogues of games, something like Spider-Man, maybe. So, I think to different people, it has a different appeal.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Would this actor be happier if he was looking at an OLED screen? Maybe. Image credit: ASUS</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One level of appeal that the ROG Xbox Ally devices lack is the inclusion of an OLED screen. And especially after hearing Krohn talk about the new Lumina Pro OLED screens from ASUS, I had to wonder if those screens would find their way inside a future ROG Xbox Ally device.</p>



<p>Gordon stepped up to answer this question, saying, "<em>We know that a lot of people are really interested in getting that kind of display experience on the Ally. There are a few reasons that we haven't done it yet. One of them is, like we talked about earlier, cost, trying to make sure that it stays affordable. Another is power usage."</em></p>



<p>"<em>So, one really interesting thing is, we don't want to give up Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and for a long time, that was something that was not as easily done on OLEDs and portable devices like this, and the current method for doing that on an OLED screen is more powerful, than what you're getting on this really great IPS display that we have on the Ally."</em></p>



<p>"<em>It looks excellent, and it's very power-efficient, and one of the most important things we have learned over the last two years of building the Ally is that battery life is one of the highest priorities. We don't want to give that up for an OLED screen that doesn't have an optimal solution for VRR. So, it's always on our radar, it's always something that we're testing, but it's just not quite where we want it to be yet for what we think is the best experience.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Inside the ROG Xbox Ally: Game Access and Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTaboYwSyuc?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>So, it looks like we'll have to wait a little while longer to see a Lumina Pro OLED screen, or any OLED screen for that matter, in an ROG Xbox Ally handheld device. And probably pay at least $1K for it. For now, it seems like the ROG Xbox Ally line will keep Xbox in the hardware business, even if it is ASUS behind the wheel and Microsoft slapping an Xbox logo on top.</p>



<p>Thank you to Whitson Gordon and Sascha Krohn for speaking with me and for being so generous with their time and answers. </p>

              <p>Recording your adventures is a great way to revisit and relive them later, or even share them with the world. But your smartphone camera or traditional options can only take you so far. To get those professional results in all lighting and weather conditions, you might want to consider investing in a DJI action camera, and now is a great time to grab one without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">Amazon has dropped the price of the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro essential combo to $269, giving you 21% off on one of the best action cameras out there.</a> The deal won’t be around for too long, so we highly recommend getting your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals On the Go</h2>
<p>The Action 5 Pro camera comes with all the essential features you need for a minimal yet powerful setup. You’re getting the all-new 1/1.3-inch sensor paired with a 13.5-stop dynamic range for clear images in both bright and dim settings. It shoots 4K video at up to 120fps, and the advanced 4nm chip makes sure the subject stays in focus even during motion in both horizontal (16:9) and vertical (9:16) formats. There’s a built-in color temperature sensor to automatically adjust white balance for lifelike results, as well.</p>
<p>Then you’ve got front and rear ultra-bright OLED touchscreens to capture moments without a lot of fumbling around. You can frame and check your shots on the go within seconds. And for when you don’t want to bother with buttons, there’s voice support with always-on recognition to control the camera hands-free within a one-meter range. The camera also plays nicely with the DJI Mic 2 and Mic Mini, so you will also enjoy crisp, clear audio without needing a separate receiver.</p>



<p>The built-in 1950mAh battery can last up to 4 hours on a full charge, while a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 2 hours of filming. Plus, the camera is IP68-rated waterproof up to 20 meters, and can even handle extreme cold (as low as -20 degrees) quite well.</p>
<p>All things considered, this action camera can be a great investment for all the outdoor enthusiasts looking to film their adventures in the wild. You’re not just getting a solid visual quality but also a reliable battery life, handy touchscreens, easy controls, and much more. Grab it for less while it’s still discounted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A continues on the modern trend of Pokémon titles with a huge amount of character customization options, which we’ve explained in full in this guide.</p>



<p>The first big Pokémon launch on Nintendo Switch 2, though it also remains available on the original console, Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of Legends: Arceus and makes a big change to battle mechanics.</p>



<p>There’s also a huge amount of character customization options in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which we’ve broken down in this guide, including covering details on any gender-locked options.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Lots to consider. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong> <strong>has a wide array of character customization options, giving you control over your full look and physical features, alongside a host of fashion choices.</strong></p>



<p>Initial character customization in the game covers the general set-up, including choosing a gender, hairstyle, skin tone, eye color, and make-up. Similar to Scarlet and Violet, your physical features are not permanent and can be adjusted in future in any way you choose, aside from skin tone.</p>



<p>In addition to flat hair colors that players have become used to, further customization options include color blocking and balayage. </p>



<p>When exploring Lumiose City, plenty of shops are available to purchase new clothes to shake-up your look, while others are unlocked through story progression and side quests.</p>



<p>We’ve listed all of the available character customization options below, split into physical options and cosmetic options.</p>



<p><strong>Physical Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gender</li>



<li>Eye Shape</li>



<li>Eye Color</li>



<li>Eyelash Shape</li>



<li>Eyelash Color</li>



<li>Eyebrow Shape</li>



<li>Eyebrow Color</li>



<li>Beauty Spot</li>



<li>Freckles</li>



<li>Dark Circles</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cosmetic Character Customization Options</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Hairstyle</li>



<li>Hair Color</li>



<li>Tops</li>



<li>Bottoms</li>



<li>Hats</li>



<li>Glasses</li>



<li>Gloves</li>



<li>Socks</li>



<li>Shoes</li>



<li>Jewelry</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>No, there is no customization in Legends: Z-A locked by gender, giving you full freedom in character creation.</strong></p>



<p>Hairstyles are uni-sex, and can be used for either gender, while other customization options like make-up and clothing is also freely available to fit any character. This includes skirts, blouses, and dresses.</p>



<p>This shouldn’t be too surprising, as the change was first made to the franchise with Scarlet and Violet unlocking all clothing and customization options, and should remain the norm for the franchise moving forwards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is a phenomenal piece of equipment that has a high price tag and a stunning specification, proving once again why ASUS sits at the top of the table in the handheld gaming market. I’ve been trialling a ROG Xbox Ally X for some time, and I’m happy to report that it has ticked all my boxes when it comes to gaming on the go.</p>



<p>Being a veteran of the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X units, I was always going to invest in an Xbox Ally X, but I underestimated how effective the evolution of this device would be. This is a winning handheld that suits me down to the ground, and in this ROG Xbox Ally X review, I’ll help you understand why it’s worth every penny.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-different-from-the-original-rog-ally-x">Is The ROG Xbox Ally X Different from the Original ROG Ally X?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The shell is better, has a custom print, the UI is upgraded, and the buttons have been enhanced.</figcaption></figure>







<p>On paper, it might seem like the core difference is just the name, with the addition of ‘Xbox’ being slipped into the branding. In actuality, things go beyond that, and the ROG Xbox Ally X represents <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a sizeable overhaul</a> compared to the original Ally X.</p>



<p>The biggest difference is that the ROG Xbox Ally X has an upgraded processor, featuring the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, compared to the original device’s AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme. This results in more processing power and smoother gameplay, and multitasking.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the memory (24 GB), storage (1 TB), screen (1080p, 120Hz IPS panel), and battery (80Whrs) are all the same.</p>



<p>I’m a <strong>huge </strong>fan of the biggest cosmetic and ergonomic changes to land with the ROG Xbox Ally X. The new device has a shell that might look strange at the beginning, but is actually much more tactile, comfortable, and sensible than the original shell.</p>



<p>It has more of a ‘grip’ built into the shell, and it accommodates larger shoulder and trigger buttons to suit all hand sizes. This grip makes it much more feasible to play games like first-person shooters. For example, I was playing Battlefield 6 on the ROG Xbox Ally X and found that I was almost as capable as I would have been using a traditional controller input.</p>



<p>Other improvements I noticed that aren’t necessarily on paper are the lower operating temperature, even at load, the quieter fans, and what sounds to me like better audio output.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-perform">How Does the ROG Xbox Ally X Perform?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Even a brand-new game like Battlefield 6 ran well on the ROG Xbox Ally X</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ROG Xbox Ally X ticked every box for me, as I’ve already said. I ran it through its paces with a series of games, both old and new, and every time, the device left me thoroughly impressed. I played everything from Fallout 4 (2015) to Battlefield 6 (2025). </p>



<p>I spent hours enjoying PowerWash Simulator, and even did what I’d done on the previous ROG Ally X, installing Escape from Tarkov and using the onboard Armory Crate software to remap my inputs to make it playable on a controller.</p>



<p>At every step of the way, the Xbox Ally X kept me entertained. With the 80Wh battery, you can get a few hours of gameplay out of the device, depending on the game you play and the processing level you pick (Silent, Performance, or Turbo). The ports for charging and audio inputs are nicely located, the buttons are responsive and full-sized, and the unit doesn’t weigh so much that it introduces fatigue.</p>



<p>I was wondering how the Xbox integrations would work, and I’m pleased to report that they’re not disruptive or pointless. They’re practical and make it feel more like a gaming handheld than a Windows 11 PC shrunk into a smaller shell.</p>



<p>If I have one gripe, it’s that ASUS strangely switched around the pause/select/Armory Crate/library buttons compared to the Ally X, which meant I was always pressing the wrong button when I tried pausing my game.</p>



<p>At the press of a button, you can open the Xbox Game Bar, fully customizable with widgets. With another press, you’re in the aggregated library function that collates all your games into one place, regardless of launcher or storefront. Using the Xbox UI is a much more welcoming and user-friendly experience than relying on the Windows 11 interface, and even that feels better than ever.</p>



<p>For example, I always had a problem with <strong>typing </strong>on the Ally X, and bringing up the keyboard often felt fiddly and frustrating. With the Xbox Ally X, that’s not the case, and the tweaks applied on a software level are tangible.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenal handheld, and when fused with Xbox, players open up remote play (with Xbox Series consoles) and cloud gaming potential like never before.</p>



<p>It charges quickly, has expandable memory, a lightning-fast processor, and it looks gorgeous on a stand. The RGB touches are neat (again), the glass and frame have survived a few drop tests, and there are plenty of accessories on the market you can use to customize your ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>Sure, it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-rog-xbox-ally-x-us-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has a price tag</a> of an eye-watering $999 (or £799), but in my opinion, it’s worth every penny. If you travel a lot, game on the go, or simply want something smaller to curl up with in bed as the cold winter nights creep in, you’ll want to invest in an ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>To me, this is the best gaming handheld on the market, bar none.</p>

<p>Here at Ars, we have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">writing</a> about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/05/6951-2/">rumors</a> of a portable Xbox <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/03/6415-2/">for literal decades now</a>. With the ROG Xbox Ally, Microsoft has finally made those rumors a reality in the weirdest, most Microsoft way possible.</p>
<p>Yes, the $600 ROG Xbox Ally—and its souped-up cousin, the $1,000, ridiculous-mouthful-of-a-name ROG Xbox Ally X, which we tested—are the first official handheld hardware to sport the Xbox brand name. But Microsoft isn’t taking the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/do-xbox-owners-have-a-right-to-expect-console-exclusives/">exclusive-heavy</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/08/as-epic-attacks-apple-and-google-it-ignores-the-same-problems-on-consoles/">walled garden</a> software approach that it has been committed to for nearly 25 years of Xbox home consoles. Instead, the ROG Xbox Ally is, at its base, simply a new version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">Asus’ Windows-based ROG Ally line</a> with an Xbox-flavored coat of paint.</p>
<p>That coat of paint—what Microsoft is calling the Xbox Full-screen Experience (FSE)—represents the company’s belated attempt to streamline the Windows gaming experience to be a bit more console-like in terms of user interface and overall simplicity. While that’s a worthy vision, the execution in these early days is so spotty and riddled with annoyances that it’s hard to recommend over the SteamOS-based competition.</p>
<h2>Promises, promises</h2>
<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/microsoft-dives-into-the-handheld-gaming-pc-wars-with-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally/">announced the ROG Xbox Ally this summer</a>, the company promised that what it was calling a new “Xbox Experience for Handheld” would "minimize background activity and defer non-essential tasks" usually present in Windows, meaning "more [and] higher framerates" for gaming. While this is technically true, the performance improvement is so small as to be almost meaningless in practice.</p>
<p>In our testing, in-game benchmarks running under the Xbox Full Screen Experience were ever so slightly faster than those same benchmarks running under the full Windows 11 in Desktop Mode (which you can switch to with a few button presses on the ROG Xbox Ally). And when we say “ever so slightly,” we mean less than a single frame per second improvement in many cases and only one or two frames per second at most. Even on a percentage basis, the difference will be practically unnoticeable.</p>

<p>The other major selling point of Microsoft’s Xbox FSE, as sold this summer, is an “aggregated gaming library” that includes “all of the games available on Windows” in one single mega-launcher interface. That means apps like Steam, Battle.net, GOG Galaxy, Ubisoft Connect, and EA Play can all be installed with just a click from the “My Apps” section of the FSE from the first launch.</p>
<p>The integration of these apps into the wider Xbox FSE is spotty at best, though. For one, the new “aggregate gaming library” can’t actually show you every game you own across all of these PC gaming platforms in one place. Choosing the “installable” games filter on the Xbox FSE only shows you the games you can access through Microsoft’s own Xbox platform (including any Xbox Game Pass subscription). For other platforms, you must still browse and install the games you own through their own apps, each with their own distinct interfaces that don’t always play well with the ROG Xbox Ally’s button-based controls.</p>

  </div>

<p>Even games that are supposed to be installable directly via the Xbox FSE caused me problems in testing. Trying to load the EA Play app to install any number of games included with Xbox Game Pass, for instance, triggered an “authentication error” page with no option to actually log in to EA’s servers. This problem persisted across multiple restarts and reinstallations of the extension that’s supposed to link EA Play to the Xbox FSE. And while I could load the EA Play app via Desktop Mode, I couldn’t get the app to recognize that I had an active Xbox Game Pass subscription to grant me access to the titles I wanted. So much for testing <i>Battlefield</i>, I guess.</p>

<h2>Mo’ launchers, mo’ problems</h2>
<p>Once you’ve gone to the trouble of installing your favorite games on the ROG Xbox Ally, the Xbox FSE does a good job of aggregating their listings in a single common interface. For players whose gaming libraries are spread across multiple platforms, it can be genuinely useful to see an FSE game list where Battle.net’s <i>Hearthstone</i> sits next to a GOG copy of <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, a Steam copy of <i>Hades II,</i> and an Epic Games Store copy of <i>Fortnite, </i>for instance. A quick tap of the Xbox button will even show you the last three games you played, regardless of where you launched them (alongside quick access to some useful general settings).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, actually playing those games via the new Xbox FSE is far from a seamless experience. You never quite know what you’re going to get when you hit the large, green “Play” button to launch a third-party platform via the Xbox FSE. All too frequently, in fact, you’ll get no immediate outward sign for multiple seconds that you did anything, leaving you to wonder if your button press even registered.</p>
<p>In the best case, this long wait will eventually culminate in a separate launcher popping up and eventually loading your game (or possibly popping up and down multiple times as it cycles through necessary launcher updates). In a slightly annoying case, the launcher might require you to close some pop-up and/or manually hit another on-screen button to launch the game (if you’re playing with the console docked to a TV, this may be downright impossible without a mouse plugged in). In the worst case, the wait might stretch to 30 seconds or more before you think to check the App Switcher and realize that Battle.net actually launched in the background and is waiting for you to input your username and password (to cite just one of many frustratingly counterintuitive examples I encountered).</p>

<p>Sometimes, switching from one active game to another via the handy Xbox button will pop up a warning that you should close the first game before opening a new one. Quite often, though, that pop-up warning simply fails to appear, forcing you to go to the trouble of manually closing the first game if you don’t want it eating up resources in the background. But in cases where you do want to multitask—downloading a game on Steam while playing something via the Epic Games Store, for instance—you can never be quite sure if the background app will actually keep doing what you want when it isn’t in focus via the FSE. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other little annoyances that make using the Xbox FSE more painful than it should be. Sometimes the system will swap between third-party launchers or between a launcher and the Xbox FSE for seemingly no reason, interrupting your flow. When the Xbox app itself needs updating, it does so via the desktop version of the Windows Update settings menu, which isn’t really designed for controllers (but which will offer to let you install the latest version of Notepad). Sometimes, Steam’s Big Picture Mode would have the very top and bottom of the full-screen interface cut off for no apparent reason. The system will frequently freeze on a menu for multiple seconds and refuse to respond to any input, especially when loading or closing an outside launcher. I could go on.</p>

<p>I’m willing to cut Microsoft a bit of slack here. It’s hard to bring the fragmented landscape of competing PC gaming platforms and storefronts together into a single unified interface that provides a cohesive user experience. In a sense, Microsoft is trapped in <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">that XKCD comic</a> where people complain about 14 different competing standards and end up creating a 15th competing standard in the process of trying to unify them.</p>
<p>At the same time, Microsoft sold the Xbox FSE largely on the promise of an “aggregated gaming library” that makes this all simple. Instead, the Full-screen Experience we got papers over the fragmented nature of Windows gaming while causing new problems all their own.</p>
<h2>A powerful machine</h2>
<p>Xbox FSE aside, there’s a lot to like about the ROG Xbox Ally line from a hardware design perspective. I tested the ROG Xbox Ally X, which is a little thicker and heavier than the Steam Deck but ends up riding that fine line between “solidly built” and “dense brick” pretty well in the hands.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>I was especially impressed with the design of the ROG Xbox Ally’s hand grips, textured ovoid bumps that slot perfectly into the crook of the palm for comfortable extended gaming sessions. The overall build quality shines through, too, from nicely springy analog sticks and shoulder triggers to extremely powerful, bass-heavy speakers and excellently clicky face buttons (which can be a bit loud when playing next to a sleeping partner). There are also some nice rear buttons that are incredibly easy to nudge with a small flick of your middle finger, if you’re one of those people who never wants to move your thumbs off the analog sticks.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally’s 7-inch 1080p screen is crisp enough and looks especially nice when delivering steady 120 fps performance on games like <i>Hollow Knight: Silksong</i>. But the maximum brightness of 500 nits is a bit dim if you’re going to be playing in direct sunlight. I also found myself missing the deep blacks and pop of HDR color I’ve gotten used to on my Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>The AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip in the ROG Xbox Ally X delivers all the relative gaming horsepower you’d hope for from a $1,000 PC gaming handheld. I was able to hit 30 fps or more running a recent release like <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> at 1080p and High graphical settings. For a slightly older game like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, the chip could even handle the “Ray-tracing Low” graphics preset at 1080p resolution at an acceptable frame rate when plugged into an outlet.</p>



<p>If&nbsp;you’re away from a power source, though, pushing the hardware for high-end graphical performance like that does take its toll on the battery. Titles that required the hardware’s preset “Turbo Mode”—which tends to run the noisy fan at full blast to keep internal temperature reasonable—could drain a fully charged battery in around two hours in the worst case. Switching over to the power-sipping but less graphically powerful Silent Mode (which can be accessed with a single button press using a handy "Armoury Crate Command Center" overlay) will extend that to about five or six hours of play time at the expense of the frame rate for high-end games.</p>

<h2>The SteamOS elephant in the room</h2>
<p>In a bubble, it would be easy to see the ROG Xbox Ally X as a promising, if flawed, early attempt to merge the simplicity of console gaming with the openness of PC gaming in a nice handheld form factor. Here in the real world, though, we’ve been enjoying a much more refined version of that same idea via Valve’s SteamOS and Steam Deck for years.</p>
<p>With SteamOS, I don’t need to worry about which launcher I’ll use to install or update a game. I don’t need to manually close background programs or wait multiple seconds to see an on-screen response when I hit the “Play” button. I don’t need to worry about whether a Settings menu will require me to use a mouse or touchscreen. Everything just works on SteamOS in a way I can’t rely on with the Xbox FSE.</p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft can brag that the Xbox FSE supports every Windows game, while SteamOS is limited to Valve’s walled garden. But this is barely an advantage for many if not most PC gamers, who have been launching their games via Steam more or less exclusively for decades now. Even companies with their own platforms and launchers often offer compatible versions of their biggest titles on Steam these days, a tacit acknowledgement of the social-network lock-in Valve has over the market for whole generations of PC gamers.</p>

<p>Sure, the ROG Xbox Ally can play a handful of games that aren’t available via SteamOS for one reason or another. If you want to play <i>Fortnite</i>, <i>Destiny</i>, <i>Battlefield</i>, or <i>Diablo III</i> portably, the ROG Xbox Ally is a decent solution. Ditto for web-based games (playable here via Edge), games available via niche platforms like itch.io, or even titles you might install directly to the Windows desktop without an outside platform’s launcher (remember those?). And even for games available on SteamOS, the ROG Xbox Ally can give you access to the free or cheap versions you obtained from sales or offers on other platforms (don’t sleep on <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408064600721-FAQ-Amazon-Prime-x-GOG?product=gog">Amazon’s Prime Gaming offers</a> if you like free GOG codes).</p>

<p>The killer app for the ROG Xbox Ally, though, is Xbox Game Pass. If you subscribe to Microsoft’s popular gaming service, logging in to your account on the ROG Xbox Ally means seeing your “installable” library instantly fill up with hundreds of games spanning a huge swath of the recent history of PC gaming. That’s an especially nice feeling for PC gaming newcomers who haven’t spent years digging through regular Steam sales to build up a sizable backlog.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/should-you-cancel-xbox-game-pass-everything-to-know-on-the-price-hikes-and-new-features/">recent price hike to $30 a month for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> definitely makes this a less compelling proposition. But ROG Xbox Ally users can probably get by with the $16.49/month “Xbox Game Pass for PC” plan, which offers over 500 installable games and access to new first-party Microsoft releases. As a way to dip your toe into the wide world of PC gaming, it’s hard to beat.</p>
<p>Even for players who aren’t interested in Xbox Game Pass, the ROG Xbox Ally X is a well-built piece of hardware with the power to run today’s games pretty well. All things considered, though, the poor user experience of the Xbox FSE makes it hard to recommend either ROG Xbox Ally over somewhat less powerful SteamOS devices like the Steam Deck or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/games-run-faster-on-steamos-than-windows-11-ars-testing-finds/">Legion Go S</a>. That said, we hope Microsoft will continue refining the Xbox Full-screen Experience to make for a Windows gaming experience that lives up to its promise.</p>

                <p>Released in 2011, Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was a success at launch and continued to grow in popularity over the years. It's now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as the No. 8 best-selling game in history.</a> Why has the game had such enduring appeal? Lead designer Bruce Nesmith said on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FRVR Podcast</a> that the game's open-world design was done in a way that "nobody had ever done before" and that only "very few" games have tried to do since.</p><p>"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It's like, 'What the hell is going on here?'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-is-eternally-shocked-at-the-games-lasting-appeal-saying-i-think-skyrim-did-open-world-in-a-way-that-nobody-had-ever-done-before" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>.</p><p>Nesmith, who has since left Bethesda, said he remembers when Bethesda boss Todd Howard--who directed Skyrim--would host in meetings in which he would tell staff about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">how wildly popular the game continued to be some 10 years after launch.</a></p><p>Nesmith went on to say that Bethesda accepted that Skyrim would have bugs and quirks, and fans did too. "You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond," he said.</p><p>Before this, Howard said of Skyrim's ongoing appeal and all the subsequent re-releases for new platforms: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">"If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it."</a> It's become something of a joke that Bethesda will release the game on any and all platforms, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-jokes-about-skyrim-on-amazon-alex/1100-6459648/" data-ref-id="1100-6459648">including Alexa devices. </a></p><p>Bethesda is now developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but it's likely still a long time off.

<p>It's a flippin' massive game, so chances are you won't get particularly far in just a few short days, but it should prove to be a compelling little demo if you're on the fence.</p>

<p>It's quite funny that this happens to also coincide with the launch day for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with X user <a href="https://x.com/BranPickle" tabindex="-1">@BranPickle</a> stating "Same day Z-A comes out is scandalous".

              <p>So much of the crap we own is beholden to a long cable and fat adapter to make it work. Our phones, our headphones, even our watches now all have a lithium battery that needs to be charged on the regular. When you need to plug in more than one device at a time, suddenly you space feels like a cobweb of cables running all directions, creating a tangled mess. Or worse, they don’t all fit. So now you’re on the hunt for multiple free wall outlets to get your AirPods up and running again just so you can relisten to the&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> soundtrack while you work. Thankfully, you can take control of your stress and clutter with a good charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charge of which Amazon knocked 40% off the price</a>. The charger normally goes for $50, but the discount ends up saving you an even $20. That means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multi-Device Charging</h2>
<p>This all-in-one charging block combines 10 different ports so you can charge up as many as 10 devices simultaneously. Between them all, you get six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one standard USB-A port. With a wide spread of options, you shouldn’t have any issue charging your various devices without the need for a unique charging block. You can just plug your device directly into the unit. In the event you still end up needing to plug an adapter into the AC outlet, you shouldn’t have that common problem of the block taking up multiple slots on the power strip. On the Baseus charger, each outlet faces a different direction to allow for better flexibility.</p>



<p>Designed for desktops and nightstands, the Baseus charging station comes with an adhesive strip for the bottom of the unit. This was it can stand firmly in place to the side of your desk, out of the way, but always where you want it to be.</p>
<p>Whether you’re charging your phone, earbuds, a MacBook, or all three at once, you can expect them to charge up quickly. The Baseus power station is able to deliver a maximum output of 67W. As a point of reference, the USB-C adapter that comes with iPhones nowadays is only 20W. And with GaN6 technology, you can trust your devices will stay safe and cool while charing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">For a limited time, you can secure yourself this versatile 10-in-1 Baseus charging station for $20 off. Get it now for just $30.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>By playing Battlefield 6 online, you’re bound to level up. Completing matches and challenges will give you precious XP, allowing you to level up your profile. If you want to know how far you can go and how many levels there are to ascend, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-has-reportedly-sold-over-6-5-million-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a lot of content, to say the least. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> will contribute to this, offering the community more ways to level up and earn rewards. Whether you play for the next few weeks, months, or years, chances are you’ll level up a lot.</p>



<p>So we’re checking out how many player levels there are to grind.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-highest-level-in-battlefield-6">What’s The Highest Level in Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bring the fire. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Technically, there isn’t a max level you can hit in Battlefield 6, as your player level can keep going.</strong></p>



<p>It’s believed that your Battlefield 6 player level can reach the high hundreds, maybe even the thousands. This means you can keep playing, keep leveling up, and flex on people with your incredible rank. Yes, remember to go out and touch some grass once in a while, but make sure you return to BF 6 as it’s always a fun journey starting at player level 1 and seeing how far you can progress.</p>



<p>As long as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> keeps delivering the multiplayer goods—and offers a strong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale</a> component—there’s no reason not to dedicate many hours to BF 6 to see if you can reach the unreachable ceiling!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-stop-earning-battlefield-6-rewards">What Level Do You Stop Earning Battlefield 6 Rewards?</h2>



<p><strong>At the moment, you stop earning Battlefield 6 online rewards once you reach player level 100.</strong></p>



<p>Again, there seems to be no max level cap, but it should be a while until someone finds out anyway. However, once you hit rank 100, this definitely brings an end to your free rewards. At least for now, as EA might decide to increase the rewards cap, and either give you backdated rewards for levels you’ve already reached, or implement a new reward system.</p>



<p>Special events might also be another way to grind levels within the overall grind. Either way, there are plenty of goodies to attain.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-amp-fastest-ways-to-level-up-in-battlefield-6">Best &amp; Fastest Ways To Level Up in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p><strong>Playing in a party, seeking out special Portal maps, and being smart with XP Tokens are the best methods to level up fast in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>We’re not going to get into the nitty-gritty of each point here, as we already have a useful, in-depth ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Farm XP &amp; Level Up Fast in Battlefield 6</a>‘ guide you should definitely read and bookmark.</p>



<p>But if you’re looking to level up fast, there are many ways you can embrace to make the process easier.</p>



<p>We hope this gave you the information you were looking for. May you level up in style and take pleasure in the misery of others as you defeat them for XP to level up! Let us know what level you are through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.</p><p>Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1148917741" data-promo-id="0"

It’s a reminder that, despite the scope of the journey ahead, this is a deeply personal tale.</p>
<p>Little Sewing Machine lead Chris Darill is no stranger to artistic horror or cinematic flair. His <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Aremothered"><strong>Remothered</strong></a> games were standout examples of survival horror done right. Here, he introduces us to a disarming world of primary colours and art that feels straight out of Disney, before plunging us into a nightmare filled with tricky puzzles and shadowy monsters.</p>
<p>Lana Benton lives a bleak life of toil at Bunny Hall Orphanage. Her only solace was her friend Carole, who has gone missing under mysterious circumstances. Haunted by nightmares of a tall figure in a top hat, Lana sets out to find her friend. In doing so, she stumbles into the world of Corolla, where strange creatures roam and the sinister Mr. Kyn, the man from her dreams, relentlessly pursues her.</p>

<p>In keeping with its art style, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a> unfolds like a classic Disney tale. A downtrodden heroine, who can speak to birds and is frequently called “princess” by fantastical creatures, moves from a bleak earthly existence to a strange alternate realm in search of a loved one. Personal struggles are overcome, and emotional lessons are learned. There's even an omniscient narrator that chimes in occasionally to exposit and vocalise the hero's internal trauma.</p>
<p>The writing has welcome cultural complexity. Bunny Hall is an oppressive institution that reinforces distorted gender dynamics. These story elements are well illustrated and underscore the importance of the central relationship.</p>
<p>The mechanics of Lana's adventure are as traditional as its story. Essentially a side-scrolling puzzle adventure, it plays out like an old-school point-and-click, with some added QTEs and punishing trial-and-error encounters.</p>
<p>Early on, Lana gains the ability to transform into a rabbit, unlocking wall jumping and new traversal options. The alternate Bunny Hall also features grotesque versions of authority figures that our princess must run or hide from in tense, though often clunky, stealth sections.</p>

<p>Hiding in dark spaces, holding your breath, and trying not to get caught by a twisted rabbit creature evokes the gothic chills of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a>. However, unlike the quick death that awaits in that Burtonesque classic, Bye Sweet Carole’s has a health bar that encourages multiple attempts at hide and seek. Character animations don’t always allow for a smooth escape once you’re discovered. Lana can switch between human and rabbit form to navigate obstacles, but these moments can still feel like frustrating exercises in trial and error.</p>
<p>There’s some light combat, where you take control of the mysterious protector Mr. Baesie. It fares a bit better than the stealth encounters but still feels somewhat fiddly. That said, an empowering final battle is thoroughly enjoyable, but I won’t spoil that here. The lavishly animated challenges are not as punishing as the visually similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragons_lair_trilogy">Dragon’s Lair</a> (Don Bluth rather than Disney), yet there are times when Lana simply has to die before you can figure out the solution.</p>
<p>The rest of the time is spent travelling between screens, collecting various ephemera to clear obstacles or open doors. There’s some very light platforming and frequent chase encounters with Mr. Kyn and his minions.</p>

<p>It’s worth pushing through the rough patches to continue Lana’s search for her friend. Using a familiar yet distinctive aesthetic to tell such a personal and occasionally bleak story is effective. The visuals are complemented further by a beautiful score from composer Luca Balboni, which makes even the simple act of retracing your steps through loading screens feel grandiose.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the art style doesn’t always mesh perfectly with movement and combat, but that doesn’t take away from its beauty on either a big or small screen. Aside from a fair bit of loading between areas, the game performs well on the Switch, with smooth, fluid animation, especially when Lana is darting around in rabbit form.</p>
<p>Undocked Switch 2 performance feels mostly the same as on Switch 1, though the visuals stand out far more on the newer console’s larger handheld display. Undocked play is a much more viable option on the Switch 2, but Bye Sweet Carole performs well across both platforms.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfolding like a classic Disney tale, this is a beautifully animated adventure that weaves a deeply personal tale. Bye Sweet Carole is driven by its art style and a brilliant musical score, but occasionally stumbles due to stiff controls and frustrating mechanics.</p></section>
