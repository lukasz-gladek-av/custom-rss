            <p>Gears of War Reloaded developer The Coalition has extended the second weekend of the game's beta, which along with more time will also include more modes and more maps for participants to check out.</p>
<p>The upcoming weekend's beta will now run between 20th June 8pm UK time until 23rd June 5am UK time, and feature five maps for both Social Team Deathmatch and Competitive King of the Hill and Execution. Initially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-coming-this-weekend">things were planned to be wrapped up within 48 hours and with less variety</a>.</p>

<p>As to why the team has decided to do this? Well, "we heard you," is what it wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1935414750034411784">post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>You see, the first Gears of War Reloaded beta weekend didn't <em>exactly </em>go all that smoothly for the developer, and there were multiple reports from players of <a href="https://x.com/SASxSH4DOWZ/status/1934359201523929512">server instability</a> as well as technical issues. Many were quite <a href="https://x.com/Lilkillsville/status/1934044001050730864">vocal about their experiences</a>.</p>
<p>"Most of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream thumbnails are of people sitting trying to find a match. When you eventually can get into a match, everybody is laggy and when you start shooting somebody they just disappear and then randomly you die or they stutter back and forth taking multiple full clips and not dying," read <a href="https://x.com/Freas23Gaming/status/1933863257304875257">one such post on social media</a> following the first beta. "I knew the beta was probably gonna be bad but this is just terrible and unacceptable."</p>
<p>Hopefully things will go a bit better this weekend.</p>

<p>Gears of War Reloaded - which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">revamped edition of the original Gears of War game</a> - will be making its full arrival on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August.</p>
<p>It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studio promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-update-20-1-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Nintendo Switch 2 system update is now live, introducing general stability improvements as well as undocumented improvements.</p>
<p>The official update notes don't leave any doubt regarding the fact that this is a minor update, as it only introduces <em>"general system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</em> What's more interesting is that the update reportedly does introduce some undocumented improvements. As reported by well-known dataminer OatmealDome on <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, the new update improves backward compatibility, and some previously unsupported titles are now properly playable on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>While not a direct effect of the new system update, Pikmin 3 Deluxe now properly works on the new system, thanks to a new <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935510351015006422" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> that addressed screen flickering issues. The demo version of the game will also be fixed later.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility seems to be one of the best features of the Nintendo Switch 2, so it wouldn't be surprising to see improvements already being made so soon. Multiple tests have confirmed that even<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/"> unpatched games</a> can take advantage of the new system's better specs to deliver more stable framerates, so hopefully, more of the incompatible titles will become fully playable on the system in the future.</p>
<p>For the rest, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a massive improvement over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Sloclap launched its football action game Rematch today, but crossplay has not been included due to "unforeseen technical complexities".</p>
<p>Rematch released across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (Steam), but players are unable to play with others on rival platforms - at least, not yet.</p>
<p>"We understand many of you were looking forward to playing Rematch across platforms from day one," said the studio in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch blog post</a>. "We did our utmost to include crossplay at launch, but Rematch is the studio's first crossplay title, and we faced unforeseen technical complexities which prevented us from having this feature ready in time. We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn't be available at launch, and we're sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>

<p>The studio noted it's "very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends" and so crossplay is its "absolute highest priority" alongside bug fixes. It's "committed to delivering this feature swiftly". A basic working version has already been produced from a technical standpoint, but needs to be debugged and polished before full implementation.</p>
<p>The studio also noted other issues it's looking to fix, based on feedback from the early access period. These include: performance optimisations to improve stability; preventing server and client desynchronisation; and resolving game-breaking bugs.</p>
<p>Beyond these issues, the studio will be working on broader updates with new content like tournament and leaderboard systems, social features like spectating and (ironically) easier rematches, as well as more casual game modes such as quick play and implementing AI bots to train against.</p>
<p>Sloclap will also tweak the core gameplay, with improvements to the sliding tackle, goalkeeper mechanics, the dribbling system, and wall contacts, among others. "Our general objective is to keep adding depth and granularity to our mechanics, to make the game as interesting as possible in a competitive environment," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year!" Sloclap concluded. "We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p>
<p>The studio added: "We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress. Thanks to all players who joined us already for your incredible enthusiasm and support, this is really what motivates us to make this game as great as it can be!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Tom Orry has been playing Rematch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-the-challenging-new-online-football-game-hitting-game-pass-immediately-transported-me-back-to-my-schools-playground">likened it to being transported back to the school playground</a>, stating "the same blinkered overconfidence of school days is here to see in Rematch".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Rematch has also been added to Xbox Game Pass</a>, for those with a subscription.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Hogwarts Legacy on Nintendo Switch was pretty naff, let’s be honest. A remarkable achievement, but one that was inevitably heavily compromised just to get it running at the low level that it managed. By contrast, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is a huge accomplishment that captures so much more of the tone and feel of the game on PS5, Xbox Series X or PC that it feels so much more worth playing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is a transfigurational new port!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIeg7MFl6NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a brand-new port of the game to Nintendo Switch, retaining none of the heavy compromises that were needed to work on Switch, and making its own adjustments to match the new hardware platform’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>


<p>The difference is night and day, though. The often very flat lighting and shading of the interior of Hogwarts on Nintendo Switch is replaced by the rich light and dark of more realistic internal lighting and illumination. This is one of the key areas where the game gets much closer to the game on PS5.</p>

<p>To me, that is one of the most impactful changes, but there’s so many other changes that were made for the game on Switch that have effectively been reverted for Switch 2. It’s everything from how thick the grass looks on the ground with the draw distance, to the variety of fidelity of the trees in the grounds around Hogwarts, the shadows that things cast.</p>

<p>It’s seriously impressive.</p>

<p>Alongside this has come a general gameplay experience that better matches the game on PS5. Where Switch 1 had loading transitions to get into Hogsmeade and to walk into shops, Switch 2 is able to get back to the style of PS5, where the doors all just feel like they’re a bit haunted and slow to respond –&nbsp;most noticeable at major area transitions.</p>
<p>Flying around on a broomstick has also been sped back up, the faster storage and larger amount of RAM in the Switch 2 allowing for dynamic loading to keep up better. It’s one of those things you might notice most in side-by-side comparisons, or if you ever compare your records for time trials.</p>
<p>On a simplistic level, Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 is able to hold onto a 30fps target very well, Running through Hogwarts grounds on the path to Hogsmeade is basically just locked to 30fps, and when you reach Hogsmeade itself, you don’t have a loading screen like on Switch 1 and can just run straight into the tight village streets where, once again, performance is great.</p>

<p>Really, the main issues we’ve found have been with instances of loading stutter when coming up to the hidden loading screens at doors between areas –&nbsp;which when Hogwarts itself is a maze of doors and courtyards, does add frequent little blips, in addition to some pop-in and the fade of new lighting conditions. Flying around on a broom also leads to poor frame pacing, so this introductory time trial, for example, is 30fps, but it feels more juddery than it should be.</p>
<p>In any case, this all makes for a much more pleasant experience than the Switch 1, which can pretty much never maintain its 30fps target. Just running through the halls dips to the mid-20s, and the broom flying is seriously taxing for the system, such that this port slowed down the speed of flight to try and keep up.</p>
<p>You can, of course, play the Switch 1 port on Switch 2 via backward compatibility, and this does make it much more palatable. Dynamic resolutions will be better (though I’d argue still not exactly good), and the frame rate does steady up to 30fps, but there’s bad frame pacing here when running to Hogsmeade in particular. I guess Shiver Entertainment who did this Switch 1 port didn’t feel the need to look at this when they had much bigger problems!</p>
<p>Of course, even 30fps is a big step back from what is possible on PS5 and other more powerful platforms. They have graphics performance options, ranging from 30fps fidelity and ray tracing modes, through a standard 60fps performance mode and even a higher frame rate mode.</p>

<p>The main comparison, to my mind, would be from Switch 2 to PS5 performance mode. Not the max fidelity or performance, but the safe middle-ground. With this, you definitely notice some of the compromises still being made for Switch 2. And…. well, honestly you don’t even need to make this comparison to see how the Switch 2 relies on lower resolutions and upscaling to get the job done. The key area that always grabs my attention is when in the dialogue scenes and you can see the low resolution hair with jaggies and floating isolated strands. The diffuse reflections on shiny walls and floors through Hogwarts also have much more of a speckled look at you get to the ends, though intriguingly, it does seem that there are more of these reflections by default on Switch 1, vs. performance mode on PS5.</p>

<p>However, in general, this is an incredibly impressive new port of Hogwarts Legacy for Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, there are of course compromises, but it really captures the look and feel of the original game release that makes it feel of that generation, and not like the necessarily cut down port of the original Switch.</p>
<p>It’s also nice to see that, while this is new work, Warner Bros. is offering upgrade pricing. If you own the game on Switch 1, you can access a DLC from the game’s main menu to enable a discount price for the full Switch 2 game to bring it down to $10 or £8.50. This could have been made more obvious with a Switch 2 Edition style release, but has the major benefit that you won’t need the Switch 1 cartridge to play anymore, if you’re coming from a physical copy. For one of the biggest generational leaps you’ll ever likely see, that’s a bargain, but it’s also just a nice good faith upgrade in general.</p>

<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a great port for Nintendo Switch 2, and another great showcase of how the console can punch above its weight.</p>

			<p>A new game project titled Lionhearts <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/612741239/lionhearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appeared on Kickstarter</a> yesterday, seeking a minimum of $100K, of which over half has already been pledged. ROBLOX fans might recognize the name from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/1160789" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts: Crusade</a>, a conquest experience developed by Credenzio Studios that reached over 6.3 million plays in the popular game since its original release in 2018.</p>
<p>Now, Colorado-based developer Credenzio is turning the concept into a standalone game developed with Unreal Engine 5. It will be a persistent multiplayer feudal simulator inspired by games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-to-get-war-sails-nautical-expansion-this-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade: Bannerlord</a>, Assassin's Creed, Helldivers, and EVE Online.</p>
<p>The game is set in a historically authentic 12th-century medieval world, specifically during the Third Crusade. The developers pledged to respect the bounds of historical plausibility and accuracy. In this context, players will be given nearly complete reign, with NPCs having little to no presence in the game world. They'll start with having to gain favor in their kingdom to ascend the religious, military, or trade hierarchies and acquire wealth, tools, lands, and power. To do so, they'll choose one of the three career paths of the age: military, religious, or trade. With 16 factions, 14 guild types offering 60+ career paths, and 4 religions, players can become a knight, blacksmith, bishop, merchant, or even a king, eventually ruling the Holy Land itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lionhearts Official Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEj2d-uBhEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Lionhearts, there will be 12 player-run kingdoms and 4 military orders, in which every position of power, from lord to king, is controlled by real players. Players can command retinues, wage wars, and navigate diplomacy in an ever-changing struggle for land and influence. Monarchs must balance internal politics, trade, and religion while competing for dominance in the Holy Land and beyond. As mentioned earlier, Credenzio is promising a persistent MMO-like world. This is supposed to happen through a server meshing-like technology where servers are stitched together to create a single, seamless shared open world. Each location will exist in a single instance, so there will be no need for server hopping or loading screens.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's an incredibly ambitious project, especially for an indie studio. There is, however, a 'visual demo' available for download (the link is on the Kickstarter page) for those interested. Otherwise, you could simply add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3348690/Lionhearts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lionhearts</a> to your Steam wishlist.</p>

            <p>You thought the summer showcases were done? Well, no they are not! Capcom has today announced its own showcase, scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>Capcom Spotlight, as it is known, will shine a light on upcoming games Pragmata and Resident Evil Requiem, as well as existing titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>The whole thing will last for around 40 minutes, Capcom has said, offering us all the "latest news and extended commentary with developer interviews". It will kick off on 26th June, at 11pm here in the UK.</p>

<p>While the specifics of what Capcom will be spotlighting next week remain mostly under wraps for now, this showcase will include some information on the newest update for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>As for those other games, we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem earlier this month, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. Bodes well!</p>
<p>Capcom also gave us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-pragmata-coming-2026-developer-promises">another look at Pragmata earlier this month</a>. This is the studio's long in the works astronaut and small girl-starring game. "Pragmata is a fascinating genre mash-up, and Capcom at its experimental best," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pragmata-is-a-fascinating-genre-mash-up-and-capcom-at-its-experimental-best-hands-on">Eurogamer's hands-on Pragmata preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Grant Kirkhope, composer of the DK Rap, wasn't aware it would be used in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo detailed more on its forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> gorilla platformer and fans spotted the inclusion of the DK Rap, originally created for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>.</p>
<p>But Kirkhope was not aware it would be used again in Donkey Kong Bananza. Based on past use, it seems unlikely he'll be credited too.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I say, the worst rap track in the history of rap tracks seems to be back again!" joked Kirkhope to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"It's so bizarre that people seem to like it now considering the backlash that I got when DK64 first came out, nobody seemed to get the joke except me... haha... I've only had to wait 25 years for that to happen! Actually I think that little kids got the joke but the cool teenagers didn't!"</p>
<p>He added: "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-explains-why-nintendo-didnt-credit-him-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">Kirkhope about the inclusion of the DK Rap in Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Kirkhope was not credited for its use.</p>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo," he explained. "Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
<p>Considering Nintendo owns the DK Rap score, it would appear Kirkhope may once again not be credited for its inclusion in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Bananza will be released next month and has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-musical-twist-revealed-plus-dk-rap-is-included">musical twist with Donkey Kong transformations</a>. It will also include a music player to enjoy tracks from the game - presumably the DK Rap will be there too.</p>
<p>Eurogamer also spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope">Kirkhope about the possibility of a new Banjo Kazooie game</a>, as well as his work on GoldenEye, and how his music represents nostalgia.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s great enhanced bossening has begun, with the first of the toughened up terrors FromSoft had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-new-enhanced-boss-fights-have-leaked-early-thanks-to-nosy-modders">previously teased</a> having just rocked up.</p>
<p>It's the Gaping Jaw boss, and it'll be followed by other Everdark Sovereigns in a time-limited weekly rotation of advanced adversaries for folks to test their mettle and friendships against.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Everdark-News">announced by FromSoft</a> at 6AM UK time today, June 19th, in what I assume to be a commendable effort to get everyone out of bed on a very hot Thursday, the Everdark Sovereign version of Gaping Jaw is now available to battle. That's assuming you've managed to defeat the base version of Gaping Jaw already. If not, you'll have to take that on as a pre-megajaw warm-up.</p>
<p>If you can beat enhanced Gaping Jaw, you'll get some Sovereign <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sigil">Sigil</a> tokens as a reward you can then trade in for "special relics and other items", with your first victory over each of these extra-resilient rivals netting you more tokens than subsequent wins. If you want an idea of what you're in for with this first time around, the sorts of streamers who specialise in beating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> with one health while doing a handstand and pressing keys with the power of their minds have already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWMWNVZB2YY">taken on the fresh foe</a>.</p>
<p>This initial crack at Gaping Jaw will run until June 26th at 1:59 AM BST, which is 20:59 on June 25th in ET, at which point enhanced Gaping Jaw will be whisked away, possibly to return at some point down the line. The enhanced versions of Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight are next up in the rotation, with FromSoft adding that Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast, and Fissure in the Fog's Everdark Sovereigns will be arriving at a later date.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in order to take on these enhanced bosses, you'll need to launch the game in online mode, but it looks like modders may have already found a way to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/202?tab=description">make them available offline</a> as they arrive by swapping them for their regular counterparts. So, if you want to take them on using modded gear or as a twosome via the duos mod, you should be able to do just that.</p>
<p>If you'll be diving back in for your first expedition in a while, make sure to check out what the first few <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-latest-patch-is-good-news-for-madness-fans-and-should-save-you-from-auto-death-after-boss-fight-revives">patches</a> for Nightreign have tweaked and our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">guides</a> if you fancy a refresher to help you get back up to top speed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I’m a massive fan of&nbsp;TRON, but more specifically, I’m a massive fan of TRON: Legacy. The 2010 sci-fi sequel has been cemented in my subconscious since the day it came out. The world it built has always been so captivating to me, with sleek metal obelisks and neon colorized highlights dancing around in my dreams most nights. It’s all complemented by gripping audio design, from the roar of the light cycles to the zap of a bouncing identity disc and the iconic Daft Punk&nbsp;curated score. Every opportunity I get to revisit that world is a thrill, so I’ve been chomping at the bit to get my hands on the latest spinoff of my favorite sci-fi property –&nbsp;TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrt-GkCO-ZQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it doesn’t have a number in the title, TRON: Catalyst pretty much a direct follow-up to Bithell Games’ 2023 visual novel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tron-identity">TRON: Identity</a>. The two titles make a really complementary pair and, after rolling credits on this latest release, it’s clear they’re aiming to continue this story further with a third entry. TRON: Catalyst focuses our sights on Exo, a program working as a courier in the virtual city of Vertical_Slice who lands in hot water when her last delivery of the night ends up being an explosive device that goes off in her hands. She makes it out alive, but not unaffected. Whatever she was tasked to deliver ended up giving her the ability to Glitch, which lets her rewind time to an earlier point whenever she chooses. Hunting for answers on why she can do this and who’s responsible lands her in the middle of a plot of resistance and uprising, and a race against the clock to stop a Glitch storm from wiping out the entire system.</p>


<p>Mechanically, the glitch ability is a lot less exciting than it sounds. I’m a sucker for a good time-loop game, but it needs to smartly loop that concept equally through the narrative and the gameplay. TRON: Catalyst doesn’t strike that balance. Your hand is often held tightly by the game as your objects guide you on when to press the loop button to reset the current chapter, retaining your obtained info and abilities to progress down a new path. Despite the illusion of dialogue choices and branching exploration, the entire experience is incredibly linear, never once feeling like you have the ability to shape any outcomes yourself.</p>


<p>Despite the middling use of time-loop gameplay, I was still in awe getting to run around the world of TRON and explore such lovingly crafted locales. The dense Iso-populated cities and barren, green-tinted Outlands perfectly matched my memories of them from other TRON properties, and the pink-tinted Automata add a new element to the mix that I loved exploring. You’re given iconic tools like the Identity Disc and a Lightcycle to play around with, too.</p>
<p>Tossing and slicing your disc plays out in pretty basic real-time combat, with a skill-tree that helps expand your abilities. It’s hardly the focus of the game or it’s strongest suit, but it helps break up the exploration heavy segments that occupy the rest of the game. Lightcycle chases and battles, on the other hand, are a delight. The top-down viewpoint of the game never properly captures the sense of speed you’d hope for from these moments, but the battles are so satisfying and I could honestly see myself getting lost in a mode that was nothing but those bike battles for hours, if it was on offer.</p>

<p>If there’s one element of TRON: Catalyst that actively disappointed me, though, it was the soundtrack. A major part of the modern identity for the TRON franchise is it’s music. TRON: Legacy introduced us to the electronic and orchestral fusion of Daft Punk excellence that has gone on to influence the music of every spin-off title since then, and the upcoming TRON: Ares film promises to carve out an equally exciting audio identity for itself with a soundtrack composed by Nine Inch Nails. TRON: Catalyst fails to ignite the same excitement that most Tron music does, its score often playing it safe and basic and remaining buried far too deep into the background. It also doesn’t buck trends and try to establish it’s own identity with those tracks. Instead, it feels like the safest, undetectable interpretation of what TRON: Legacy introduced to us.</p>
<p>That’s probably the best word I could use to describe TRON: Catalyst –<strong>&nbsp;</strong>safe. It has a lot of big ideas, but only gives you the faintest taste of each of them. As a fan of the franchise, I still adored every second of it, but I was never truly wowed or inspired playing this as I was from any other entries in the series. With an ending that so clearly queues up a sequel, my biggest wish is that whatever comes next is bigger, bolder, and louder in every way possible.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		TRON: Catalyst is a safe spin-off of the iconic TRON: Legacy world - it presents big ideas but only ever dips it's toes into those waters, wrapping things up as a mostly okay game that existing fans will likely find a lot of joy in nonetheless. 	</p></div>

<p>We all kind of knew this was coming, of course, thanks to a previous leak, but it's still pretty cool to see just how vital she'll prove to be with the overarching story.</p>
<p>Thanks to a new page via the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html">Japanese Nintendo Store</a>, even more details regarding Pauline have been revealed, including her age. According to a very brief summary of her character, she is 13 years old at the time she encounters DK in Bananza.</p>
<p>Translated via Google, the sumary reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A 13-year-old girl who loves to sing. She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and turned into a rock."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Direct revealed that Pauline can use her singing abilities to point DK in the right direction during gameplay, while also transforming him into one of three new forms: Kong Bananza, Zebra Bananza, and Ostrich Bananza.</p>
<p>Co-op play is also supported, with a second player taking on the role of Pauline to sing out deadly words to defeat enemies and blast away chunks of the environment. GameShare has also been confirmed for DK Bananza, with users of Switch 1 consoles able to join the fun.</p>

            <p>I actually can't remember the last time I played a shmup. Maybe a Gradius? I don't know anything about ZPF's genremates or even what its name stands for, but I do know a good colourful big bastard turtle when I see one, and that was enough for me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095410/ZPF/">Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>"Great score!" Zam Pankman-Fried told me after I died 45 seconds in. From this, I learned that ZPF is a massive liar, but also that I actually quite like shmups still. Pretty compelling as far as avoid the bad thing 'em ups go.</p>

<p>There is/was/are going to be <a href="https://megacatstudios.com/pages/zpf">physical carts of this one available</a>, and while I appreciate the commitment to the 16-bit, I know where buying one physical game ends, and it ends with me buying so many I'm forced to start an unsuccessful retro gaming YouTube channel where I film myself in front of my heaving collection to adopt an air of legitimacy like a Netflix documentary trying to convince you to heed an MBA's opinion on magic mushrooms because they're sitting in front of a very large bookshelf. Steam suits my purposes fine for now. Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Inspired by classic horizontal shooters like Lords of Thunder, Elemental Master, and the Thunderforce series, ZPF is a passion project from the designer and developer of Super XYX and Tänzer.</li>
<li>Players will dodge and weave through intense bullet patterns, unleashing a barrage of firepower upon hordes of unique and challenging enemies.</li>
<li>Brace yourself for epic encounters with mid and end-stage bosses, each demanding a different strategy to defeat.</li>
<li>Upgrade your arsenal and gain valuable tips between levels at each of the world’s in-game shops.</li>
<li>Finish every stage and discover a treasure trove of hidden secrets.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say I really like how this one looks, even if I lack the language this morning to call it anything more precise than "colourful and cybery". Rainbow Geiger? Enlighten me, art style knowers. Reminds me quite a bit of <a href="https://hollow-press.net/collections/cyberflesh/products/cyberflesh-boardgame">Hollow Press's Cyberflesh</a>. Will I get good enough at it to see that turtle in the cyberflesh? Doubtful, but I'm motivated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been shadow dropped, bringing stronger Nightlords to defeat on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>These limited-time versions of bosses are known as the Everdark Sovereigns and will have new moves and increased power. The first to appear will be an enhanced Adel, Baron of the Night (Gaping Jaw) for this week, to be followed by the Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight.</p>
<p>The remaining Nightlords will be added at a later date. At the end of each week the "Sovereign will disappear from the available Expeditions… for now".</p>

<p>Note that these Everdark Sovereigns will only be available once the original form of that Nightlord has been defeated.</p>
<p>What's more, defeating the Everdark Sovereigns rewards players with Sovereign Sigils. These are unique tokens that can be exchanged for special Relics and items. Additional Sigils will be rewarded the first time an Everdark Sovereign is defeated.</p>
<p>"This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle," read the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign">update notes</a>. "As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from."</p>
<p>At the start of the month, FromSoftware stated that "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords" would be on the way, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">duo mode is coming "at a later date"</a>. Even before this, though, dataminers discovered game files for new phases of each Nightlord encounter, so this update was very much expected.</p>
<p>What wasn't expected, perhaps, was the weekly cycle of these encounters. It's a smart live service-esque twist to keep players coming back regularly and exactly what the game needs to extend its longevity.</p>
<p>Once all the Nightlords are defeated, the only reason to return is to complete Remembrances with each character. This may not be attractive enough for some, so seeing the beginning of regular updates is a welcome addition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC is also on the way</a>, although it's unknown what this will include. Would a Bloodborne pack of returning bosses be too much to ask?</p>
<p>The Everdark Sovereign version of Adel, Baron of the Night is available from today, 19th June until 26th June at 1:59am UK time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. It's "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-kart-world-was-made-with-a-much-larger-workforce.1222818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-was-made-with-a-much-larger-workforce/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that Mario Kart World is the most important launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2. Not only is it the only new game (no, the Welcome Tour definitely doesn't count) made by Nintendo for the launch lineup, it's also the sequel to one of the best-selling games ever. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, at last count, has sold nearly 70 million units on the original Switch.</p>
<p>Whether Mario Kart World can match it with similar success remains to be seen over a long period of time. Still, the early reception is promising. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game earned an 8.5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch, who wrote:</p>
<p><em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em></p>
<p>Making the new open world-style game required a much larger workforce, though. Japanese analyst Papen (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mario-kart-world-had-a-significantly-larger-dev-team-than-past-entries-with-art-related-positions-increasing-threefold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Automaton</a>) has looked into the headcount, discovering that around 300 developers worked on Mario Kart World, compared to 163 on MK8 Deluxe. That shows how Nintendo is following the market trend in this regard, with larger and inevitably more expensive teams making bigger games.</p>
<p>The biggest increase was in the art department, which tripled in size from one game to another. Furthermore, like most of the gaming industry nowadays, Nintendo leveraged several development teams beyond Nintendo EPD, such as Monolith Soft, Bandai Namco, Imagica Geeq, and 1-Up Studio. This could go some way to explaining why Mario Kart World was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infamously priced at $80</a>.</p>
<p>Did you purchase the game alongside the Nintendo Switch 2? If so, please comment below with your impressions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/capcom-spotlight-set-for-next-week-featuring-re9-pragmata-mhw-and-sf6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new CAPCOM Spotlight livestream has been announced this morning by the Japanese publisher. It will air on Thursday, June 26, at 3 PM Pacific Time (6 PM Eastern time, 11 PM GMT, midnight CET) on CAPCOM's YouTube channels. It's expected to last around 40 minutes, featuring news and updates on both upcoming games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-sgf-2025-hands-off-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRAGMATA</a>) and existing games (Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6).</p>
<p>The first two are those more likely to gain interest from fans. CAPCOM has shown them off during this year's Summer Game Fest, and our envoy, Kai Tatsumoto, checked both. Here are a couple of quotes from his previews:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Much of the Resident Evil Requiem demo was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time. PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that CAPCOM has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal five years ago today. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="(Teaser) Capcom Spotlight | 6.26.2025" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uC18vWzk8u8?feature=oembed" width="740" height="416" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, many CAPCOM fans still play Monster Hunter Wilds and Street Fighter 6. The latter game has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announced-street-fighter-6-has-surpassed-5-million-copies-sold-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 5 million sales milestone.

            <p>When the tragically half-empty hooch barrel of potential that was Capone 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/empire-of-sin">Empire Of Sin</a> launched back in late 2020, it also sold a pass pledging two story expansions down the line. The first of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/empire-of-sins-first-dlc-and-major-free-update-launch-november-18th">arrived in 2021</a>. Time and more time passed, prompting a union of shaking fists to wave grubby promissory notes scrawled on diner hamburger wrappers and brace themselves for a trampling by the proverbial Pinkerton agents on horseback of continued disappointment. Despite this, that second DLC never materialised.</p>
<p>Do not fear the sound you hear. The Pinkerton's have not found you - it is simply the heavy clopping of legal obligations being grudgingly fulfilled. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Hunt For Aurora is now available</a>, assuming there's anyone left with the energy to avail it.</p>

<p>Romero Games haven't returned for this one. It's been developed by Moonmana, of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628460/Ultimate_pirates/">shonky Pirate MMO fame</a>. The DLC centres around new boss Robin Kray and partner Sylvia Taylor trying to nab "the Aurora diamond". I don't know much about diamonds aside from the absurd onslaught of 60's marketing that popularised the engagement ring, and the capitalisation prompted me to look up the Aurora, although the most interesting piece of information I came away with is that "Fancy" is an actual proper grading term, which I enjoy quite a bit. Nevertheless, "crime friends want shiny rock" feels like a worthy enough setup.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303314/Empire_of_Sin__Hunt_For_Aurora/">Steam has to say</a> about Hunt For Aurora.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>New Boss:</strong> Robin Kray</li>
<li><strong>New Side Character:</strong> Sylvia Taylor</li>
<li><strong>New Gangster Class:</strong> Vanguard (melee and versatile combat builds)</li>
<li><strong>New Racket:</strong> Dance Clubs</li>
<li><strong>Lucky Companion:</strong> A loyal dog with uncanny good luck</li>
<li><strong>Arsenal Expansion:</strong> High-power Prototype Pistol, Plains Rifle, Model 21 Shotgun, M1886 Sniper Fusil, Irma Submachine Gun, MP 28 Submachine Gun, and Brn. Vz. 26 Machine Gun</li>
<li><strong>6 deadly melee weapons:</strong> P1907, Hooked Quillon Bayonet, 10'' Chef’s Knife, Hunting Knife, Balisong, and Fish Knife</li>
<li><strong>4 New Mission Chains:</strong> Dive into 14 missions in total!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I haven't played Empire Of Sin for a very long time. If you have, can you please let me know if there's likely to be a tangible difference between the Chef's Knife and the Fish Knife?</p>
<p>I chatted to Romero Games back in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-empire-of-sins-new-updates-are-adding-more-strategy-more-drama-and-truth-thats-stranger-than-fiction">2021 about the future of Empire Of Sin</a>, following a huge patch. I'd be very interested to learn the full story of how the game was effectively abandoned, because Brenda and the team sounded very motivated at the time.</p></div>

<figure><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6751a32c7063/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released a bunch of free Switch updates alongside the launch of the Switch 2 earlier this month but one issue that wasn't entirely resolved was tied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Nintendo was only able to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-switch-2-updates-for-multiple-first-party-switch-games-are-now-available">"partially" alleviate an issue</a> which occured when playing the game on the Switch 2, and the "entire screen" would flicker in several scenes. It mentioned in the previous patch notes how a fix was on the way, and today it's seemingly delivered on this promise with the Version 1.1.3 game update:</p>
<h2>Pikmin 3 Deluxe: Ver. 1.1.3 (Released June 16, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>The following updates have been made when playing the game on Nintendo Switch 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurs when playing on Nintendo Switch 2 where the entire screen will briefly turn off and on again in several scenes of the game, such as at the beginning and end of a day.</li>
<li>Several adjustments have been made to improve gameplay on Nintendo Switch 2.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how this particular problem has <em>not</em> been resolved in the Pikmin 3 Deluxe Demo, but a fix for this will be distributed alongside a full game update at some point in the future.</p>
<p>These are the only updates Pikmin 3 Deluxe has received for the Switch 2 so far and if there are any upgrades released, we'll let you know. Pikmin 3 is marked on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played">backwards compatibility list of games</a> with issues that have "been resolved, or are planned to be resolved by an update".</p>
<p>This follows on from an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

Unless you're mega lucky, of course.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">10: Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h2><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223150"><div id="223150" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR is considered the main chase card of Journey Together, it's quite affordable now. Due to the overhype surrounding this set and scalpers not being able to get the same astronomical amounts for it, this card soon crashed to around the $150 mark. It's a gorgeous card and a no brainer decision for your binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9: Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223151"><div id="223151" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Moltres ex - 229/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How can anyone not love this card? It's got action, stunning detail and eye popping color that represents the Team Rocket vibe of Destined Rivals perfectly. It's a beast in battle too, with Flame Screen doing 110 damage whilst reducing damage from the opposing Pokémon by 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Evil Incineration allows trainers to discard a Team Rocket's Energy in order to immidiately discard an opposing active Pokémon and all attached card. Play this right and it could turn battles on their heads, especially because its a basic Pokémon, so it can be built up straight away on a trainers bench without evolution mechanics getting in the way. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">8: Latias ex - 239/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223152"><div id="223152" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Latias ex - 239/191</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sharing a dual artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKgqVj?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Latios Illustration Rare</a>, Latais ex is holding it's value of nearly $200 and is an absolute stunner playing on a sunset background with Latios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's ability allows you to switch out basic Pokémon to hit swiftly with Eon blade, which does 200 damage and stops it from attacking next turn. All trainers need to do is survive the next turn and switch out with another Pokémon for free. Rinse and repeat, love to see it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7: Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223153"><div id="223153" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roaring Moon ex - 162/131</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Roaring Moon ex SIR has held it's value out of the gate since Prismatic Evolutions dropped, which is frankly amazing. The linework in this card is ridiculously intricate, giving it that cave painting vibe that goes well with ancient Pokémon found deep in Area Zero, Paldea. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a cool moment too, seeing Roaring Moon seemingly escaping some sort of cosmic calamity. The more you look at it the better it gets.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6: Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223154"><div id="223154" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia's Garchomp ex - 232/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm calling Destined Rivals as the best Scarlet and Violet set for it sheer amount of detailed and expresive artwork, and Cynthia's Garchomp ex SIR is a fantastic example of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With calls to the Pokémon League in the early anime (See the fire lamps at the top of the stadium) and big screen behind trainers on platforms, Garchomp can be seen lunging forward and breaking ground as it goes. Amazing card and well worth the money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5: Pikachu ex - 238/191</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223035"><div id="223035" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pikachu ex - 238/191</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $289.86</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikachu ex SIR is partially to blame for the Pokémon TCG boom that kicked off at the end of October 2024 and is still going today. After peaking at $485 at the end of 2024, it's finally stabalized at a much for reasonable $295 at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a good time to snap it up, if you've got the cash, but the amount of nostalgia and detailed yet soft artwork on this card will make it climb back up as we move away from the Scarlet and Violet era over the years to come. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4: Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223155"><div id="223155" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ethan's Ho-Oh ex - 230/182</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was one of my main chase cards from Destined Rivals, just look at it. Not only have we got mental amounts of nostalgia for Pokémon Gold and Silver OGs, but it reminds me so much of the first ever episode of Pokémon when Ho-Oh was revealed for the first time (which was before Pokémon Gold and Silver released). It's a stunning illustration that means so much to plenty of trainers, and I half expected the $300 market value before release.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3: Greninja ex - 214/167</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223034"><div id="223034" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Greninja ex - 214/167</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $288.31</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Greninja ex SIR is my favorite in this article as I have it graded in a 10 and I'm being completely bias. Joking aside (I'm not) but this is one of the best artworks outside of Prismatic Evolutions in the Scarlet and Violet era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twilight Masquerade was a slept on set in my opinion, but the chances of pulling this are stacked. If you have the money upfront, i'd put it into this card instead of trying to rip packs. But I also obviously hate having fun, so the choice is yours.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2: Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223038"><div id="223038" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex - 231/182 </h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $378.76</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What a beast of a card! Mewtwo ex SIR captured that Mewtwo's Revenge energy so hard, immense amounts of nostalgia in this card for me. It looks like everyone agrees considering it's currently over $450. Destined Rivals cards are up and down day after day, so no doubt we'll see this settle at a cheaper pricepoint before it crossed the vintage checkpoint in years to come.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1: Umbreon ex - 161/131</h2></div><div catalogid="2f8c71b9-ea28-4296-a154-d2c4107f9496" id="223040"><div id="223040" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Umbreon ex - 161/131</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Current Market Value: $1,162.95</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We always knew it was going to be insanely priced, and we needed a cheaper Umbreon chase card after <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/246723/pokemon-swsh07-evolving-skies-umbreon-vmax-alternate-art-secret?page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Umbreon VMAX (Moonbreon)</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Granted, it's still a mental market price, and over $1,000. But it won't get cheaper solely because it's<a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxJx?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Umbreon</a> and almost anything linked to this dark type Eeveelution holds it's value, trust me on this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're brave enough to drop $1,000 on Prismatic Eeveelutions boosters, or even this card standalone, I salute your efforts, and your bank account.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions: Even More Eeveelutions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The money in Prismatic Evolution chase cards is insane, and it always will be, which is why the rest of the Eeveelutions need a dedicated section to themselves! These could've dominated the whole article, otherwise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon ex SIR</a> is a stunner, but I always prefer seeing Pokémon cards with a bit of movement and action in them. I have to say though, the ornate ice patterns and overall terastalisation of <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yP?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glaceon</a> is dipicted so well. It's also one of the less eye-wateringly expensive Eeveelution cards from Prismatic Evolutions at the minute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping up the trend is one of my favorites, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3G1yR?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jolteon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions. There's been some banger Jolteon Cards in the past, for me that would be <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/264213/pokemon-swsh09-brilliant-stars-trainer-gallery-jolteon?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon from the Brilliant Stars Trainer Gallery</a> and the <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/253418/pokemon-swsh-sword-and-shield-promo-cards-jolteon-v-swsh183?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolteon V Sword and Shield Promo Card</a>, but this one has unlimited energy. Just look at how expressive this card is, perfectly showcasing Jolteons speed and agility with one of the coolest backgrounds i've seen in a Pokémon card. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cell shading mixed with comic book artstyle of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAxmp?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vaporeon ex SIR</a> from Prismatic Evolutions is a stunner. Just look at how light is captured in every drop of water and crystal. Plus I think this is one of the cutest depictions of this water-type Eeveelution we've had for some time. Absolute banger of a card and would do a flip terribly if I pulled this beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another beautiful pastel artwork with <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWM4r?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Espeon ex SIR</a>. On top of Espeon being a fan favorite, it's easy to see why this card is now over $300. I've never seen that many shades of purple in such a small space before, such a stunning piece of art, imagine pulling this, getting a 10 then getting it in your slabbed collection? Stuff of dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love me a good woodblock print, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL8MYX?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Leafeon ex SIR</a> gives me massive tradition Japanese art vibes. The bold colours, thick lines and the overall beauty of this makes it worth the price tag.Verdant storm for   a grass and colourless energy can be devestating too, 60 x damage for every energy attached to all of your opponents Pokémon. Lethal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's such a shame Fairy typing didn't come back for <a href="https://zdcs.link/znx5ej?object_uuid=ae948c6d-f4c6-49f6-ab91-b545c3b5f3c2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Sylveon ex SIR</a>, because I can't think of a more Fairy type Pokémon card ever. It's another stunner with a cute stance and a pastel color pallete that just makes it. There's that much pink it just works, a fantastic card and its easy to see why it's over $400, especially as it's one of the most popular Eeveelutions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9207bed9c7d34/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has rolled out a new system firmware update today for the Switch 2 and original model which bumps the hybrid family of devices up to Version 20.1.5.</p>
<p>This update officially kicks off the Switch 2's life with a stability update, but nothing else is revealed in these patch notes. This follows on from Version 20.1.1 which was released earlier this month and contained some minor fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown of the latest system update, courtesy of Nintendo's support page:</p>
<h3><a id="current" name="current">Ver. 20.1.5 (Released June 18, 2025)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1935542554642051512">Dataminer 'OatmealDome'</a> suggests trying out any games that may have had issues to see how they're performing on this new firmware:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm currently seeing reports that 20.1.5 fixes some Switch 1 games that previously didn't work on the Switch 2. If you have any problematic games, try them after updating!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is anything significant going on behind the scenes of this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>If you're not prompted to update your system, you can manually enter the system settings from the home menu on the Switch and Switch 2 to perform this update. You then navigate to the "system" option and perform a "system update" from here.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also been updating many of its games over the past week, including its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
