		<p>Awaken Realms has revealed its next project and it is a maritime based narrative RPG called Tides of Blazefall. You are a sea captain who has forgotten their identity and is sailing the Forlorn Sea of Evershade to discover its secrets. You are not alone though as the Masks, voices in your head, accompany you, and try to influence your choices.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Blazefall - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qtbn4-SYFKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Masks do not just advise and try to influence your decisions, but have a direct influence on your battle strategy. The cards that you use in battle are directly influenced by the Masks, so if you are allied with one in particular it will be their cards that make up the deck. As a ship captain you can’t sail the Forlorn Sea alone, so you are able to recruit crewmembers that can provide upgrades to the ship, which are going to be needed as you navigate the waves, storms, and unexpected events.</p>
<p>Exploring the open sea and making choices that shape the narrative of Tides of Blazefall are not the only things you do. You need a home base where your ship can find safety, so you are also tasked with turning a derelict pier into a proper stronghold from where you can take up new quests and get even better ships to make it easier to search the seas. A demo for Tides of Blazefall will go live on February 23rd, and it will include 30+ minutes of gameplay, 30+ pages of text,&nbsp;11 masks defining your character’s traits, 20+ cards, 5 followers, 3 player ships, 6 different duels and one artifact.</p>

<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Tides of Blazefall, and the game has only been confirmed for PC at this time.</p>

<figure data-uuid="16f4b2ee5310b"><a title="Absolum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/16f4b2ee5310b/absolum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Right on schedule, Dotemu, Guard Crush Games, and Supamonks have dropped a big free update for the excellent roguelite beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>. And alongside some brand new gameplay modes and run-changing updates, we've got a swathe up bug fixes, character balance tweaks, and more.</p>
<p>We've covered the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/absolums-first-free-content-update-arrives-next-month">Threads of Fate update previously</a>, but it's worth reminding yourself what's included. Mystic Ordeals are a brand new way to embark on runs, which add modifiers and challenges. Corrupted Biomes replace the Rifts system, optional areas within zones that yield great rewards. The Soul Tree has gained new rewards like Elite mounts and additional character skins. And a new "devilish ambush" in the Forest biome.</p>
<p>On top of the new content, the devs have also rebalanced each of the four characters, made a few regional tweaks, and tweaked some enemy AI.</p>

                  Blizzard is bringing in a lot of new players with its new season, so here’s a few tips to get back in the swing of things
                </p><div>
              
              <p><span>Some of us </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><span>never stopped playing </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a><span>, but many players have come and gone as the hero shooter has had its ups and downs over the past decade. With Blizzard essentially </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>rebooting the game</span></a><span> by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from the title</span></a><span>, restructuring its seasonal rollout to incorporate story, and adding five new heroes, a lot of folks are coming back to see what all the fuss is about. But if you’ve been gone for a while or you’re straight up new to the game, there’s a lot you may have missed out on or don’t know about how to play the hero shooter. Well, the intricacies of </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>are impossible to break down in one blog alone, but I can give you at least a few tips on how to get (back) into the swing of things.</span></p>

 <h2><b>A quick breakdown of each game mode</b></h2> <p><span>Whether you’re playing in Quick Play, ranked modes, or something in the casual arcade menu, </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> has several modes of play determined by which map you’re on. The objective usually just requires you to hold space for longer than your opponent or escort something across the map, but the rules of each of them change depending on which mode you’re playing. Some of these have been in the game since launch, while others have been added over the course of the past few years. Here’s a quick summary of each:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Control – This is a King of the Hill style deathmatch mode in which two teams fight for control of a designated area on the map. When one team has maintained dominance for an allotted time, they win the round. These matches are a best of three, and each round takes place on a different map within the same region.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Escort – This mode has one team trying to move a payload from one side of the map to the other, with the enemy team attempting to block their progress. The payload only moves if players on the attacking team are touching it, and if the defending team manages to fight them off the payload and stay on it for a few seconds, it will slowly start to backtrack, resetting the opposition’s progress. Matches can go into overtime after the time limit runs out as long as the attacking team maintains control of the payload.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Flashpoint – If Control didn’t make you enter a loading screen and a new spawn each round, it would look like Flashpoint. These maps are the biggest in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, and the best-of-five matches will have you and your team running across long distances to reach each objective point and fight over it against your opponents.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Hybrid – These maps are essentially a mashup of Control and Escort. You’ll start defending or attacking one point, and if the attacking team wins, a payload is revealed that must be escorted to the end of the map.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Push – The first mode that was added in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is a bit of a tug-of-war, with both teams trying to escort a robot that pushes two barricades across the map. Which one he pushes depends on which team has the upper hand, so it’s basically a custody battle for the push bot as you both fight over his allegiance until the match ends, either because one barricade has reached the end of its path or because time ran out, at which point whichever barricade has been pushed further determines the winner. If the team that’s currently losing has control of the bot when the clock runs out, the match will go into overtime and they’ll have a chance to push their barricade as long as they maintain control.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Clash – These maps are some of the most straightforward in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, as they have two teams fighting over objectives and gradually progressing further onto one side of the map or the other depending on who wins each round. The first team to capture five points wins, regardless of where on the map the fight has ended up.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Those are all the standard ways of playing; we’ll get to one other major pillar of the game later.</span></p> <h2><b>Yes, you can still play 6v6 without role lock</b></h2> <p><span>Some folks who haven’t played </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>in a hot minute might not realize that the classic 6v6 open queue is still in the game, and has been for a long time. The standard way of playing </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has pivoted to a 5v5 “role lock” mode that requires a team composition of one tank, two DPS, and two support, but back in the day, the game supported 12 players at once, and didn’t require you to play specific roles. Both of these modes are available in both quick play and competitive ranked modes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000006306" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000006306"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000006306">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>How map voting works</b></h2> <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has map voting now, but it’s not a majority vote win sort of deal. At the beginning of each match, both teams can vote for one of three maps, and every vote gives each map more chances to get picked on a roulette wheel. As a result, it’s entirely possible that one person may vote for a map against nine other players and it still wins out. I suppose if it were a majority rule we’d only play on the same handful of favorites so this is probably the best approach, even if it means we get comical moments in which one person’s vote decides the fate of the entire lobby.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t be afraid to lose your Perks and swap</b></h2> <p><span>One of the biggest gameplay changes that’s been made since the days of standard </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is the addition of Perks. These are branching upgrades you’ll pick throughout a match that modify and upgrade your base abilities. Each hero has bespoke changes, so there’s no blanket “make my bullets do more damage” or “give me a ton of overhealth.” The tweaks have been patched in and out a few times over the past year, though, so don’t get too comfortable with the ones you like.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Since they take time to charge up, you might be hesitant to swap to another hero after you’ve already sunk so much time into one. Well, get out of that mindset quick. Perk charge speeds grow faster the longer a match has gone on, so you can unlock them much more quickly for a character you’ve swapped into in the final push than for one you came out of spawn playing at the beginning. Also, if you change your mind, you can swap back to the hero you were using before and you’ll still have all those Perks unlocked and equipped. So don’t feel obligated to commit to a character just because you’ve already leveled them up.</span></p>

 <h2><b>If you’re overwhelmed by the amount of heroes, try someone simple out first</b></h2> <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has a staggering 50 heroes now, with another five planned for the next five seasons. If you’re new here, it might be worth starting with someone simple before you jump into the more elaborate kits. You can’t really go wrong with a lot of the OGs. Soldier: 76 is the sort of baseline “shooter guy” with an assault rifle and a sprint. Reinhardt is a big tanky guy with a shield and that’s pretty straightforward. And if you’re a returning player, don’t be afraid to just jump in with your old fave. You’re just getting back into the swing of things, no need to overwhelm yourself trying to figure out how all of Wuyang or Kiriko’s bullshit works.</span></p> <h2><b>It’s going to take time to learn all the ways heroes synergize</b></h2> <p><span>The 50-hero roster can look intimidating, and if you haven’t touched </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>in years, you probably won’t recognize half of them. Between each of them there are hundreds of interactions you might not know or understand, so it’s better to focus on a hero you jive with and learn about the rest of the roster through interacting with and and countering them first. I started as a Soldier: 76 main and gradually started memorizing how other heroes work by just seeing them in a match and using context clues. Definitely take some time to try everyone out in the practice range, but don’t feel like you’ve gotta know the intricacies of everyone before you queue up.</span></p> <h2><b>If you’ve got friends who play, lean on them</b></h2> <p><span>One of the best resources a person can have for getting back into </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is a friend who’s been playing and knows their shit. I’ve been coaching some of my returning friends through changes on the fly in the middle of matches, and that takes some of the trial and error out of countering or avoiding certain heroes. I guarantee you any friend who has been playing </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>solo for the past few years has been waiting for a chance to play with you again, so hit them up and form a five-stack.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005813" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005813"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005813">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Stadium is for the sickos</b></h2> <p><span>One of the game modes we haven’t touched on yet is Stadium. This was added last year, and it’s one of the most complex modes in all of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>. Its matches are the longest of any mode in the game, and it has two teams facing off in a series of quick rounds while players buildcraft and fundamentally change up their heroes’ playstyles in ways more far-reaching than Perks. If you aren’t a person who likes upgrading skill trees, crunching numbers, and committing to a hero for a whole game because you can’t switch, Stadium is absolutely not the game you should play when you’re just coming back to </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>. I love it and I barely even play it because it’s such a time commitment, so work your way up to that if it’s something you might be interested in.</span></p> <h2><b>Mythic skins are expensive, but you can unlock them for cheap</b></h2> <p><span>When you pop over to the Shop tab, you’ll see a standard page with a bunch of cosmetics you can pay real money for, but you’ll also see the Mythic shop. Here, you’ll find customizable skins and weapons for specific heroes that you buy with a specialized currency called Mythic Prisms. They cost a whole lot of money, but there is a cheaper way to unlock these prisms and that’s through the premium battle pass. Completing any given season’s battle pass will net you enough of this currency to buy one Mythic skin at no additional cost. So if you’re keeping up with the battle passes, you can collect all of these without forking over any additional real cash. And if you’ve missed one you want, hang tight; they rotate in and out of the shop every season.</span></p>

 <h2><b>There are better story recaps than the one in the game</b></h2> <p><span>With the big emphasis on lore and story moving forward, all future </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>story content from motion comics, cinematics, and short stories will be found in the game itself in the Story menu. However, if you haven’t been paying attention to the story as it’s developed for the past decade, know that the in-game summary is absolute dog water. It touches on a few major plot beats, such as the rise and fall of Overwatch, but there’s a whole lot of context, characters, and content missing. You’re better off finding summaries on YouTube about everything you’ve missed or, better yet, reading and watching it all yourself, as most of it is </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/media/"><span>readily available online for free</span></a><span>. A lot of the more recent stuff is available as audio dramas on YouTube, usually read by one of the game’s stellar voice actors.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665015">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>No, you can’t buy lootboxes</b></h2> <p><span>If you weren’t part of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s community at the time, you might have been confused as to why fans were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-loot-boxes-season-15-skins-cosmetics-1851762971"><span>excited for loot boxes to return last year</span></a><span>. Well, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans liked these not because of the gambling aspect, but because they were a free way to unlock cosmetics rather than throwing cash into the game’s expensive shop. Nowadays, you can’t buy these outright, so the gambling part is no longer part of the equation. Instead, you unlock them through progressing the battle pass, participating in events, and completing daily and weekly challenges. The new season included a refresh of what you can find in the loot boxes as well, so there are plenty of new skins that were once available in the shop that can pop out of these.</span></p> <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>can be a lot, and the key to getting into the game is finding ways to not overwhelm yourself with all the sensory overload of content and characters it offers. Take it slow, grab a friend or two, and pick a hero who you’re comfortable feeling your way through it all with. The game is at its best when your third eye opens and you can predict, strategize, and execute cool plays by pure instinct, and you’ll never get that far if you don’t take the first step. I’ll see y’all at Watchpoint Gibraltar. </span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/luna-abyss-preview-a-grimdark-bullet-hell-fps-that-ramps-up-in-challenge</link>
            <guid>1434046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are quite a few modern first-person shooters taking notes from the bullet hell arcade games from yesteryear. Games like BPM or  Deadzone Rogue throw walls of projectiles and fodder enemies at you, and demand you thread yourself through them like a gun-toting needle to return fire without getting obliterated. Luna Abyss joins these ranks but certainly stirs the formula up a bit. When we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luna-abyss-is-a-movement-first-bullet-hell-fps-set-in-a-space-prison">took a look at the first level of gloomy sci-fi shooter</a> a couple of years ago, we saw just enough to get intrigued by the potential quivering in the crimson glow between all of its shadows. Now that we’ve gotten our hands on a bit more, being introduced to a new weapon, movement mechanics, and a killer boss fight, I can safely say that the optimism was justified.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Warm-Up Round</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I was dropped right back into Sorrow’s Canyon, a prison colony with the most accurate name in the universe. The grimy metal halls, scaffoldings, and makeshift walkways made out of piping mixed with occasional stone floors and weird  organic growths all give a sort of Chronicles of Riddick, grim dark gothic energy. Giger-esque, without all of the phallic stuff. It certainly doesn't matter what anyone was actually doing in a place like this before our hero, Fawkes, wakes up in an open coffin, finds a nifty gun, and starts shooting them all, because most of the things that move around down here that aren’t you are mindless husks who want to destroy you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Luna Abyss Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The almost sardonically chummy tone in which the sudden guiding voice in Fawkes’ ear, Aylin, takes with her charge does help add a bit of texture to what comes off as a pretty standard “everything here sucks and is bad” aesthetic. Most people, likely including her, would rather not be trapped here, but she is dangerously close to sounding like she’s having something that resembles fun, and that does make me want to know what this world is hiding, at the very least. It sits in contrast with the only other non-enemy character you meet in the demo, The Waif, who gives guidance in solemn riddles like a depressed Tom Bombadil.</p><p>Then I played the new additional mission from further into the game and...yeah, Luna Abyss might be cooking with gas.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gliding from room to room, strafing gracefully through enemy fire and returning with blasts of your own is a breezy process, thanks to the aim function that auto locks to the enemy closest to your crosshairs, letting you focus more on the moving than the aiming. I liked this at first, taking the mental load off of trying to line up shots while gliding from cover to cover helps you focus on defense. But as the encounters progressed, the challenge didn’t really follow suit. Skull-faced drones chased me around the room while floating eyeballs fired from floating perches, but things didn’t get anywhere near too hairy to deal with in the canyon.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Water Begins to Simmer</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I found a second weapon, a shotgun that specialized in shutting down gleaming blue shields, and some nuance and complexity started to reveal itself. Some enemies now were cloaked in these barriers, which had to be shattered by the shotgun before doing damage to them directly. Now I was sliding from cover to cover, switching back and forth between weapons to make certain enemies vulnerable while trying not to overstay my welcome in any one spot for too long. That auto lock feature began to make more sense, but still, I found getting to the end of the Canyon to be a pretty tame experience. I know this was the extent of the original demo, and I can see walking away from this feeling tepid about what the future could hold for this goth-person shooter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I played the new additional mission from further into the game and yeah, Luna Abyss might be cooking with gas.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Full Boil</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scourge Crater is a snowy, craggy mountain face with floating platforms and a heaping helping of sunlight and sky. There are a lot of floating bits of rock and far away platforms that put Fawkes’ new double jump and air dash to great use. Theres no real indication to what has happened to Fawkes between the Canyon and now to give them these powers, likw the ability to execute low health enemies to regain health, but I don’t necessarily require exposition every time theres an opportunity to do something badass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't take long to find a new weapon, a long ranged rifle that does big damage,  but overheats in just a handful of shots (unlike your standard gun or shotgun that you can squeak many more rounds out of before havin g to cool it down). New enemies come with it, like some floating bundles of death that explode when touched, or a larger, scarier eyeball creature with its one big single-shot laser. This new weapon comes with a new color of shield to dispatch, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When we get off to the races, moving from little island to little island, staying fast on the trigger for the new enemies that pop up at a brisk pace, and staying on top of what the necessary weapon to take them down with was the faster-paced slobberknocker I was looking for. It’s not quite Doom-levels of expressive combat – every enemy there has a best weapon to kill them with but not necessarily a “correct” weapon, leaving room to flex however you see fit. But the limited offensive options are balanced with the sometimes overwhelming need for defensive finesse. At its best, every plan has a window of time where it will be most effective before you have to regroup and try something else, like dipping behind a pillar of rock to wait out a big beam, knowing that a handful of bomb drones are well on their way to clear you out of cover with a bang.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveling through this stage between combat introduced some environmental movement tricks as well, like boost gates that launch you when you dash through them, or weird flovating balloons that you can possess, jumping inside them to get a view from their perspective before erupting out of them to continue the climb. There's a cool, if not a little garish, moment a little over midway through the wintry crater where you can actually possess a Goliath, some sort of giant minigun wielding monstrosity that can mow down a small battalion of enemies with ease. Though this level kept things pretty simple, I like the potential of Luna Abyss using possession in conjunction with air dashing and double jumps for some good platforming puzzles – or even in combat scenarios.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Eye of the Beholder</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The rowdiest and most difficult combat in the entire demo was against the level-ending boss, a big eyeball monster in the style of a Dungeons and Dragons Beholder by way of Dark City. It stayed in the center, relentlessly firing walls of bullets (and occasionally lasers) making it tough to find the space to take advantage of how exposed it was. Phases where it is invulnerable and you need to deal with how to fix that change the pace up well, at first its juvst breaking the connection between power points in the walls that are blasting it with an impenetrable shield, but eventually it’s surviving waves of enemies and long stanzas of incoming fire, etc. At its busiest, it almost felt a bit like Housemarque’s excellent Returnal, but in a smaller arena. I can only hope Luna Abyss’s combat can crescendo like this for all of its boss fights.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With some patience for its soft-touch opening minutes, I found myself very on board with the Luna Abyss’s brand of crowded screen shoot-em up. It’s thick with moody vibes, which can be more than just a good backdrop for the action. And don’t let that auto targeting aim get you complacent, because when the more blustery bad guys turn up the heat, you won’t have aiming as an excuse as to why surviving the onslaught takes you multiple respawns. If the gunplay and platforming can evolve further, as it did between these two demo levels, then I can’t wait to stare into the Abyss when it opens wide sometime this year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/luna-abyss-preview-a-grimdark-bullet-hell-fps-that-ramps-up-in-challenge]]></content:encoded>

Back when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lil-gator-game">Lil Gator Game</a> arrived in the forgotten year of 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lil-gator-game-review">it received RPS' coveted Bestest Bests badge</a> because, well, it was just so darn delightful! And in the years since, developer MegaWobble have been tinkering away at a seemingly Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom influenced bit of DLC. Which, as it just so happens, has just been released today!
</p>
<p>
For the intrepid adventurer who knows no fear, this DLC, titled In the Dark, sees the titular gator head into an entirely underground - and still wonderfully whimsical looking - underground area that apparently doubles the size of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a>. That's good to hear too, as the original was a touch short, so it's nice to have an even bigger playground to romp around in. Much like Tears of the Kingdom, it appears that each of the new underground areas have an underground counterpart, like one where there's a giant tree above ground, and its lengthy roots below.

<p>
There's also a few new items to find, like a gymnastic ribbon that allows for double jumps. A few new weapons appear to have been added in too, like a lance that lets you dash forward in the air, and a pickaxe for busting up boulders. You'll of course find some other very friendly critters to help out, although there'll be some troublesome teens - such as a pig called Darklord and a bear called Ruth, which doesn't feel particularly proportionate - to contend with this time round.
</p><p>
The DLC is also at a nice healthy 30% off until February 26th, which certainly isn't anything to complain about in this economy. So, if you're looking for an injection of something just a bit lovely, you can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3205060/Lil_Gator_Game_In_the_Dark/">here</a>.

		<p>Dotemu, Guard Crush, and Supamonks have announced the release of Absolum’s major 1.1 update, titled Threads of Fate, with this update bringing new features to the game. The headline features include Mystic Ordeals, which are modifiers that can alternate runs, and Corrupted Biomes which are more dangerous areas of a map but promise better rewards than if you choose to avoid them. There are also new skins, emotes, and upgrade mounts as part of the Absolum 1.1 update.</p>

            <guid>1433980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has just reported its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors">third-quarter financial results</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, which covers the last three months of 2025, ending right at the end of the year on December 31, 2025. This is an important distinction to make, only because these results do not include all of the layoffs and restructuring that happened at the start of this year when the company announced its "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>This means that Ubisoft went forward with its plan to reorganize the entire structure of the company and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">layoff hundreds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">workers across</a> multiple of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">its global branches</a> and its own <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">headquarters in Paris</a> while the company was actually doing well on paper. The company reported <strong>double-digit growth</strong> in the quarter, with net bookings coming in at <strong>€338 million,</strong> a <strong>12% increase</strong> from the third quarter of its previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>It was the "<em>overperformance</em>" of the <strong>Assassin's Creed </strong>franchise that drove the increase, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-hands-on/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong> and <strong>The Division</strong> helping push the increase behind it. Its new historical sim, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></strong>, was able to deliver net bookings that outpaced its predecessor, <strong>Anno 1800</strong>. Though its only major live service title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/">Rainbow Six Siege</a></strong>, did not exceed or fall below expectations, it simply landed where Ubisoft thought it would, which Ubisoft partially attributes to a "<em>particularly crowded</em>" first-person shooter market.</p>



<p>"<em>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations</em>," said Ubisoft chief executive officer and the guy who recently installed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">his son in one of the company's highest-ranking positions</a>, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>. "<em>This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players</em>."</p>



<p>Guillemot went on to say that the company is "<em>making progress on the transformation announced in January</em>," with key positions within the new structure still being filled, with some of the roles set to be filled by <em>"external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans</em>." Which sounds exactly like <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">the kinds of people they lost</a> in this restructuring, either through layoffs or <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">individuals looking towards greener pastures</a>.</p>



<p>The one bit of forward-looking news we got was that the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/">The Division Resurgence</a></strong> is set to be revealed "<em>soon</em>," according to the report, with no mention of the long-rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></strong> remake/remaster, or anything else coming up from the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

The 2025 models of <strong>Acer’s Predator Helios Neo 16S</strong> and the <strong>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</strong> are hundreds off, although it’s the model with the bigger screen that is currently the cheaper of the two. The sale on the Neo 16S will expire at the end of the day, while the Zephyrus G14 discount will likely be available through President’s Day.</p><p>Starting with the popular Zephyrus G14, which has a 3K resolution Pantone-validated OLED that can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate, you can get a high-end configuration at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white%2FJJGGLHJXQ9" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $1,899.99, down from its original price of $2,399.99. In addition to great screen specs, it has AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor — one of the fastest available on a laptop — plus Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 12GB of VRAM, 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM clocked at 8,000MHz and a 1TB SSD. This model is ideal for those who want to be able to play any 2026 title at great frame rates without any (or many) compromises to visual fidelity.</p><p>For context on the price, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white%2FJJGGLH72GT" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> is offering the step-down configuration for $100 less, with a slightly worse CPU, a significantly less capable GPU (the RTX 5060), and half the RAM. You’re getting a lot of extra power with the discounted model at $1,899.99.</p><p>The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S is bigger and has a larger OLED screen, yet on the whole it’s still fairly thin for a gaming laptop. And, it starts at $1,469.99, down from $1,899.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Facer-predator-helios-neo-16s-ai-gaming-laptop-16-oled-240hz-intel-core-ultra-9-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070ti-32gb-1tb-obsidian-black%2FJJ8V8H38XT" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. It has comparable specs to the Zephyrus G14 — a capable processor in the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, the RTX 5070 Ti, 32GB of DDR5 6,400MHz RAM, a 1TB SSD — but its 16-inch screen is slightly lower res at 2560 x 1600 (albeit with a 240Hz refresh rate) versus 2880 x 1800 in the Zephyrus G14. Either way, you’ve got two great potential upgrades to consider.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/878209/asus-acer-oled-rtx-5070ti-gaming-laptop-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

For me it’s an <em>Armored Core 6</em> expansion or, better yet, an entirely new standalone game.</p>

 <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> makes so much god damn money</h2> <p>Parent company Hasbro <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial">revealed in its earnings this week</a> that<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> raked in $1.7 billion in revenue in 2025. That was up 59 percent from the year prior, much of it on the back of the fastest-selling set it’s ever produced: <em>Final Fantasy Universes Beyond</em>. Hasbro is sitting on a golden goose that shits cardboard, even if some investors are currently suing the company for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/hasbro-is-being-sued-by-its-own-shareholders-for-printing-so-many-damn-magic-cards-destroying-the-long-term-value-of-the-brand/">allegedly mishandling that asset by printing too many cards</a>.</p> <p><em>MTG</em> might be as overexposed as Timothée Chalamet but it is currently paying huge dividends to Hasbro’s shareholders. With new Marvel, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and <em>Star Trek</em> sets all planned for the coming year, the toy maker is already promising $1 billion in stock buybacks. Don’t think of it as the Wall Street equivalent of milling your deck for short-term advantage, think of it more as exiling equity for a rainy day.</p>

 <h2><em>The Duskbloods</em> isn’t coming to PC</h2> <p>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa also released <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">its earnings this week</a> in which it confirmed <em>Elden Ring</em> and<em> The Duskbloods</em> are still both set to come to Switch 2 in 2026. There’s no firm release dates yet, but <em>The Duskbloods</em> in particular “will only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2,” suggesting no timed exclusivity or parallel launch on PC.</p>

 <h2>Embracer teases a “long-awaited, major” game coming soon</h2> <p>Guess who else was doing earnings this week? The once-almighty investment vehicle/game-publishing conglomerate Embracer got people talking with its remarks to investors. “For the next financial year, we look forward to one long-awaited, major, in-house-developed and in-house-published title together with a range of important mid-sized titles,” the company said (via <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metro-and-darksiders-owner-embracer-says-it-will-soon-release-a-long-awaited-major-game/">VGC</a></em>). That points to 4A Game’s new shooter in the post-apocalyptic <em>Metro</em> series. Embracer also owns Gunfire Games, which is working on <em>Darksiders 4</em>, but that sounds like it’s farther tout.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s season 2 trailer is finally here</h2>  <p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-2-gameplay-trailer-and-roadmap-2-maps-new-vehicles-and-weapons-limited-time-night-modes-etc.1433695/">updated roadmap</a>, it outlines new maps, modes, and gear coming to the game starting February 17. Will two new maps per season be enough to keep players satiated? Not if they’re not big enough, and the bigger ones sound like they’re still a few months away.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered</em> is still out there, lurking</h2> <p>Ubisoft’s worst-kept secret just had its art book <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r26nu9/assassins_creed_black_flag_remaster_art_book/">listed on Amazon</a>. The game was originally rumored to be coming this winter but now appears to have been delayed ahead of Ubisoft’s recent poor earnings report.</p> <div> <h2>The <em>Arc Raiders</em> domination train hasn’t lost steam</h2> <p>For every half-dozen live service stumbles, you get a durable new hit or two, and <em>Arc Raiders</em> is one of them. Publisher Nexon <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/YpwX/MxJ9/q7uK.pdf">revealed this week</a> that the game has sold 14 million copies so far, and reached nearly 1 million peak concurrent players across all platforms in January. Months after launch it’s still reportedly sustaining 6 million weekly active users. Those are MMO numbers, which is maybe why Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderland recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">told <em>IGN</em></a> he feels the extraction shooter needs more social hubs that are better utilized.</p> </div> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/reanimal-review-little-nightmares-3-horror-adventure-2000667716"><em>Reanimal</em> is a beautiful but disappointing successor to <em>Little Nightmares</em>&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-new-heroes-story-sigma-dialogue-sombra-talon-2000667771"><em>Overwatch</em> has come roaring back after lapsed players realize it’s good again</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-2-resurrected-reign-of-the-warlock-new-class-2000667816"><em>Diablo 2</em> is getting a big new expansion like it’s 2000 all over again</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends 2026 Roadmap Promises Community-Focused Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2026-roadmap-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1433971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Respawn Entertainment just unveiled the Apex Legends 2026 roadmap, and it’s a doozy. It covers more than <strong>a year </strong>of content, and it has already set about impressing fans of the battle royale-centric title on social media. In a blog post, the team at Respawn and Electronic Arts uncovered a desire to promote more of a community-focused development cycle moving forward.</p>



<p>In their words, they want to take ‘player feedback into consideration with every decision.’</p>











<p>The full roadmap for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> through 2026 and beyond includes <strong>five seasons </strong>of content, the last of which expires in April 2027. It’s one of the most ambitious roadmaps the community has ever seen, but there’s something to be said about promising so much, so soon.</p>



<p>It was just a couple of weeks ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wildlight-entertainment/" id="3393">Wildlight Entertainment</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard</a>, published a 12-month roadmap that looks in danger of being quickly abandoned…</p>



<p>Anyway, here’s a look at the upcoming schedule for the Apex Legends season structure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Season 28: February to April 2026</li>



<li>Season 29: May to July 2026</li>



<li>Season 30: August to October 2026</li>



<li>Season 31: November to January 2027</li>



<li>Season 32: February to April 2027</li>
</ul>



<p>In season 29 and season 32, new Legends will be added, starting with a Skirmisher in just a few months. As the year unravels, countless tweaks and reworks are planned for existing Legends, starting with Fuse, Catalyst, and Bloodhound in the season that’s just dropping as we speak.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team plans to update POIs across the map pool in the first half of 2026, pushing for a competitive firming up of World’s Edge later in the year.</p>



<p>One of the more divisive topics in the Apex Legends space has been around integrity and anti-cheat, and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a> from Respawn cleared up the desires quite nicely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are shooting for best-in-class online integrity, continuing to crack down on cheaters and improve how we keep bad actors out of the Apex Games. We know we have our work cut out for us, but we’re dedicated to the task.</p>



<p>In 2025, we took some big swings at tuning matchmaking and fighting cheaters. We know fighting cheating is a never-ending battle and even a small number of bad actors can impact match quality. </p>



<p>These improvements are signals we’re heading in the right direction to keep more cheaters out of the game overall, and that we’re catching more of them earlier than before. We know there’s more to do in this area in 2026, so expect ongoing updates.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Recently, an overhaul was published regarding the game’s esports ecosystem, and there are major changes on the horizon in that space, too. It’s a sizeable roadmap, but as always, the proof will be in the delivery and how the community receives the changes and additions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Clash Royale devs have amended their blog post to acknowledge Jynxzi’s contribution towards the title’s recent success. </p>



<p>The CEO and co-founder of SuperCell released a new blog post titled The Best Games Haven’t Been Made Yet. One of the focuses of the blog post was the historic year Clash Royale had, and fans, <a href="https://x.com/jynxzi/status/2021283304649970153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even Jynxzi</a>, were not happy that the creator was not acknowledged for being influential in the game’s success. </p>







<h2 id="h-clash-royale-dev-finally-appreciates-jynxzi-s-influence">Clash Royale Dev Finally Appreciates Jynxzi’s Influence</h2>



<p>SuperCell’s CEO and co-founder, Ilkka Paananen, stated on <a href="https://x.com/ipaananen/status/2021985581929050453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they have amended the Clash Royale category in the blog post following community reaction. Paananen accepted that the developers “failed to acknowledge the role that creators, pro players, and the broader community played in Clash Royale’s resurgence.” The CEO added that there was never an intent to “diminish anyone’s contribution”. </p>



<p>The blog post then talks about Clash Royale being celebrated through creators self-organizing tournaments, sharing of art and memes, and more. The blog post specially mentions Jynxzi, adding that the creator invested their “own time, money, and energy into bringing Clash Royale back to cultural relevance.” He also managed to introduce the title to many new players and some of the biggest names in streaming. </p>



<p>The blog reveals that Clash Royale’s re-engaged players have doubled, while new players have grown by almost 500%. Additionally, all measures of playtime and engagement grew successfully. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft </a>reported that Assassin’s Creed surpassed expectations this quarter, with session days increasing by 28% year-on-year and a significant growth in active users.</p>



<p>On February 12, 2026, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported </a>its Q3 sales for the fiscal year. Not only did the company report that its net bookings were up 18% year-on-year, but it also noted that the Assassin’s Creed brand in particular overperformed, with a strong quarter that underscored the franchise’s strength.</p>



<p>Specifically, activity metrics for Assassin’s Creed were up, with double-digit growth in active users. In a quarter that saw the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 and updates for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, there was a 28% surge in activity year-on-year. There’s also a 7% increase from the previous quarter.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-anticipated-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-is-stalled-for-now">The Anticipated Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Is Stalled for Now</h2>



<p>While the Assassin’s Creed brand remains a tentpole franchise for Ubisoft, the highly anticipated remake of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag is likely delayed. A previous report noted that an<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/"> unannounced title</a> planned for the fiscal year 2026 has been delayed to the fiscal year 2027. This point was reiterated during an investor call that followed the release of the sales report.</p>



<p>The remake of Black Flag is currently the only game that matches this description. Insider Gaming had reported that the project was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">slated for release this March.</a> The brand recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of the planned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>







<p>An art book centered on the forthcoming Black Flag remake was recently listed on Amazon. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-listing-surfaces-online/">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent financial update, Ubisoft touched on The Division, the post-apocalyptic shooter MMO that is preparing to celebrate its tenth anniversary. In March, The Division will be a decade old, and this year, Ubisoft plans to unveil an ‘ambitious’ roadmap that includes the launch of The Division: Resurgence.</p>



<p>While we don’t have a firm release date just yet, we now know that The Division: Resurgence, an authentic mobile-first experience, is <strong>planned </strong>for release between February and April 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-big-things-are-coming-to-the-division-this-year">Big Things Are Coming to The Division This Year</h2>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft quietly released The Division: Definitive Edition, which proved to be a disappointing drop for fans of the shooter series. It was assumed that the team at Massive would have produced something more significant for the game’s tenth anniversary, but the ‘special edition’ came without any frills whatsoever.</p>



<p>Regardless, Ubisoft has assured fans that a strong year is ahead for The Division.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a>, which reported strong results, the team insisted that The Division: Resurgence, a mobile game with all the trappings of the core series, is planned for release in Q4 2025-2026. That means, all being well, we’ll have it before April. Right now, the game is undergoing tests that are slowly opening to include more territories.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that The Division 2 will be getting ‘a new game mode’ for the tenth anniversary of the franchise, arriving in March 2026. When that date comes around, Ubisoft will take the opportunity to unveil ‘an ambitious roadmap’ for the year ahead.</p>



<p>Given the recent positivity and promising comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" id="168702">around The Division 3</a>, by the recently departed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-gerighty-leaving-massive-to-work-battlefield/" id="170229">Julian Gerighty</a>, fans are full of anticipation for what lies ahead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>Earlier today,&nbsp;<strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>&nbsp;published its Q4 2025 earnings report, and in the <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss2025Q4_eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent earnings call</a>, the South Korean company revealed interesting tidbits about what it will focus on after the imminent launch of&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Desert</strong>.</span> The executives revealed that, depending on market demand (that is to say, depending on how well the game sells), Pearl Abyss <strong>already has plans to potentially add downloadable content and even multiplayer</strong>.</p>



<p>As you probably remember, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually supposed to be an MMO at first</a></strong>. Then it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to an open world game with multiplayer elements</a>, but in the last few years, Pearl Abyss hasn't referred to multiplayer at all. It seems like <strong>they haven't entirely abandoned the plans to add multiplayer modes</strong>; rather, they focused on completing the single player experience first.</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss also explained why Crimson Desert took much longer than anticipated. The reason is the concurrent development of the BlackSpace Engine, but they are now confident that, with the technology ready, they'll be able to accelerate work on the next games, the open world creature collecting game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dokev-an-open-world-creature-collecting-game-by-pearl-abyss-resurfaces-with-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DokeV</a></strong> and the exosuit shooter game <strong>Plan 8</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Since we have reached the stabilization stage of the BlackSpace Engine, we now have an environment where, from the next title DokeV, we can concentrate our efforts on just developing the game alone. Accordingly, we believe that we will have a great reduction in the development time of different projects. In addition, through the development of Crimson Desert, we have now accumulated significant internal experience and know-how regarding Console. So we believe that by efficiently managing development and other preparatory work, we will have a smaller launch gap between new titles.</em></p>



<p>DokeV in particular already <strong>garnered attention</strong> thanks to the Gamescom 2021 trailer. Pearl Abyss acknowledged that fans have been left without any updates, but clarified that Crimson Desert remains the focus, which is why they couldn't share any news about that game. Now, <strong>they believe it should take about two years after the debut of Crimson Desert to launch it</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Considering the launch preparation experience of Crimson Desert, taking into account that at least one year or so of preparation for launching was needed even after game completion, it seems about 2 years of time will be needed after the launch of Crimson Desert for DokeV. </em></p>



<p>The good news is that some sort of communication about DokeV should start later this year. We'll let you know once that happens. In other Crimson Desert news, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared more information about the game's non-combat activities</a></strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Reports Strong Growth and Beaten Expectations in Financial Report]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has finally published its latest financial report, outlining the Q3 2025 – 2026 performance portfolio across the company. In contrast to what you might generally believe, the company is in a strong place and is reporting beaten expectations across the board, with key franchises soaring year-over-year.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed, The Division, Anno, and Avatar are all up in terms of net bookings, contributing to a total €1.1 billion, up <strong>18% </strong>year-over-year.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-reports-smooth-sailing-in-financial-update">Ubisoft Reports Smooth Sailing in Financial Update</h2>



<p>Ubisoft’s recent financial update opened with bold statements about the company’s performance. It was written that financial delivery in Q3 25-26 is ‘above expectations’ and hitting levels classed as an ‘overperformance’ based mostly on gains secured by Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege is also doing very well, as is Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, with a burst of success being secured by the game’s ‘strongly anticipated third-person update and high-quality From the Ashes expansion release.’</p>



<p>More than 130 million MAUs (Monthly Active Users) are being reported across the Ubisoft estate, covering both console and PC platforms, and in December, a 3% growth in MAUs was recorded year-over-year.</p>



<p>In a statement at the heart of <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the financial update</a>, CEO and co-Founder, Yves Guillemot, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance,with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has been pushed from pillar to post in recent months. Days ago, much of the company participated in a walkout, mainly staged to oppose a five-day return to office order imposed by the company, and to recognize plummeting stock values.</p>



<p>The financial update didn’t refer to any of the recent troubles, nor did it outline anything to do with the recent crash in share price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA['I Hope People Will Look to Vince as a Model and Aim High': Hideo Kojima, Phil Spencer, Todd Howard, Other Industry Luminaries Honor Vince Zampella at]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">"What struck me most was his restlessness," said Geoff Keighley yesterday in front of an audience on the DICE Summit 2026 keynote stage. "Nothing was ever quite good enough. That relentless hunger for excellence drove him to believe he could always make a better game, a better company, be a better man. Since his passing, I've thought a lot about what made Vince unique, what's his superpower. Of course he knew how to build great teams, make great games, but inside massive companies built on process and politics, Vince was able to stay stubbornly human. He was direct, impatient with nonsense, and fiercely loyal to the people doing the work."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keighley was speaking of Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty franchise, co-founder of Infinity Ward, and co-founder of Respawn Entertainment, who tragically died this past December in a car accident at the age of 55.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keighley opened a segment of the DICE Summit keynote talks dedicated to honoring Zampella's legacy and memory, during which a number of other industry luminaries both took the stage as well as appeared in video messages discussing the impact he had on them personally, and the industry writ large.</p><p>No matter who was around him, he found a way to get the best out of them.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Technically, we never worked together, but he's had a huge effect on me," said Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO, in a video message. "Not just me as a game maker, but as a character."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That is the thing from Vince's entire career," said Respawn game director Peter Hirschmann, also in a video clip. "No matter who was around him, he found a way to get the best out of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[The team] always valued that Vince had their best interest," said Daniel Suarez, head of production at Respawn and similarly appearing in a video. "They knew he was going to go into the arena and fight for what was going to be best for the game. And I think because you knew he had your back, you knew he was going to be the one who was chanting for this to be the best game it could be if the team had the ability to do their best work, people loved him for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox head Phil Spencer was the second speaker to take the stage in person, talking about his friendly rivalry with Zampella over the years, and what he learned from their friendship. "Vince's legacy of leading without ego, of leading a team, is something that I took a lot away from, just watching him in how he led his teams to achieve such greatness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More individuals appeared in more video messages following Spencer's speech. "I didn't know what a servant leader was until I met Vince, and to be honest with you I don't know if Vince knew what a servant leader was. But he was the best servant leader I ever knew," said Stig Asmussen, former Respawn game director.</p><p>I think that without him, the modern game industry might not exist.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima made a video appearance as well: "I think that without him, the modern game industry might not exist," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He just really wanted to make great games for players with a team of developers he liked working with. I don't think it was really about how do I change the game industry or how do I make a legendary game," said Rob Pardo, former CCO of Blizzard. "I think he's just simpler than that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Watching him lead, having him lead us for so long, we've become him, with a sense of discipline, drive, ambition, execution, and a standard for excellence with the players in mind first," said Byron Beede, SVP on Battlefield. "Thanks to Vince, that's in our DNA now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next video speaker was Bethesda director Todd Howard. "Vince was cool," he said. "He was, I think, and a lot of people who knew him all would agree, he was probably the least full of s*** person I knew. And sometimes, he didn't mind pointing out when someone else was. Vince was cool! So cool, my oldest son has only ever asked to meet or get his picture with one game developer. Vince! Twice! And Vince never would be changed. He was still that guy when we first met, except he had a new T-shirt once a year. That was a change for him. Vince was cool. He knew what was cool about a game. And he knew instinctively what a great game was. He knew how to take a game from average, to good, to great, and he knew what needed to be done to get there. He knew how hard it would be, the effort, the personal sacrifice it would take. And he wasn't afraid of doing it. It was never about him. It was always about the game. Most of all, about the team making it."</p><p>Vince Zampella changed how games were made, but more importantly, he changed how people were treated while making them.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After more video messages, the final in-person speaker was Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment. "We've talked a lot today about Vince as a titan of gaming who put out highly successful franchises he helped create," she said. "And all of that is true. But what he would say, often, is, I just want to be remembered for being a great dad. He truly lived that. There were many meetings over the years he didn't attend, because he needed to be somewhere else. At a game, at a school event, or just simply being there for his kids when they needed him This instinct to show up didn't stop with his family. He really showed up for people. He mentored, he supported, he believed in others often before they believed in themselves. He created cultures where people felt trusted and protected and challenged to be their best. Vince Zampella changed how games were made, but more importantly, he changed how people were treated while making them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A final round of video messages concluded the presentation, including a reappearance by Kojima in which he concluded, "I hope people will look to Vince as a model and aim high."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE attendees have been asked to look for set-ups of blank Magic: The Gathering cards around the conference, on which they are being encouraged to write memories, tributes, and other thoughts about Zampella before depositing them in available boxes. The cards will be delivered to his family after the conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella was well-known industry-wide, having co-created Call of Duty at the studio he co-founded, Infinity Ward. After departing Infinity Ward, he joined a number of his former team members in founding Respawn Entertainment, which went on to produce number hits including Titanfall (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2">IGN review</a>), Titanfall 2 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review">IGN review</a>), Apex Legends (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-review-2">IGN review</a>), Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">IGN review</a>), and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">IGN review</a>).
