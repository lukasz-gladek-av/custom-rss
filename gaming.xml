		<p>It’s been a funny old week, when I thought that Wednesday was Thursday, thanks in part to a long day at a preview event on Tuesday throwing my internal calendar out of sync. What game, you ask? Well, I’ll tell you soon. We’ll also tell you what game Dom and I have been splitting up in co-op sometime next week, you can’t already guess what that is.</p>

<p>But there’s no guesswork for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">Two Point Museum</a>, which I had a lovely time reviewing for the start of the week. I do enjoy Two Point’s brand of management sim, and it’s always fascinating to see how each setting subtly shifts the style of the game, providing a canvas for all the base punning and nonsense that makes this feel so thoroughly British.</p>
<p>I mused the other day that Two Point Museum would be the perfect game to have a themed crossover with the huge game release of the week: Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds.<strong> Nic B</strong> has played Monster Hunter Wilds. <strong>Jim</strong> has also played Monster Hunter Wilds. The last of this trio said, “I found the main story quests to be a little too easy, so I’m hoping the endgame content will prove more challenging. My go-to weapon has been the Insect Glaive but once online servers go live at launch, I’ll be partaking in some Hunting Horn rehearsals!”</p>


<p>He’s also been playing A Plague Tale: Innocence, “which has been rattling around in the backlog for years. It’s an incredibly atmospheric medieval stealth ’em up that weaves together simple yet satisfying stealth sections and puzzles.”</p>
<p>While <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has, quite obviously, been playing Destiny 2, <strong>Aran’s</strong> mixed things up a little with Afterlove EP and Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. The former was ‘fine’ until he ran into a progression bug later on, while the latter is “as silly as you’d expect it to be.” Sounds perfect!</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> had a bunch of games, new and old on the go. In addition to his casual Phasmo and Palworld gaming, he was roundly disappointed by the Tomb Raider IV-VI remaster, and roundly satisfied by Avowed, “which is rather good in exactly the same kind of way as The Outer Worlds was.”</p>

<p>In addition to his continuing playthroughs of Immortals: Fenyx Rising and Sea of Stars, <strong>Ade’s</strong> also continued to have a great time fighting for freedom and liber-tea in Helldivers 2 this week –&nbsp;“There’s been some brilliant storyline developments added over the last few weeks; surely the payoff to all the drama will be the opportunity to battle on Super Earth itself?”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel’s</strong> played MiSide, and had a grand old time of it, while looking to sate his extraction shooter urges with Synduality: Echo of Ada. And he’s also played an odd bundle of Steam Next Fest demos, including A Gentlemen’s Dispute, Panic Delivery, Haste: Broken Worlds, and more!</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who dabbled with the opening of Avowed, but has put it on hold until he finishes playing through Eternal Strands. It’s Steam Next Fest, so you know that he’s been delving into the delights of horror demos, and then pairing that with some of the “slight but delightful” Princess Peach Showtime on his commutes.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/monster-hunter-wilds-best-beginner-weapons-to-learn/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With 14 different weapon types and so many mechanics to learn, trying to get into the Monster Hunter series can feel daunting, and even with its streamlining of many of the experience's core mechanics, Monster Hunter Wilds can be difficult to get into for newcomers, since the game still plays like very little else on the market. Every journey, however, begins with a single step, and the very first step in any Monster Hunter game, including Wilds, is finding the best weapon not only to learn the game's intricacies but also to have fun relatively quickly. And just like monsters, not all weapon types are made the same, and some are better suited for beginners than others.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250215123352_1-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The best beginner weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds share some common traits. For starters, they have relatively simple game plans that don't require managing resources or multiple gauges to hit hard, have versatile movesets that include both solid offensive and defensive options and have very simple combos that don't require pressing multiple buttons.</p>
<p>The first weapon that falls perfectly into this category is the <strong>Sword and Shield</strong>. This weapon has some very simple combos that are still satisfying to pull off, no gauges to manage or multiple stances, a very functional guard, and the ability to use items without sheating the weapon, which is quite helpful when you are trying to learn the game.</p>
<p>The other three great beginner weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds are slightly more complex than the Sword and Shield, but not by much, and still work great to learn the game. The <strong>Dual Blades</strong> are a little lacking in defensive options, as they cannot guard whatsoever and only have a perfect dodging mechanic that requires being in two of the three possible stances, but when it comes to offense, they are very straightforward with great mobility and some easy combos. The one thing that makes them slightly more complicated to use besides the lack of defensive options is resource management, as entering the powerful Demon Mode drains stamina. Keeping an eye on the Demon Gauge to enter Archdemon Mode once full adds a little more complexity, but the weapon's flow is generally pretty easy to understand, making it a solid choice for beginners.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250226120617_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The <strong>Lance</strong> is also a great beginner weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds thanks to its extremely good Guard, which can be kept up while attacking with its simple combos. Guarding also allows to counterattack when timed right, and with the addition of a few techniques that essentially allow Lance users to intercept monsters' attacks, the weapon is also great to learn some advanced techniques down the line that can be brought over to other weapons.</p>
<p>In past entries in the series, the <strong>Great Sword</strong> wasn't entirely a great beginner weapon. While its moveset was very simple, it required excellent positioning and good knowledge of monsters' tendencies and movesets to land those powerful True Charged Slashes. The buffing of the first two Charged Slashes in the weapon's basic combo, and the addition of Focus Mode, have made using the weapon much, much easier than in previous games, and the improvements made to guarding have made it more than viable to use, in addition to another advanced defensive tool, Offset Rising Slash, which allows you to intercept attacks with good timing. If you're looking for a weapon that hits very hard while being simple to use, the Great Sword is the weapon you want.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250226115127_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While these weapons are, in my opinion, the best for beginners in Monster Hunter Wilds, there are a few additional choices that may be better suited for your playstyle. The <strong>Hammer</strong>, for example, is a good choice with a simple gameplan and combos, but it feels a little weak in the game at the beginning without a proper build, so it may prolong fights a little too much. The <strong>Long Sword </strong>comes with relatively simple gameplay as well, but<strong>,</strong> on the other hand, you will need to learn how to use its counterattacks properly, like Foresight Slash and Iai Spirit Strike from Special Sheathe, to use the weapon to its full potential, which can feel a little overwhelming if you're just starting out your Monster Hunter journey. The ranged weapons - <strong>Bow, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun</strong> - are decent choices for beginners as well, but they require resource management to deal serious damage, and I think they don't really teach you the game properly, as a ranged playstyle doesn't carry much over to a short range playstyle.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, however, you could potentially feel more at ease with even the more complex weapons in the game, like the Charge Blade and the Switch Axe, so you should definitely try them all to see which one feels the best for you. Monster Hunter Wilds is not a competitive game, so having fun remains the most important thing. Back when I started my Monster Hunter journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Rise</a> after many failed attempts over the years, I learned the game with the Long Sword before moving on to some more complex weapons like the Insect Glaive and the Charge Blade, so don't stop at your first pick once you have learned the basics of the series' formula: you may find some more fun ways to play the game and enjoy it for longer!</p>

Years ago I wrote <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/climate-crisis-city-building-games/">a piece</a> about what I presumptuously defined as the "emerging" subgenre of city games that respond to the climate crisis, with its attendant catastrophes of unchecked capitalism and resurgent fascism. Today, it feels dangerously like that subgenre is "sub" no longer.</p>
<p>We are engulfed in strategy sims where society is the rind between the formless terrors without and the only-human abusers within. The geography is clogged by Last Cities and Final Bastions Of Humanity, all of them awkwardly avoiding eye contact, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmyuE0NpNgE">the prophets that line the alleyways of Life Of Brian</a>. I guess it's in keeping with the "unchecked capitalism" bit that apocalypse fantasies have become a thriving business. I hope that's not my fault. On the brighter side, roguelike deckbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/as-we-descend">As We Descend</a> is quite fun, combining moderately baroque turn-based combat with tales of Vernian dystopia. Here's Wot I Think of the demo.

<p>
In As We Descend, you dutifully take custody of another Terminal Metropolis, a crenellated steampunk diorama that huddles <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>-style around a light source - not a coal generator, in this case, but an enormous golden hologram, which is possibly the god of the draconian theocracy you'll have to wrangle with as the latest, unwilling First Ranger. 
</p>
<p>
For reasons currently unclear to me, your city is also a huge circular drill that is tunnelling to the centre of the Earth. On each level, you spend turns playing cards to access facilities and stories within the city. You'll also send expeditions into the surrounding caverns to recover technologies such as reactor rods, used to power the forcefields that safeguard your city's descent.
</p>
<p>
The local wildlife don't take kindly to this. That wouldn't be a problem if they were all roundworms and bacteria, but as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxia-station">Anoxia Station</a>, As We Descend has a nasty case of the megafauna. Enemies range in scale and threat level from gristle-filled balloons to massive, skinless Skeletors. Against these foes you shall pitch Age Of Sigmar-esque battalions of fragile arbalests, iron-palmed monks, tanks with tower shields, and clockwork soldiers, unlocked from run to run.
</p>
<p>
Battles see you distributing your units between two radial zones, while a smaller version of the big golden hologram slings ability cards from the rear. Units in the front zone auto-attack enemies between turns, but are naturally exposed to greater harm. The game's card alchemy feels appropriately compressed and dicey. There are cards that tether stat boosts to moving between zones, cards that cause units to "fixate", inflicting extra damage on a selected foe, while losing the ability to target others, and barrier cards to stave off unit wipes. All of which is powered by faith generated by your citizens, as long as you carry on completing quests for them.

<p>
I lost plenty of units in the demo - there's a nice sense of being fundamentally outmatched, and the longer you linger on a level, the more you're provoking a chonkier predator to attack your city directly. During my first run, my dystopaville fell to a crablike rhino that had the bad form to materialise after a series of expeditions, with all of my units at half-strength.
</p>
<p>
I'm wooed but not wowed by As We Descend's strategy-tactics sandwich. What lures me more is the glowering enigma of the city itself, whose art deco crevices teem with small, branching stories involving supercilious overseers and buff blacksmiths and the like. There's an agreeable stink of medieval politicking. Yes, humans are probably the real monsters here. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/">Read more and find the demo on Steam</a> - the full game's out on 27th March.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> looks set to be a smash hit for Capcom, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">hitting nearly a million concurrent players on Steam overnight</a>, but the response to the game so far from those played is not all positive, according to Steam user reviews. 
</p>
<p>
On Steam, Monster Hunter Wilds currently sits with a Mixed rating, with  many responses criticising the game's technical performance. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292">Capcom issued a social media post</a> seemingly in response to these early complaints, and said that anyone "experiencing any issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam"  should try updating their graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode and then readjusting their settings. The company also linked to a more detailed <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/047">Capcom support blog</a> with further tips.

For now, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340">Steam user reviews</a> are awash with complaints regarding the game's performance.
</p>
<p>
"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen," wrote one fan who has already clocked up five hours of playtime. "I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point."
</p>
<p>
"I have been a fan since MH3U," wrote another player. "I have 1000s of hours in MH across all of the games. My beefy rig with a 3080 super and decent CPU can't run this game at an acceptable frame rate."

"Runs even worse than the beta," wrote a third. "For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this."
</p>
<p>
Still, the game's performance issues at launch don't seem to be putting too many people off from continuing. Currently, 940,000 people are playing Monster Hunter Wilds via Steam - just down from its overnight peak of 987,000. 
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry will be weighing in with its verdict on Monster Hunter Wilds on PC shortly.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt called it "the most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Raw Fury has announced that it is partnering with developer Christoffer Bodegård to publish the table top inspired CRPG Esoteric Ebb. Described as an absurd fantasy, Esoteric Ebb puts players in the shoes of a lowly cleric who is tasked with solving the mystery of an explosion that took out a tea shop in the city of Norvik. Much like table top RPGs, the cleric’s success relies on the roll of the dice and the advice and taunts of the six voices in his head.</p>
<p><iframe title="Esoteric Ebb | Partnership Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QrdSKgd-1do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As the story of Esoteric Ebb moves forward, players can choose to try and solve the core mystery or do anything to ruin the flow of the plot. The Cleric has some magical abilities that allow him to read and control minds, and detect secrets within Norvik. The dice rolling affects everything from stealing and fighting, to narrative choices. Failure is an option in Esoteric Ebb, and that will open up different avenues to explore. There are battles to take part in, with those being turn based and reliant on the dice too. How the Cleric’s playstyle evolves depends on the Questing Tree, which is a quest log, mind map, and skill tree combined into one tool. The playstyles change depending on the outcome of quests and how they were completed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">demo for Esoteric Ebb</a> is available on Steam until March 17th.</p>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Electronic Arts (EA) is releasing the source code for four <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> titles under the open source GPL license. The original <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> (since subtitled <em>Tiberian Dawn</em>) is joined by <em>Red Alert</em>, <em>Renegade</em>, and <em>Generals</em>, the code for all of which can now be found on <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/">EA’s GitHub page</a>. Only the code has been open sourced, not the games’ assets and cinematics, but it will help modders and the game restoration community keep the games playable.</p><p>This isn’t actually a first for EA. Back in 2020 the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265663/ea-command-conquer-tiberian-dawn-red-alert-open-source-remastered">released the source code</a> for its <em>Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection</em>, made up of <em>Tiberian Dawn </em>and <em>Red Alert</em>. That code had already been adapted for the remaster’s engine however, while the new releases are the “fully recovered source code” of the series’ first two games, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered/news/steam-workshop-support">according to Luke “CCHyper” Feenan</a>, a <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> community member who proposed and orchestrated the release together with EA.</p><p><em>Renegade</em> and <em>Generals</em>, meanwhile, have been released under an open source license for the first time. <em>Renegade</em> is a 2002 first- and third-person shooter set in the franchise’s Tiberium universe, while <em>Generals </em>is a 2003 strategy game that eschewed the Tiberium and <em>Red Alert</em> worlds for a near-future setting depicting a war between the United States, China, and the fictional Global Liberation Army. Its expansion <em>Zero Hour</em> is also included in the open source release.</p><p>Alongside the open sourcing, EA has also opened Steam Workshop support, and released a <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Modding_Support">‘Modding Support’ pack</a> that includes the source XML, schema, script, shader and map files, for all the games that use the SAGE engine:</p><div><ul><li><span><em>C&amp;C Renegade</em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour</em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kane’s Wrath</em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising </em></span></li><li><span><em>C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight</em></span></li></ul></div><p>That move should make it easier to create mods and maps for the games, and to share some of those creations through Steam.

<p>Lumiose City is the home of Pokémon Legends Z-A and the successor to Legends Arceus. The release window is out in the tall grass, and the Pokémon Legends entry could pose stern competition to its contemporaries.</p>



<p>There was a year between <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A’s announcement</a> at the 2024 Pokémon Presents showcase and the first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-gets-release-window-extended-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 edition of Pokémon Presents</a>. It may have taken a while, but the wait was worth it, and we’re beholden to The Pokémon Company for revealing the scope of Lumiose City.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A looks to have taken feedback regarding Legends Arceus, so let’s see how long we’ve got to wait until we get our hands on it.</p>







<figure><figcaption>We all dream of a pet Gyarados. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is scheduled to release in Late 2025—but it doesn’t have a concrete launch date for now.</strong></p>



<p>The Pokémon Presents presentation on February 27 is where we learned about the title’s release window. The word “late” is vague, but it might not be hard to decipher if we consider previous Pokémon titles. Scarlet and Violet, Sword and Shield, Sun and Moon, and the Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&nbsp;and&nbsp;Shining Pearl remakes all came out in November of their respective years.</p>



<p>Yes, Pokémon Legends Arceus released in January 2022. But we’ve not had a new game for a while, so a <strong>November 2025</strong> is a likely release window for <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-legends-z-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>.</p>







<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is a Nintendo exclusive, meaning the only way you can play Legends Z-A is either through a Nintendo Switch—or the Switch 2 if the console is available at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Sadly, Pokémon games don’t release on formats other than Nintendo hardware or mobile. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation and Xbox’s escalating partnership</a>, don’t expect to see <strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A</strong> on another console. </p>







<p><strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A is still only advertised as a wishlist item, but with this being Nintendo, expect Pokémon Legends Z-A to cost $59.99 or £49.99.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo notoriously doesn’t discount games easily. It also launches all new AAA titles at full price. It’s almost a lock Legends Z-A will cost $59.99 or £49.99. You’d better save up your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-discontinue-my-nintendo-gold-points-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Gold Points</a> before they’re discontinued.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s going to take some beating for Pokémon Legends Z-A to overtake Legends Arceus. What are your impressions of Pokémon Legends Z-A so far? Will the Switch’s technical performance hinder the title’s chances of being more Legendary than any Kanto birds could dream of?</p>

This date applies to all platforms the game is coming to including PC via Steam and Epic, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.

<p>Promise Mascot Agency! is an open world mascot management crime drama, where you play as a disgraced Yakuza lieutenant called Michi. He is sent to the bankrupt agency and is tasked with turning it into a profitable business, which is a lot harder said than done when the location is a small town called Kaso-Machi. The gameplay will consist of exploring Kaso-Michi, recruiting mascots, and sending them on jobs around the area. Sometimes, these jobs will go wrong so Michi will have to find solutions to get them back on track.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/02/paradise-killer-review-pc-switch/">Paradise Killer Review</a></h2>
<p>Kaizen Game Works previously made Paradise Killer, and in our Paradise Killer review, Miguel wrote, <em>“Paradise Killer is a pure, unguided detective mystery that doesn’t dare hold your hand. You, and you alone, are in charge of seeking out not only the truth of this locked room murder, but the truth of the wild and cosmically corrupt world that the game takes place in. The open ended nature of the investigation can be daunting at first, and while some clunky platforming and frequent periods of downtime can sour the experience just a bit, Paradise Killer still manages to be one of the most well put together and utterly satisfying mystery games I’ve ever experienced.”</em></p>

            <p>EA has released the source code for classic strategy games in the Command &amp; Conquer series along with Steam Workshop support, opening the game to modders.</p>
<p>The games in question are Command &amp; Conquer (aka, Tiberian Dawn), C&amp;C Red Alert, C&amp;C Renegade, and C&amp;C Generals + Zero Hour, all released under the General Public Licence.</p>

<p>The news follows the launch of Command &amp; Conquer Ultimate Collection on Steam last year, after which EA commissioned modder Luke "CCHyper" Feenan to research improvements to the games - as detailed in a new reddit post.</p>
<p>In addition to opening the source code, which allows existing C&amp;C communities to continue supporting their work, Steam Workshop support has been added for more games in the series.</p>
<p>All Mission Editor and World Builder tools have been updated, meaning maps can be published directly to the Steam Workshop. In addition, a C&amp;C Modding Support pack has been released, which contains the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all the games that use the SAGE engine - a long-requested wish from the community.</p>
<p>Lastly, EA has updated its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/modding-faq?isLocalized=true">Command &amp; Conquer Franchise Modding Guidelines</a> to reflect this initiative.</p>

            <p>
There's a temporary truce in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Galactic War, after a game-breaking bug introduced during maintenance.
</p>
<p>
The issue sprung up yesterday, after Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead issued an update to the game's backend. The problem saw planet liberation rates skyrocket - which is a good thing... until it isn't.
</p>
<p>
"While we know this is fun, we also know that it is breaking the Galactic War mechanic itself," Arrowhead wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1895176702252458384">post on social media</a>. "In short, this is harming the game experience and will have detrimental effects on the war mechanic in the future."

<p>
While players' sudden tide of victory will not be turned back, Arrowhead has frozen the Galactic War so no further damage to the game's balance is done.
</p>
<p>
"We have made the decision to pause the Galactic War temporarily until this is fixed," Arrowhead continued. "We're already starting the process, but we do not yet have an ETA for this fix."
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Helldivers 2 will remain fully playable, but victories will not contribute to the wider goal of liberating planets within the war. 
</p>
<p>
"This is our mistake and we own it," Arrowhead concluded. "We are not going to revert any of the damage done by this error, however, so your major order victory is still secure."
</p>
<p>
In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-creative-director-takes-sabbatical-promises-to-start-arrowheads-next-game-on-return">Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt announced he was taking a sabbatical</a> after working for 11 years on the series, but would return to begin develoment on the studio's next game.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-helldivers-2-has-received-a-stealth-ps5-pro-upgrade-and-heres-what-it-does">Digital Foundry analysed a 'stealth' update to Helldivers 2</a> that improved the game's performance for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.

<p>Brevity soul'd or no, wit can also be the enemy of honesty; a fundamentally performative pin brooch with an artificial sheen. When I go back over my notes after playing a game, at least two-thirds of them will routinely be useless and powerfully crap jokes I've written in lieu of practical points because - even in a document no-one but me will ever read - I cannot bear to cease reminding myself that I'm an implausibly clever sausage.</p>
<p>Occasionally I do remember to just jot down an unadorned factoid. "Cards wot do two things (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a>)" says my notes on this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle game</a>. I've had my eye on it for a while, mainly because making your game star a ghost with an axe and calling it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/axe-ghost">Axe Ghost</a> is some premium Nic Reuben bait, especially if the ghost also has normal human arms for some reason.<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2712670/Axe_Ghost/"> </a></p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2712670/Axe_Ghost/">How's the demo</a>? It's good! Falls into the "It's either quite hard or I'm quite bad at it, yet I still want to keep playing" category. A tricky one to get right because, as we've already established, I do like to be reminded that I'm very good at everything by all things, at all times.</p>

<p>It does indeed feature cards that do two things, or rather offer two options, or rather actually offer <em>four</em> options because the arrows on the cards can be reverse-toggled. Those arrows are used for shunting around monsters or grouping them together so you can wipe out the entire shoal with your axe, which is where that Tetris comparison comes in.</p>
<p>They're also useful for pushing monsters away. If a single one reaches you it's farewell to normal human arms: you're now entirely dead.</p>
<p>My Sokoban comparison is more spurious, but what I mean here is that you spend time working out which shunts to chain together to create paths without blocking off others, lest your future shunting plans be interrupted. The most basic arrow will target and move an entire group of monster types as long as they're all touching, but it won't work if <em>any</em> of those monsters would end up getting blocked by the move. For those situations, you need a different type of arrow that tracks collision on each monster individually, letting others complete their move even if some of the group get blocked. You get cards that move entire rows one space, cards that move whole columns one space, cards that freeze monsters in place, and so on.</p>

</figure>
<p>An additional wrinkle here is that the actual axe you need to actually get rid of the monsters is itself a card, although one that shows up regularly. An Axe Ghost without permanent access to his own axe? Communism did this.</p>
<p>It took me a while to wrap my head around all the rules and counter rules but it ends up flowing nicely after a little investment. What I like most about Axe Ghost is how it takes some game things that feel quite ancient and primitive and turns them into a random conundrum generator, offering meaty, puzzly turns that sometimes had me stumped for good stretches.</p>
<p>Also, as far as I could tell, it's made by a single guy. I realise that's not quite as impressive as it used to be, since with 2025 inflation that's more like one and a quarter guys. Still impressive though. No release date on this one just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>One of the most exciting projects we’ve been able to check out recently has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/prologue-go-wayback-playerunknowns-glimpse-of-a-digital-future-that-teaches-us-to-survive-in-the-present/">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a>. There’s a whole host of reasons as to why it’s exciting, but the first amongst them is that it’s coming from PlayerUnknown Studios, the development team headed by Brendan ‘PlayerUnknown’ Greene, known globally for the smash hit battle royale PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds, or PUBG. This new trailer is the first true taste of the game’s gameplay outside of our press viewing and selected beta testing. You should definitely join us in the excitement.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KI6H_WNHUlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Prologue uses procedural generation and machine learning to create an 8km by 8km map every single time you play. For context, that’s the same size as Skyrim’s map, and just as with Bethesda’s RPG hit, if you can see it, you can walk there. In fact, that’s the whole point of the game. Your task here is to survive, with each iteration of the map liable to cause you immense stress and strain as you fight against the elements, and your own hunger and thirst. You have to stay warm, dry, fed and watered, and that is far harder than you might first think.</p>
<p>Your task is to make it to the weather station. Each time you drop into the game you’ll start in a cabin, and the weather station will be somewhere between 3km and 6km away. There’s no mini-map, or route finding, you have to use an in-game physical map that your character holds up to read, while then referring to your compass to choose the direction. Just as you would in real life if you were lost in the woods, you have to navigate by the monuments and landscape details that you can see, finding other shacks or cabins along the way that hopefully contain better clothing or additional food to keep you going through the night.</p>


<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the perfect survival game, and it can really look quite beautiful, assuming you’re able to survive long enough to see it. Prologue: Go Way Back will release into Early Access this summer for PC.</p>

			<p>PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has released the first gameplay trailer for its second project, the single-player open world survival game Prologue: Go Wayback. The Amsterdam-based developer also revealed that it will be available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early access</a> starting this Summer for the rather low price of $20, which will not be increased after the end of the early access phase (estimated to be around a year).</p>
<p>In the game, players are dropped into a vast and wild landscape, equipped with just an old map and the basic tools to stay alive. The mission is simple: reach the weather station, but how to get there depends entirely on the player.</p>
<p>The world is dynamic and unpredictable. The weather can change at a moment's notice, forcing players to adapt to fierce storms and freezing temperatures. Gathering resources, finding shelter, and foraging for food will be essential. Extreme weather conditions can affect the character's stats. Items and even buildings found along the way can be repaired. Additionally, each playthrough will be completely different since it is generated by the studio's machine-learning technology.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KI6H_WNHUlU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Brendan 'PlayerUnknown' Greene himself, diving deeply into his 10-plus-year plan to get the metaverse right. Prologue: Go Wayback follows the tech demo Preface: Undiscovered World (which is live now on Steam) and is a mid-step toward the final, full-fledged planet-sized massively multiplayer game codenamed Project Artemis. Unlike Preface and Artemis, it is made with Unreal Engine, albeit mixed with the studio's in-house custom machine learning terrain generation technology.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned interview, Greene said about Prologue: Go Wayback:</p>
<p><em>Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. It's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a testbed for our ML tech.</em></p>
<p><em>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is living up to its name, with some truly wild player numbers following its debut.</p>
<p>The next installment in Capcom's Monster Hunter series went live earlier today (28th February) and quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam.</p>

<p>At the time of writing and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 933,446 Monster Hunter Wilds players on Valve's platform. It currently has an all time player peak of 987,482, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>To compare further, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day. Are you one of them?</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Capcom gave us all a little teaser for what lies in store for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">Monster Hunter Wilds' first post-launch content update</a>, which is now confirmed to be launching some time in "early April". This update will include a "new level of challenge" for players.</p>
<p>But, as for what players can expect in the here and now, well it sounds like quite a rather good ol' time. In fact, our Matt recently awarded the game four out of five stars, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>
<p>"Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p>

			<p>Continuing a process that began with Monster Hunter World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> attempts to further streamline the series formula to reduce the time players spend in menus and at the base camp to keep them on the field as much as possible, providing them with all the tools they need to effortlessly traverse the new open-world maps.</p>
<p>Among these new tools the game provides is the Seikret, a friendly Bird Wyvern that assists Hunters by giving them access to Supply items and an additional weapon while making traversal way faster than on foot. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise's Palamutes, which served a similar traversal purpose, however, Seikret don't really feel good to control due to some default control settings that the game never really explains unless the player goes through them manually.</p>

<p>The settings you will want to change as soon as you begin your adventure in Monster Hunter Wilds are the Call Seikret Controls (Radial Menu), and the Seikret Manual Controls found on the second page of the Controls menu in the main Options menu. The first one is, by default, set to Auto-move, which puts the Seikret into Auto-move after calling it from either a shortcut or the Radial Menu, which makes the Bird Wyvern head towards any highlighted target, whether it is a resource you have highlighted yourself on the map or any target monster. This option is far from being the best, as it wrestles control away from the player upon calling the Seikret, and having to press buttons to slow it down and make it stop feels clunky and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The Seikret Manual Controls option is even more important to change to have better control of the Seikret. The default option, Type 1, makes the Seikret move without player input, similar to Auto-move, as pressing nothing maintains the current speed, while additional button presses are required to slow it down and make it stop. Type 2 is a much, much better option in pretty much every scenario, as the Seikret will only move with directional inputs without needing additional button presses to change the beast's speed, just like controlling the Hunter. And if you still want the Seikret to bring you to your target automatically, you can still activate Auto-move at any time, so changing the Seikret controls this way will provide you with the best traversal options the game has to offer for all sorts of situations. If you're so used to how you call the Palamute in Monster Hunter Rise, you can also change the Call Seikret Controls option so as to be able to call the Seikret by holding the circle/B button with your weapon sheated.</p>
