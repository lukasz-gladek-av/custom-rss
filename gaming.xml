                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 launched July 1, and it hasn't taken long for players to discover an infinite-damage bug for the Sorcerer class that is trivializing the ARPG's hardest content. Even worse, it's not hard to replicate.</p><p dir="ltr">As broken down by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mekuna</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/infinite-damage-strikes-again-as-diablo-4-players-overthrow-the-tyranny-of-mathematics-with-an-exploit-that-grants-sorcerers-the-power-of-the-gods-no-way-that-they-leave-that-in-the-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), the bug revolves around the Sorcerer's Enlightenment Key Passive, which can be activated by casting skills of a different element to generate Enlightenment stacks. At 100 stacks, the Sorcerer becomes Enlightened and benefits from increased damage, mana regeneration, and attack speed for a limited time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6FLFrumkg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c6FLFrumkg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's simple enough, but the passive is currently interacting with a new seasonal power, Smoldering Embers, that for some reason causes the damage bonus from Enlightenment to go through the roof when entering portals to a new area. By proccing Enlightenment right before going to a portal, the Sorcerer's elemental damage multipliers start to go up exponentially, with Mekuna's video showing how at one point, after going through several portals using the bug, his Sorcerer had plus 581,000,000,000% more Lightning damage.</p><p dir="ltr">With such absurd numbers, any enemy in Diablo 4 becomes child's play. Pit 150, the current hardest challenge in Diablo 4, can be cleared in under a minute, as everything instantly melts around a Sorcerer taking advantage of the bug.</p><p dir="ltr">"Hopefully that's going to be fixed quickly," Mekuna said in his video explaining the bugged build. "We don't need that in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days ago, players <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk6SW_yOZIg&amp;t=217s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> another bugged Sorcerer build that also took advantage of the interaction between Enlightenment and Smoldering Embers. That build, however, was much more difficult to replicate, as it required cycling Enlightenment with another modifier that, while possible, required far more precision.</p><p dir="ltr">This new version of the bugged build doesn't require any careful stacking of modifiers and is so easy that basically anyone can do it. For that reason it's almost certainly now on Blizzard's radar, but there hasn't been any official word on when a fix might be coming, though one would hope it's soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to run until September 23. In addition to letting players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">craft their own Horadric spells</a>, Season 9 brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to the game's Nightmare dungeons</a>. It didn't, however, address the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">unpopular new Reliquary battle pass system</a>.</p>

            <p>If you have already played The Last of Us Part 2 on its initial PS4 release, plus again thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">then once more on PC</a>, but still want to play through the game <em>yet again</em> but with another new twist, well now you can.</p>
<p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has today announced a free update for Part 2 Remastered across PS5 and PC, which will let you play through Ellie and Abby's stories chronologically. <strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 below. </strong></p>

<p>"Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realisations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines," Naughty Dog wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">blog post detailing this Part 2 update</a>.</p>
<p>"While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part 2's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog hopes that replaying Part 2 with Ellie and Abby's stories more interwoven like this will give players a deeper understanding and insight into the game's narrative. It noted now, players will see Ellie receive her guitar from Joel and then her learning to play in a more fluid manner.</p>
<p>Then, when it comes to Seattle, players will see just how close Ellie and Abby actually come to crossing paths as they each make their way through the city on their own journeys of revenge and grief.</p>
<p>"It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part 2's story chronologically together, given that Part 2's story is so meticulously put together," Naughty Dog said, adding new trophies have also been added as part of this update for those who complete the game in chronological order.</p>
<p>In addition to base game tweaks, this update will also include two new skins for The Last of Us Part 2's roguelike mode No Return. In a Naughty Dog crossover, players who complete The Last of Us Part 2's narrative chronologically will be able to adorn Joel in Nathan Drake of Uncharted fame's garb. Tommy, meanwhile, has got himself a Sam Drake skin.</p>

<p>"We here at Naughty Dog are so grateful for all the love and support we've seen from The Last of Us fans these last few months," Naughty Dog closed. "From the launch of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC, to The Last of Us Complete on PlayStation 5, to seeing your weekly reactions to season two of the television series, it's been such a pleasure to celebrate this moment with you."</p>
<p>As for the TV series, The Last of Us season two wrapped earlier this year, with subsequent seasons still to conclude Part 2's narrative. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Naughty Dog studio head Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping away from the adaptation</a>. Soon after, Halley Gross - who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, before also working on the show - announced she was also taking a step back from the HBO series to focus on other projects.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. Set in the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603, there’s a real Western vibe to some of the scenery and imagery that has been used for the game’s trailers.</p>
<p>That means there’s also a new Ghost to play as, named Atsu. Hers, as is so often the case for this kind of fiction, is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>
<p>Looking back on out original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima review</a>, Aran said, “Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on 20th October for PS5.</p>

<p>"Man, that was seriously lame"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You might remember prior to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>'s launch in 2022 that a bit of controversy made the rounds online regarding voice actor Hellena Taylor.</p>
<p>Taylor, who had voiced the titular protagonist in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_2">Bayonetta 2</a>, had been replaced by Jennifer Hale following a pay dispute with PlatinumGames. This was brought to the forefront by Taylor herself via a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-given-the-voice-artist-controversy-will-you-be-boycotting-bayonetta-3">video message posted to social media</a>, with the resulting fallout leading to abuse thrown left, right, and centre to Taylor, Hale, and even the series' writer, Hideki Kamiya.</p>
<p>In a new video from Kamiya, the creator addressed the fallout from the controversy in response to a fan's question, opting to avoid discussing the controversy itself, but rather the way others had treated him online following the whole drama.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was wild. My Twitter timeline was just flying by in real time – it was insane. Just nonstop scrolling. I kept blocking nonstop, though. But even my speed I couldn't keep up. So I was like 'What?! They're coming in faster than I can block them? WHAT?!'</p>
<p>"Anyway, that's not the point. People were saying whatever they wanted. Even famous people were jumping in and throwing comments at me. And then, once things calmed down, I went back and looked – and they had quietly deleted their tweets. Hey, apologise to me first before you do anything sneaky. That's some real coward s***.</p>
<p>"You posted it publicly on social media, right? So if you were wrong, you should publicly admit it. Say "Hey, I messed up" – own it. At least that's how I try to be. I may act like this, but I do have my own code. If I'm not wrong? Then no, I absolutely won't apologise. No chance. But when I am wrong, I'll own it properly.</p>
<p>"Man, that was seriously lame."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although not mentioned by Kamiya himself, one of the "famous people" he spoke about was supposedly the voice actor Bryan Dechart, who perhaps most notably played Connor in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/detroit_become_human">Detroit: Become Human</a>. As demonstrated by a screengrab shown on-screen in the video, Dechart had tweeted to Kamiya to say "Those who treat others well are treated well in return. You make us all sad. Greed is ugly".</p>
<p>Thankfully, it seems the controversy is, by and large, behind us now. Bayonetta 3 launched to widespread critical acclaim, though its future is undoubtedly uncertain following the departure from Kamiya from PlatinumGames. He is now working on a sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/okami">Okami</a> in collaboration with Capcom.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-mode-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-update-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-lets-you-play-the-story-in-chronological-order.1238361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> lets you play through the game's story in chronological order. That means instead of how the original game is structured, where you play through Ellie's three days in Seattle, followed by Abby's, you'll crisscross between them, jumping back and forth from Ellie to Abby in chronological order. </p>



<p>Anyone who has played The Last of Us Part II will know that this significantly changes how you experience the story. Controversial as it was, part of what made The Last of Us Part II a memorable game was how it challenged players to reflect on their feelings towards Abby in its back half, and to see her as more than just Joel's killer, which is all you know about her from the beginning of the game's story up until you swap to playing as her after the end of Ellie's third day in Seattle.</p>



<p>There's also an extremely significant scene between Ellie and Joel that takes place in Jackson, the day before he dies, that makes for an extremely impactful moment at the end of the game when it is revealed. Now, that scene will come at the very beginning, and like everything else that is getting switched around, it'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how many of the game's powerful moments retain their strength, or lose it, due to this new order. </p>



<p>"<em>Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby's motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines,</em>" writes Jonathan Dornbush, editorial manager at Naughty Dog in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/">PlayStation Blog post</a> announcing the update. </p>



<p>"<em>While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted Part II's themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Through the new chronological mode, we believe players will gain deeper insight into Part II's narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted at guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby's crisscrossing journeys. You'll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their actions impact each other, and more</em>."</p>



<p>The update is out today, on PlayStation and PC, and also includes a number of bug fixes and performance updates. It also includes new skins for Joel and Tommy for the game's No Return mode. Joel gets an outfit making him look like Nathan Drake from Uncharted, while Tommy gets to don the look of Nate's brother, Sam Drake.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you're like me, and don't understand who would want this in the first place after playing the story as it was originally intended to be experienced, then you don't have to fret, since it is an optional mode that you can ignore whenever you return to The Last of Us Part II. And if you've never played The Last of Us Part II before, Naughty Dog still recommends you play it the way it was originally developed, before diving into this new mode.</p>



<p>"<em>It was no small feat to bring The Last of Us Part II's story chronologically together, given that Part II's story is so meticulously put together. We're grateful to the developers both at Naughty Dog and our partners at Nixxes to make the chronological mode as smooth as possible. And while we of course recommend players still new to the game to play through Part II's story as was originally developed, the team's hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter</em>."</p>



<p>You can jump into this new mode once you've downloaded the update, or, if Naughty Dog's history is anything to go by, you can wait until the seemingly inevitable The Last of Us Part II Remastered: Chronological Mode Remake is announced and play it then.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Naughty Dog has released a new update for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered&nbsp;</em>that allows you to experience the game's harrowing story of revenge in a completely new way.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the rather appropriately-named Chronological Experience lets you play through&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>'s narrative in chronological order, rather than in the non-linear fashion in which it's originally presented.</p>

<p>The studio says that while the original structure is "very intentional and core to how [Naughty Dog] wanted&nbsp;<em>Part II</em>'s themes and narrative beats to impact players", the new Chronological mode will grant players "even deeper insight into&nbsp;<em>Part II</em>'s narrative".</p>

<p>The studio does stress that it still recommends newcomers play through&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>"as was originally developed", but that the new story mode is a "fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter".</p>

<p>It's not just the new mode, either. If you complete a Chronological playthrough, you'll be rewarded with&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>-themed skins for Joel and Tommy in the game's No Return mode. There's a Nathan Drake skin for Joel, as well as a skin based on Drake's brother Sam for Tommy.</p>

<p>The Chronological update is available now for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>on both PC and PS5, and you'll also find "a host of additional bug fixes and performance improvements" contained in the update.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>news, co-creator Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-steps-down-hbo-the-last-of-us" rel="nofollow">vacated his creative role</a> on the successful HBO show in order to spend more time with Naughty Dog.

No, it’s not like there was a recent golden era where the news bulletins were packed with incessant good cheer, but we’re a species that’s still reeling from the trauma of covid, inundated by news of wars, suffering, and the inevitable consequences of capitalism’s unchecked overreach, all while major nations elect cruel people incapable of tying their own shoelaces. </p><p>As I looked through the feeds and wires this morning, it all just felt too heavy. And honestly, under that weight, I couldn’t bring myself to plaster on a smile and report the (genuinely fun) news that Crocs are partnering with Nintendo to make <em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed plastic shoes. But no! I’m not going to let all the bad news squish me, and I don’t want it to squish you either. So instead I’ve put together a bunch of things that make me smile, that I want to share and hopefully cause you to smile too.</p><h2 id="h47242"><a id=""></a>Slings &amp; Arrows</h2><p>If you’ve met me in real life, there’s a very strong chance I’ve already recommended 2003's <em>Slings &amp; Arrows </em>to you, complete with terrible attempts on my part to deliver lines like main character Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross). Fortunately, you’ve likely been spared this, and instead I’ve put the scene I love to quote from above.</p><p><em>Slings &amp; Arrows</em> was a Canadian TV show, set in a fictional theater that hosts the annual New Burbage Shakespeare Festival. However, moments before the new season was due to start, director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) dies. The festival is forced to beg the return of Geoffrey Tennant, a former actor and director who left New Burbage after a massive falling out and a following  stint in a psychiatric facility. Each of the three six-episode seasons follows Tennant’s attempts to put on a specific Shakespeare play, battling against money-men, egos, and perhaps most of all, the ghost of Oliver Welles.</p><p>It is one of the most extraordinary pieces of television ever made. Its love for and knowledge of Shakespeare makes it an education, and its dark humor ensures it always feels punchy and passionate. Alongside the incredible Paul Gross (<em>Due South</em>’s Benton Fraser) is Martha Burns as Ellen Fanshaw, an actor coming to terms with now playing Gertrude rather than Ophelia, and <em>The Kids in the Hall</em>’s Mark McKinney as Richard Smith-Jones, a desperately useless manager who fails to please everyone.</p><p>All three seasons are a joy. Nearly every relationship is antagonistic, especially those between Geoffrey and absolutely everyone else, and yet the love and care and depth of understanding from the cast shines through it all in every moment. It is a thing of beauty that’ll make you want to understand Shakespeare more, just so you can feel like part of the gang. And if not, you’ve always got the glorious Seán Cullen’s sot critic, Basil, to have your back.</p><p>It’s not always easy to find these days, but <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/0MNKEGPHP8XR0XYEU7AEBEUBW6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/saints-row-4-homestar-runner-sherlock-holmes-1851785792&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">right now you can buy it via Amazon</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h47243"><a id=""></a>Saints Row IV</h2><p>I will not tire of celebrating <em>Saints Row IV</em> in a world where I feel like this game gets short shrift. Here’s my declaration: <em>Saints Row IV</em> is funny in the most enormously elaborate ways. It’s a game that exists to make you laugh on  a vast scale. It feels like something that shouldn’t have been able to happen in an industry that’s so focused on the necessity of producing massive hits that it tends to shave the corners off everything to appeal to the widest audience possible. But <em>SRIV</em> thrives in its stupidity.</p><p>This is a game that begins with you disarming a nuclear missile you’re clung to while it’s in flight, crashing through the roof of the White House to be president, and then watching helpless as the entire world is destroyed by invading aliens. That’s the opening sequence. The rest of the game is set in a digital reproduction of the city from <em>Saints Row III</em>, all for the amusement of a tiresome alien overlord who comes across like a gormless boss who has no idea how disliked he is by his employees. Oh, and you now have superpowers.</p><p>This is a game that asked, “What if you could just do what you like?” Some people found it too much, too un-serious. I find it just a complete joy. And it helps that it delivers all these histrionics with the most incredible dialogue and acting. It’s just so, so funny. This is a game that gets the original actors back to re-enact the classic fight scene from <em>They Live</em> for <em>literally no sensible reason</em>. It just exists to be daft. And its closing joke over the credits made me laugh so hard I had tears streaming down my face.</p><p><em>Saints Row IV</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/206420/Saints_Row_IV_ReElected/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/206420/Saints_Row_IV_ReElected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently $5 in the Steam sale</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h47244"><a id=""></a>A Good Hang With Amy Poehler</h2><p>I strongly suspect that A Good Hang With Amy Poehler exists for the very same reason this article does. Poehler makes clear her express wish that this new podcast offer friendly laughter in a world on fire. And it succeeds.</p><p>The weekly show is 18 episodes in, which means both that there’s an excellent pool to choose from, and that you’re not arriving so late as to be daunted by the backlog. Guests have included Jack Black, Paul Rudd, Michelle Obama, and Quinta Brunson. And Will Forte, Natasha Lyonne, Seth Meyers and Idris Elba. And Martin Short. Oh, and Kathryn Hahn. Look, she gets the <em>best</em> guests. And the purpose of the conversation is just to cheerfully reminisce, tell funny tales, and goof around.</p><p>It’s so low stakes as to be glorious, and Poehler’s positivity and eagerness to listen causes everyone to be incredibly human. In most episodes it’s two friends catching up, which removes all the Celebrity Interview nonsense, so much so that guests often forget to plug anything. The latest episode, which went up just moments before I started writing, features Andy Samberg, and I just cannot wait to hear the two of them fondly remembering <em>SNL</em> and making each other laugh.</p><h2 id="h47245"><a id=""></a>Homestar Runner</h2><p>You either know and adore <em>Homestar Runner</em> and are wondering why someone would even think this needed recommending, or you’ve not heard of it and are about to become the former. </p><p><em>HSR</em> is, astonishingly, 25 years old now. It began as a Flash cartoon in 2000, an early internet phenomenon created by two brothers, Matt and Mike Chapman (The Brothers Chaps). It was, from the start, both incredibly funny and deeply strange. Its incredible cast of characters, almost entirely voiced by the incredibly versatile Matt Chapman, includes the eponymous doofus Homestar Runner, the wonderfully brash and cynical Strong Bad (and his pet, The Cheat), the greedy and corpulent King Of Town, and my favorite, the implausible and unbound-by-reality Homsar.</p><p>As well as being the most essential website of the early internet, it also spun off a series of Telltale-made episodic adventure games, and most recently a spoof point-and-click called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2023/09/dangeresque-the-roomisode-triungulate/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2023/09/dangeresque-the-roomisode-triungulate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate</em></a></span>. The latter has so many layers of <em>HSR</em> in-jokes as to be impenetrable to anyone but long-term fans, but gosh, there are so many long-term fans.</p><p>The great thing is, nearly everything from the original Flash site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@homestarrunnerdotcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been preserved on YouTube</a></span>, with new cartoons still occasionally being made and uploaded there.

This gorgeous point-and-click adventure tells a new tale of Sherlock Holmes, following the adventures chronicled in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s novels, living in retirement after the First World War. When his erstwhile partner Watson returns from the front lines, Holmes welcomes him to his new Sussex home. Both are now elderly men, and Holmes—living in his rural idyll—is reflecting on just what a complete shit he was to Watson throughout his life. He simply wants to put together a picnic for his lifelong friend, so he can have a moment to tell the doctor what their friendship means to him.</p><p>You could interpret this as quite twee, but creator Helen Greetham is an expert in all things Sherlock Holmes, and by rooting the game in the stories—most especially by cleverly evoking the events at the end of the short story “The Adventure of the Three Garridebs”—Holmes’s motivations are grounded and understandable.</p><p>Sherlock Holmes tales are one of my happy places—most nights I’ll fall asleep listening to 1960s radio plays based on the stories, because they’re the perfect mix of gently entertaining and soporific. So yes, this is my wheelhouse. But I’m hardly alone! <em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> understands the underlying gentleness of Doyle’s writing which often lies concealed just beneath Holmes’s acerbic nature, how he gives us a world in which smartness and wit always outdo cruelty and greed. Part of the game’s genius is that it gives us a tale of Holmes that exists entirely without the latter.</p><p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2248890/The_Beekeepers_Picnic__A_Sherlockian_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently $11 in the Steam sale</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/saints-row-4-homestar-runner-sherlock-holmes-1851785792]]></content:encoded>

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [5,021 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Naughty Dog [312 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> have released a free update for <em><a title="Games > The Last of Us Part II Remastered [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a></em> today that lets players experience the story chronologically, the companies <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-978036"></span></p><p>Here are the details:</p><blockquote><p>Available for players as part of a downloadable update today, we’ve introduced a new way to play the story of <em><a title="Games > The Last of Us Part I [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-i">The Last of Us Part I</a>I</em> like never before—chronologically.</p><p>Those who have already played will know its story is told non-linearly, as Ellie and Abby’s motivations, realizations, and emotional stakes unfold across myriad flashbacks and present-day storylines. While this structure is very intentional and core to how our studio wanted <em>Part II</em>‘s themes and narrative beats to impact players, we always wondered what it would be like to experience this story chronologically. And now finally, we can answer that question.</p><p>Through the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into <em>Part II</em>‘s narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abby’s crisscrossing journeys. You’ll see just how close they come into running into each other, how their <a title="Genres > Action [2,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s impact each other, and more.</p><p>It was no small feat to bring <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>‘s story chronologically together, given that <em>Part II</em>‘s story is so meticulously put together. We’re grateful to the developers both at Naughty Dog and our partners at Nixxes to make the Chronological mode as smooth as possible. And while we of course recommend players still new to the game to play through <em>Part II</em>‘s story as was originally developed, the team’s hard work has paid off with a fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>And we also wanted to reward players for jumping into this new, transformative approach to our story. In addition to new trophies tied to completing the narrative experience in chronological order, doing so will also unlock two new, perhaps surprisingly familiar skins…</p><p>Yes, that’s right, play as Joel dressed as Nathan Drake and Tommy as Sam Drake in No Return. Particularly as we celebrate Naughty Dog’s 40th anniversary this year, we love getting the chance to spotlight and share in the history of our studio that we love as much as we know you do. These skins will be unlocked for completing the narrative in Chronological, and will be usable in No Return, <em>Part II Remastered</em>‘s thrilling <a title="Genres > Roguelike [343 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> <a title="Genres > Survival [434 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> mode.</p><p>A new update for <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em> is available today on both <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,867 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> (via Patch 2.1.0) and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,632 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via Steam and the <a title="Companies > Epic Games [352 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store (via Patch 1.5), bringing with it the Chronological mode, as well as a host of additional bug fixes and performance improvements.</p><p>We here at Naughty Dog are so grateful for all the love and support we’ve seen from <em>The Last of Us</em> fans these last few months. From the launch of <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em> on PC, to <em>The Last of Us Complete</em> on PlayStation 5, to seeing your weekly reactions to season 2 of the television series, it’s been such a pleasure to celebrate this moment with you.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em> is available now for PlayStation 5 and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-update-now-available]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m a middle-aged man. I think? I’m not totally clear when middle age starts, and, as a queer trans man living through this particular phase of history and capitalism, a lot of the markers of middle-aged manhood don’t feel like they apply to me. But as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/wwn0ao/you_guys_know_the_joke_every_man_when_he_hits_30/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joke</a> goes, I’m definitely into that age where men seem to get into wars or meat, and I’m not that into meat.</p><p>OK, I’m not that into wars either. Over the holiday weekend, I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmV1QTzfyRo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very good YouTube video</a> about labor history and the games industry. The video mentions Reconstruction, which made me realize that we learned very little about it when I was in school in Connecticut in the 90s. This made me realize that actually I don’t know very much about the Civil War either, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-simpsons-christmas-disney-plus-derren-brown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beyond</a> having researched religion around that time period due to an interest in <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/seances-in-the-red-room" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiritualism</a> and other faith movements that came out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Awakening#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Great Awakenings</a>. (America is very good at making weird religions.)&nbsp;</p><p>I did once go to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/anti/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Antietam</a> when I was on a <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bike trip</a> from Pittsburgh to DC, but that was less out of interest in historic battlefields and more because it was a national park that was too along my way to miss out on. As very much not a wars guy, I was surprised to find my time there meditative and interesting; I biked around the giant battlefield and read all the informative signs and learned a lot.</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>Despite how deeply middle-aged man coded biking a Civil War battlefield is, I have never seen the famed <a href="https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-civil-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Burns <em>Civil War</em></a> miniseries. Watching an 11-hour documentary about a war is <em>definitely</em> a middle-aged man thing to do, maybe even more so on a patriotic holiday weekend when the other option is grilling meat, which I did not do because I was watching the documentary instead. I’m about halfway through <em>Civil War</em>; so far the most interesting part is seeing all the historical photographs in one place. &nbsp;</p><p>I was also introduced for the first time to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Foote" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shelby Foote</a>, a Southern writer with a cliche accent who spends his copious screentime telling suspiciously charming anecdotes about the Confederacy. I got <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ltdd65sa4c26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">curious</a> about what precisely his deal was and looked him up, and his deal was not great! He appears to have been a proponent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Cause_of_the_Confederacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Cause</a> idea, something I <em>also</em> didn’t know very much about having grown up in the north. So then I spent a while learning about that, which means now I side-eye Foote whenever he comes on-screen. I feel like I had always heard of the Ken Burns documentary spoken about as some gold standard for historical documentaries, so learning all the ways it’s <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-we-need-new-civil-war-documentary-180971996/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspect</a> was definitely eye-opening, but also had the consequence of making me want to learn more about how narratives of the Civil War have been shaped over time.</p><p>That led me to a book about <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674008199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memory</a> and the Civil War, which I’m excited to get from the library to add to my current pile of library books whose due dates are rapidly coming up. But that book also led me to a book full of <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469621821/gods-almost-chosen-peoples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sources on religion</a> <em>during</em> the war, which I could not resist, and then, because it was by the same publisher and so came up when I was browsing its catalogue, a book about <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469633435/guaranteed-pure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism and the Moody Bible Institute</a>, which has nothing to do with any of this but sounds interesting as hell. On the one hand, “pile of books about history” is a very middle-aged man thing to have, but on the other, “too many books to read” makes me feel like I’m in grad school again, which makes me feel young.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond Shelby Foote, the documentary is a lot of war stuff, with generals whom I keep getting mixed up and lots of information about how battles work. I sometimes found it confusing to follow precisely why battles went the ways they did or what people were doing during them, with lots of mentions of walls and hills and troop movement that I struggled to picture. <em>This</em> made me wonder exactly how Civil War battles worked, a question I had two ways of answering because I’m definitely not going to read a book about military strategy: calling my military veteran sister, or trying to find a video game about it.</p><p>Luckily for me, there’s a Steam sale on right now, which meant scrolling through the war games on sale until I decided to pick up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502520/Ultimate_General_Civil_War/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ultimate General: Civil War</em></a>. It’s an RTS, one of the game genres I’m the least familiar with, but it looked full of nitty-gritty battlefield stuff and also appeared to have a pause button and lots of big arrows to make me feel like I might be able to understand it. Having played it for about an hour, and then spent another hour scrolling through YouTube for “teach me to play this game like I’ve never played an RTS before” explainers, do I understand Civil War battles any better? I do not.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Ultimate General: Civil War</em> doesn’t have a tutorial, which Luke told me is because it came out of the <em>Total War</em> modding scene and so assumes some familiarity with the genre. In the first level, I played as the Union attempting to capture a town; after my superior forces cleared some Confederates off a hill and reinforcements arrived, things swiftly went off the rails as we approached the town. I do not understand what my different guys do and how to position them strategically, given the lack of military understanding that gave rise to my buying the game in the first place, so I decided to just play it like I’d play a shooter and send my guys straight through the enemy. This made the Confederates retreat to the main part of town, which requires crossing two narrow bridges to access. I posted my forces up near each bridge and watched all the little guys exchange brutal fire, trying to keep them all in ammo with my painfully slow-moving supply wagons. Eventually I got sick of all this and just rushed the town, sending all my guys over the bridges to their dooms. I restarted the level, determined to do better, but did <em>not</em> do better at all, getting chaotically jammed up at the bridges again and burning through soldiers and ammo while all the little guys yelled and ran around.</p><p>It’s a hell of a way to introduce a video game rather than some kind of hand-holding “click this, move here” tutorial, but it did, probably unintentionally, help me better visualize the chaos and violence the Ken Burns documentary talks about and the terrain that gave rise to it. I tried to watch some more YouTube videos about the game, which means my YouTube recommendations are now full of war gaming playthroughs. Alongside the performances of traditional music that fill my feed because I’m learning <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-a-mandolin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandolin</a>, my YouTube recommendations are painting a very particular picture of who YouTube thinks I am these days that feels far, far removed from who I <em>actually</em> am, a New York City-dwelling punk anarchist who doesn’t own any clothes that aren’t black.</p><p>So now I am a middle-aged man with a pile of history books to read in between playing a historical war RTS, all because of a YouTube video about video games. This is not at all how I expected my Fourth of July weekend to go, and not at all how old I expected to feel coming out of it, but here we are. How long will it be until I develop a Tony Soprano style <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/comments/n7ddr8/tony_and_the_history_channel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interest</a> in The History Channel? Am I going to have to learn to grill? Am I going to have to stop wearing skinny jeans, or are they themselves<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-millennials-defense-of-skinny-jeans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a marker of middle-age</a>? Is this how age comes for me, alongside worrying about my cholesterol and a recent conversation with my dad about my long-dormant 401ks? What’s happening to me? Who am I?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While I regret the student loan debt that has followed me into middle age, one thing I miss about academia is the way one question or source can lead to another and another. It’s a reminder that there are so many things going on in the world that I don’t know about yet, but which other people do and can teach me about. As a middle-aged man who lives alone and is single, I often worry about getting too dug into my habits and opinions. So at least finding myself going from learning about video games to learning about the entire project of America’s revisionist historical memory feels like a relieving sign that I’m not too far gone.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-microsoft-vested-unvested-shares-stocks"><h3>Xbox’s ‘Golden Handcuffs’ Are Screwing Over Laid Off Workers</h3></a><p>'Unvested shares' are something I didn't even understand last week but this week have been floored by</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-kotaku-sold-endless-mode-microsoft"><h3>Games Media Actually Had A Good Week, For Once</h3></a><p>"Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In the last nine years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-by-daylight/" data-ref-id="5000-452548">Dead by Daylight</a> has crossed over with numerous horror franchises, so it was inevitable that The Walking Dead would be added to their number. Now, that collaboration is around the corner and three of The Walking Dead's heroes will enter Dead by Daylight.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has shared a teaser trailer for the Dead by Daylight x The Walking Dead collaboration which re-envisions some aspects of the latter's opening credits sequence with the show's iconic theme.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4TdvV46ZS4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K4TdvV46ZS4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rick Grimes and Michonne are being added as new survivors, while Daryl Dixon will enter the game through a legendary outfit from The Walking Dead collection. Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus are reprising their roles as Rick and Daryl for voiceovers in the game. Danai Gurira--who starred as Michonne in The Walking Dead--wasn't mentioned by name in the announcement.</p><p>Inside the game, Rick will have three specific perks including the ability to lure the killer away away after unhooking survivors who were captured. Michonne's perks include the ability to temporarily heal herself after healing other survivors.</p><p>In addition to the Daryl Dixon legendary outfit, there will be multiple options for Rick and Michonne. Both characters will have uncommon recolors, while players using Rick can choose between his Last Day on Earth outfit or his Brutal Awakening outfit. Michonne has her Next World outfit and What We Become outfit as well.</p><p>A handful of the show's famous settings--including the prison from seasons 3 and 4 and the locked hospital doors that say "Don't Open, Dead Inside"--will be recreated in a new map tile that will appear when either Rick or Michonne are added into the Garden of Joy map.</p><p>Dead by Daylight x The Walking Dead is currently playable in beta testing, with the full release to follow on July 29.</p>

This upgrade gives the smallest Switch a far superior display to the one it ships with, but the modder wasn't content to stop there; he's also been working on another update which introduces support for HDMI-out.</p>
<p>It has not been an easy journey, as Taki Udon points out on social media. "18 months of R&amp;D, just as many failed revisions, and more than $200K in costs. SUPER5 OLED HDMI is finally done," he says. "This is the first fully assembled device in the world. You can't imagine how relieved I am that it works. This was the most difficult project I've ever worked on."</p>
<p>The modder goes on to explain the <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942600677542486340">mental anguish</a> this particular venture has caused him. "I can't describe how soul-crushing it was to go through so many failed revisions. After the 3rd failure, I was hopeful every subsequent version would be successful, but they weren't. And when you do fail, you are looking at a minimum of 2 weeks to try again."</p>

<p>As you can see in the video above, plugging the Switch Lite into an external screen automatically turns off the console's main display and instantly sends the image to the connected display. Sadly, it's not possible to have the image on both screens at the same time, as <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942595350403113160">Taki Udon says</a> the signal "wasn't stable" with dual input.</p>
<p>Taki Udon also reveals that this project is unlikely to recoup its costs, given the sheer amount of time and materials that have gone into getting to this stage. "I gave up on recoup after the 3rd revision failed," <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942590890671043020">he says.</a></p>
<p>The modder – who also produced the excellent <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/reviews/mister-pi-a-usd99-gateway-to-fpga-retro-gaming">MiSTer Pi</a> and is currently working on the <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/01/heres-your-best-look-yet-at-taki-udons-superstation-one-fpga-ps1-and-you-can-order-it-now">SuperStation</a> system – then <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1942596968464970095">reveals</a> that he plans to create an OLED mod for the Switch 2 next.</p>

        <p>Previous reports appeared to suggest the platform holders might have deep sixed 'Gwangju Running Man'</p>

            <p>Valve say a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-warband">Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</a> mod which reportedly misrepresented the events of the South Korean Gwangju Uprising was pulled offline worldwide by its creator, with the folks behind Steam only having blocked its distribution in South Korea.</p>
<p>The mod, reported on by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-banning-steam-mod-for-depicting-historical-revisionism/">Automaton</a> yesterday, was called "Gwangju Running Man" and was a total conversion that turned Mount and Blade's medieval warfare into an apparently warped depiction of 1980's student-led protests against the military coup of Chun Doo-hwan, which were violently supressed by the country's army. Around 200 people are estimated to have been killed during <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/05/nx-s1-5215788/south-korea-martial-law">the uprising</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>However, despite records to the contrary, as well as the South Korean government <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2172098/gwanju-apology-south-korea-sorry-rape-and-torture-committed">apologising in 2018 for military atrocities</a> during the protests, Automaton cites the Korean Yonhap News Agency as reporting that Gwangju Running Man "depicted protesters as armed and violent criminals, thus framing the military regime’s brutality as justified."</p>
<p>As you can imagine, deliberately rewriting a key moment in <a href="https://jacobin.com/2020/06/gwangju-uprising-korean-war-seventieth-anniversary">South Korea's history and fight against being ruled by US-backed dictatorships</a> in such a way made the mod very controversial.</p>
<p>It's since disappeared from Steam Workshop, with Valve having clarified that the mod's creator was responsible for it being pulled worldwide, while the company had only moved to block access to the mod in South Korea. Initial reports had appeared to suggest Valve may have been behind the worldwide takedown, at the request of South Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee, but instead it seems the company have dealt with this in a manner that more closely mirrors their previously established modus operandi.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-content-restrictions-removed">modus operandi</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-abdication-of-responsibility-over-steam-is-the-worst-possible-solution">for better or worse</a>, is to "allow everything onto the Steam Store, except for things that we decide are illegal, or straight up trolling", with this mod looking like it fell into the first category in South Korea specifically. </p>
<p>Here's hoping the next time Mount &amp; Blade: Warband modding hits the news, it's for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modder-superior-mount-blade-warband-game-of-thrones">something cool</a>, rather than what looks to have been offensive and far-right leaning utter bollocks.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-say-controversial-mount-blade-warband-mod-accused-of-historical-revisionism-was-taken-down-by-creator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I don't regret the many years I've spent not playing MMOs, but I do regret not taking part in the Great Hobbit Run. It's an annual event hosted by Twitch streamer BurkeBlack in which hobbit players of Standing Stone and Daybreak's absolutely ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord Of The Rings Online</a> try to walk all the way to Mount Doom, without taking on any quests. Which is to say, while doing the bare minimum of levelling up. </p>
<p>This year is the first year the community have made it to Sauron's hellmouth, and what better way to celebrate than by throwing themselves immediately into the lava. Here's the full video - skip to the end (or click <a href="https://x.com/0BurkeBlack0/status/1942510906698613112">this Xitter link</a>) for some footage of ecstatic burning Hobbits.

<p>The full journey took seven hours, rather than the estimated six months (plus Rivendell layover) it took Frodo and company in the book. Frodo was a wimp, clearly.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/after-3-years-of-attempts-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmos-great-hobbit-run-is-finally-successful-as-a-band-of-tutorial-level-hobbits-make-it-to-mount-doom-and-celebrate-by-jumping-into-lava/">PCGamer</a>'s Scott McCrae, the area around Mount Doom is a level 112 zone. One can only imagine the feats of evasion and/or brassnecked brute-forcing necessary to navigate that landscape without putting in the customary grinding. As McCrae comments, it's lovely to encounter this kind of community commitment to a bit, given the recent dismal fortunes of always-online games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>.</p>
<p>Are there any always-online pilgrimages you're a part of? Now is the time to pull up a chair and sing us a tale of virtual misadventure. The only such thing I've dabbled with is Back To Lordran, the annual feast of jolly cooperation among <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> players, but I'm also reminded distantly of how Elite: Dangerous players have collaborated to map their game's enormous galaxy.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-players-finally-complete-the-great-hobbit-run-by-incinerating-themselves-in-mount-doom]]></content:encoded>

In 2017, <em>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony </em>seemingly ended Spike Chunsoft’s murder mystery series with a decisive metacommentary about letting art die with dignity. Four years later, after creative director Kazutaka Kodaka left the company, Spike Chunsoft released the obvious cash grab <em>Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp</em>, a gacha game universally maligned for stomping all over the series’ legacy (and for being a mediocre video game). Since then, the series has mostly gone away, with Kodaka releasing several <em>Danganronpa</em>-like projects over at his new studio, Too Kyo Games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span>. For years, it seemed like <em>Danganronpa </em>might be well and truly dead, until last night when one of the stars of the series’ English dubs posted a cryptic tweet that has put the community in a tizzy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,197544" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Brian Beacock, the English voice behind Monokuma, the series’ masochistic teddy bear villain, posted a tweet of the evil animatronic bear laughing, with the caption “11.25.2025.” There’s no other context for this in the post, so fans have a lot of empty space in which to speculate.

If a new <em>Danganronpa </em>game were coming, it seems unlikely that the first tease would be from one of the English voice actors, rather than some kind of worldwide, coordinated effort from Spike Chunsoft.

            <p>FromSoftware has announced the existing Everdark Sovereigns in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will rotate round again before any new additions arrive.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">more challenging variants of existing Nightlord bosses</a> were introduced at the end of June, with one Sovereign available to face each week. It began with the Gaping Jaw boss, and was then followed by Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight.</p>
<p>Now, these three bosses will rotate again in pairs, before the remaining bosses are added in their Sovereign form.</p>

<p>The rotation will begin this week as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>10th July - 17th July: Gaping Jaw and Darkdrift Knight</li>
<li>17th July - 24th July: Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight</li>
<li>24th July - 31st July: Gaping Jaw and Sentient Pest</li>
</ul>
<p>Note you won't face them as a pair, just both bosses will be available to challenge.</p>
<p>"The Everdark cycle continues, and the Night grows deeper still," reads a social media post from the studio. "The Everdark Sovereigns Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will be the next abominations to lay waste to Limveld."</p> <div>

<p>The timing for these new bosses is still to be announced, but won't be at least until the end of this month.</p>
<p>The new rotation is all part of FromSoftware's live service aspirations for Nightreign, as it continues to update the game.</p>
<p>Still, players are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">awaiting the promised two player mode</a> that's due "at a later date".</p>

<p>Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to its hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, which I described as "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour" in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Beyond sharing more about Atsu's quest for vengeance, we're excited to show off her new weapons, new ways to personalise your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more," Sucker Punch's senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei is set to launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October. As mentioned, the game will focus on Atsu and her quest for vengeance. She is hunting down a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six, you see.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sucker Punch teased earlier this year</a>. "She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito."</p>
<p>Personally, I am really looking forward to finding out more. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-confirmed-for-thursday-by-playstation]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I love to see a video game full of janky anime absurdity, but there has to be heart and soul behind that absurdity. Anime culture is so inherently Japanese, not only in it’s origin but in it’s meaning and it’s DNA. When someone who doesn’t come from that Japanese culture attempts to emulate it, you need to hope they respect and understand its depth to do it justice. KinnikuNeko: SUPER MUSCLE CAT,&nbsp;despite being developed by a sole artist in Barcelona, is thoroughly and passionately tapped into what makes anime culture click.</p>
<p><iframe title="KinnikuNeko: SUPER MUSCLE CAT - Consoles Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ix9QOX4E1AM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At first glance, KinnikuNeko&nbsp;is eye-roll inducing with how on-the-nose its whole anime shtick is. References to Evangelion,&nbsp;Sega&nbsp;and more are tossed at you constantly as the game introduces your trio of protagonists. There’s a ditzy girl named Lemon, a shy nerd with a heart of gold named Keita, and the titular KinnikuNeko. KinnikuNeko is just a cat, nothing else. Except for when he puts on a pair of magical alien underwear and transforms into a shredded humanoid bodybuilder with an adorable kitty face. You know, standard cat stuff. The trio team up to prevent an alien invasion of Earth, prompting you to dive into a few hours of platforming action to face that threat.</p>


<p>The platforming in KinnikuNeko&nbsp;is simple enough, although there’s some variety tossed into it via your feline hero’s multiple forms. By finding Lemon in various spots of the level, you can swap between regular cat mode or buff cat mode. The former can make huge jumps and cling to walls, but can’t fight enemies at all. The latter can tussle with Yatterman&nbsp;inspired baddies and lift weights to progress at certain points. I wish this element of the game was less restrictive, though – needing to find Lemon just to swap is a needless complication, and her very presence at key points in each level basically implies that you’re required to swap forms there to progress.</p>


<p>Even in the correct form, though, the game tossed out platforming challenges that left me far more frustrated than excited. Certain jumps and platforming challenges require hyper-specific timing that are far too punishing compared to the flow of earlier levels in the game. Often times, moving platforms would feel like they failed to register a landing on their corner, leading to so many annoying deaths where I thought I landed safely only to be proven wrong by the games inconsistent physics. It’s mostly worth suffering through these ill-designed platforming sections for the zany cutscene antics that book-end them, but by the end of the game’s 3 or 4 hour runtime, I felt like I was craving far more story shenanigans and far fewer platforming challenges.</p>
<p>Overall,&nbsp;KinnikuNeko: SUPER MUSCLE CAT&nbsp;knows what it’s about. This is a game steeped in obscure and obnoxiously wacky anime culture and it owns it from start to finish. It’s just a shame that, for all that cultural care and consideration, the accompanying gameplay feels tolerable at best and punishing at worst.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		KinnikuNeko: SUPER MUSCLE CAT is a bizarre game that pays homage to it's otaku roots with full voice and no hesitation. The platforming gameplay falters pretty frequently, but it's worth the trouble to experience such a wild and clearly fan-driven experience.	</p></div>

			<p>Xbox Game Pass is reportedly profitable even when factoring in loss sales of first-party titles available on the service, according to a known business journalist.</p>



<p>Providing a clarification on yesterday's statement revealing that Xbox Game Pass is profitable, taking fees paid to third parties, marketing, and service costs into account, but not lost sales of first-party titles, The Game Business founder Chris Dring stated today on <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring">X</a> that the subscription service is profitable even when factoring these lost sales. 18 months ago, the journalist checked with Xbox what's included in the Game Pass P&amp;L, and was told that first-party games have their own P&amp;L separate to Game Pass as they make money via other means, which may have meant that Xbox Game Pass was profitable but potentially also put pressure on the margins for first-party games, possibly with some studios not making much profit, if any at all. All this, however, was before Xbox games started being released on other consoles, as studios can now make more margins on premium sales. Regardless of all the information above, sources have reached out to Chris Dring to confirm that, even if lost sales of first-party titles and related microtranscations are taken into account, Xbox Game Pass is still profitable.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Xbox Game Pass's profitability and the impact it has been having on the industry as a whole have been a point of discussion since the service's launch a few years back. No matter its profitability, the impact in terms of loss sales seems to be big, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">estimated</a> earlier this year that games available via the subscription service can lose has much as 80% of their expected premium sales on Xbox consoles, as was highlighted by how games like Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Starfield failed to make a real splash on sales charts. On the other hand, a multiplatform game available on Xbox Game Pass can have a beneficial impact, as it can be accompanied by increased sales on another format.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-deep-dive-announced-for-july-2025/">announcing</a> that Ghost of Yotei would be getting a dedicated State of Play event sometime this month, PlayStation has announced when that State of Play will happen, and it'll take place just two days from now at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>In a new<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/"> PlayStation Blog post</a>, PlayStation has confirmed that the Ghost of Yotei State of Play will take place this Thursday, July 10, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BST / 11pm CEST. The presentation will be a 20-minute-long deep-dive on Ghost of Yotei's gameplay, and will feature the creative directors from Sucker Punch, Nate Fox and Jason Connell, discussing the gameplay, and showing off "<em>new weapons, new ways to personalize your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more</em>," the blog post reads.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We now have less than 100 days to go from now until Ghost of Yotei's previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, release date. The follow-up to Sucker Punch's 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Tsushima currently carries the full weight of PlayStation's first-party fall lineup, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">Marathon was delayed</a> from its original September release date and a new release date for it was not announced. </p>



<p>At the time of this writing, the rest of the major games that'll be available to PlayStation players are coming from third-party developers, though of course, there's still time for PlayStation to announce another first-party title coming before the end of the year. Astro Bot, last year's GOTY at The Game Awards wasn't announced until the midway point of the year. That said, we're already past that, so it'll be interesting to see if Sony does have anything else up its sleeve, or if Ghost of Yotei gets to hog the entire fall/winter spotlight for PlayStation.</p>

Some Catholics believe in first, second, and third class relics, just like the Ghostbusters’ numbering system for haunted artifacts, but it’s hard to find strict, codified definitions by the Church. Because the cards don’t belong to Pope Leo XIV and aren’t regularly used by him, but have come into contact with his hands, they might count as third class relics. It’s unclear if that means they’re banned at official tournaments. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pope-leo-xiv-pokemon-card-autograph-popplio-meme-1851785788]]></content:encoded>

                <p>As ICE raids continue to take place across the US, an itch.io bundle has been set up to help raise funds for two organizations. The first is the LA-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a "next-generation social justice law firm that defends our immigrant communities against injustices in the immigration system," as described on its <a href="https://www.immdef.org/about" rel="nofollow ">website</a>.

The twins share a single body, but are conjoined in such a way that Arora is almost riding atop Otto's shoulders, pointed in another direction, thus giving the killers more coverage when they're prowling for players in shadows, lockers, or barrels.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfcv30W857o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qfcv30W857o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Otto wields a chainsaw, while Arora lobs toxic chemicals at players. Together, they have a 360-degree field of vision, which will make sneaking around much harder. Red Barrels says the pair combine to make up "the most difficult Prime Asset [players] have yet faced."</p><p>With a new season tends to come a <strong>new map</strong>, and that's true once more. This time, players will be exploring a shopping mall, which will host both the new Trial, or main mission, Kill The Politician, as well as additional MK-Challenges, which play out like shorter missions in similar environments.</p><p>The new season will also come with a new catalog, the game's free battle pass-like system of gruesome cosmetic rewards, as well as additional paid cosmetics, which this time will be split into four solo packs for $5 each rather than the typical $20 pack for a set of four. This will let players pick and choose the skins they like most, so they needn't buy the whole set just to get one or a handful of the skins they sought.</p><p>Along with all of that, the game's endgame missions return in a new form. <strong>Rebirth 2.0</strong> adds co-op options to the experience, unlike the previous version that forced players to play the game solo. Rebirth can take place on any of the major maps in the game, so it won't be the same mission each time anymore, and it will be played in mirror mode, borrowing a popular, albeit unexpected, feature from Mario Kart.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527385"></a><figcaption>The Vote or Die campaign is really ramping up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4527385-unnamed%285%29.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4527396,1300-4527395,1300-4527394,1300-4527393,1300-4527392,1300-4527390,1300-4527389" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527396-tot_season04_shoppingmall-02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527395-tot_season04_shoppingmall-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527394-tot_season04_mk01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527393-tot_season04_custo.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527392-tot_season04_primeasset-03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527390-tot_season04_mk02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4527389-tot_season04_primeasset-02.png"></figure><p>"It's something that we discuss pretty often when we're coming up with new trials," narrative designer Jonathan Morrell told me. "Within the company, it's just [about] trying to find that line that we need to tiptoe. Someone will suggest something, and even internally, we'll go, like, 'I don't think we could do that.' Or like, 'Maybe that's a little too much, even for us.' And it's kind of like we go back and forth until we find that line. And so far, at least, it seems like we haven't overstepped it, which is cool, because I agree that there aren't many games out there that are as graphic or thematically disturbing as The Outlast Trials."</p><p>Community manager Rosemarie Sarno added that the team wants to "always try to keep it different enough that we know that no other game would do <em>this</em>."</p><p>The Outlast Trials Season 4 update arrives for free on July 15, though the sound of the chainsaw might cost you some hours from your sleep schedule.</p>

                <p>Majjam is the first game from the recently-announced studio Opus Major, and it's an exciting multiplayer adventure game that relies entirely on music to power its gameplay. From the way you traverse the world and engage in combat through to how you interact and explore, Majjam is inspired by "live jam" sessions--where musicians bring their instruments and voices to an improvised musical collaboration.</p><p>Majjam is described as a co-op multiplayer adventure and MMO, where you can use your own rhythms, melodies, and harmonies to work together to rescue the world around you. Music, as the world's life force, is the only thing holding back the corruptive element known as Kodé. Kodé is a dark presence that's encouraging death and silence via an ominous fog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOnYB4W_PYo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vOnYB4W_PYo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Working together, you and your friends will harness musical energy via jams, using your characters' unique abilities and instruments to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and ultimately rescue the world.</p><p>While Majjam relies on music and creativity to progress through the game, Opus says that there is "no instrumental expertise" required to play. You'll unlock more musical abilities as you progress, and each one has a specific power that will unlock the world's true potential.</p><p>Speaking about the announcement, Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin said, "Our team's dream is to make the world jam together. In music, a jam is a suspended moment--a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there. You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together. It's that same spark you sometimes feel in a multiplayer game. Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience."</p><p>Majjam is launching a closed alpha playtest this September. Opus says it knows the first version of the game will be "flawed" but that it values player feedback. "We're inviting players not just to test the game, but to help us build it in the next months," it said. To join the closed alpha test, you can sign up on the <a href="https://www.majjam.com/news/get-ready-to-jam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Majjam website</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Majjam is a newly announced cooperative multiplayer game where players interact with the world and each other entirely through music. It is the debut project by French developer Opus Major.&nbsp;</p><p>In Majjam, interactions occur through music, which serves as the life force for its whimsical world. When a dark corruption called Kodé infects everything with its silence, players must combine their musical talents and instruments to fend it off, also known as Jamming. Creating melodies is not only used in combat but also to solve puzzles and explore and unlock new parts of the environment. The Jam ability of each of Majjam’s distinct character types, such as woodwind or percussion players, is bolstered by unlockable musical abilities, which each have a unique power.&nbsp;</p><p>Players team up in online co-op (the number of which is unclear), and Opus Major states that the game's technology auto-harmonizes online players' performances with minimal noticeable latency. &nbsp;The developer also stresses that Majjam is not a rhythm game; instead of emphasizing musical skill, it focuses on communal creation and expression through simple, intuitive mechanics. Check out the teaser trailer below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8_l6CHw6O4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8_l6CHw6O4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“In music, a jam is a suspended moment — a shared energy between friends, strangers, and other passionate souls who just happen to be there,” reads a statement from Opus Major founders Pierre-Armand Nicq and Jean-Nicolas Vernin. &nbsp;"You might not know each other, but for a few magical, spontaneous moments, you vibe together.

Our dream is to bring all these joyful moments together into one single, shared experience.”</p><p>Majjam does not have a release window, but you can <a href="https://www.majjam.com/">sign up </a>to participate in a closed alpha in September.
