<figure data-uuid="cec31544ef737"><a title="Devon Pritchard Lead" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cec31544ef737/devon-pritchard-lead.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">Nintendo shared the news</a> that none of us could have predicted so soon: Bowser is stepping down from the position of top dog at the end of this year. The Koopas will have to find a new king, the Mushroom Kingdom will have to find a new menace, the kart racing scene will ha- what? Not <em>that</em> Bowser? Oh... we're going to miss these jokes.</p>
<p>Okay, for real now: Nintendo announced that <em>Doug</em> Bowser is retiring from his role as Nintendo of America President on 31st December 2025. After six years in the position, Bowser is to be succeeded by Devon Pritchard, a long-time NOA executive and the subsidiary's first female president.</p>
<p>While we'll be sad to see Mr. B go at the end of the year, it's an exciting time to get to know the new face stepping into his boots — not literally, we assume. You might have seen Devon Pritchard's name crop up in various conferences and events in recent years, but we actually know surprisingly little about her.</p>
<p>So, join us as we run through everything we know about the new face of NOA, and say farewell to 'not <em>that</em> Bowser' in the process — come on, who knows when we're going to be able to make those jokes again?</p>

<h2>Who Is Devon Pritchard?</h2>
<h3>Far From A Nintendo Newbie</h3>
<p>Despite appearing at a fair few Nintendo events in recent years — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFfc70f6rE">the San Francisco Nintendo Store grand opening</a>, Switch 2 reveal etc. — the name Devon Pritchard may not have entered your sphere. But it should have, because she's far from an NOA newbie.</p>

<p>Pritchard joined Nintendo of America in 2006, heading up the subsidiary's legal department as its presidency changed from Tatsumi Kimishima to Reggie Fils-Aimé — remember that guy?</p>
<p>She would go on to take leadership roles in the company's Marketing, Business Affairs, and Publisher Relations sectors, before landing her current title of NOA’s Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience in 2021.</p>
<p>Why is this important to note? Well, because it follows a similar pattern to what we have seen with NOA's presidential promotions in the past. Let's not forget, both Bowser and Reggie's NOA careers started in the sales and marketing departments (of which they were both vice presidents), and Kimishima came to the role off the back of his work in Pokémon finances. If you want a new NOA president, you look to the internal marketing and finance departments first.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:134329 @ 1758902402 -->
<h3>Law, What Is It Good For?</h3>
<p>With all that background, it'll come as no surprise that Devon Pritchard knows her legal onions. She became a Doctor of Law at the Gonzaga University School of Law in 2001, and before that, got a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from Kansas State University.</p>
<p>While at Kansa State, she played on the university volleyball team... sooo, revival of the canned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/06/next_levels_super_mario_spikers_was_canned_because_nintendo_had_issues_with_its_level_of_violence">Super Mario Spikers</a>, then? We doubt it.</p>
<h3>A Grip On Gaming?</h3>
<p>It seems somewhat counterintuitive, but being the most die-hard capital-G <em>Gamer</em> isn't necessarily a prerequisite to being the Nintendo of America President.</p>
<p>Of course, we all remember Reggie being very much hands-on in this department, regularly sharing what he was playing and for how long — what can we say? He had to get back to playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS — but do you ever recall Bowser sharing his playtime?</p>
<figure data-uuid="307f8fc5e9f93"><a title="Reggie Look" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/307f8fc5e9f93/reggie-look.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't know for sure what Pritchard's <em>vidyagame</em> chops are like just yet, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9fW2TGXxco">Kit &amp; Krysta's latest video</a> shed <em>some</em> light on her gaming habits. The former-NOA employees claim to have worked closely with the soon-to-be President during their tenure at the company, and while they agreed that she's far from a hardcore gamer, they were quick to point out that she knows her Nintendo.</p>
<p>"She definitely loves Nintendo," Krysta stated. "Like all of us, she has these childhood memories of connecting with Nintendo in some way, shape or form. She's probably not playing games every day for many hours, she's not a '<em>core gamer</em>', as we like to call it, but she definitely understands the industry, and she understands how Nintendo fits into [it]".</p>
<p>Kit Ellis was quick to also point out that Pritchard has young children, and very much views Nintendo's image through them. "I had some very insightful conversations with her about the industry, about games, and about Nintendo's games. So, I think she's really on it".</p>

<h3>Pik Me A Winner<br></h3>
<p>Let's briefly address the Bulborb in the room: yes, there is a picture of Devon Pritchard holding a Bulborb plushie, and yes, it was formally her display picture on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-pritchard-a970a21aa/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Does that mean we're going to get <strong>Pikmin 5</strong> under her leadership? Maybe. But a NOA president being a fan of a series doesn't really have any sway over what the company releases, and, according to Krysta Yang, "she's not really a Pikmin fan".</p>
<p>But hey, we can dream...</p>
<h3>Bye To Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="4933d2c1eaa82"><a title="Doug Bowser Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4933d2c1eaa82/doug-bowser-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, Pritchard sounds like a promising follow-up, but we couldn't celebrate the incoming talent without also sending a goodbye to Mr. Bowser himself — he's been the NOA president for the past six years, after all.</p>
<p>When we look back on the Bowser era, it's impossible <em>not</em> to compare him to Reggie. Let's admit it, Bowser wasn't the larger-than-life quote machine that his predecessor was, but honestly, who is?</p>
<p>Bowser's tenure can generally be looked back on as steadily guiding H.M.S. Nintendo of America through calm waters; for that, he did a good job. Nintendo didn't need another recognisable Reggie-like to drum up the hype at otherwise quiet Directs because, since Bowser's introduction in 2019, the output has been anything but quiet.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">launched to record-breaking sales numbers</a>, Nintendo continues to earn more money than ever before, and Bowser has, from an outside perspective at least, maintained cool, calm, and collected at the head of it all.</p>
<p>It mightn't have been the back-to-back tough-call role of previous NOA presidents, but remaining steady during some of the strangest times for the wider industry is nothing to scoff at — even if you do think he should have pulled rank on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> à la Reggie and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a> to make the damn thing a pack in...</p>
<p>As for what the incoming president had to say about her predecessor, Pritchard shared the following message on her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7377109391864610816/">LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on an incredible career, Doug! You’ve been a fantastic leader and it’s an honor to build on the foundation you’ve established here at Nintendo. On behalf of the entire Nintendo of America team, thank you for everything. Wishing you a well-deserved and happy retirement!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Setting A President For The Future</h3>
<p>So, where does this leave us for the future? Honestly, we'd be surprised if it were anything other than more of the same.</p>
<p>The days of Nintendo requiring a Reggie figure at the helm are long behind us. Nintendo is <em>not</em> big on its personalities, and if the Bowser era has taught us anything, it's that the NOA president will mainly stay out of the public eye while the going's good.</p>
<p>From an outside perspective, we can only assume that Pritchard will follow the same approach: generally staying in the background before occasionally popping up at a North American event or showcase. That's just the way Nintendo <em>is</em> these days.</p>
<p>But who knows, perhaps she's being measured up for a Jim Henson puppet replica as we speak.</p>
<figure data-uuid="74d119a1b787e"><a title="Nintendo Direct Puppets" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74d119a1b787e/nintendo-direct-puppets.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Hat Productions has announced it will be launching a crowdfunding campaign for Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins. This is not a reprint of the original documentary-style books, but rather a new collection of volumes that delve into the early years of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and its numerous supplements.</p>

<h2>The <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> Backerkit Campaign Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/0477a26f-723e-4d2f-8f11-74cdc007daf1/landing" rel="nofollow">landing page</a>, <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> is a 4-volume set that covers the history of each and every product released by TSR for original <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>AD&amp;D</em>, and <em>Basic D&amp;D</em>. This will include all Unearthed Arcana, the legendary orange-covered B3, and the rare 1986 <em>Up The Garden Path</em> prewritten adventure.</p>

She delves deeply into the artwork, design, and origins, as well as other iconic books released during the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG's formative years. Everything from the start of the TTRPG genre, to the discovery of the Forgotten Realms, to the fall of Mystara will be covered in these books.</p>

<p>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins is a more comprehensive look at one of <em>D&amp;D's</em> eras by Appelcline. This is in comparison to past <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em> books, which focused more on the broader history of the TTRPG industry. The origin of TSR and the influence of wargaming in the 1970s. The rise of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Jackson</a> and West End Games in the 80s. The growth of independent publishers in the 2000s. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Evil Hat Productions is the publisher of many beloved TTRPGs throughout the years. Their work includes the electropunk dark fantasy heist game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, the <em>Dresden Files</em> RPG, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>, <em>Apocalypse Keys</em>, and <em>Monster of the Week</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the landing page, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> will go live near the end of October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We can’t blame you if you were planning on keeping your wallet stashed away until Amazon’s Fall Prime Day hits on Oct. 7-8, but the run-up to the big event is often where you can find sneaky-good deals as Amazon looks to clear out the shelves. We found this one today — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">24% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro, which brings their price down to just $190.</a> That’s right in line with Apple’s AirPods 4 and a big drop from the closer-comparison AirPods Pro3.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds3 Pro got a full redesign from Samsung before dropping this past July, with an emphasis on comfort for long listening sessions. The sound is, of course, the amazing quality that Samsung’s famous for. And these buds are bolstered by Galaxy AI to enhance the noise cancellation, equalization, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Theater of the Mind</h2>
<p>Whether you’re listening to your own playlist or connecting to your tablet or TV via Bluetooth, the surround sound from the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is so good and so immersive it’s like being in the theater, but the sound is all for you. Dual amplifiers and a 2-way speaker in each bud creates a 360-degree effect, and Galaxy AI powers an adaptive equalizer that optimizes the sound specifically for you.</p>
<p>You can disappear into the listening experience of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro regardless of where you are, because the Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation feature, also powered by Galaxy AI, intelligently adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, and changes is as the conditions around you change. You won’t want to put them down, and thanks to the comfort-enhancing redesign and long battery life, you won’t have to.</p>



<h2>Futuristic Features</h2>
<p>One of the most jawdropping features of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is the real-time interpreter. When your Buds3 Pro are paired with a compatible Galaxy device, your can carry on a conversation with someone speaking a foreign language and hear the translation on your earbuds in real time. All you need is a Samsung account, from which you can download languages for free. (English and Spanish are pre-installed.)</p>
<p>Will there be incredible tech deals dropping during the two-day Fall Prime Day event? Of course. But consider the several days leading into the event a golden opportunity to find those under-the-radar bargains Amazon likes to drop as they get their inventory set for the big rush. This is most definitely one of them — a $60-off deal on Samsung’s newest and best wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Get the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $190 and beat the Prime Day rush.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lawyers-look-to-consolidate-dozens-of-roblox-child-exploitation-lawsuits.1309917/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Roblox</em> has a <a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predator problem</a>, according to the dozens of lawsuits filed against the game platform over the past year. Lawyers&nbsp; are looking to consolidate at least 31 different lawsuits filed in 12 different districts into one, big multidistrict litigation. The alleged victims in these cases are all different — and, crucially, all children — but the core of the lawsuits are the same: Parents are looking to hold Roblox accountable for its role in the abuses their children are alleged to have experienced on the platform.</p><p>“The case presents a matter of significant public concern involving a multibillion-dollar technology platform, Roblox, falsely represented as safe for children,” lawyers wrote in a newly filed document asking the court to consider consolidating the cases. “In truth, the platform’s design is alleged to be dangerously and unreasonably defective, providing a platform that enables adult predators to easily target, contact, and exploit minors.”</p><p><em>Roblox</em> is more popular than ever. <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/06/roblox-infrastructure-supporting-record-breaking-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">By Roblox’s own count</a>, more than 30 million people were using the platform in June 2025, a number that has since grown to a reported 47 million concurrent users, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/roblox-is-reportedly-bigger-than-the-entirety-of-steam-with-a-whopping-47-4-million-concurrent-users-almost-exclusively-thanks-to-two-games-steal-a-brainrot-and-grow-a-garden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per unofficial data</a>. A large number of those people were pouring into two wildly popular games: <em>Grow A Garden</em> and <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> — they both can amass tens of millions of players at one time.</p><p>By design, <em>Roblox</em> is a space for socialization and play rather than a game itself. <em>Roblox</em> is a platform where its users can create games and other experiences. There are thousands of games and experiences, most of which don’t have the immense popularity (and millions of players) of <em>Grow A Garden</em> and <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>. But the promise of <em>Roblox</em> is that anyone can see this potential success, and anyone can play in the created spaces. It attracts a lot of children because of that simplicity, but it’s a space where adults congregate, too. Connection on the app is easy; part of the draw is that people can socialize with others while playing games. But, according to these lawsuits, Roblox isn’t doing enough to keep kids safe from the dangers that bad actors using the platform present.</p><p>Each of these lawsuits has their own individual claims and impacts, and separately detail the way in which a child allegedly met a predator on <em>Roblox</em> who later coerced and exploited that child. In one lawsuit, filed in September, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/roblox-discord-lawsuit-teen-suicide-b2826315.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a mother is suing Roblox for wrongful death</a> after her son died by suicide following abuse by a 37-year-old man he met on the platform. In a different lawsuit, <a href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a parent said that their child had been coerced and abducted across state lines</a> by a predator the child met on <em>Roblox</em>. The child later escaped. Other lawsuits detail alleged other sorts of exploitation and blackmail, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/air-force-member-charged-sexual-exploitation-nine-year-old-child-long-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including bribing children for explicit photographs</a> with money or <em>Roblox</em>’s currency, Robux. The common thread between all these lawsuits is the claim that Roblox is responsible because it failed in creating a space that was truly safe for children.&nbsp;</p><p>Multidistrict litigation is a strategy that’s designed to streamline the court processes in instances where a company is being sued by lots of different people in different districts. Lawyers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138572/video-game-addiction-lawsuits-2023-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempted to consolidate a bunch of different video game addiction lawsuits</a> into a multidistrict litigation case in 2024, but the court panel denied the effort because the cases were levied against too many different companies. (The lawsuits can still continue on an individual level. Some have since been dismissed, while others are ongoing.) However, <a href="https://www.broughtonpartners.com/updates-on-video-game-addiction-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 100 lawsuits alleging video game addiction <em>were</em> consolidated</a> in the California court system in 2025; this consolidation is cited in the exploitation filings as proof that centralizing these lawsuits is appropriate.</p><p>A Roblox representative told Aftermath it “strongly disagree[s] with the characterization by the plaintiffs lawyers and will respond in court.” The company said it has implemented “over 100” new safety features “this year alone,” including age verification, AI tools to monitor voice chats, and the ability for parents to better control what their children have access to.&nbsp;</p><p>“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, and prohibiting sexual conversations,” a Roblox spokesperson told Aftermath in an email. “We also partner with law enforcement and leading child safety organizations worldwide to combat the sexual exploitation of children.”</p><p>On Tuesday, Roblox vice president of civility and partnerships Tami Bhaumik addressed the issue and Roblox’s improved safety measures while also claiming that the “negative press has come from things that have happened five years ago,” <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/roblox-negative-press-child-safety-old-events-1236527396/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Variety</a>.</p><p>As press around Roblox’s safety issues continues to grow, so does its userbase, making parents and lawmakers’ continued fight for accountability even more urgent.

The city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building</a> genre is grossly overpopulated. Competing Simvilles predicated on wholly opposed theories about plumbing and traffic wardens stretch as far as the eye can see. As such, the genre must imitate real-life urban centres of the 20th century, and begin expanding vertically. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stario-haven-tower">Stario: Haven Tower</a>, the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management sim from Chinese developers Stargate Games, in which you build upward through the realms of Sand, Mist, Rain, Frost, and Clear Skies until finally, your city stands among the Stars.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Accomplishing this will require a fair amount of faith, but above all - yes, literally above all, ha ha - it will require a mastery of resourcing and logistics. You will need to stretch water pipelines between city layers, set up balloon deliveries, and engage in shrewd bartering with the flying turtles that, for some reason, keep showing up at your window. You will also need to think about reinforcing the foundations and/or managing the city's mass with "lattice-like aerial platforms" and so forth.

Stario enters early access today, and I've just procured a code from one of the flying turtles that periodically appears at my window, asking me to write about a videogame. As such, I can't give you much sense of how it plays, but I like the concept's blend of mysticism and heavy engineering, though I have reservations about the in-game vocabulary. You can build sacred beacons to raise the morale of your, ugh, "Towertizens", together with ritual platforms that can be used to meddle with the weather.
</p><p>
If nothing else, it cuts an intriguing figure. The architecture is ornate and colourful but also, curiously muted in places, almost a little spreadsheety. There's a flat interface that floats next to your tower and drifts about when you rotate the camera, not quite ruining the view. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I hope to fit in some time with this over the coming weeks, but given the abundance of town-tenders round these parts, I figured you'd like to hear about it now. Food for discussion about this very busy genre, if not a thing to immediately purchase. Stario: Haven Tower will remain in early access for 6-12 months, according to the developers - you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3209750/STARIO_Haven_Tower/">read more on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has finally come clean about one of the bigger stains on its legacy. Veteran head designer Mark Rosewater recently apologized for the misogynistic treatment of a low-level pro player in the ’90s that he immortalized as a printed card called Ghazbán Ogress. “I have had a hand in creating thousands of Magic cards over the years, and Ghazban Ogress is the one I most regret making,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a> in a new blog post.</p> <p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ugl/60/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogress">Ghazbán Ogress</a> was a parody of an existing card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/arn/49/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogre">Ghazbán Ogre</a>, but its real inspiration was a woman named Catherine Nicoloff, an aspiring pro player who also dated several different top players in the ’90s <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> competitive scene. Part of the 1998 Unglued side-expansion, which was designed entirely by Rosewater, the card’s description read, “When Ghazban Ogress comes into play, the player who has won the most <em>Magic</em> games that day gains control of it.” It essentially took slut shaming that was happening in private and immortalized it in print.</p> <p>This darker chapter in the card game’s history was explored in a recent video on the <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheTranquilDomainMTG">The Tranquil Domain</a> YouTube channel in which Nicoloff was interviewed about it for the first time. “I just wanted to be one of the guys at the time,” she said. “That was the biggest compliment you could get is if you were one of the guys and man, when people say guys don’t gossip, boy are they lying. So, the attention was mixed, but you were always being watched. I could not go anywhere without being watched. If I went to lunch with a friend, there would be a rumor the next day that I was seen with so-and-so and I was dating him, even if I wasn’t, even if it was nothing more than a lunch where we were talking about decks or cards or draft strategy or whatever.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I laughed at and shared that joke at the time, when I was a teenager, and it certainly can’t have made women feel welcome in the community. I think one of the worst habits that Magic embedded in me was choosing my social circle based largely on peoples’ perceived skill.</p> <p>— Brian Kibler (@bmkibler) <a href="https://twitter.com/bmkibler/status/1395410046394060802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nicoloff said Rosewater took her aside during one event to give her a heads-up that the Ghazbán Ogress card would be coming out. “Mark Rosewater wielded enormous power over the game and continues to do so,” she said. “I was just, you know, a a small-time wannabe pro player. So, at that moment, it this is going to sound melodramatic, but it just kind of broke me a little because I had thought Mark was a friend. I thought he was trying to be humorous, but [that] he had the best interests of the players at heart. And now I’d been handed this tiger by the tail, and I had to either ride it or get eaten by it. That was what Mark gave to me.”</p>

 <p>She ended up signing some other people’s copies of the card while also trying to collect as many of them as possible to keep it from spreading. Nicoloff reckons she has two binder pages full of Ghazbán Ogress now. It wasn’t until a viral post about the incident four years ago by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/nh5pep/comment/hf1dq1n/?context=3"><em>Magic</em> player Brian Kibler</a> that she wanted to correct the record about what a gross thing it was. “I admit I still felt just a little bit angry and a little bit hurt by the whole thing because this was like an elephant in the room and nobody had ever apologized to me.”</p>

 <p>That changed after the video went live and people started asking Rosewater about it. In a post over on his blog he unequivocally apologized for it. “Let me start by stating unequivocally that it was a mistake to have ever printed the card. It is 100% my doing,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a>. “I designed it and put it into the set. I take full responsibility for the card’s existence. It’s important to own up to one’s mistakes and not try to justify them.”</p> <p>Rosewater has since called Nicoloff to apologize 27 years later, an apology which he said she accepted. “This apology should have come decades earlier though, and for that I am also sorry,” he wrote. “Magic cards should be something that bring people together and help foster growth and connection,” he added. “It should never be used to tear people down.”</p>

              <p>Following the non-appearance of a new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was left with a bit of a predicament at the end of its three years of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets. So, rather than drag it on, the trading card game has opted to return to Mega Evolutions, perfectly in time with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380">giant monsters’ resurgence in the forthcoming <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>. The first new set, out today in the U.S., is aptly and simply called Mega Evolution, and based on opening a few dozen packs, I’m delighted to report that a newfound generosity seems to have arrived.</p> <p>Now, while The Pokémon Company has chosen to save the really big guns for November’s next set, Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-charizard-x-ex-secret-rare-card-inferno-2000628025">a Charizard card that is likely to cause riots in the streets</a>, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some big hitters in this first outing for the new era. Sure to see high demand and higher prices are Special Illustration Rares for fan favorites Mega Venusaur ex, Mega Lucario ex and Mega Latias ex, as well as one very special card: the return of Mega Gardevoir ex. I can’t hold it in any longer. I pulled it! I pulled the Gardevoir!</p> <p>OK, I’m not going to let this color my assessment of the set, but I will say I when I opened it last night I ran upstairs and woke up my son to show him in quite the display of excellent parenting. Oh, and the centering on the reverse is <em>awful</em>, so there’s no hope of a nice PSA rating. Right, moving on.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629190"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629190">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Another New Beginning</h2> <p>While the ex cards continue to appear, although only in Mega Evolved form here, Mega Evolution does represent something of a resetting of recent trends in the TCG. For instance, the completely out-of-control reverse holos with either Poké Balls or Master Balls on them are all gone, and in fact the reverse holo has no pattern&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. There are no holo Energy cards, no Ace Spec-likes—just a very basic set of a very normal size (188 cards). As such, in this sense, it feels like an appropriate wiping clean of the slate for a new era. In another sense, other than the Mega Evolved Pokémon, it’s an incredibly&nbsp;<em>ordinary</em> set, too. The art on a large number of the Basic cards is weirdly generic, images that look so plain that you’d swear you’ve seen them before.</p>

 <p>This makes for an odd set in some ways. With no new Pokémon arriving, and the indistinct art, most of the cards feel like they could come from any era in any of the last ten years. However, when you pull something more special, they feel&nbsp;<em>very</em> special, and I’m delighted to report that in our smallish sample, that happened a lot more often than I was expecting.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629195">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So <em>Pokémon TCG</em> sets in recent years have been built of your regular cards with the small window of art, Double Rares that are either the older basic Vs or the more recent basic ex cards, Ultra Rares which tend to be more elaborate V/ex arts or full-art Trainer cards, then the desirable Illustration Rares (IR) which are full-art cards depicting Pokémon in their environment, followed by Special Illustration Rares (SIR) which also full-art, but mostly far more elaborately detailed. Then you get your gold cards which used to be the most prized, but more recently lost all their allure—this time out there are just two of them, with a lot more detail etched into the gold foil, and the hilarious new classification of Mega Hyper Rare. Mega Evolution sticks to this formula but with a boost, giving those Illustration Rares a big upgrade: the artworks in this set are <i data-stringify-type="italic">astonishing</i>.</p>

 <p>Each time I pulled an IR I was convinced it had to be an SIR, so gorgeous and elaborate was the art. Cards like the Clawitzer, Bulbasaur, and Ivysaur IRs would previously have easily been given an SIR rating. And yes, that means the 10 SIR cards have stepped up too, all of them (but for the Mega Absol ex, I would argue) looking like they could have been the ultimate chase card in any set on their own. Mega Latias ex is just extraordinary, while the Mega Lucario ex seems to be deliberately evoking the classic Mewtwo vs Charizard cards of the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era, as the Lucario soars over a city, wheeling back to punch an attacking Venusaur. And talking of it, the Mega Venusaur ex card completes a triptych set with Bulbasaur and Ivysaur in gobsmacking artwork by very new Pokémon artist mashu. And then, yes, there’s that Mega Gardevoir ex, with a degree of intricacy not seen since <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H69.shtml">Akira Egawa’s Giratina VSTAR in Crown Zenith</a>. (Egawa designed the Mega Latias in this set.) What’s more extraordinary is that the Gardevoir card was designed by an artist brand new to the TCG, Raita Kazama, who has previously designed incredible packaging and sleeves for the franchise, but never a card.</p>

 <h2>Pull Rates</h2> <p>Pull rates over&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> felt like they were crawling by the end, settling on a pretty desultory 1 in 5 chance of a pack having something you’d care about, even including a basic ex. Mega Evolution (and again, I stress my sample size is non-scientific) blew this out of the water for me. Of the first 40 packs, I pulled 12 cards Ultra Rare or higher! If you include the basic ex cards (which look great, by the way) that goes up to 21 pulls from 40 packs. 1 in 2?! And better than 1 in 4 for real pulls. That’s so much more appealing, and a far better use of someone’s allowance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629192">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What’s The Meta?</h2> <p>As for how all this will affect the game itself, I’d say it’ll be pretty big stuff. The Mega cards are as powerful as you’d hope, and are going to absolutely flip the meta. Mega Gardevoir ex, for instance, has a one-Energy ability called Overflowing Wishes that lets you add an Energy card to <em>every</em> benched Psychic Pokémon you have at once, and a second called Mega Symphonia that’ll deliver 50 damage for every Psychic Energy attached. It’s a Stage 2, so you’re not going to be playing it out your deck, but at the same time that gives you a lot of time to build up its Energy stock while you evolve it. Meanwhile, Mega Abomasnow ex could possibly deliver the highest damage I’ve ever heard of. Hammer-lanche has you discard the top six cards from your deck, doing 100 damage for every Energy card that’s there. Load your deck with Energy and you could hit for 600! Albeit at a hefty cost for your reserves of cards, of course.</p> <p>Mega Camerupt ex can deliver a ludicrous 240 damage for&nbsp;<em>one</em> Energy if the opponent is Burned, while my favorite, Mega Mawile, can take a Huge Bite of 260 damage if an opponent is unharmed (and only 30 if it isn’t!), but also Gobble Down for 80 per prize card you’ve taken. What a finisher that would be, your opponent finally playing their stacked Mega Gardevoir with five prize cards gone, and you clobber it in one turn for 380.</p>

 <p>There are also nice twists like Wally’s Companion, a Trainer card featuring good ol’ Wally that will heal&nbsp;<em>all</em> damage from an ex Pokémon at the cost of returning Energy attached to it back to your hand. Yup, it’s not discarded!</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629193">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is to be a very brief set, given the arrival of Phantasmal Flames as soon as November 14. It’s an even shorter time if you live outside the U.S., where Mega Evolution has been delayed by a full two weeks due to manufacturing issues—barely a month long. But it’s a lovely way to begin the new era, unless I was just ridiculously lucky!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A developer based in Estonia has stated that it's working on a classified Brothers in Arms game with Gearbox Software. Frozen Lake Studios notes on <a href="https://frozenlake.studio/clients-gearbox/" rel="nofollow ">its website </a>that more than 50 employees--including artists and animators--are working on "Gearbox’s next Brothers in Arms mission."</p><p dir="ltr">Just a bit over four years ago, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford confirmed his studio was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-brothers-in-arms-game-in-development-but-gearbox-wont-show-it-off-until-its-almost-done/1100-6496198/">working on a new Brothers in Arms game</a>. However, Pitchford added that a reveal wouldn't happen "until we have it, you know." Basically, Pitchford didn't want to show anything too soon for the project to draw comparisons to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aliens-colonial-marines-lawsuit-filed-against-sega-and-gearbox/1100-6407789/">the Aliens: Colonial Marines debacle</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Frozen Lake has previously collaborated with Gearbox on Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderland, per the studio. In addition, Frozen Lake highlights experience assisting on games set during World War II, such as Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond as well as Sniper Elite 4.</p><p dir="ltr">The last mainline Brothers in Arms game that was released on consoles and PC was 2008's Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway. The FPS was developed by Gearbox and published by Ubisoft. Since then, there have been multiple mobile titles (like 2014's Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War) and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brothers-in-arms-furious-4-to-be-reimagined-into-new-ip/1100-6394527/">a Gearbox-developed project called Brothers in Arms: Furious 4</a> that ultimately was canceled, with some elements later used for the ill-fated Battleborn.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/">Borderlands 4</a> just launched earlier this month from Gearbox. The developer delivered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/">a major new patch for the looter-shooter yesterday that introduced a FOV slider on consoles</a>. Switch 2 owners will have to wait to play the game as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/">it's been delayed</a>, with no new release date provided yet.

                <p>A MOBA that's been in development for 15 years and launched into early access in May 2025 to a "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mostly positive</a>" Steam rating has unceremoniously shut down. The game never left its early-access period and, according to developer Lunchbox Entertainment, couldn't keep going despite the team's best efforts.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBqkNeYZje4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sBqkNeYZje4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>You may have never heard of this game before now. Titled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790090/Sirocco/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sirocco</a>, it's a 5v5 naval brawler where customizable boats try to send each other to the bottom of the sea. It started as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reforged/" data-ref-id="5000-504202">Warcraft 3</a> mod over a decade ago before the team made the concept--a sort of Battleships-esque multiplayer online battle arena--a full-blown game. It's only ever peaked at 882 players some four months ago, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2790090/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB data</a>. And now, with the game barely cracking 30 players at any given time since its May 2025 launch, Lunchbox Entertainment has decided to pull the plug on Sirocco servers.</p><p>"We are shutting down our servers indefinitely on August 20, 2025 at 3PM ET," the team wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2790090/view/502834059926306900?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Steam update post</a>. "After that time, the game will be unplayable. [...] We are sorry for the inconvenience and grateful for your support. If you have questions, reach out in Discord and we will do our best to help."</p><p>In the official Sirocco Discord server, developer Jack of Boxes gave a bit more details on August 18, writing that the team is proud of the game and hopes to bring it back.</p><p>"Hi everyone, getting emotional just writing this," Jack of Boxes wrote. "Today is the day we pull the plug on our servers. Despite our best efforts, we can’t keep Sirocco going. So, we’ll be shutting things down [on] Wednesday, the 20th. In other words, Sirocco will go offline in two days. All Patreon supporters who [subscribed] in the last 90 days have been refunded. As much as it sucks to shut off the servers, we're really proud of Sirocco and we are going to do everything we can to keep making games so one day we can bring back Sirocco in the future when we have more resources. [...] Thank you all for being a truly amazing community. You all have gone above and beyond to make our game and community the best it could be and, for that, I can’t thank you enough."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even though <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">we've known the release date</a> for the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom last month</a>, pre-orders were not live, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-handhelds-asus-rog-ally-x-999-usd-ally-599-usd-pre-orders/">before last night, we were still in the dark on price</a>. Well, now we know the price with the base Xbox Ally model coming in at $599 USD and the more powerful Xbox Ally X model listed at a whopping $999 USD. But even with those eye-watering prices, the handhelds are selling out across the globe, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>"<em>The hype is real!</em>" Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1971477401944326215">boasted in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "<em>ROG Xbox Ally X preorders are sold out on the Xbox Store worldwide. You can still grab yours at asus.com/store/ or find a local retailer on xbox.com.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, it should be pointed out that this is just the first batch of pre-orders selling out. We don't necessarily know how many units Microsoft made available, so this isn't exactly a sign that the handheld is due to sell millions of units or anything like that when it launches next month.</p>



<p>But it is at least a clear sign that the early-adopting enthusiasts who are getting these pre-orders are not swayed by its price in the least. What happens after those enthusiasts all have their own, and how sales of the handhelds look within a year, will be the more telling figure.</p>



<p>Though these handhelds are made by ASUS, it's worth noting that Xbox-branded hardware hasn't exactly been selling well. Xbox Series X/S consoles have <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">reportedly sold only a little over 30 million units</a> since its launch five years ago, and new reports seem to confirm that Costco, the third-largest retailer in the world, <a href="https://wccftech.com/reports-confirm-costco-has-stopped-selling-xbox-series-consoles-in-us-uk/">has stopped selling the consoles in its US and UK locations</a>. Costco Canada seems to carry them still, but you have to wonder how much longer that will last. </p>

              <p>City apartments don’t offer a ton of living space. So if you find yourself in either a one bedroom or studio, you’re going to have to make some tough decisions surrounding how every square inch gets used. This is especially true when it comes to your desk setup. It may not be worth it for you to dedicate a tone of surface area to a huge PC tower. Go with a mini instead.

<h2>AAA Gaming on a Mini PC</h2>
<p>This compact case measuring in at only 5.4 by 5.1 by 1.7 inches contains <strong>a full-on PC powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and AMD Radeon 780M graphics card.</strong> As far as mobile integrated GPUs go, this one is pretty darn good. You might actually be able to play some of the more demanding games out there like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> so long as you keep it in minimum graphics settings. And then lots of smaller indie titles should play pretty smoothly. You can actually even connect the AX8 Max to an AMD discrete graphics card over one of the USB-C ports to improve your graphics further. The mini PC has also got a fair amount of memory with its <strong>32GB of RAM plus a full 1TB of storage</strong> on its PCle SSD.</p>
<p>Mini PCs are pretty perfect for your “everyday” computer tasks. By that I mean the day-to-day stuff like browsing the web, sending out emails, queuing up a YouTube video, or doing anything you need in Microsoft Office apps like PowerPoint, Excel, or Word.</p>



<p>With the two USB-C ports and the two HDMI ports, you can actually connect to up to four displays at once without the help of a dedicated docking station. Over USB-C, you can achieve an 8K resolution at 30Hz while the HDMI 2.0 ports can get you 4K resolution&nbsp; at 60Hz. And since the PC is so small, you can just mount the whole thing to the back of one of your monitors, taking up no surface area on your desk at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">The Geekom AX8 Max can be set to three different modes, based on your needs in the moments</a>. First up is the default mode. Not much to say there. Next we have quiet mode which can reduce power consumption and noise. Great for some light office work or while studying and needing to focus. Then we have performance mode which is optimized for AAA gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Man, I love Supergiant Games. I’m still of the opinion that they’re one of the best developers around, and every new game has been a delight ever since their debut with the amazing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/07/19/review-bastion/">Bastion</a>. Each new game has their style and sound all over it, but has offered an entirely new mechanical experience underneath. So I was a little nervous when they announced Hades 2, even though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">I gave the original a 10/10</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hades II – v1.0 Launch Trailer (Available Now!)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8lJRcUeEMs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I stand by my score for Hades, by the way. It’s basically perfect, and that’s a bit of a problem when trying to make a sequel – how can you improve upon perfection? Hades 2 adds in a lot of new mechanical features to the game, with resource gathering, new people to meet, two separate paths to take in your adventure, and a more mechanically involved combat system as well. It’s just layer upon layer of stuff to do, and it can almost feel a bit overwhelming.</p>


<p>The general premise is pretty simple though. You take control of Melinoe, a mighty warrior and witch, and the daughter of Hades. You’ve been raised by Hecate, and it turns out that, while Zagreus in the previous game did get to sort stuff out for himself and his family, the problems were not over. Not a huge shock if you’ve paid any attention to Greek mythology, to be fair. Chronos has decided to wage war on the Gods, and has recruited the Titans to do so. He’s set himself up in Hell, while the other Titans are besieging Mount Olympus. Both of these things are bad, so you need to sort it out.</p>


<p>As you would expect, Hades 2 still plays fantastically well, a refined action RPG roguelike, though Melinoe doesn’t feel <em>quite</em> as slick as Zagreus did, in my opinion. She has&nbsp;a wider array of weapons to choose from, and a lot more layers to what boons you choose from the Gods to get upgrades and so on. The build variety is fantastic, and unless you’re actively seeking it out, you’ll be unlikely to play the same build more than a couple of times.</p>
<p>It still looks and sounds fantastic too, which isn’t a shock. Darren Korb has penned the soundtrack one again, and he’s one of the best in the business. The design is also steeped in style. Each new boss and monster is fantastic to look upon, and the horrors at the top of Mount Olympus are truly something to behold. So, it looks amazing, sounds exceptional, and it plays great… so what’s my issue?</p>

<p>Hades was sort of revolutionary, as one of the first roguelikes to use the gameplay mechanics to tell a really heartfelt story. Hades 2 is just another game that follows that form, and I don’t feel it tells the story quite as well, nor that the story is as interesting. It loses a lot of the heartfelt nature of Zagreus’ journey through the first game, and it results in one that’s just a bit more generic. You’re still overcoming trauma, sure, but the stakes are bigger, and I think that obscures some of the core themes that I’d like to see the game focusing on.</p>
<p>I also just think the cast of characters isn’t as good as the first one. While Melinoe is a fantastic protagonist, the supports aren’t as good, and I don’t think the bosses are either. I miss Theseus and the Furies, and instead we get Eris and her machine gun, or Scylla and her band. I like them all well enough, but I don’t love them.</p>

<p>To be honest, that’s how I feel about Hades 2 as well. It’s more technically and mechanically ambitious, and I appreciate that added depth and variety, but I don’t think it’s necessarily better for it.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is an undoubtedly excellent game, but it can’t quite escape the shadow cast by the original – I just know I won’t be playing this one as much as the first. That’s okay, of course, but it has me once again looking forward to Supergiant’s next original game, not what they’re doing now.</p>

<p>Silver Lining Interactive has announced that a physical edition of its first-person survival horror sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bendy_and_the_dark_revival">Bendy and the Dark Revival</a>, releases today for Switch . Hooray! (And/or terrified gasps!)</p>
<p>The physical edition of Bendy and the Dark Revival is out <strong>today, and you can pick it up from</strong> <a href="https://direct.silverliningint.com/products/bendy-and-the-dark-revival-standard-edition-nintendo-switch?_pos=2&amp;_sid=8fc22cb6c&amp;_ss=r">Silver Lining Direct for £32.99</a> or whatever that equates to where you are.</p>
<p>This particular survival horror, which is currently sat on a very respectable <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/bendy-and-the-dark-revival/">72% over on ye olde Metacritic</a>, sees players assume the role of Audrey, "a trapped animator who must navigate a dark, ink-drenched version of her old studio."</p>
<p>You solve puzzles and face off against scary enemies in this inky horror adventure. Will Audrey be able to survive for long enough? It's up to us! Gulp.</p>
<p>Here's some more official deets on the game, including some screenshots, in case you missed it early this year::</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Fight for Survival<br></strong>Sneak, fight, and think your way through a nightmare made real. Use stealth and puzzle-solving to avoid deadly encounters, or face them head-on with evolving inky powers.</p>
<p><strong>Terrifying Foes<br></strong>Face horrifying creatures lurking in the shadows, each more grotesque and relentless than the last. And always, the Ink Demon watches…</p>
<p><strong>A Story Drenched in Mystery<br></strong>Dive into a dark tale where animation and reality collide. Uncover lost secrets, piece together Audrey’s past, and make your way out. If escape is even possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While we missed out on this one, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">we did review</a> the game's predecessor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a>, which we thought was solid, but lost its magic towards the end.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Bendy fan? Picking up this physical edition? Let us know!</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/physics-based-mars-rover-building-sim-mars-first-logistics-has-launched-out-of-early-access.1309824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mars First Logistics is a physics-based sim-game developed by Shape Shop and published with support from Outersloth (the publishing and creator fund arm of <a href="https://wccftech.com/among-us-vr-release-window-trailer/">Among Us developer Innersloth</a>) that lets you build your own Mars rover to run around the red planet on. After more than two years of early access, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/">officially out with the launch of its v1.0.</a></p>



<p>The game first launched in early access on June 22, 2023, and the v1.0 launch adds a new area for players to explore, 10 new endgame contracts, support for seven additional languages, new parts for your rovers, and more.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Mars First Logistics 1.0 Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SoDG_Qd5dgY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beyond just building your own rover to trot around Mars on, you'll spend your time transporting various cargo across the face of the planet and trying not to topple over from the planet's awkward terrain on the way. You'll also make a home on Mars with your own shelter that you can build up and expand while you tinker and tweak your rover with well over 100 parts to mix and match.</p>



<p>It's a strong week for physics-based games, with Mars First Logistics' launch following the release of Baby Steps from the creators of Ape Out and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. Interestingly, Baby Steps was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">one of the indie titles that got out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a> when it was initially set to release just ahead of Silksong. Now, it's launched right next to a game that it actually has more direct competition with, as they're more aligned genre-wise. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-update-progress</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-still-moving-forward-konami-says.1309821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been wondering what's happened to&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, then wonder no more, because Konami has an update for you on how development is going.</p>

<p>As spotted by social media user <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Outsider Snake</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Master Collection&nbsp;</em>producer Noriaki Okamura provided more information about the second volume of the collection during this week's Konami Tokyo Game Show spot.</p>

<p>According to Okamura (via Outsider Snake's translation), development on the second volume is "moving forward properly", and the collection as a whole is "shaping up to be something enjoyable", but fans should "wait just a little longer" for more information about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=Jkvw5vd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=A7d8P9Lc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2023, and a second volume is expected.</figcaption></figure><p>Okamura goes on to say that it's "hard to say" exactly how much longer we'll have to wait for more&nbsp;<em>Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>news, but that Konami is still working on the compilation, which feels like good news in and of itself.</p>

<p>Of course, we still know very little about what&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>will feature. Presumably, since the last collection left off at&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>, the new volume will offer a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, but beyond that, it's tough to say.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say <i>Vol. 2&nbsp;</i>will remaster&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Portable Ops</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peace Walker</em>, and that bonus versions of&nbsp;PSP card battlers&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Ac!d&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be offered as well, although that might just be wishful thinking on my part.</p>




<p>In any case, if you want to play more&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>, you'll have to content yourself with the recently-released (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a>)&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>for now. Hopefully, we'll get more info about&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">pledged to revive</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>with new titles, as well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Since then, we've seen the release of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>will get its turn in the sun next (although that would probably turn it to dust).</p>

            <p>I've yet to fully consume <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuoo_zhsAhs">Consume Me</a>, so please take that headline with a pinch of salt (not too much, because apparently salt can cause <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-surprising-link-between-salt-and-weight-gain/">short-term weight gain</a>). Still, I thought I'd rush out a quick "on sale now" piece before the weekend because this game is extremely good, and I worry based on the Steam stats that it's being overlooked. 
</p>
<p>It's a fast-talking, mildly anguished pocket <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about a high schoolgirl, Jenny, who is trying to lose weight while balancing schoolwork, domestic duties, an emerging social life, and her domineering mom. It broadly consists of household tasks and Coming Of Age Milestones couched as a bunch of Wario Ware-style timed minigame puzzles. Among other antics, you'll fold laundry by clicking on cue, manage a (dis)interest bar during a terrible date, apply your make-up as though doodling yourself in Kid Pix, and surgically arrange food on your plate while passing carbier morsels to your absurdly squishy dog.

<p>The developers are Jenny Jiao Hsia, AP Thomson, Jie En Lee, Violet W-P, and Ken "coda" Snyder. They offer the following cautionary note: "Consume Me is a semi-autobiographical game that depicts dieting, disordered eating, and fatphobia. If you are someone who struggles with or has struggled with disordered eating, it's possible that Consume Me will be a stressful or even upsetting experience and we won't begrudge you for giving it a pass."
</p><p>I myself have never had an eating disorder, but to borrow a phrase from Eddie Izzard, I am familiar with the experience of sliding up to the mirror and thinking "well <em>I</em> wouldn't fuck me". The mirror is indeed home to the Furies in Consume Me - it's where Jenny gets her quest assignments from her comically unforgiving reflection. I laughed a lot during my first hour with Consume Me. I think I'll probably cry a bit at some point, too. But even if I reach one of the less-good 13 possible endings, I don't get the sense I'll regret the journey.
</p>
<p>Consume Me's visual wit is balanced by a startling emphasis on resource management that is also a critique of the gamification of wellbeing. It's divided into days, which are divided into scripted and unforeseeable events such as trips to the shops, random hot boy encounters and above all, mealtimes. These see you trying to put enough stuff on Jenny's plate to fill her Gut gauge, without taking too many Bites. In my current save, I started out piling up objects subject to real-time physics, but then I had Jenny glean a few tips from a dieting mag, and the eating minigame evolved into a process of slotting together random Tetris blocks.

<p>Overeat, and you may wish to burn off the pounds by exercising in Jenny's room. Exercise takes the form of dragging an elasticated Jenny around with the cursor to fit various poses. Many of the minigames and cutscenes involve the clownish deformation of Jenny's body. It's amusing, and also a bit painful to watch. Consume Me does a great job of leaning into Looney Tunes slapstick while making clear that the portrayal contains an element of self-loathing.
</p><p>As for those resource gauges, you've got to worry about your energy (used for physical labours like walking the dog), your mood (strongly affected by hunger), and your cash reserves (see also, buying a new swimsuit before the big neighbourhood pool party). While the minigames may seem flimsy, there's a bit of strategy to distributing your time efficiently and unlocking activities, buffs and outfits that juice your stats. Again, though, this feels like critique, not an earnest equation of levelling-up with self-improvement. The developers caution in a brief foreword that Jenny's fortunes may take a turn for the worse even if she masters all these life-hacking gambits.

<p>The character art and interface design are sumptuously daft, with chunky Walkman buttons and a colour scheme suggestive of a virtual pet game, which I guess this sort of is. The audio is possibly even better: there's different music for each part of Jenny's day, and the sound effects fit the visual gags superbly. Above all, Consume Me is fast. Even when it's dealing with more difficult stuff, like your mom body-shaming you, it rarely prolongs a scene for more than a few sentences.

<p>Find the joyful, slightly upsetting thing on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/">Steam</a>. If you want a second opinion, Oisin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/consume-me-a-life-sim-rpg-thatll-remind-you-that-you-hated-being-a-teenager-actually-has-a-demo-out-now">had some quick thoughts on a demo in May</a>. I suspect one reason Consume Me hasn't yet made a splash is that it's launched in the same week as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-tokyo-game-show-silent-hill-babel-city-building-and-an-rpg-about-a-fugitive-king">various other brillo experimental games</a>.</p><p>In particular, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a> from Bennett Foddy and co, which comes at similar subject matter from a very different direction. I've written previously about how that outwardly depressive game sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baby-steps-isnt-about-humiliation-but-the-joy-of-disobedient-flesh">celebrates the experience of inhabiting a disagreeable lump of flesh</a>. I get the feeling Baby Steps and Consume Me will make natural companion pieces. We'll hopefully have more thoughts on both down the road.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember last month when Game Freak revealed that Hawlucha would get a mega form in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>with an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>animated sports drama</span></a><span> starring the luchador bird and a Machamp? Well, Nintendo partnered with real luchadors to bring this fight to life. Last night, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>took over a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre event in Mexico City that had several luchadors dressed in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-themed costumes, including two who referenced the rivalry between Hawlucha and Machamp.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre collaboration was a two-hour event full of drama, mayhem, and references to different Pokémon in both costuming and in the set dressing. The ring in which the bouts took place included </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>branding (or </span><i><span>Leyendas Pokémon Z-A</span></i><span>, as it’s called in Spanish). Attendees were given paper hats of Hawlucha and Machamp to wear in the stands, and Pikachu and Eevee mascots were hanging out the whole time. If you want to watch the whole thing, it’s on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Latam’s YouTube channel, but do keep in mind this was a Spanish event. I don’t speak a word of the language, and the vibes are still pretty great.</span></p>  <p><span>Those who attended the event were gifted a </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span> medal featuring art of Hawlucha and Machamp squaring up. As of right now, there are no plans to distribute this anywhere else outside the event. For those of us who couldn’t make it out to Mexico City, the VOD is still a really fun intersection of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and a specific culture. Lucha libre wrestling and its aesthetics have been featured in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>before, both with Hawlucha itself and the Pikachu Libre cosplay variant in </span><i><span>Omega Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Alpha Sapphire</span></i><span>, but this event takes that energy to a new level, and it’s fun to see people in the crowd playing into that crossover with their own costumes and chants.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="cs" dir="ltr">Místico Charmander 🔥<br>This is peak <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeyendasPok%C3%A9monZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LeyendasPokémonZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/zYFYDzhBfo">pic.twitter.com/zYFYDzhBfo</a></p> <p>— Emmanuel 🐝 (@Emmanurl_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Emmanurl_/status/1971391237069603185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most aura there's even been in 1 fist bump holy shit<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cmll?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cmll</a> <a href="https://t.co/AtRD8nZSqL">pic.twitter.com/AtRD8nZSqL</a></p> <p>— Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971402106566516846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOUD ASS TOGEPI CHANTS IN ARENA MEXICO 😭<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/q5awnYy46U">pic.twitter.com/q5awnYy46U</a></p> <p>— Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971388353636675678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS UMBREON MASK IN THE AUDIENCE <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/ljUzo9naIe">pic.twitter.com/ljUzo9naIe</a></p> <p>— Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971398611830538419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Hawlucha wins the fight thanks to its Mega Evolution in the trailer, so if Machamp wants to stand a chance, it’ll probably need a new form of its own.

            <p>Modded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> guns and equipment are being sold on Ebay with tailored gun parts and effects. However, as of writing, it doesn't appear this grey market of modded loot is particularly profitable.</p>
<p>Ebay - a public e-commerce marketplace - is no stranger to gaming related side hustles, with numerous account, cosmetic, and service sellers setting up camp there over the years with the release of popular online video games. Eurogamer reached out to one Borderlands modded gun merchant to find out how it's going.</p>
<p>"It is fairly difficult to do as they have included a new encryption method to the guns this year that makes doing specific builds very very hard and will take, I would imagine, a long time to get perfected" states one Borderlands modded weapon reseller to Eurogamer under anonymity.</p>

<p>This new encryption method implemented by Gearbox not only makes the act of modding the exact weapon you want difficult, it's also making prospects of profit for resellers unlikely due to the cost of getting the decrypted values for weapons people will actually pay for. When asked how successful business is, the seller told Eurogamer:</p>
<p>"Not very successful. I've sold maybe three or four since release, which is around £15 to £20, which doesn't even cover the costs to build the guns, but I don't do this to make money or profit.</p>
<p>"To make the modded guns you often need to pay for tables that data miners have made that breakdown gun parts. Each part of the gun has an encrypted value, so does the rarity, manufacturer, level etc and the tables can be expensive to buy at around £50 to £100."</p><p>As such, at the moment, it appears that the grey market for selling modded Borderlands 4 loot is more for the hobbyists rather than those looking to make a buck from a hot new release (unless you're a data miner able to sell off valuable info, rather than the sought after weapons themselves).</p>
<p>Whether or not this will become a great problem as time goes on, and more of the game's loot encryption is broken down and made publicly available, remains a potential problem for the future. Although as a PvE game, the modded gear seller made an argument for why the practice of modding isn't doing any harm:</p>
<p>"Borderlands games have always been modded and I've modded them since Borderlands 1 and every game in between. It's a <em>huge</em> part of why I love the games so much."</p>

Anyway, there are some awesome PlayStation 5 exclusives. The amazing and cute platformer <em>Astro Bot </em>won Game of the Year last year. <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>is dropping in under a week. Plus people are still sleeping on 2021’s incredible third-person shooter roguelike <em>Returnal</em>. And then yes of course there really are a bunch of good PS4 games to check if you missed them last generation. A lot of them have great-looking updates too like everything going on with <em>The Last of Us </em>remakes and remasters. Point is there are lots of good games to play, but do you have enough storage space for all of them?</p>
<p>Expand you PS5 storage with the help of Seagate’s officially-licensed game drive for PlayStation consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">This external hard drive connect to your system over USB 3.2 and will&nbsp; let you boost your capacity to store games by a full 2TB</a>. Right now, Amazon has the drive discounted down from $90 to just $80. A $10 savings may not sound like much, but that’s already halfway to getting you <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The PS5 base model only comes with 800GB of internal space (1TB on the Slim), and some of that isn’t even usable to you as it’s got all the system stuff on it that makes the console work. Really you’re working with roughly. The base model really has about 667GB while the Slim has a bout 842.2GB for you to work with, saving your games. This Seagate drive will more than triple your ability to store your game data. nor more deleting and redownloading.</p>



<h2>One Small Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a catch though. You can’t actually&nbsp;<em>play</em> you games off this external drive. The PS5 requires much faster read/write speeds than this supports. You might be thinking, “Okay, then what the heck is the point?” Well, this drive is still helpful because you can move you games from it to your internal drive when you want to play them. This is a much, much faster process than redownloading a game over the internet. Think of it like the digital version of taking your disc off the shelf and popping it into your console. The good news is you can play your PS4 games directly off of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">Unlike the internal SSDs available to expand your PS5 storage, this drive requires no tools to install as it just connects over USB.</a> That makes it totally portable so you can bring it over to a friend’s house and fire it up on their PS5 if you wish. Have your whole gaming library on the go.</p>

              <p>Will<em> Resident Evil 9</em> struggle on Switch 2? Is the new <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch really broken or do players just need to be better at compiling their shaders? And where the hell is the next <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</em>? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While all the big gaming showcases have wrapped up, there are still a few more days of Tokyo Game Show proper until the last big gaming festival of the year wraps up. Then it’s on to the fall’s next batch of big game releases. Yes, I’m talking about you <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p> <h2>PlayStation boss touts PS5 as Sony’s most lucrative gaming box yet</h2> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was the keynote speaker at Tokyo Game Show 2025 and his topic was the PlayStation Store. Covering its evolution and current financial dominance, he flashed a chart showing how revenues have kept climbing with each new console. What’s interesting is that this is happening despite PS5 sales tracking only slightly ahead of the PS4. So where is the growth coming from? In part its the explosion in microtransactions in free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nishino-san says PlayStation 5 is the most successful generation in PlayStation history. <a href="https://t.co/E5feupYHGr">pic.twitter.com/E5feupYHGr</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1971034274536272100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the expansion of subscription services like PS Plus. And then there’s the fact that people are still playing on PS4, so even though the install bases are similar, the overall footprint of active PlayStation players spending money is seemingly larger. Plus the consoles keep getting more expensive. With graphs like this, did Sony really need to raise the price of the PS5 another $50 nearly five years after it launched? Either way, it’s an interesting data point amid debates about console makers going platform-agnostic. Will PS6 just be a PC with a PlayStation logo on it, or is Sony, like Nintendo, married to the hardware business long-term?</p>

 <h2><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next 2D action game is out in November</h2>  <p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is Heart Machine’s first stab at the Metroidvania formula and arrives the same year its loot shooter, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, entered Early Access. There’s a new trailer showing off more of the game about a high school student who forms a pact with a demon to uncover the mystery behind a catastrophe that’s befallen Sanzu city. It’s out on PS5 and PC on November 11.</p>

 <h2>One of the last significant updates for <em>The Witcher 3</em> has been delayed</h2> <p>CD Projekt Red’s fantasy RPG was supposed to get cross-platform mod support across PC and consoles before the end of the year. The update will <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewitcher.com/post/3lzochplzqc2h">now arrive in 2026</a>, but with no clear window for when players can expect it. Once it finally arrives, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will finally get to experience all of the extra fan-made content modders created for the PC version.</p>

 <h2>Gearbox has some advice if <em>Borderlands 4</em> is running poorly for you <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">after the latest patch</a></h2> <p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">blames some initial reports</a> of even worse performance following the new update on shader compilation. Basically, the game has to recompile all of the shaders again, which can mess things up while running in the background. “Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing,” the studio wrote on X. “If you’re still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method.”</p>

 <p>One fan offered <a href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615">their own tip</a>: “quit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol’s or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness.” Big-budget gaming in 2025 folks!</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks pretty decent in first Switch 2 hands-ons</h2>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is the first game in the survival horror series to come day-and-date to a Nintendo platform. Early impressions seem to be that while the game looks and runs best on PC and high-end consoles, the Switch 2 version still performs admirably, especially in hand-held mode. So far both <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have both been better than expected on Nintendo’s new console. Hopefully other third-party ports can continue the trend.</p> <h2>A <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster will arrive eventually</h2> <p>Fans waiting for news on the status of the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> got an update via a panel at Tokyo Game Show. According to <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">a translation by X user Kuwabara357</a><span>, it will still take a little longer for the next batch of games to get ported. “The project is moving forward properly, and we believe it’s shaping up to be something enjoyable really,” Konami producer Noriaki Okamura reportedly said. “So please wait just a bit more, more information is coming.”</span></p> <h2><em>Payday 2</em> dev apologizes for price-gouging fans</h2> <p>The<em> Payday 2</em> Infamous Collection bundle, which contains every piece of DLC the multiplayer heist shooter has ever received, recently jumped in price from $118 to $170. Starbreeze also announced a new $5-a-month subscription option for players to access all of it. Fans obviously thought the timing of this was a bit cynical.</p> <p>“The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they’re not wrong, it’s terrible timing,” Starbreeze’s Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We definitely didn’t handle this right, and we’ll be apologizing to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-leaves-nintendo-of-america-2000628868">Nintendo is shaking things up at Nintendo of America with the retirement of Bowser</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-israel-palestine-gaza-phone-calls-xbox-cloud-2000628764">Microsoft has taken the first step toward addressing the Xbox BDS boycott over Israel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s open world take on Japan will be the game’s biggest map yet</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is celebrating its one-year anniversary today, September 26, 2025. Below, we look back at how it successfully married the flexibility of recent Zelda games with the top-down classics.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo unveiled The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in 2017, it redefined what a Zelda game could be. Gone were the dungeon-by-dungeon progressions of earlier entries. Instead, players were dropped into a vast, living world and told to simply survive, explore, and discover.</p><p dir="ltr">Six years later, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-magic-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-one-year-later-is-in-experimentation/1100-6523363/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> expanded that formula upward and downward, stacking floating islands and subterranean caverns around Hyrule’s sprawling surface. Together, those two games set a new standard for open-ended adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo found a way to take those explorative and freedom-minded mechanics and distill them into something smaller with The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. Developed by longtime Nintendo partner Grezzo, Echoes of Wisdom may not match the raw scale of its predecessors, but it captures their essence--freedom--within its more compact world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4575605-4361860-screenshot2024-09-04093841.png" data-ref-id="1300-4575605" data-ratio="0.56259780907668" data-width="1278" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4575605-4361860-screenshot2024-09-04093841.png" data-ref-id="1300-4575605"></a><figcaption>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4575605-4361860-screenshot2024-09-04093841.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">At first glance, Echoes of Wisdom recalls Grezzo's remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. It uses a toy-like tilt-shift perspective, the camera hovering high above a colorful overworld. But beneath the inviting diorama visuals is a design that borrows the creative heart of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda, stepping into the protagonist’s role for the first time in a mainline entry, wields the Echo Rod, a tool that lets her record the properties of objects and creatures and then recreate them at will. Copy a rock and spawn it to form an impromptu bridge. Capture an enemy and unleash it as an ally.</p><p dir="ltr">This mechanic doesn’t simply mimic the weapon durability or crafting systems of the Switch epics; it reimagines their sandbox approach on a tighter canvas. Where Link fused weapons or combined objects to solve problems in Tears of the Kingdom, Zelda collects and redeploys echoes to achieve similar feats of improvisation. The result is a game that asks players to invent solutions within a gorgeous top-down diorama-like world, rather than follow a predetermined solution that was programmed by the game's creators.</p><p dir="ltr">“These were the two basic elements, and from there, I asked them to think of ways to add some freedom. Having worked on games in the Legend of Zelda series over the years, we started to feel that fans may not continue playing this franchise unless they can think independently and try various things freely on their own, rather than following a set path," Legend of Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma said in an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1/?srsltid=AfmBOop5OdcwfPqFjB6PjbfC4xD0oNiRGOhzc07HT74D5bcNqD9aSzoR">interview</a> published on nintendo.com. "Even when it comes to solving puzzles--in a game in the Legend of Zelda series, having the excitement of solving puzzles in your own unique way makes the game 'Legend of Zelda-like.' Hence, we need to increase the degree of freedom to achieve that. With this in mind, I asked Grezzo to use those two elements as a foundation for the gameplay and add freedom on top of it.”</p><p dir="ltr">Aonuma’s words crystallize what Echoes of Wisdom aims to accomplish: to preserve the exhilaration of experimentation that made Breath of the Wild a phenomenon, but without sprawling continents or hundreds of hours of content. The approach was widely praised when Echoes of Wisdom launched in 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">"Echoes of Wisdom's brilliantly integrated echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise's classic formula," wrote Steven Petite in GameSpot's <a

Need to cross a chasm? Build a bridge of conjured beds. Want to defeat a boss without direct combat? Summon echoes of enemies to fight on your behalf while you stay safely out of reach. Each puzzle is less about finding the right answer and more about discovering your answer.</p><p dir="ltr">This freedom also enhances the game’s pacing. Echoes of Wisdom respects the player’s time, offering bite-sized challenges that can be completed in short sessions without sacrificing the thrill of discovery. It’s an ideal fit for the Nintendo Switch’s hybrid nature, encouraging players to dip in and out while still feeling like they’re shaping the world.</p><p dir="ltr">The shift to Zelda as protagonist reinforces this sense of new possibilities. Without Link’s traditional swordplay, combat becomes another puzzle to solve. The Echo Rod is a clever narrative and mechanical bridge: Zelda isn’t a warrior; she’s a scholar and strategist. Her power lies in observation and ingenuity, qualities that invite players to think differently.</p><p dir="ltr">By compressing the grand ideas of its predecessors into a smaller frame, Echoes of Wisdom also highlights what made Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom revolutionary. Those games were never just about scale--they were about agency. Climbing a distant mountain because you saw it on the horizon. Crafting a bizarre contraption to outwit an enemy. Stumbling upon a shrine or a sky island simply because curiosity led you there. Grezzo’s game asks: Can those feelings exist without a Hyrule a few dozen square miles wide?</p><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Wisdom is proof that freedom isn’t measured in miles. It’s measured in options, in the delightful uncertainty of not knowing exactly how you’ll overcome the next obstacle. The game invites players to be inventive, to experiment--qualities that made the Switch’s two massive Zelda adventures modern classics.</p><p dir="ltr">In distilling that formula into something more intimate, Nintendo and Grezzo have done more than create a side story. They’ve shown that the spirit of The Legend of Zelda--the wonder of exploring a world and bending it to your will--can thrive in any size. Whether you’re fusing giant mechs in Tears of the Kingdom or spawning a chain of beds to reach a hidden treasure in Echoes of Wisdom, the feeling is the same: freedom, pure and simple, echoing across Hyrule.</p>
