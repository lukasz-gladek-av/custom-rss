<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6e57b3256915/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest boxed charts from Japan are now available thanks to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202508/50866">Famitsu</a>, and as expected, Nintendo's first-party line-up for Switch 2 is doing particularly well.</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> remain unchanged at the top, selling a further 30,202 and 8,424 copies respectively. We'd like to see those lifetime sales for Bananza climb a little higher, but it's a solid performance, at least.</p>
<p>The only newcomer this week is <strong>Tetsudou Nippon! RealPro Tokyo-Kanagawa! Tokyu Dentetsu Hen</strong> at number ten, selling a total of 2,497 units on Switch. In fact, there are no games from either PlayStation or Xbox in the top ten; it's a Nintendo clean sheet!</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at this week's top 10:</p>

<hr>
<p>Figures are down from last time with hardware; mostly because we're looking at one week's worth of sales data instead of two. Regardless, both the Switch and the Switch 2 are absolutely dominating, with the latter sitting pretty at the top with 35,359 units sold.</p>
<p>Combining all three SKUs, Switch sold a total of 17,945 units this week, while the PS5 managed to shift a total of 6,428, which means the Switch wasn't too far off shifting <em>three times</em> as many consoles.</p>
<p>Xbox, meanwhile..? Well, look, they're trying. We can give them that.</p>
<p><em>(It goes without saying that healthy sales across the board is good for everybody; our jibes toward PlayStation and Xbox is all in good fun.)</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Konami and Virtuos have <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/news/us/en/update_112">pushed a new patch</a> to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater with update 1.1.2 that addresses several gameplay issues and issues causing game crashes, but doesn't directly address performance issues that players have been experiencing.</p>



<p>It addresses issues with the crocodile cap that caused the game to crash, problems with Snake floating in the air after rolling, and issues that soft-blocked player progression, along with a few more fixes. Here's the full patch notes:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Resolved an issue where performing consecutive survival knife attacks to secure food could cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while equipped could cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed crashes that could occur when collecting food near a hungry crocodile under certain conditions.</em></li>



<li><em>Corrected an issue where transitioning from a roll into a crawl could cause the character model to float in mid-air.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where player movement could become restricted under certain conditions in areas where Intrusion View is used.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where the game could crash under certain conditions while in Radio Window.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>These fixes are great, but it's not necessarily the patch that players are waiting for. Snake Eater is the latest Unreal Engine 5 game to launch with performance issues, and while Konami doesn't directly say anything about those issues in these patch notes, it does have a concluding line on the website saying, "<em>Please rest assured that we are actively investigating and addressing all reported concerns.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, those fixes come sooner than later, though it would be nicer if we didn't have to worry about Unreal Engine 5 games launching with performance issues at all, which, according to Epic Games chief executive officer, Tim Sweeney, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">a problem caused by the developers and their development process, not the engine itself</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-gaming-buddy.1282947/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of the most devastating parts of grief is how it can strike out of nowhere. There you are, doing a perfectly normal, everyday thing, and then that perfectly normal, everyday thing reminds you of something or someone who is no longer there. And when that presence you lost was intimately connected with your life, well, those moments happen frequently and unexpectedly.</p><p>I recently had to say goodbye to an old friend named Millie, an 18-year-old shih tzu who was a constant and steady companion for nearly my entire adult life. In an attempt to get my mind off the sadness, I decided to take a little dip into the familiar with <em>Animal Crossing</em>, a peaceful place full of simple chores that usually helps get my head right. But as I sat on the couch watching the shadows of fish dart around virtual waters, something was missing: the warm presence on my lap that I had taken for granted the last two decades.</p><p>My gaming habits are primarily solitary. When I get time to actually play something, I usually try to lose myself for a few hours in a big world, something like a <em>Zelda</em>, <em>Persona</em>, or <em>Death Stranding</em>. This typically happens in the quiet evenings when everyone else is asleep, and I’m far removed from the screams of a <em>Mario Kart</em> bout or the inane chatter of a <em>Fortnite</em> lobby. But as I realized during that <em>Animal Crossing</em> session, I was almost never <em>really</em> alone playing these games.</p><p>She may have had an adorable little face, but Millie didn’t like most people. She carried herself like a bulldog, chest puffed out to intimidate, and was a grouch even from a young age. The sound of children laughing would make her grumble, and she hated when any unknown person came into our house, which always made it fun when repairs had to be done. Few people got to see the dog I did, a fiercely protective little thing who knew who she loved, and cared about little else. No matter what I was doing she never seemed to be far away, which obviously included plenty of gaming.</p><p>The day we lost Millie, my wife and I spent much of our time digging through old photos and videos to reminisce. As I scrolled back to my very first Instagram posts, it really hit home that this dog had been there for basically every major moment in our lives; every move and heartbreak, Christmas mornings and the early childhoods of both our daughters. We always remembered her as being cold with the kids when they were little — she was no longer the center of attention, after all — but there we found videos and pics of her eating out of their hands, or sleeping on their beds when they were sick. She was always just there, a quiet source of comfort for our whole family.</p><p>There was a theme with most of the photos of Millie and myself: her just chilling in my lap while I was reading or playing a game. Scrolling through those photos I saw this same scene play out through multiple console generations: a young and scrawny Millie beside a silver PS2 controller, a slightly older and scruffier version of her face hidden behind an Xbox One gamepad. There were photos of her lying on my chest as I played <em>New Horizons</em> during the early days of the covid-19 pandemic. The one that hit me the hardest was my oldest daughter lying on our couch with a Nintendo DS, probably lost in <em>Pokémon</em>, while Millie dozed beside her.</p><p>Here was a creature I loved unconditionally, who was always quietly there when I needed her and, later, when my kids needed her, too. Console generations might seem like a silly way to measure time, but they can also be effective. Technology changes so quickly that it can become an easy visual shorthand for identifying a particular moment or era. Millie had sat alongside me through four of these generations — I even found a photo of her next to a PS5 review unit that I used to show how big the console was — and so became an indelible part of how I experienced these games.</p><p>At first I thought this connection would taint a hobby that had become important to me, turning something that had long been a source of joy and escape into one tinged with bitter memories. But as I tossed my line into the <em>Animal Crossing</em> waters, I realized I wasn’t being haunted by Millie’s presence, but reminded of it. Her warmth and presence may no longer be physical, but that doesn’t make it any less comforting.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/767156/gaming-grief]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Some <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> players like to say that the MMORPG has a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy toward mods. While technically verboten under the strict terms of the game’s user agreement, Square Enix has mostly been content to look the other way as long as the mods aren’t interfering with the overall health and integrity of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228">But last week</a>, a plugin for <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> called Mare Synchronos was taken down by its creator after receiving a letter from Square Enix’s lawyers. The crackdown came as a surprise to some, while others felt like players had left Square Enix with no choice but to take action. And reading between the lines of a new blog post from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida, that’s essentially what happened.</p>

<p>It may still be a couple of years away from release, but more information regarding the PlayStation 6 (PS6) handheld console continues to come out.</p>



<p>In his latest video going over some new specs and details he’s uncovered, Moore’s Law Is Dead (MLID) says that the upcoming PS6 handheld console, codenamed “Canis”, will be dockable for connection to an external display.  </p>



<p><strong>“That’s right everybody,”</strong> he said. <strong>“Multiple documents directly call out that this thing can be docked, will be docked like the Nintendo Switch 2.” </strong></p>



<h6 id="h-more-news-many-developers-still-don-t-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits">More News: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Many Developers Still Don’t Have Nintendo Switch 2 Dev Kits</a></h6>



<p>When talking about the specs, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-A3Bl2hXoQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLID said that the system</a> will have <strong>16 compute units of RDNA 5 at 1.20GHz</strong> while in handheld mode. When docked, that speed <strong>jumps to around 1.65GHz</strong>. </p>



<p>Other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously rumored specs</a> for the device include full backward compatibility with PS5 and PS4 titles, 4 x Zen 6c cores, a M.2 SSD slow, haptic vibration, 15W TBP, and more. </p>



<p>The PS6 handheld, along with the standard PS6 console, are reportedly planned to release sometime in late 2027-early 2028.</p>



<p>Sony has yet to announce or confirm any of the specs that have been revealed recently for the PS6 handheld. Until that happens, or Insider Gaming can independently verified its legitimacy, it’s important to take these claims with a grain of salt.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will see players return to Pokemon X and Y's Kalos region, and fittingly, one of the major gameplay features of those games will make a return: Mega Evolutions. Ahead of its release next month, The Pokemon Company has shown off one of the new Mega Evolutions debuting in the game, as the Luchador-inspired Pokemon Hawlucha is getting a serious upgrade when it jumps into the ring.</p><p>A Fighting- and Flying-type Pokemon, Hawlucha's Mega Evolution sees the Pokemon transform into a creature that has even more ornate plumage, which makes it look like a Pokemon version of famed wrestler Jushin Thunder Liger. "After bathing in the energy of Mega Evolution, its whole body has grown more muscular. Its signature move is Flying Press. It spins to increase the momentum of its dive when attacking. It shows off its muscular chest--both to its opponent and to its Trainer," Hawlucha's Mega Evolution Pokedex entry reads (<a href="https://serebii.net/legendsz-a/megaevolutions.shtml">via Serebii</a>).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A | Hawlucha vs. Machamp FULL MATCH | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Hawlucha is the third new Mega Evolution reveal so far for Pokemon Legends: Z-A. The first one was Mega Dragonite, a power-up that adds massive wings to the powerhouse Pokemon's head, and recently, we got a brief taste of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-goes-full-blair-witch-project-to-reveal-a-brand-new-mega-evolution/1100-6534163/">what a Pokemon horror movie would be like</a> with the debut of Mega Victreebel.</p><p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A launches on October 16 for Switch 2 and Switch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">and it throws in some mega-changes</a> alongside the Mega Evolutions. Traditionally, Pokemon games have featured a turn-based battle system, but Pokemon Legends: Z-A flips the script with real-time fights in Lumiose City.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/">Another interesting mode that players can take part in is the Z-A Battle Club</a>: free-for-all battles for up to four players to take part in. The trainer who manages to defeat the most Pokemon within three minutes is crowned the victor in this fast-paced match, and Mega Evolution Pokemon have the power to knock out multiple Pokemon with a single attack.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Developer Crystal Dynamics is laying off more members from the team, though not detailing the total number of people impacted. This is the second round of cuts at the Tomb Raider studio within the last six months--and the first since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">the Perfect Dark reboot was canned</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn</a>, the official Crystal Dynamics account announced the layoffs. "This decision was not made lightly," the post reads. "It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market." The language is pretty similar to what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-studio-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-staff/1100-6530417/">Crystal Dynamics stated after 17 people were laid off</a> in March: "We did not make this decision lightly."</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest known project at Crystal Dynamics currently is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-new-unified-design-is-the-best-of-two-timelines/1100-6521149/">the next Tomb Raider</a>. The game starring Lara Croft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-will-publish-the-next-tomb-raider-game/1100-6510083/">will be published by Amazon Games</a>, and Crystal Dynamics noted that "the future of Tomb Raider" is "unaffected by this decision."</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, the developer stated that the next Tomb Raider and Perfect Dark reboot wouldn't be affected by downsizing, either. However, Microsoft canceled Perfect Dark--a game that Crystal Dynamics was co-developing--last month. The other main studio working on the game, The Initiative, was shuttered.</p><p>Amazon was also previously working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-reportedly-dead/1100-6530816/">a Tomb Raider show, but that's reportedly dead now</a>. Along with Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics is known for the Gex and Legacy of Kain video game franchises.</p>

<p>As for what to expect at the Summit and Direct, RGG doesn't tease anything, though it has various projects in the works like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/rgg-studios-project-century-formally-unveiled-as-stranger-than-heaven-in-new">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/04/check-out-the-first-gameplay-of-the-next-virtua-fighter">a new Virtua Fighter</a>, and almost assuredly, a new Like A Dragon project. The studio also recently released <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut</a>, which features new cutscenes and more, exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, and fans are hoping the team might bring it to other platforms.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, a brand new DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>that's launching next month, although the studio is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding what you can expect for now.</p>

<p><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>was announced earlier today via a brand new teaser trailer, and "teaser" really is the word; the trailer reveals the name of the expansion, as well as a C.O.R.E. robot standing in front of some kind of red growth (presumably the Red Strain of the title).</p>

<p>What we do know is that this will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second major story expansion, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em></a>, which introduced a brand new area and other goodies to Rebellion's open-ended shooter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=jb20XuWE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-the-red-strain-dlc-wicked-isle.jpg?itok=W7D_8oYR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Red Strain&nbsp;</em>will be&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s second story DLC, following on from&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>While Rebellion hasn't revealed exactly what will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>The Red Strain</em>, the studio does say you can expect "a highly confidential new location", as well as "plenty more mysteries to uncover". That sounds about right for an&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>expansion.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-ended first-person shooter developed by&nbsp;<em>Sniper Elite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zombie Army&nbsp;</em>studio Rebellion. It's set in a 1960s England that was a lot more heavily impacted by the Windscale nuclear disaster than the one in real life was.</p>

<p>At the outset of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you awaken in a bunker with amnesia, and it's up to you to explore the Windscale plant and its surroundings in order to discover the truth behind Windscale and why a mysterious voice is telling you that a being known as Oberon "must die".</p>




<p>Somewhat unusually for modern games,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>essentially allows you freedom in how you pursue your objectives; you'll have several leads to follow at any given time, and the order in which you chase those leads is largely up to you.</p>

<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's also a day one Game Pass title.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>has been holding its Mega-Evolution cards close to its chest leading up to its launch in October, but after the reveals for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682"><span>Dragonite</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>Victreebel</span></a><span>, the floodgates seem to have opened for Game Freak to show off more of the new superpowered forms coming to the RPG. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>isn’t adding any new Pokémon to the Pokédex, but it is going back and giving some underappreciated monsters Mega Evolutions, and Hawlucha, the fighting/flying luchador bird Pokémon from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, is the latest old ‘mon learning new tricks.</span></p> <p><span>Game Freak revealed Mega Hawlucha through an animated short depicting a battle between the bird and a Machamp. The two fighting-type Pokémon meet in a ring alongside their trainers, and Hawlucha plays to the crowd like a real luchador. Then in comes Machamp, who has a dramatic wrestler entrance of its own. The two clash, and it becomes clear that Hawlucha plays up the showmanship to the detriment of its performance in the battle. After Machamp teaches it a lesson in humility, Hawlucha thinks about all the training it took to get to this match and finds the strength to get back up, apologize to its trainer, and mega evolve. Mega Hawlucha gets a new mask and cape, its feathers forming a belt around its waist. It definitely heightens the luchador theme, but it feels a bit more grounded than the mega designs of Dragonite and Victreebel, which lean more fully into a kind of goofy, exaggerated charm. Machamp is no match for Hawlucha after it mega evolves, and the match is over pretty quick. Check out the full animated short below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FULL MATCH: Hawlucha vs. Machamp! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYCOc3SiU7A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Like Draqonite and Victreebel, Hawluche was on the list of leaked Mega Evolutions from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>back in March</span></a><span>, so that list keeps looking more and more credible as time goes on. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Draw Me A Pixel is doing something bold for their second release. After the decidedly un-game-like There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension, the studio has decided to actually make a game this time round. It’s just a damned shame that it’s all gone a bit wrong for release, the review bombing has rolled in, and now Sherlock and Watson are off to solve the mysterious case of the game-breaking missing NPC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crushed In Time (Teaser 2025)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pSSLM0QBRNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you were to be strict about genre definitions, this would have to be called a point &amp; click adventure, but that really isn’t the half of it. It’s much more of a…. grab and slap? Pull and stretch? Slap and tickle? Probably not the last one. What I mean to say is that instead of the traditional style where you point and things and click on them to move your character over and interact or utter some witty barbs, your cursor is actually the one doing the interacting directly. And that interaction comes in the form of pulling on the elastic scenery and letting loose.</p>


<p>It’s basically the opening screen of Mario 64, shoved into a blender with a point &amp; click game&nbsp;–&nbsp;I cheekily asked if they were fans of this one specific thing and Fred Malavasi, associate producer and comms manager, replied “As a child, I spent hours [playing with] Mario’s face. So yeah, definitely!” –&nbsp;and it manifests in some truly wonderful ways through the opening scene. </p>
<p>It’s a regular day on Baker Street when a repeated pounding on the front door summons Watson to answer, but as he opens it, the presumed postman grabs him for a hug and hands him a letter. Weird, but OK. Time to deliver that to Holmes, but Watson is himself now stuck pounding on the locked door to Sherlock’s apartment. </p>


<p>Now it’s over to you to figure out how to resolve this issue. Mousing around the screen, you can click and grab any part of it, pull it and release for a little bit of enjoyable wobble, but you’re really searching for the white dots to actually interact with. This won’t necessarily be the direct solution, of course, but rather provides the framework of the puzzle you need to complete. </p>
<p>You see, the door knob won’t open the door, and instead plings down onto the floor, letting you then grab it again, pull and launch it in an arc to get across the room and slot into the hole on a drawer, which in turn will release a telephone cord for you to plug in and trigger a call to wake Holmes up. There’s all the hallmarks of a point &amp; click puzzle here, but how you’re finding and giving the solution is just so thoroughly different. </p>
<p>That persists as you go through the successive puzzles in this introduction as things start to get even more unusual. You see, that letter Watson holds suddenly defies gravity and flips up to the ceiling. How do you get it down? Well, it’s obviously some kind of combination of honey, dumb waiter and portraits of the queen, but once again, you’re grabbing things, flicking them around and seeing what works. Holmes, the rather stubborn ass, just considers all of these bizarre occurrences to be a part of his own brilliance, completely oblivious to your unknowable force and inputs. </p>

<p>Getting stuck is a natural part of the genre, as obscure solutions to strange situations stump you and hold up your progress. Fred confirms that “We have two types of hints. The first one is you just have to look around and maybe listen to what characters are saying. But the second one, we are definitely going to have a real hints system. I can’t say exactly what right now, but there will be a hints system like in every point &amp; click game.”</p>
<p>There’s three different styles of action that Draw Me A Pixel use through this into: grabbing to stretch and release, grabbing to release and eject, and grabbing and then spinning something round. I’ve no doubt that there’s more than these three, and there’s a bunch of snippets found within the teaser trailer. </p>
<p>But what was that about a buggy, review-bombed game release? Well, hopefully the actual game won’t have a troubled launch, but the narrative is that the in-game Draw Me A Pixel has released this buggy mess. As they set off from Baker Street in the Sherlock-o-motive (it’s a car), Holmes and Watson don’t realise that they’re going to be on a time-travelling adventure, of sorts, that delves back through and explores their game in different iterations. Expect to see prototypes, alpha versions and lots of other quirky stuff, likely leaning back into some of the shenanigans that were seen in There Is No Game. </p>

<p>Crushed In Time looks like a truly unique and exciting riff on the point &amp; click adventure, with its truly inventive grabbing and elastic mechanics. If you like the genre and have a barmy sense of humour, this should absolutely be on your watch list for 2026.</p>

<p>Ahhh, memories</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>XSEED Games has announced that it's bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_memories_of_celceta">Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</a> to Switch in the West in early 2026.</p>
<p>In case you missed this one, Revelations in Celceta enhanced port of the PlayStation Vita game (which later came to PC and PS4) <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/ys_memories_of_celceta">Ys: Memories of Celceta</a>. Can you see <em>why</em> they changed the name? Memoire: Memories is a bit of a mouthful... well, Falcom kept it for its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/ps-vitas-ys-memoire-memories-of-celceta-lands-switch-remaster-in-japan-this-may">Japanese release in May 2025</a>. So, y'know.</p>
<p>Anyway, Revelations in Celceta is actually the <em>true</em> fourth game in the Ys series; Falcom originally outsourced development of a fourth game to two seperate companies in the early '90s, which in turn gave us two different <strong>Ys IV</strong>s. Timeline wise, it takes place directly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X</a> — which is also getting a rerelease in 2026 on Switch 2.</p>
<p>This rerelease will allow you to swap between the original soundtrack and a brand new, rearranged version. And, from the look and sound of it, that seems like the main addition.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the action RPG from XSEED, along with some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ys Memoire: Revelations in Celceta</em></strong> Key Features</p>
<p><strong>- Exhilarating Party-based Action:</strong> Strategic party battles challenge players to change their tactics on the fly, and allies can pick up new abilities in the midst of battle that can help them gain the advantage against powerful enemies.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Dynamic Exploration of a Dangerous Land:</strong> Celceta is a vast and mysterious land, filled with interesting people and thrilling adventures. Players can take advantage of a robust mapping system as they discover all the challenges and rewards that await.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Enhanced Musical Experience:</strong> The sweeping score guiding Adol’s journey through Celceta returns, along with a newly recorded, re-interpreted version, allowing players to choose their own auditory adventure.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So, we don't have too long to wait. Oh, and if you want to catch up on your Ys, this is the second game in the Memoire project — which is porting the older games to Switch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_memoire_the_oath_in_felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a>, which launched earlier this year, is a fantastic place to start.</p>
<p><em>Let us know if you're looking forward to Revelations in Celceta in the comments</em>,</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new Mega Evolution for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and unlike the last two reveals, this one is a bona fide Generation VI native.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">set to launch on October 16th</a>, and the first major new Mega Evolution revealed for the game was Dragonite, with Grass/Poison-type plant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za" rel="nofollow">Victreebel following earlier this month</a>. Be sure to check out Mega Victreebel's horror-inflected announcement trailer if you haven't already.</p>

<p>Now, a brand new Mega Evolution has been revealed for the game, and it's none other than the Fighting/Flying-type luchador bird Hawlucha, which will transform into an even more magnificent form if you choose to Mega Evolve it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=kSFPRTR0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-hawlucha-announced-trailer.jpg?itok=xl4KvUbx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hawlucha is the latest Pokemon to get the Mega Evolution treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer in which Mega Hawlucha is revealed is a pretty heartwarming one; the luchador steps into the ring with Machamp, and the latter proves to be a tough opponent until Hawlucha draws on its memories of its trainer and steps it up a notch.</p>

<p>I would say that I won't spoil what happens next, but given that this is a trailer specifically announcing the existence of Mega Hawlucha, I'm sure you can put two and two together. Suffice it to say Hawlucha's trainer is delighted with the outcome.</p>

<p>You can check out the full trailer announcing Mega Hawlucha below; it essentially takes the form of a full wrestling match between the two Pokemon, complete with the kind of dramatic twists and turns you'd expect from a WWE bout.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is set to debut on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-2533423.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original Switch</a> on October 16th. Set entirely in Lumiose City in the Kalos region, the game sees players undertaking an urban redevelopment project by day and participating in an exciting battle tournament by night.</p>

<p>The game will also feature a more action-oriented battle system that will require players to physically dodge certain moves, as well as a number of new Mega Evolution forms, of which we've only seen a few. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>If you like games, you’ve probably heard the name Hollow Knight: Silksong at some point. Its disappearance into the seemingly abyss following its 2019 announcement was curious. Thankfully, it resurfaced in 2025, it’s coming out this year, and we’re here to let you know if you need to play the first game beforehand.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-hollow-knight-silksong-a-sequel-or-prequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong is a direct sequel to 2017’s Hollow Knight</a>. The Knight has stepped aside in the new game so that Hornet can take center stage. If you’re a newcomer to the series, this all might sound more foreign than if I’d written this in an alien-like language. </p>



<p>This guide is to help you if you’re not well-versed in the Hollow Knight world. You should be excited for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a>, and you should have all the details ahead of its long-awaited release.</p>

<figure><figcaption>You’re having fun either way. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It is not essential or a requirement for you to play Hollow Knight before Silksong, but I recommend you do so, as it will help you to appreciate Silksong’s improvements and new content.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Silksong</a> puts you in the shoes of Hornet—a prevalent character in Hollow Knight. By playing the original, you get to understand Hornet’s roots better, how she ties into the world, and why we’re suddenly controlling her instead of The Knight.</p>



<p>Team Cherry has said that Silksong will be a good introduction for new players. It’s a different world with fresh mechanics, but Silksong still has basic tutorials and pointers on how to get started. There will be plenty of first-time players and consumers of Hollow Knight media likely following the hype train.</p>



<p>What I will say is that Silksong was originally planned as DLC for Hollow Knight. So you get the sense that this is a genuine continuation of the world that came before. All things considered, <strong>I recommend you sink a few hours into Hollow Knight before Silksong</strong> to become acquainted with the world, movement mechanics, and the vibe of the franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-hollow-knight-worth-playing-in-2025">Is Hollow Knight Worth Playing in 2025?</h2>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight is 100% still worth playing in 2025, as it’s considered one of the all-time great indie games and is still incredibly fun to play nearly 10 years later.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, Silksong is a new chapter in Hollow Knight. New abilities, new bosses, new biomes, and much more. Playing Hollow Knight means you get to enjoy and appreciate the foundation laid down before Silksong; you get to experience boss fights you would miss out on otherwise, and even small details, such as backgrounds and the soundtrack, need to be enjoyed and savored.</p>



<p>When you think of the Metroidvania genre, or find anyone’s ‘best Metroidvania games of all time’ list, Hollow Knight will be on it. Do yourself a favour and find time to play it—even if it’s only after Silksong.</p>

                <p>What's the most important thing that EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/">Skate</a> game needs? Contrary to popular belief, polished gameplay and fun environments aren't at the top of the list, because that's a spot reserved for the soundtrack. If we're talking sub-genres within the playlist itself, then naturally, we have to know just how much of it is reserved for the <em>best </em>music to power a kickflip: ska. So just how much ska is in Skate? That's a question Skate's developers aren't quite ready to answer yet, although they are tooting their horns about the game's upcoming release on PC and console.</p><p>"I know ska is really polarising. I love Ska, I love Rocksteady (another genre of music), so I don't know how to answer this. I'm also bad at math, so I'm going to say it won't be a high percentage but I won't rule out ska being on the soundtrack," senior creative director Deran Chung said to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/i-asked-the-skate-devs-how-much-ska-is-in-eas-new-open-world-game-and-they-laughed-at-me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>. Skate head of creative Jeff Seamster added that the game definitely features "some" ska, which might be reason enough to grab your old Mighty Mighty Bosstones T-shirt out of your cupboard and dust off your Reel Big Fish CDs.</p>

		<p>NetEase’s spin-off from Bungie’s Destiny universe has launched today on mobile and PC. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising/">Destiny: Rising</a> is a brand new game set in an alternate universe to the main Bungie titles but retains everything that makes the series popular.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M3JJKAc-C8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I have been playing the game for a couple of hours using the Mumu emulator for PC –<a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/"> something NetEase actively encourages</a> –&nbsp; and I have to say it’s rather good. It’s Destiny, but all brand new. New characters,. supers, weapons, locations, missions, basically everything everyone has been screaming at Bungie to add to Destiny 2. The only major difference so far is you have two weapons rather than three.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a full report on the game when I have played some more and have reached any monetisation barriers.</p>
<p>The alternate timeline is set in a period way before the setting familiar to those who have played the main Destiny Games, dated before the Last City has been built. Players take control of various characters from a roster that will keep growing, but they will not be based on the classes of Hunter, Titan, and Warlock. Instead the characters have their own abilities. Some of the characters players will get to use include Ikora Rey, Iron Lord Jolder, and Kabr. The main protagonist is a character called Wolf that players can&nbsp; to customise.</p>

<p>The first Season, named Daybreak, will be launching “soon”, no exact date has been given.</p>
<p>The recommended specs and devices include:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Android Devices:</u>&nbsp;Snapdragon 845 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPhone:</u>&nbsp;iPhone 8 or newer</li>
<li><u>iPads:&nbsp;</u></li>
<li>iPad (8th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (10.5-inch)（2017） or newer</li>
<li>iPad Pro (11-inch, 1st generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad mini (5th generation) or newer</li>
<li>iPad Air (3rd generation) or newer</li>
</ul>
<p>Or you can just fire up the <a href="https://www.mumuplayer.com/">Mumu emulator</a> and play it on your PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-office-365-is-cheaper-than-buying-office-alone-amazon-clears-out-stock-for-labor-day.1282818/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It doesn’t often happen that Amazon’s best-sellers list puts a budget Windows laptop next to high-end MacBook Airs, but that’s what’s happening right now. There’s an HP 14-inch model (Intel Celeron N4020, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB Storage) that has quietly become a serious player on the platform as one of the best-selling laptops on the site, and the reason why is simple: it’s awfully cheap.</p>
<p>With the ongoing Labor Day sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">you can get it for $172 down from its usual $230</a>. At that price, it’s one of the cheapest brand-new laptops you’ll find anywhere, and it’s less than some headphones or tablets.&nbsp;The deal becomes even harder to pass up when you factor in it also <strong>includes a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365</strong> which alone usually costs $129 (per year). And since that comes bundled for free, you’re essentially paying close to the value of the software and getting a full-sized laptop in exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Buy It</h2>
<p>The screen itself is a 14-inch HD micro-edge bezel panel that boasts a slim design that doesn’t scream “budget.” It’s not too small for Netflix sessions or working on documents, and its size sits comfortably in the sweet spot between being travel-friendly and being productive. The laptop is also easy to carry around thanks to a thin build and light weight which is convenient if you’re going to class or a local coffee shop.</p>
<p>The machine runs on <strong>Intel’s Celeron N4020 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage</strong>. It’s not built for heavy creative projects or gaming, but that isn’t what this computer is meant for. Instead, it’s built to give you coverage for normal things such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, email or Zoom meetings. The storage might feel tight compared to higher-end models, but remember—Microsoft 365 allows you to access OneDrive cloud storage which means you can keep your most important files online and free up space on the device.</p>



<p>Battery life is always something to watch out for with cheaper laptops, but HP has managed to keep it respectable here: You’ll have hours of use out of one charge, which should be <strong>sufficient to get you through a school day</strong> or long study session. Add in <strong>preinstalled Windows 11 Home</strong>, and you’re receiving the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system with periodic updates, all for the cheap price.</p>
<p>At $172, this HP laptop is precariously close to “why not?” territory.</p>

                <p>Activision has brought Call of Duty: World War II back to the Microsoft Store and Xbox PC App after it was removed more than a month ago, though the company has still not said a word about what happened.</p><p>A statement released on August 27 confirmed that <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1960760388221640812" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 2017 game has returned</a>, and is once again available for PC Game Pass players. However, there was no explanation as to anything else related to the game's removal on July 4. At the time, Activision said it pulled the game to investigate "an issue."</p><p>While Activision never confirmed what happened, fans believe they worked it out. Call of Duty: WWII was reportedly overrun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-wwiis-game-pass-pc-version-was-pulled-reportedly-after-hacking-issues/1100-6532997/" data-ref-id="1100-6532997">Remote Code Execution attacks</a> that had players losing control of their PCs via a security exploit. A similar attack happened to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-servers-shutdown-after-exploit-allows-attackers-to-access-players-pc/1100-6499889/">Dark Souls 3 back in 2022</a>, which led to the entire trilogy being taken offline while the security issue was addressed.</p><p>Activision makes a point to not discuss Call of Duty security issues, saying that disclosing information about its security protocols would only help bad actors get a leg up to create new workarounds and exploits. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-rampant-cheating-activision-finally-responds/1100-6528903/" data-ref-id="1100-6528903">fight against cheaters and hackers is never-ending</a>, Activision has said.</p><p>The issue with Call of Duty: WWII was specific to the PC edition; the Xbox version on Game Pass was never removed after it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-this-underrated-call-of-duty-game-today/1100-6532845/" data-ref-id="1100-6532845">launched into Game Pass at the end of June.</a></p><p>Call of Duty: WWII was developed by Sledgehammer Games and was notable at the time in part for being the first fully WWII-set Call of Duty game since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Some of its most memorable missions including the Saving Private Ryan-like D-Day opening sequence and a mission where you go undercover in a German building in Paris featuring some tense moments.</p><p>You play as Ronald "Red" Daniels, with supporting squadmates including soldiers voiced by people like Josh Duhamel, Jeffrey Pierce, Jonathan Tucker, and Brett Zimmerman. The campaign's intensity is ramped up by the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ww2-ditching-health-regen-has-some-fo/1100-6449627/" data-ref-id="1100-6449627">there is no automatic health regeneration.</a></p><p>The next Call of Duty game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>. Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">canceled the game's Carry Forward program</a>, meaning operators and skins from Black Ops 6 will not be available in Black Ops 7. Activision also acknowledged the fan feedback that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=activision+acknoowledges+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=activision+acknoowledges+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABjvBTIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIKCAQQABiiBBiJBTIKCAUQABiABBiiBDIGCAYQRRhA0gEINTMxMWowajmoAgawAgHxBUiXjwJeshBt&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty has strayed from its identity</a> as a military shooter. Many took this to be a reference to the franchise's wacky skins, but the company did not mention this outright.</p>

<figure><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43834270dc9bd/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like many first-party Nintendo games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is absolutely stuffed with fun little details and easter eggs.</p>
<p>Some are pretty obvious, like the short challenge level that's basically a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, but others take a little more time and patience to notice. For example, you might be so busy smashing up the environment to even clock on that Pauline's idle animation actually changes throughout the game.</p>
<p>We mentioned this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">our review</a>, but it's such a small little detail and it can easily be missed if you're too busy having fun. Essentially, though, as Pauline gets more comfortable in the presence of Donkey Kong, her mood will begin to lighten. So she'll go from looking worried to playfully ruffling DK's fur, and even going so far as to tickle him. It's adorable!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4xugmit&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1960742460008591862">Supper Mario Broth</a>, the social media channel known for posting obscure Nintendo facts, showcases it wonderfully in the below video:</p>

<p>It just goes to show the care and attention that Nintendo gives to its creations, lending real authenticity to DK and Pauline's growing friendship throughout the game.</p>
<p>In other news, latest figures from the US indicate that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/donkey-kong-bananza-is-selling-like-bananas-on-switch-2-us">Bananza has sold incredibly well in the region</a>, reaching number three in the list of best-selling games during July 2025; a feat made more impressive when you consider that Nintendo doesn't share digital sales.</p>
