<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159975/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in October 2010. We're updating and republishing it to mark the game's arrival in the</em> <em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack GameCube library</a> on Switch 2</em><em>. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo has always had a dark side. Though it's built up a name for itself as a family-friendly company, every so often, when it can be contained no longer, its dark side manifests in the form of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> or a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a>. But while we expect a touch of gloom and misery in our Zeldas and Metroids, it may strike you as more than a bit curious that one of Nintendo's darkest adventures stars a platforming hero previously known for some of the happiest, most family-friendly games on earth.</p>
<p>But then, nearly every aspect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> will strike many as more than a bit curious. Nintendo had launched each of its three previous consoles with a bright and colourful Mario platformer, yet for the GameCube the company chose a dark, atmospheric title starring the mascot's lesser-known brother. Not only that, but Luigi's Mansion was about as far from a traditional Mario game as it could possibly get. It didn't even feature a jump button.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159983/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Perhaps it's for these reasons that Luigi's Mansion didn't get the recognition and reception Nintendo had hoped, at least at launch. It simply wasn't the game that people were expecting. It's a shame, really, because in actuality it's quite a remarkable little game, a unique and atmospheric experience that's as fun as it is technologically impressive.</p>
<p>The premise is a simple one: Luigi has won a mansion in a contest... except he doesn't remember entering any contest. To see what the deal is, he heads out to check out the mansion for himself.</p>
<p>Once inside, he is almost immediately confronted by a gang of disgruntled ghosts; thankfully, the notorious Professor E. Gadd (creator of such classic commodities as the Portraitificationizer and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s F.L.U.D.D.) comes to your aid with one of his latest inventions. He explains that Mario is being held captive inside. Naturally, Luigi must find a way to save him.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/accessibility-report/2195/embed @ 1761816632 -->
<p>In addition to your trusty flashlight, the Professor equips you with two of his cleverest inventions to survive the haunted abode: the Game Boy Horror (GBH) and the Poltergust 3000.</p>
<p>The former — which is quite literally a Game Boy Color with a more groan-inducing name — might be likened to the Scanning Visor in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>. The GBH screen is sort of like a window, and pressing the 'X' button lets you look through it and examine your surroundings. This item becomes useful as you encounter some of the game's trickier bosses, as it allows you to scan them and get insight into their possible weak points.</p>
<p>However, the focus is undoubtedly on the Poltergust 3000, which served as both an incredibly fun gameplay mechanic and a technological showcase for the then-new console. When used in tandem with the flashlight, the vacuum-like device is simply a way of sucking up the ghastly inhabitants – first shine your light on the ghost to catch it off guard, then quickly suck it up using the 'R' button and control stick.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159976/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>However, it quickly reveals itself to be much more than a simple vacuum. The GameCube's pressure-sensitive trigger buttons were quite cutting-edge when the system launched, and Luigi's Mansion was one of the first titles to showcase their use. Being able to precisely control the airflow of the Poltergust sets the groundwork for some pretty neat boss fights and puzzles, and this, in conjunction with the game's still-impressive physics engine, makes interacting with the environment a real joy.</p>
<p>The way in which your vacuum is able to affect things like table cloths, shelves, beach balls, and carpeting is still really cool even today, and goes a long way in pulling you into the game. Interacting with the environment doesn't go unrewarded, either – exploring every nook and cranny to find cash, pearls, and gold bars is addictive and gives the game a high score twist.</p>
<p>Structurally, Luigi's Mansion is about as far-removed from a Mario game as you could get – in fact, the closest thing you could compare it to might be dungeon-crawling in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Gone are the spacious and whimsical environments of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a>. Instead, you're given one ill-lit, claustrophobic, creepy mansion that you must explore room by room. Upon entering one, you're greeted with darkness; darkness, that is, and the haunting giggles of hidden ghosts. One by one, these spectres will reveal themselves, and it's your job to suck them up.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159979/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Clearing all of them in a given room will cause the lights to come on and, more often than not, a treasure chest to appear. Nine times out of ten, these will contain keys that allow you to access some previously impassable door, and round-and-round the formula goes.</p>
<p>It would run the risk of being repetitive if the core gameplay mechanics weren't so much fun, but thankfully the odd satisfaction of seeing Luigi getting yanked around the room by unruly ghosts never gets old, and the game's knack for creating a mood means exploring each new room is always exciting.</p>
<p>This being a launch title and all, it's not surprising that this launch title isn't the prettiest GameCube game, but what it lacks in pixels, it makes up for with artistic flair and technological impressiveness. In addition to the aforementioned physics and great use of the controller, Luigi's Mansion was also a pioneer in realistic lighting effects. The flashlight was an immediate stunner, and its effect still manages to impress after other flashlight-driven games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/silent_hill_shattered_memories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake</a> drove the concept further.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159984/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>But one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects is how much work went into turning Luigi, who began life as Mario's bland palette-swap, into a hilarious and lovable individual with a distinct personality. Simply put, the character animations in this game are astounding: the way Luigi's hand trembles as he opens a new door, or how his teeth chatter as he walks down a darkened hallway. He flattens into a thin sheet of paper when something falls on him, he stretches and expands when screaming with fear — with care and detail, Nintendo turned a once carbon-copy character into one as expressive and malleable as something out of a Bob Clampett cartoon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Luigi's Mansion's use of sound is still some of the cleverest you'll hear in a video game. There's essentially only one theme here, but it's amazing how much mileage Nintendo gets out of it. Sometimes it plays hauntingly in the background. Sometimes, in the creepiest and quietest of rooms, Luigi will whistle and hum it nervously to himself, as if to keep his mind off the ominous danger at hand.</p>
<p>And in rooms with sneaky ghosts that refuse to show themselves, if you listen carefully, you can hear them cackling the tune to get a better idea of where they are. Genius.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What Luigi's Mansion lacks in content and longevity, it makes up for with a remarkably well-crafted and unique single campaign that will keep you consistently entertained from front to back. It's not quite on the same level as Mario's better outings, but the game is so entirely different from anything Mario has ever starred in that it feels unjust to compare them; and, really, it's this complete departure from the Mario formula that makes the game so successful in the first place.</p>
<p>The gameplay design is so uncommon that it's pretty difficult to slap a genre label on it, but suffice to say that if you consider yourself a gamer or Nintendo fan, you owe it to yourself to give Luigi's first spooky adventure a shot.</p></section>

			<p>The MMORPG AION 2 will launch globally in 2026 with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on the PC version (the game will also be available on mobile devices).</p>



<p>The initial launch in South Korea and Taiwan is set for November 19. The game is a sequel to Aion: The Tower of Eternity, which launched in 2008 in Korea and the following year worldwide. The original game was powered by Crytek's CRYENGINE, whereas this new installment is made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>Aion 2 takes place around two hundred years later and features a world that, according to NCSOFT, is 36 times larger. Moreover, unlike the “zoned” areas of the original, Aion 2 features a seamless, fully explorable world with no loading screens between vast regions. Players will once again choose between two factions, Elyos and Asmodian, which are eternally locked in conflict. However, unlike in the original game, they will be placed in separate servers, so the conflict between them will occur entirely in the Abyss. On this special PvP battlefield, the populations of two servers (one for Elyos and another for Asmodian players) will clash.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the developers have promised over 200 dungeons to explore that range from solo instances to group dungeons for up to eight players. Eight are also the classes available at launch: Gladiator, Templar, Assassin, Marksman, Sorcerer, Spiritmaster, Cleric, and Chanter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The news was shared by NVIDIA as part of a press release highlighting the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gamer-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce Gamer Festival</a>, which is live today at COEX in Seoul to celebrate 25 years of GeForce in South Korea. The MMORPG is playable at the event, just like NCSOFT's MMOTPS Cinder City, which we checked out at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an exclusive developer interview</a>.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared a brief update by KRAFTON on PUBG Ally, the 'co-playable character' powered by ACE <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at CES 2025</a>. PUBG Ally, which is powered by the small language model (SMM) Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k and enables AI teammates to support the player including even engaging in combat with other players, will host a 'user test event' early next year. </p>

            <p>GOG continue to conquer the world of old games you either remember fondly or have totally forgotten about. They've added 18 new ones to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> this week, with the latest arrivals being the Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0.</p>
<p>It's good to see the storefront's preservation efforts keep on expand, given they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-say-their-preservation-program-has-been-harder-than-we-thought-thanks-to-drm-and-elusive-creators">recently revaled</a> that this program's been a tougher undertaking than originally envisioned thus far. Things that're worth doing are rarely easy, though, are they? Well, ok, maybe having a cheeky biscuit with your supper is still worth doing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0's arrivals were <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983807379125702969">announced just this morning</a>, and they've been chucked straight into GOG's classic Resi bundle. In terms of tweaks to get them running as they should, both have had their stability checked, their compatibility with Windows 10 and 11 okayed, and support for cloud saves added. They're also currently grabbable with a 75% discount which knocks each down to £4/equivalent until November 13th.</p>
<p>The addition of those two follows 16 other games hitting the preservation program <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983175739714191850">earlier this week</a>. Tomb Raider GOTY, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-codename-47">Hitman: Codename 47</a> are the headliners to my young eye. However, you may have much stronger feelings for one or all of (clears throat):</p><p>SPORE Collection, Clive Barker's Undying, Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy, Superhero League of Hoboken, Heart of China, Thunderscape, North &amp; South, Titus The Fox: To Marrakech and Back, Battle Chess 4000, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>: Prisoner of Ice, and Bloodwych.</p>
<p>GOG say their preservation program's 250 games wide with these new additions, which is inching closer to their stated goal of around 300 to 350 by the close of 2025. I'm sad they don't publicly track a 'number of private investigators hired to track down rights holders' stat, but retaining some mystery there's understandable.</p>

              <p>There are two big names when it comes to video game escape rooms, and they’re remarkably similar ones. First you have <em>Escape Academy</em>, a wonderfully bonkers college for escape room artists, with a story that somehow includes murder and time travel. Then you have <em>Escape Simulator</em>, a more straight-faced collection of digital escape rooms, but with a much bigger focus on involved puzzles and deep mystery. Both are excellent, but only one of them has a sequel just released. <em>Escape Simulator 2</em> came out this week, offering even more elaborately themed rooms and even more complex challenges to solve. I spoke to developers Pine Studio to find out more about how to find the balance between emulating real-world rooms, and embracing the impossibilities afforded by video games.</p>  <p>Escape rooms, as a concept, are showing no signs of fading in popularity. On the day&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em> released, I wasn’t playing the game because I was out celebrating my birthday with my family by playing in a real-life escape room (<a href="https://tempo-bath.com/">Tempo</a> in Bath, UK—it was&nbsp;<em>fantastic</em>). And we were spoiled for choice, with more and more buildings in my local area taken over by these hands-on, locked-in puzzle chambers. A well-designed escape room is such a thrill, as you and your buddies scramble to unscramble codes, piecing together clues to cause a bookshelf to reveal itself as a secret door, then squeezing down a passage to find a hidden briefcase and new set of clues…It’s the best. But it’s also pretty pricey, and requires getting together a group of people willing to play. When that can’t happen, that’s when video game escape rooms step in.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator</em>, released with perfect timing during the covid lockdowns of October 2021, provided a way to play such challenges when leaving the house and gathering in groups was very much a bad idea. And it was utterly splendid, a really superb collection of 16 rewarding rooms. Then came the DLC, and oh boy, there was a lot of it! In the years since, the number of rooms has reached 50, with more still to come. Given this, I wondered how a studio knows when it’s time to stop adding to their previous success and make the decision to create a sequel. “What pushed us toward&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em>,” says Boris Barbir, co-founder of developer Pine Studio, “was the chance to create much larger rooms with a more realistic look. That change opened the door to a whole new kind of puzzles that we could not do before.” That doesn’t mean they’re done with the first game, however. Remarkably, there are still new rooms in development, with Barbir noting, “We will continue supporting it for a long time.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639911" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639911"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639911">© Pine Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Part of Pine Studios’ method is to involve real-world escape room creators when developing their challenges. “For both games we worked closely with real-life escape room designers,” says Barbir. “They start by sketching puzzles on paper, then we curate, adapt, and build them into playable virtual spaces. From there we go through several rounds of testing and adjustments until everything feels right.” For the sequel, the developers had the smart idea to add another group of consultants to the process: the best community creators who had built rooms using the first game’s room creation tools. “Their input,” says Barbir, naming Zesty, Elkondo, and Sade, “helped us keep the puzzles fresh and engaging.”</p>

 <p>But obviously such designs have a delicate path to walk. With the freedom afforded by playing on a computer, these games don’t necessarily have to stick to the laws of reality, allowing for events and sequences that real-life rooms could never deliver. But then, at the same time, if they become too fanciful they can lose that unique sense of being trapped in an elaborate room and the hands-on nature of solving the puzzles. I wondered how Pine Studios approaches this balance. “We always try to keep the game true to being a simulator,” Barbir says. “Our playtests showed that players generally do not enjoy puzzles that work ‘magically’ without logic behind them. We design spaces and mechanisms that feel grounded in reality.” That’s not to say that magic isn’t a part of the games, however.&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em> begins with four puzzles set in a vampire’s castle, involving literal magic mirrors and some rather impossible spells, but there’s always a grounding rationale to their use. “The virtual world still gives us plenty of freedom,” Barbir notes. “We can build a pirate island or a zero-gravity spaceship, things that would be almost impossible to pull off in real life, but the puzzles themselves remain logical and believable.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639912"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639912">© Pine Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The community certainly became a big part of the original game. Via Steam’s Workshop feature, players were able to add their own creations to the mix, with over 4,000 rooms submitted in the last four years. A pattern Pine Studio noticed was that “a huge number of them leaned into darker, creepier or horror themes.” The same, Barbir says, is true of real-world escape rooms, with horror-themed settings proving the most popular. “In the first game we kept things light and playful,” he adds, “but with the sequel we wanted to explore that darker side.” That’s not to say this is a horror game, and there’s certainly nothing even approaching a jump scare. Instead it has a “moodier” atmosphere, still entirely suitable for younger players, but with a bit more spookiness.</p>

 <p><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> comes with a 2.0 version of its room creator, and the hope the community will get just as engaged this time around with the more elaborate tools and room sizes. Of course, that requires some time, given just how involved it is to build something worth playing. A handful have started to appear, but it’ll be in the next few months that the game’s 12 developer-made rooms will start to be joined by the best creations from players. Talking of which, how long exactly does it take for the developers to create just one room? “Some of our larger rooms,” Barbir says, “take over six months to design, test and polish before they feel ready. It is a lot of work, but the result is worth it.”</p> <p>I’d agree. I’ve played a fair few rooms in the sequel now, and they so satisfyingly scratch that escape room itch. You can play in co-op, too, to really embrace that pleasure of working as a team to crack the mysteries. And completed rooms unlock versions with even more difficult puzzles, giving a genre that’s usually very much one-and-done a reason to replay. Of course, if the previous game is anything to go by, we can expect dozens more official rooms to be added to the game over the next few years (and it’s worth noting plenty of these were free, especially the bizarre crossover packs like rooms themed around&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em> and&nbsp;<em>Among</em> Us, with other DLC adding five new rooms for around $5).</p> <p><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/">is out now on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>Finding an affordable cordless vacuum that actually delivers professional-grade cleaning feels impossible these days. Most budget options sacrifice suction power or build quality, while premium models from Dyson or Shark demand prices that make your wallet weep. The Shark IX141 Pet Cordless Stick Vacuum sits firmly in the mid to high-end category with its Hypervelocity suction and 40-minute runtime, but Amazon’s early Black Friday discount slashes the price from $299 to $149. This all-time low pricing positions a quality Shark vacuum at entry-level cost, which explains why over 20,000 people grabbed this deal last month alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hypervelocity Suction That Handles Real Messes</h2>
<p>The Hypervelocity motor provides strong suction that <strong>handles everything from fine dust to pet hair on both carpets and hard floors</strong>. Shark’s bristle brushroll has self-cleaning technology that stops hair tangles, and automatically clears wrapped strands while you vacuum. This feature is essential for pet owners or homes with family members who have long hair since regular brush rolls quickly become ineffective when hair wraps around them.</p>
<p>The <strong>40-minute runtime in standard mode</strong> with no accessories gives you enough battery life to clean most homes on a single charge and this performance surpasses what many competitors provide at this price. The runtime stays consistent throughout the battery cycle, which means it doesn’t weaken as the charge runs low. <strong>Also, charging from empty to full takes about 3.5 hours</strong> which is typical for cordless vacuums in this category.</p>



<p>The LED headlights in the floor nozzle light up hidden debris that you might miss in dim corners, under furniture and along dark baseboards. These bright lights uncover dust, pet hair and dirt that blend into shadows so that you can clean everything instead of just moving mess around. The low-profile design is slim enough to fit under most furniture, reaching spots where dust bunnies gather but traditional upright vacuums cannot access.</p>
<p>The <strong>XL dust cup holds 0.4 quarts of debris</strong> and allows for several cleaning sessions before you need to empty it. The CleanTouch Dirt Ejector lets you dispose of dirt with one touch, keeping your hands clean and stopping dust from escaping into the air. This hands-free system opens the bottom of the dust cup completely, letting compacted debris fall straight into your trash without getting stuck inside.</p>



<p>Switching to handheld mode takes seconds; just remove the wand. This transforms the vacuum into a lightweight tool for above-floor cleaning tasks. The <strong>handheld version weighs only 7.5 pounds</strong>&nbsp;which makes it easy to clean stairs, furniture, car interiors, and ceiling corners without tiring. The Pet Multi-Tool has an anti-tangle conical brush bar designed to lift embedded fur from upholstery, car seats, and pet beds where hair collects stubbornly. The included Crevice Tool reaches into narrow gaps between cushions, along baseboards, and into tight corners where standard attachments don’t fit.</p>
<p>At $149, you pay half the usual price for a vacuum that competes with models priced at $250 or more, making this early Black Friday deal one of the best values for cordless cleaning.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment’s busy 2025 ends with the release of The Outer Worlds 2. If you’re committed to the series, you can upgrade to the Premium Edition to get more bang for your sci-fi buck. But doing so also comes with a great benefit and a bit of thinly-veiled banter.</p>



<p>With so many big releases toward the end of 2025, it’s easy to forget that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is sandwiched in between all of this. The first game was tremendous, and the sci-fi sequel is just as good, if not better. If you’re really keen, you can go all out for the Premium Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-comes-with-a-flaw">The Outer Worlds 2 Premium Edition Comes With A ‘Flaw’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>DLC and more are coming your way. Image by the PlayStation Store</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chances are, you’ve already checked out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all The Outer Worlds 2 Pre-Order Bonuses &amp; Editions</a>. The Premium Edition is the big, bad wolf of the pack. It comes with future DLC expansions, cosmetics, and a digital artbook and soundtrack. But one thing it doesn’t make clear is the Flaw you can gain from it.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 has many ‘Flaws,’ all of which give your character permanent attribute afflictions and benefits. The Consumerism Flaw is automatically presented to you for buying the Premium Edition.</p>



<p>“<strong>You’re the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you’re more interested in buying the next big thing than in financial planning</strong>,” the Flaw’s description says.</p>



<p>If you accept the Flaw, you gain “-15% Vendor Prices” and “-10% Sell Value at Vendors.” It’s an optional Flaw, so you don’t have to take it, but Obsidian’s self-awareness and humor are very much appreciated on this one. Basically saying ‘We’re glad you bought our game’s most expensive edition, but praise capitalism!’</p>



<p>Have you picked up The Outer Worlds 2? Do you plan to? Let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which is getting more popular by the minute.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> has officially launched, and like several other live-service games, the servers for the extraction shooter game are currently being overwhelmed with people attempting to log in. On Steam alone, the game has currently peaked at 153,919 players at the time of writing (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), and that's not even factoring in players on the Epic Games Store version or console players on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of people are getting error connection messages, with the issue being compounded by players constantly trying their luck to gain access. Arc Raiders developer Embark Studios hasn't issued a formal statement yet, but if you're one of the people affected by online connection errors, you may want to be patient and wait for things to die down a little.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>A rocky start to online games isn't novel these days, with numerous live-service titles all experiencing these teething pains. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-developer-in-crisis-mode-working-on-fixes-for-launch-issues/1100-6520932/" data-ref-id="1100-6520932">Helldivers 2 was an infamous example</a>, with other games like Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft also experiencing surges in player traffic during the launch of new expansions. We haven't even reached the weekend yet, so Arc Raiders is likely going to see even more players flock to its servers for a few days of post-apocalyptic scavenging.</p><p>This launch does bode well for the game, as it's sandwiched between two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-shooter-games/2900-6622/" data-ref-id="2900-6622">biggest shooters of the year</a>, Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Embark Studios co-founder Patrick Soderlund was recently quizzed about the launch timing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-aint-scared-launching-between-battlefield-6-and-black-ops-7/1100-6535792/">but he expressed confidence in Arc Raiders and its ability to find an audience</a>.</p><p>In the months leading up to its release, Arc Raiders saw some pretty radical changes. Originally envisioned as a free-to-play PvE shooter, development saw Arc Raiders evolve into an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-new-game-dumps-free-to-play-model-changes-to-40-premium-release/1100-6525993/">extraction shooter priced at $40</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-server-test-put-up-some-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535545/">The game also posted impressive numbers on Steam</a> for its server slam test, and it looks like that early slice of Arc Raiders has won quite a few people over to it during the busiest time on the gaming calendar.</p>

If you've ever wondered what the game would be like if the soldiers were ducks instead of people, you're not alone. Team Soda, a development team of Chinese company Bilibili, released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Oct.16.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not a multiplayer game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, instead reimagining the "extraction shooter" genre as a "PvE" single-player game. It may be easy to write off the game as a joke or novelty: The juxtaposition of the cute ducklings against the backdrop of a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is hard to imagine working. But it has the hardcore survival elements for a surprisingly deep experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> works because Team Soda isn't necessarily looking to fit the ducks into a realistic world, but building out its own brutal but silly environment. It works. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020?emclan=103582791474863792&amp;emgid=617681009992795859">Escape from Duckov</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020?emclan=103582791474863792&amp;emgid=617681009992795859">&nbsp;reached 500,000 players on Oct. 19</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then doubled that in days, bringing in more than a million players by Oct. 22, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020?emclan=103582791474863792&amp;emgid=503965668093198676">Team Soda announced on Oct. 22</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. On Oct. 28, Team Soda announced it'd doubled its playerbase once again—now </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/">two million players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dhs-will-continue-using-game-and-pop-culture-iconography-in-messaging" target="_self" data-discover="true">DHS will continue using game and pop culture iconography in messaging</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s all about that PvE vibe and accessibility for such a hardcore genre," Tongpeng Chen, Bilibili's head of global publishing, said. "Players choose the difficulty and experience they would like to have in the game, venture into the wild, gather resources, then return to base to level up, build stuff, and complete missions."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That satisfying loop of “loot, upgrade, repeat” gives steady positive feedback—way more relaxing than the stress of PVP shooters." It lets players truly lose themselves in the world of Duckov. Per Jeff’s words, players are 'living' in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s world."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tongpeng Chen told Game Developer that a team of four people make up developer Team Soda, led by producer Jeff Chen. Jeff Chen worked at Bilibili for seven years, and the rest of the team worked together previously on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Soda Crisis</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Snake Force</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "We initially thought selling 300K copies would be decent, 500K would’ve been a dream," Tongpen Chen said. "The current number is absolutely mind-blowing and encouraging for our team."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tongpeng Chen said there's some luck to the game's success, but that Jeff Chen's dedication to the genre means he's an expert—he's played more than 1,400 hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Jeff noticed that in Tarkov, a lot of players really enjoy the PvE experience that is also the essence of [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Tarkov]</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—not just combat, but also the progression and exploration parts," Tongpeng Chen said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/amazon-is-ending-active-development-on-new-world" target="_self" data-discover="true">Amazon is ending active development on New World</a></p><p>Image via Team Soda/bilibili.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Still, that PvE craving wasn’t really being met these days. So our dev team put themselves in the players' shoes and focused on what they truly wanted. What players value in the game shouldn't just be money or high-value collectibles. Sometimes, bringing back a very mundane, everyday item determines the success or failure of a quest or a key progression milestone. Even if a player fails an extraction and loses valuable gear, they still have the motivation to go in again."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> surpassed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/">300,000 concurrent players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Oct. 27, a number that was reached after steadily climbing for days. These Steam heights pushed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> past games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battlefield 6, Apex: Legends, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto 5</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which are mainstays on the top games chart on Steam.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game peaks at prime game-playing hours in countries like China, where the game was developed, and slips back down to around 40,000 players during standard United States daytime hours. It suggests that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s core audience—at least at this point—is international.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Escape from Duckov</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was announced by Team Soda, then a team of four, on Jan. 22. It debuted with a demo version of the game that ran for two weeks, starting a day later, on Jan. 23.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A good business (or work) laptop should ideally be portable, reliable, and fast enough to deal with everything your busy days throw at it. However, most laptops that check these boxes usually cost a ton, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/">Amazon is being generous with a limited-time deal on the 17-inch HP business laptop, now available for just $700 after a massive 75% discount</a>. That’s $2,100 off the original price, which is hard to ignore if you’ve been meaning to treat yourself to a powerful upgrade without blowing your budget. And as if that wasn’t enough, you also get an accessory bundle thrown in for absolutely free!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Run Multiple Applications Without Slowdowns</h2>
<p>The power this laptop packs is more than enough to handle resource-intensive apps and creative projects without slowing down. This is made possible with a 10-core Intel i5-1334U processor that can boost up to 4.6GHz for fast speeds, plus the 16GB of DDR4 RAM that makes it easy to work on multiple projects at once. If your productive days involve some serious multitasking, you’re surely going to appreciate how this laptop makes it easy to power through without frustrating lags.</p>
<p>Storage is taken care of by a 512GB SSD that gets you both fast startup times and ample file storage. It’s not massive, but it should be enough to house your important work files, plus media content like photos, videos, and even a bunch of movies.</p>



<p>The display gives you bright, vivid visuals with its 17.3-inch HD+ BrightView screen. It’s also quite easy on the eyes, whether you’re working in a dim setting or by a bright window. You won’t be left with eye strain at the end of a long day.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, plus a range of ports like 2 USB-A ports, 1 USB-C, HDMI 2.1, and a headphone/mic combo jack. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a wireless silent mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, and Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed). All of that is valued at $199, but it’s included here for free. Just keep in mind the accessory pack is shipped separately, so don’t panic if it doesn’t arrive in the same box as the laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5104/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going at a discount.</a> The offer won’t last long, so it’s best to jump in on it while there’s still time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox gaming revenues have declined by $113 million, or 2%, due to drop in hardware sales and limited growth of gaming content and services in Q1 FY2026 over the prior year, Microsoft confirmed in its latest financial report.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the company reported its<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/press-release-webcast"> Q1 FY2026 earnings</a>, confirming the Xbox hardware revenue 29% decline, which is offset in part by growth in Xbox content and services, whose $5.5 billion revenue is a 1% improvement over the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"strong prior year"</em>. This revenue increase was driven by growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content, and partially offset by a decline in first-party content.</p>



<p>Xbox hardware sales declining is hardly surprising, as console sales were already down 22% last quarter. With the current generation almost at the end, increasing prices, and a multiplatform strategy that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/">bringing tentpole franchises like Halo to the PlayStation 5</a>, no improvement was to be expected. </p>



<p>Considering the above, it will be very interesting to see how much of a difference the next-generation Xbox will make. The new system will reportedly be <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a very premium experience</a> combining <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-will-reportedly-be-best-of-both-worlds-between-pc-and-console/">the best of the PC and console worlds</a>, but its popularity could be severely impacted by its price, which is <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-magnus-bill-of-materials-may-push-its-price-well-beyond-1000/">expected to be much higher than the price of the PlayStation 6.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-12-in-1-docking-station-goes-for-pennies-and-it-works-as-a-monitor-stand-too-2000640096</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-12-in-1-docking-station-goes-for-pennies-and-it-works-as-a-monitor-stand-too.1339084/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk cable management is one of those daily frustrations that slowly chips away at your sanity. You’ve got charging cables snaking across the surface, USB dongles competing for space, and that eternal question of where to actually put your keyboard when you need more room to work. The Anker 675 USB-C docking station tackles this chaos head-on by <strong>combining a monitor stand with a full-featured 12-in-1 hub</strong> that keeps everything connected and organized in one sleek package. Right now, Amazon has dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5119/">award-winning workspace solution to an all-time low of $169, down from its usual $249 price tag</a>, and this early Black Friday deal deserves your attention if you’re tired of wrestling with desk clutter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5119/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The brilliance of this design is in how it turns wasted vertical space into useful storage: Instead of <strong>your monitor resting directly on the desk, the Anker docking station lifts it by 3.54 inches</strong>. This creates the ideal space underneath for your keyboard, laptop, or other accessories you want close but out of sight. This height adjustment not only looks neat but it also raises your screen to eye level. This helps you keep better posture throughout your workday instead of leaning forward and straining your neck. The <strong>unit measures 21.26 inches long and 8.66 inches deep</strong>, and provides ample surface area to support monitors weighing up to 22 pounds.</p>
<h2>Twelve Ports That Actually Matter</h2>
<p>The port selection on the Anker device includes everything you need for a modern workspace without cluttering it with unnecessary connections: The <strong>single USB-C upstream port</strong> on the underside connects to your laptop and supports up to <strong>100W of Power Delivery</strong>. This means it can charge even power-hungry laptops like the MacBook Pro or Dell laptop while managing all your peripherals through one cable.<strong> Two additional USB-C ports on the side share 45W of Power Delivery</strong> between them. They operate at 10Gbps transfer speeds which makes it easy to move large files or back up photos quickly. The<strong> three USB-A ports also run at 10Gbps</strong> with one port providing 7.5W for charging and another offering 4.5W.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDMI port</strong> supports resolutions up to 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz, delivering clear visuals for everything from spreadsheet work to photo editing. You’ll need to use this HDMI connection for external displays since the USB-C ports do not support video output, so keep that in mind as you plan your setup. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> both support UHS-I speeds up to 104MB/s which makes them quick enough for photographers who regularly transfer RAW files. An Ethernet port provides gigabit speeds for wired internet connections. The <strong>3.5mm combo audio jack</strong> handles both input and output for headphones or external speakers.</p>
<p>The <strong>wireless charging pad</strong> in the top right corner delivers 10W for compatible Android devices and 7.5W for iPhones: This matches the output of most standalone Qi chargers. This feature clears another cable from your desk and keeps your phone visible and accessible throughout the day. The pad works reliably even with phone cases on, so you won’t have to remove your device every time you want to recharge the battery.</p>



<p>The<strong> included 180W power supply</strong> provides enough energy to run the entire unit, allowing full charging speeds to your laptop while powering all connected peripherals at the same time. Setup takes just minutes since everything is plug-and-play with Windows, macOS, and Chrome OS systems. The aluminum alloy construction gives the unit a high-quality feel and matches well with modern office equipment.</p>
<p>This docking station won a <em>CES 2023 Innovation Award</em> for a good reason: It addresses multiple workspace problems in one product instead of forcing you to piece together separate solutions. At the current sale price of $169, you save a lot of money compared to buying a quality monitor stand and a similar USB-C hub separately.</p>

              <p>Mario has been a classic for decades, and it’s loved by quite literally just about everyone, no matter their age. The franchise goes back to the early 1980s when Mario made his first appearance in Donkey Kong as the Jump Man before getting his own game, Super Mario Bros., in 1985. Since then, he’s become one of the most beloved video game characters, and you can now bring his adventures home with the Super Mario Kart 8 anti-gravity mini RC racer by Nintendo for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/">On a regular day, it would run you around $40, but today, you can snag it up for just $30 on Amazon after a nice $10 discount</a>. It’s a great pick for some early holiday shopping, but the deal won’t last long. The set was already quite affordable at $40, but the current discount makes it an even better pick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Super Fun Racing Modes</h2>
<p>The kart has a good size and weight. It’s light for kids to carry around easily, but still sturdy enough to take a few bumps. There are two racing modes; standard and anti-gravity mode. The standard mode lets kids race around like a regular RC car, while the anti-gravity mode flips the wheels to perform drifts and tricks. It can even pull off 360-degree spins and wheelies! Switching between both modes is simple and just takes a single press of a button.</p>
<p>The racer runs on a 2.4GHz remote, which gives you a range of up to 100 feet. To give you an idea, that’s enough to race around your living room without slowdowns. The remote is also easy to use, so your kids will be showing off cool stunts and zipping through complicated spots in no time.</p>



<p>It’s designed for ages 8 and up, but we won’t judge if you feel the need to jump in and take a few laps yourself. Mario Kart is for everyone!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5103/">This deal brings the price down of this already-affordable Super Mario Kart 8 anti-gravity mini RC racer to just $30.</a> It’s practically a steal, and also a great chance to grab more than one if you have multiple young players at home. That way, everyone gets their own kart to race and show off without running to you every two minutes. Just be sure to hurry before the offer wraps up for good!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-halo-dev-criticizes-%E2%80%9Clame%E2%80%9D-remake-changes.1339075/</guid>

<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is the name of the long-awaited Combat Evolved remake. It brings Halo to PlayStation for the first time ever. However, one of the game’s original developers has noticed some discrepancies in the game’s early footage and questioned the changes, as they alter the game.</p>



<p>Time stood still when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-dev-criticizes-lame-remake-changes/Combat%20Evolved%20Remake%20Officially%20Announced%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Combat Evolved Remake was officially announced</a>. Bungie’s original creation was about to become celebrated once more. This time, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> owners would get to experience history with Halo making its blue-brand debut. Not everyone is as thrilled with the game’s first footage, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-combat-evolved-remake-makes-key-changes-from-original">Halo: Combat Evolved Remake Makes Key Changes From Original </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Which do you prefer? Image from Halo Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Alongside the remake announcement, we also got to witness a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-13-minute-gameplay-demo-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13-minute gameplay demo</a>. It showed off the game’s glorious opening minutes. The graphics look stunning, and it’s the Halo you know, but better.</p>



<p>Well, most people seem to think so. One person who’s not as impressed is former Bungie game designer Jaime Griesemer. The now-creative director at Highwire Games was responsible for numerous roles at Bungie, including designing, developing, tuning, and scripting gameplay objects, missions, core combat principles, and the tutorial and demo.</p>



<p>After seeing the new gameplay, here’s what Griesemer had to say on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You aren’t supposed to be able to take the Warthog up to steamroll the Hunters. I intentionally placed rocks in the way so you had to fight them on foot. When you can just smash the crates out of the way it wrecks the encounters. But the worst part? They put trees in the landing area of the WooHoo Jump. Lame. @game_fabricator What have they done to beloved B30?!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>@game_fabricator being Marcus Lehto: Former co-creator of Halo, who was recently ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-battlefield-6-director-marcus-lehto-disappointed-with-devs-being-omitted-from-credits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disappointed’ that he and various team members were omitted from the Battlefield 6 credits.</a></p>



<p>Griesemer replied to many commenters on the post. He understood that “You can FORCE the Warthog through the gap in a variety of ways. I literally spent most of a day making it discouraging and difficult but not impossible. You’re welcome!” and that “On further analysis I’m sure it’s because the vehicles take damage and so you’re just as likely to destroy the hog as get it over the rocks. If anything that makes it -worse- because -none- of the vehicle tricks are going to work anymore.”</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has returned to the subject of AI, this time suggesting the controversial technology could never create anything like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> because "no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model."
</p>
<p>
Zelnick has taken a measured position on artificial intelligence - a term he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">previously described as an "oxymoron"</a> - in the past, saying that while he's "pretty enthusiastic" about its potential to help the company "do a better job and to do a more efficient job" as a tool, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-doesnt-think-advances-in-ai-will-make-it-easier-to-create-hits">takes "genius" to "create hits"</a> and "genius is the domain of human beings".
</p>
<p>
His latest comments, shared during <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CNBC's recent Technology Executive Council Summit</a>, expand on that perspective, specifically in regard to AI's "derivative" nature. One immediate concern for Strauss is copyright. "We have to protect our intellectual property, but more than that, we have to be mindful of others," he explained. "If you create intellectual property with AI, it's not protectable." Ultimately, Take-Two's content must stand up to copyright laws, he added, while also protecting people's rights, leading to "constraints".
</p>
<p>
But Zelnick also believes the inherently "backward looking" nature of AI - a result of its dependence on big data sets of old information - means it's "derivative" in a way that doesn't suit creativity. "Let's say there were no constraints [on AI]. Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the Grand Theft Auto marketing plan?" he continued. "The answer is no. A, you can't do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn't end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative."
</p><p>
"There are many, many, many things in life that are predictable based on data," he added. "Anything that involves backward-looking data compute, [AI is] really good for that and that applies to lots of things [but] what we do at Take-Two, anything that isn't attached to that, it's going to be really, really bad at."
</p>
<p>
Referencing Grand Theft Auto specifically, Zelnick added, "What [developer] <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> tries to do, and so far has done over and over again, is create something that approaches perfection... There is no creativity that can exist by definition in any AI model, because it is data-driven."
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 launches on 26th May 2026 following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delay earlier this year</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>

			<p>Work on Valve's HLX project, rumored to be the highly anticipated Half-Life 3, is continuing with more optimization passes, suggesting that the project's polishing phase is in full swing.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube a few hours ago, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McVicker</a>, who provided correct updates on Valve's project for years before their official announcements, reviewed some of the additions made to the Source 2 engine with the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4522268822998171356">Counter-Strike 2 October 15 update.</a></p>



<p>Unlike past updates, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">introduced new systems and features that aren't in use in any other game powered by the Valve engine</a>, the latest update focuses more on optimization and polishing, introducing an automated process to clean up system resources, changes to the sound simulation and liquid simulation systems, and more. </p>



<p>Though in a smaller number than before, new features likely meant for Half-Life 3 HLX have also been added by the latest Counter-Strike 2 update to the Source 2 engine, such as an expanded damage group system to take into account enemy models other than humanoid, and an asynchronous particle simulation system which will compute particles interfacing with simulated wind speed, allowing wind speed to adjust how the particles react on a case-by-case basis as well.</p>



<p>The most notable addition, and the one that is sparking the most discussion in the community, is the introduction of a new icon that denotes a new group of assets labeled as <em>"science"</em>. Tyler McVicker speculates that this doesn't mean much for Half-Life 3 HLX, as, from every update seen to date, the game is clearly in a polishing phase where no assets are being added. Though this usually is the final development phase, Valve could take years to complete it, so there's no indication the game is any close to release.</p>



<p>However, something could be brewing, and the game's release could not be too far in the future. According to rumors, a trailer for Half-Life 3 HLX is being worked on, and if how Valve handled Half-Life Alyx marketing and release is any indication, the game should be launching shortly after its announcement. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Tyler McVicker speculates that something related to Half-Life 3 HLX can happen in November, we have to take any potential reveal date with a massive grain of salt, considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/">previous reveal windows ended up not being correct</a>. As of now, only one thing seems to be almost for sure: the Half-Life series is far from being done.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apples-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise-2000639857</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-new-11-inch-m5-ipad-pro-is-already-cheaper-on-amazon-a-subtle-pre-black-friday-surprise.1339060/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When the&nbsp;<em>really</em> big sales events of the year get close — Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, etc., one of the big questions is always “What’s Apple going to do?” If this new Amazon deal on the brand-new M5 iPad Pro is any indication, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">Apple’s going to be dipping at least a toe in the Black Friday pond in the weeks to come. For the first time, the 11-inch M5 iPad Pro is taking a price drop — it’s $949 right now, down by $50.</a></p>
<p>Apple fans and creative pros in particular are going to be all over this one, because the new M5 iPad Pro comes closer to full high-end laptop power than any tablet yet. The M5 chip is a game changer in terms of speed and pure power, and the newly released iPadOS 26 is a massive leap forward. The two combine with Apple Intelligence to create a tablet that can do nearly everything a powerful laptop can, especially if you add the Magic Keyboard to complete the experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Faster, Thinner, Better</h2>
<p>Strangely enough, the new IPad Pro is lighter than the iPad Air — 0.98 pounds, which speaks to just how much size and weight Apple has cut from their latest tablet design while amping up its power and ability. The M5 chip gets the lion’s share of attention, and deservedly so, but don’t sleep on the N1 wireless chip that’s also in the new iPad Pro, because it makes Wi-Fi 7, Thread, and Bluetooth 6 connections happen.</p>
<p>As with all things Apple, the screen on the M5 iPad Pro is best-in-class. It’s an Ultra Retina XDR tandem OLED screen with anti-glare treatment and an oleophobic coating that cuts down on fingerprints — an essential feature for an elite tablet. The ProMotion adaptive refresh rate ranges from 10Hz to a blistering 120Hz, and the peak performance of 1,600 nits delivers all of the exceptional quality of the screen in its full glory.</p>



<h2>All About the Images</h2>
<p>The M5 iPad Pro’s cameras and what it can do with the images are where this tablet really shines. The 12MP Wide camera at the rear of the tablet can shoot 4K ProRes video, and also be used as a powerful document scanner and AR code unlocking device. The front of the tablet has a powerhouse 12MP landscape Center Stage camera for pristine video calls and conferencing. When you shoot your videos or stills, Apple Intelligence takes over to deliver the best and most powerful range of editing and creative options of any tablet on the market.’</p>
<p>The first price break on this brand-new tablet is definitely an occasion, even if it’s just 5%. That might not be the case with other tablets, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5102/">but the M5 iPad Pro was a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of tablet at its full $999 price, and now that it’s down to $949 at Amazon, it’s a more impressive deal yet.&nbsp;</a></p>

Instead, it’s kicked off seasonal updates on a sour note, as fans flock to criticize Blackwell Fields as a wasteland that suffers from a lack of cover for infantry and vehicles alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't count the amount of times I spawn on this map and instantly have direct vision of the enemies capturing points,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi8psv/comment/nltl0qp/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dissatisfied Battlefield 6 player</u></a> said. “You get shot at from every angle on this map, there's never a break.

"The massive open areas makes it a sniper haven and every other class is just trashed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite its relatively large battles, Battlefield 6’s Conquest mode seems to suffer the most when it comes to Blackwell Fields, as players report facing enemy fire from as far away as enemy HQ spawn points. Pilots for air vehicles, specifically, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/blackwell_fields_enemy_base_aa_shoots_you_while/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> having a hard time on the new Season 1 map. Despite being considered one of the larger maps Battlefield 6 has to offer, opponents with the right hardware can still lock onto some jets before they’ve even taken off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is fantastic,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/comment/nltejew/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user</u></a> jokes. “I was hoping for more maps where Helis are useless.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No no, they are perfect nice garage helicopters,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oi7tgc/comment/nlthu77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> teases. “You keep them nice and clean in the hangar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's not helicopter season yet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Blackwell Fields balance issues only add fuel to the fire that is the conversation surrounding map sizes in Battlefield 6, but many have expressed dissatisfaction with the map regardless of game mode. Even smaller objective-based game modes in downsized versions of Blackwell Fields still feature those orange visuals, leading to even more chaotic moments as bullets fly through dense environments obscured by smoke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I played a round of breakthrough which was decent and one of conquest which was a disaster,” one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/599667545349564587/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam user</u></a> commented. “The visibility is already so bad in this game no matter what settings you use, the red/orange tint that this map have it's a disaster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the <a href="https://x.com/L0SSY/status/1983322555940516260" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stray comment</u></a> praising Blackwell Fields and its cinematic feel can be found if you look hard enough, it seems most players online would trade atmosphere if it meant BF Studios would fix what they feel are one-sided battles and suffocating gun fights. Of course, it’s only been one day since Season 1 launched for Battlefield 6, so opinions could shift after they spend more time with the new map.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Me on Blackwell fields <a href="https://t.co/03GkOb6pAd" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/03GkOb6pAd</a></p>— Lou (@louallen026) <a href="https://twitter.com/louallen026/status/1983213456758063388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear if Blackwell Fields will receive any changes, but EA and BF Studios have proven to be responsive when it comes to fan feedback so far.

            <p>The backlash to the Trump administration's use of AI Halo imagery to promote political causes - notably the use of force by ICE to detain purportedly illegal immigrants - has spread to include strongly worded responses from the original designers of the Halo game.</p>
<p>Jaime Griesemer, who worked as a designer at Bungie for 12 years, on all Halo games up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a>, told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/halo-ice-developers-react">Game File</a> that: "Using Halo imagery in a call to 'destroy' people because of their immigration status goes way too far, and ought to offend every Halo fan, regardless of political orientation. I personally find it despicable. The Flood are evil space zombie parasites and are not an allegory to any group of people."</p>

<p>His comments refer to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image posted by the Department of Homeland Security</a> which showed two Spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep, riding across a Halo ring world, underneath the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join ICE. The inference was clear.</p>
<p>Marcus Lehto, the co-creator of Halo and lead designer of Master Chief, added to Game File that: "It really makes me sick seeing Halo co-opted like this." The DHS Flood-related image in particular was "absolutely abhorrent", he said.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Lehto and Griesemer featured in a news story earlier this week responding to the Halo 1 campaign remake, voicing confusion at some of the apparent design decisions in it. And it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">this Halo remake which sparked the flurry of Halo-related AI images used by the Trump administration</a>.</p><p>So far Microsoft - owner of the Halo IP - hasn't noticeably said or done anything about the Trump administration's use of Master Chief and Halo. The ongoing silence speaks volumes. It follows similar inaction by Nintendo when the Trump administration co-opted Pokémon for similar social media use. Thus emboldened, <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Trump administration's provocative use of iconic IP continues, now reaching The Lord of the Rings</a>.</p>

		<p>GFAGames has announced that it will be launching an open beta for the open world MMO FPS PIONER on November 4th, giving players the chance to check out the game world. PIONER has both PvE and PvP gameplay, and it looks like players will be free to choose which side of the game they want to interact more with.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Frontier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGXEA0Exa50?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>PIONER’s description says, <em>“PIONER is an open-world MMO first-person shooter set in a haunting, alternative-reality world where Soviet-era structures lie abandoned on a desolate, post-apocalyptic island. In this immersive environment, the gameplay experience is defined by dynamic PvE and PvP elements, where realism takes priority over traditional health bars or character levels. With a sprawling map of 50+ square kilometers, not counting hidden dungeons, players can explore a world rich with mystery and danger, encountering story quests and faction missions that influence relationships and loyalty rewards.”</em></p>
<p>On the PvP side of things, PIONER has a mode called Shadowlands which is an extraction shooter mode. Here players will compete with each other to get kills and find treasures. On the PvE side players will be able to work together in structured missions as well as six unique raids. To survive in the world of PIONER, players will need to account for their character’s hunger, tiredness, and the resources to have to hand. There will be a crafting element to the game allowing players to create weapons and equipment to use in both PvE and PvP. Additionally, there are a number of different factions within the world, and building up a reputation with each will also give new items and missions.</p>

<p>GFAGames is targeting this year to fully release PIONER, but it is likely that will be looking at feedback from the open beta before committing to a solid release date for the full game. PIONER is currently confirmed for PC.</p>

<p>Step by step</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We had a good time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped">Biped</a> — the robo co-op platformer all about putting one foot in front of the other — when it arrived on Switch back in 2020, and what do you know, META Publishing has got even more up its sleeve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/biped_2">Biped 2</a> is set to step onto Switch on <strong>5th November</strong>, and it looks every bit as full of Nintendo charm as its predecessor. Once again, the main gimmick here is to do with controlling a sweet little robot's left and right feet independently to get them walking in a straight line, but there are obstacles, drops, and platforms to contend with along the way.</p>
<p>Like that which came before it, Biped 2 can be played either in solo or two-player co-op — there's a new 'pair' mechanic that sees you sticking to your pal to solve puzzles — but the sequel also adds in a fresh <em>four-player</em> mode for those who really want to up the party vibes.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Biped-2-2950357.html">eShop</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ENJOY THE CONTROLS<br>
- Meet the classic two-leg mechanics and a brand-new variety of ways to move!<br>
- Try out new movement types that are smoothly integrated into the game process! Soar gracefully on a hang glider and leave beautiful patterns behind, or conquer ledges and breaks with a grappling hook!<br>
- And guess what? Sliding is back too! Be ready to slide a lot!</p>
<p>UNIQUE PAIR MECHANICS<br>
- Not only help each other to get further, but act together to achieve success! Unite with your robot partner and become one to solve special puzzles. Take the role of “legs” or “arms” and coordinate your next step. And a whole bunch of pair puzzles will help you to master this technique!</p>
<p>EXPLORE NEW BIOMES<br>
- Unknown planets bring uncharted places! Unravel the mysteries of an alien planet and meet new characters, even elementals! Explore unfamiliar environments and be ready to face the challenges that they might bring. Have a good time, and let beautiful scenery and wonderful music create a memorable atmosphere!</p>
<p>PLAY SOLO OR IN TWO-OR-FOUR-PLAYER CO-OP<br>
To make the gameplay process even more diverse, you can choose from lots of possibilities to play:<br>
- Single-player: Become a hero of your story and test your skills in a single-player mode!<br>
- Two-player co-op: Invite a friend to share the journey with you. Take the roles of two bipeds and make the most out of this synergy. Test your skills and assist each other in difficult situations because companionship will be essential.<br>
- Four-player co-op: Apart from familiar mods, we’ve introduced a new one - a four-player co-op! Beat the challenging levels together in a team of four!</p>
<p>STYLE IS A MUST<br>
- Show the new world your creativity! Dress up your bipeds for the occasion to impress your new friends - collect treasures and buy wacky hats. Be unique or choose pair looks with your partner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Biped 2 will arrive on the Switch eShop next month for <strong>£16.75 / $19.99</strong>.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/biped">review</a> of its predecessor, we called Biped "a lovely co-op game that’s bursting with unique challenges and obstacles to overcome", though we did feel that it was a little on the short side.</p>

            <p>
Amazon have cancelled their second attempt at a Lord Of The Rings MMO as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">recent mass layoffs</a>, according to a now-former senior gameplay engineer at Amazon Games.
</p>
<p>
The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday. "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)," she <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleighamrine_opentowork-gamedev-activity-7388971058642522112-H2mY/">wrote</a>. I've reached out to Amazon for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Colonial fantasy New World has already been confirmed to be ceasing development, following the recent Nighthaven update, as part of a company-wide shift away from MMOs. Amazon will keep the servers warm through 2026, and say they'll give six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable.
</p>
<p>
Amazon's first LOTR MMO was a collaboration with Chinese company Leyou, announced in 2019. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-cancel-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">met an unfortunate end in 2021</a> thanks to an apparent contractual dispute, after Leyou were acquired by Tencent. Amazon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-games-announce-a-second-attempt-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">revealed the second LOTR MMO in 2023</a>, after partnering with new Middle-earth rights-owner Embracer. They called it a "persistent open-world MMO adventure", spanning the events of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> and the LOTR trilogy, but beyond that, we've never heard much about the project.
</p>
<p>
"It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here."
</p>
<p>
It's claimed that 14,000 people are losing their jobs as part of Amazon's latest cuts. Best of luck to everybody affected. At the risk of being twee, here is an encouraging aside from the books: "in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach."
</p><p>
If you're desperate to roam Middle-earth in company, Standing Stone and Daybreak's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> is still trucking along with a small but steady audience, almost two decades since launch. The community's recent doings include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lord-of-the-rings-online-players-finally-complete-the-great-hobbit-run-by-incinerating-themselves-in-mount-doom">finally accomplishing a pilgrimage of desperately underlevelled hobbits to Mount Doom</a>.
