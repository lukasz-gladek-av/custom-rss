            <p>
In Crisol: Theater of Idols, you fire bullets of your own blood at frenzied wooden puppets while exploring an island saturated with unpleasant Spanish folklore. As elevator pitches go, I like the immediacy of this one's trade-offs. Blood? But I need that stuff inside my body to convey oxygen and vital nutrients to my trigger fingers. Surely there are other fluids I can fill the bullets with. I get that it would prompt the less sexy kind of revulsion, but Norman Reedus <em>did</em> get away with lobbing cannisters of piss and dribble in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crisol has a demo on Steam as part of this week's Steam Nexus Festering. Being a fan of hideous marionettes and foetid folkliquorice, I was about to download it. But then my powerful journalistic brain kicked into gear, and I realised that I'd already tried Crisol at this year's Summer Game Fest. My belated verdict from back then: the doomy circus setting and scarlet-gold aesthetics are appetising, but the controls are tanky in a way that is sometimes more annoying than thrilling. It's also a bit creaky and forced in terms of scenario design.
</p>
<p>
Here is one such scenario, which also appears in the below trailer: at one point I had to pass through a tumbledown high street area patrolled by a colossal and unkillable jugger-puppet. This objective saw me alternating between crouch-walking through the mud and ducking into shops along the route to scoop up some consumables. Then I came to a gate I had to raise by laboriously turning a crank for a moment or two. Doing this locked me in place, unable to keep an eye on the street behind. You get the idea.

<p>
It took me three attempts, with the jugger-puppet chasing me back indoors each time. While hiding inside shops, I had the pleasure of staring absently at the creature's crotch while it bellowed hoarse threats through windows that were surely large enough to admit its frame. After 20 seconds of this, the roided-up Guignol would go back to its patrol. I guess this kind of ponderous scripting makes sense when you're actually held together by strings. 
</p><p>
Cristol's overall tone veers a bit uncertainly between Guillermo del Torrid art-housiness and House of the Dead. Still, I quite like the wincing restraint imposed by the literal plasma gun gimmick, and the associated pressure to delve around in the crannies for sources of blood besides yourself. I like the webbed and brassy lustre of the vampiric weapons, especially the shotgun, with its double-barrelled syringes. And I quite enjoy the puppets, even though they are functionally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s villagers in their plodding relentlessness and susceptibility to limbshots. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790930/Crisol_Theater_of_Idols/">Find the demo here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Misplacing your keys five minutes prior to when you must go, desperately searching for your wallet in advance of a meeting, or walking up to baggage claim and questioning which carousel will produce your suitcase – these daily terrors have an easy cure. Good news is, Apple’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">AirTag 4-pack has reached its lowest price ever at $64 at Amazon, down from its regular $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker which is less expensive than the price of replacing a lost wallet and the hassle of making a lost luggage claim. In the single-pack size, the solo AirTag can be found at its lowest price ever too at $24, down from $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4-pack AirTags at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The brilliance behind AirTags is their compatibility with Apple’s current ecosystem. Installation takes quite literally one tap when you press an AirTag close to your iPhone or iPad. The device automatically shows up in your Find My app which you can then assign a name and emoji to. No pairing menus, no setting up an account, no fussy configuration: <strong>In a matter of seconds, that AirTag’s ready to track anything you attach it to</strong>.</p>
<h2>How AirTags Tap Into a Massive Network</h2>
<p>The actual magic occurs via Apple’s <strong>Find My network</strong>&nbsp;which depends on the hundreds of millions of Apple devices globally in order to find your belongings. Here’s the process: your AirTag broadcasts a secure Bluetooth message that can be picked up by Apple devices in close range. Those Apple devices then report the location of your AirTag anonymously back to you via the Find My network. It’s all anonymous and encrypted and therefore no one else can see the location of your AirTag or exploit in an attempt at tracking you. Even Apple can’t see the location of your AirTag or which device assisted in tracking it.</p>
<p>This crowdsourcing model enables AirTags to be extremely efficient in highly populated locations.<strong> Leave the backpack at the popular coffee shop in town and there’s a high possibility an iPhone-carrying person will pass by the backpack in minutes and report its location without ever realizing they assisted</strong>. The network also functions when your AirTag is outside the range of your own devices, which happens to be essential in pinpointing luggage in planes and identifying things left behind while you are moving from point to point.</p>



<p><strong>Precision Finding</strong> goes one better on iPhone 11 and later with Ultra Wideband technology: When you’re near a target item with your AirTag, your iPhone can also report directional arrows and distance in feet and inches, and leads you straight to the item with remarkable precision. Take the example of searching for your buried keys in the couch cushions: Precision Finding lets you know the exact direction in which the keys are and how far away in inches the keys are.</p>
<p>Each AirTag also comes with a <strong>internal speaker that produces a tone when you activate it from the Find My app</strong>. The tone enables you to locate things in close range, such as keys that went down in the space between the car seats or a wallet kept in a coat pocket that hangs in your closet. The speaker produces a tone that can be heard in the next room and enables very swift searches compared with having to search each possible location manually.</p>



<p>Battery life is extraordinarily sensible. The AirTags are powered by a standard <em>CR2032</em> coin cell battery<strong> which lasts around a year</strong> with normal usage. You can buy these batteries anywhere: supermarkets and gas stations and so on. Replacing them only takes a second: push down the stainless steel rear and turn counterclockwise. No spanners required, no shipping devices back to Apple, no annual fees in order for them to stay operational.</p>
<p>At $64 for a set of four AirTags on Amazon, you can protect your most commonly lost belongings without spending too much money. Hook one onto your keys, put one in your wallet, add one in your daily tote and have a fourth for suitcases or seasonal gear.</p>

                <p>Veteran video game developer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at the age of 58. Famous for his work on the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and the revival of Ninja Gaiden in the 2000s, Itagaki's death was confirmed on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki/posts/pfbid02kPXD7uXWaU3ZrRTXB1x2kYPH9SXjakibwS2poX8QU6oPXC7w5occ4GuidXECSUpZl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook profile</a> where he left a final message.</p><p>"Final Words, the flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world--I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message," Itagaki's post read (via Facebook translation).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans. I'm sorry. So it goes."</p><p>Itagaki's video game career kicked off in 1992 with Tecmo Super Bowl where he served as a graphics programmer, and in 1996, he rose to fame with the release of Dead or Alive. In 2001, he was placed in charge of Team Ninja--the studio that he founded originally as Tecmo Creative #3 in the '90s--and he led the production on the modern-day revival of Ninja Gaiden. Itagaki also served as both producer and director on multiple games like Dead or Alive Ultimate, Dead or Alive 4, and Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p>By then, Itagaki had become infamous for not holding back his comments on the state of the video game industry at the time, and he later resigned from Tecmo amidst claims of the company withholding a bonus that he had been promised. He'd later found Valhalla Game Studios and release Devil's Third for the Wii U and PC, but the game was met with negative reviews upon release.</p><p>After leaving Valhalla in 2017, Itagaki returned to video game development with a new studio in 2021, Itagaki Games. Tributes have begun pouring in for the legendary developer from across the industry, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and James Mielke</a>--co-founder of Tigertron and BitSummit--was one of the first to talk about the loss of Itagaki.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/switch-2s-first-warhammer-40000-game-isnt-the-one-you-might-expect</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2s-first-warhammer-40-000-game-isnt-the-one-you-might-expect.1326340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 1 was home to plenty of <strong>Warhammer 40,000</strong> titles, so it was only a matter of time before Switch 2 got in on the fun. Well, that time is finally upon us, and the first series title on the new hardware is... the classic RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>! Wait, that's not <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine II</a>.</p>
<p>Yep, there was a part of us that expected to see the immensely popular 2024 shooter as the one to lead the 40k charge on Switch 2, but it looks like we're going for something different.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a story-rich RPG, where you'll explore the outer space perils of the Koronus Expanse. It boasts all the hallmarks of the genre, with crew-building, tough decisions that have a real effect on the story, and classic isometric turn-based battling. What's more, it seems to do them really rather well.</p>
<p>The game launched on PC, PlayStation and Xbox at the end of 2023 and, while this writer hasn't sampled it himself, it has gone on to rack up almost 15,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/#app_reviews_hash">Very Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">Steam</a>. That's not bad going!</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Koronus Expanse</strong><br>
Begin your adventure aboard your personal, giant voidship, traveling between the multitude of systems within the Koronus Expanse, a barely charted and incredibly perilous region of space. Despite being considered a backwater of the Imperium, this region encompasses an enormous stretch of the void, filled with dangerous creatures and prodigious opportunities for profit and exploration.<br>
<strong>Gather your Crew<br></strong>Rogue Traders never travel alone. Gather your retinue of righteous heroes, twisted psykers, and perfidious xenos. All of them are ready to follow you into the darkness between the stars. They will offer you counsel, aid you in battle, and allow you to amass ever more power. In return, you can guide them through their own personal journeys, changing their destinies forever.<br>
<strong>Your Decisions Matter<br></strong>During quests show your subjects mercy or disdain, stay faithful to the God-Emperor, or consort with enemies of Mankind - your every decision and every act, even in character creation, is changing the in-game open world and those who inhabit it.<br>
<strong>Plan your Actions Carefully</strong><br>
Slaughter the enemies of Mankind in a fully-fledged isometric turn-based tactical combat. Take advantage of cover, the environment, and careful positioning to overpower your enemies. When that is not enough - use your companion`s powerful abilities to turn the tide of battle and achieve victory even in the direst of situations. Our video game adaption of the classic Rogue Trader ruleset allows an enormous number of possibilities for you to explore.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>OwlCat hasn't provided a specific release date for this one just yet outside of the teasing "coming soon", but we'll be keeping an eye out over the coming months for more info.</p>

            <p>Sonic Rumble will finally be released next month, following a number of delays.</p>
<p>The mobile and PC party game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> maker Rovio was originally intended for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-segas-mobile-party-game-from-angry-birds-studio-delayed-into-spring">release last winter</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-mobile-party-game-sonic-rumble-lands-release-date">delayed until May</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/angry-birds-maker-and-sega-delay-sonic-rumble-release-once-again">delayed once more</a> without a launch date.</p>
<p>Now it's finally due in November and it's "seriously evolved" over the last few months following various playtests. "This extra development time allowed us to roll out several, player-focused updates that refined the core game from the ground up," the developer said in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000209/">new blog post</a>. "The goal? A super smooth, intense, and incredibly fun game right from the jump."</p>

<figcaption>Sonic Rumble – The ultimate Arcade Royale Arrives This November!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FP6XoAMZYA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Specifically, Rovio has updated the game in three key areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, the core of the game has been made deeper and more dynamic with iconic skills, new stages, and new game modes. Secondly, the player onboarding journey has been revamped and the UI has been drastically improved.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cosmetic and character progression systems have been updated and simplified to ensure "every unlock feels meaningful and impactful". The rewards and shop systems have also been fine-tuned.</p>
<p>"These adjustments were key in making Sonic Rumble awesome for the long haul," said the developer. "Even as we get ready for launch, our commitment continues and there will be plenty more to come!"</p>
<p>While the blog post doesn't provide a specific date, the iOS App store lists 30th November as the expected release. It's available to <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3D2aecdffa-3ac6-4708-b5e2-a8d8d0794317">pre-register now</a> and will be coming to iOS, Google Play, and Steam.</p>
<p>As the new trailer (above) shows, Sonic Rumble is a battle royale party game for up to 32 players online competing in minigames and platforming challenges for rings. Think <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> with a blue blur twist - I think it could be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>This will also be the first new game from Rovio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">since it was acquired by Sega</a> back in 2023 for £625m.</p>

<p>You better boo-lieve it</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're after something spooky to play in the run up to Halloween this year, then you might want to consider <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/an_english_haunting">An English Haunting</a> from developer Postmodern Adventures.</p>
<p>Available via the Switch eShop now, this is a classic point-and-click adventure with retro-inspired visuals and a dark, spooky atmosphere. It kinda reminds us of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, which was an excellent entry to the genre back in 2017.</p>
<p>You've got touchscreen support with this one in handheld mode, but for those who prefer docked, you can also connect a USB mouse for proper PC-like controls. As for the story, An English Haunting sees you step into the shoes of Professor Patrick More, who "teams up with a deceptive medium to create an extraordinary device that can reveal what lies beyond our world".</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like a delightfully traditional horror story, and we're here for it. Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Point &amp; click adventure gameplay based on inventory puzzles.</p>
<p>- More than 60 detailed pixel art backgrounds to explore.</p>
<p>- A cast of more than 70 characters to interact with, including real figures from the period, such as the medium Florence Cook, physicist William Crookes, illusionist Harry Houdini, and even writer Arthur Conan Doyle, whom you will control to solve one of the game’s mysteries.</p>
<p>- Inspired by the works of the greatest horror authors from the beginning of the 20th century, M.R. James, Algernon Blackwood, and Arthur Machen.</p>
<p>- Text available in English or Spanish</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 holds its own quite well against the ROG Xbox Ally X, delivering generally better image quality than the ASUS handheld system, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits"> ElAnalistaDeBits</a> compares the two handheld systems on pretty much every front, starting from general system performance before delving deeper into how the two systems handle games such as the demanding Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, Hitman World of Assassination, and Star Wars Outlaws and the undemanding Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-resolution-performance-and-graphics-comparison">Nintendo Switch 2 vs ROG Xbox Ally X Resolution, Performance, and Graphics Comparison</h2>



<p>The comparison video shared by ElAnalistaDeBits gets more interesting when it compares how the Nintendo Switch 2 and ROG Xbox Ally X run games. </p>



<p>Regarding resolution, the Nintendo Switch 2 leverages NVIDIA DLSS support to deliver impressive image quality, which the ROG Xbox Ally X doesn't match with AMD FSR in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Hogwarts Legacy. In Star Wars Outlaws, with NVIDIA DLSS, the Nintendo system delivers significantly cleaner image quality at dynamic 635p resolution against the static 635p resolution of the ASUS system, especially for far-away elements, whose details are better resolved by the NVIDIA upscaler.</p>



<p>Regarding graphics settings, the Nintendo Switch 2 delivers solid results. The system runs games at the rough equivalent of PC medium settings and does so convincingly, which is still impressive, considering the hardware differences with the ROG Xbox Ally X.</p>



<p>However, the Xbox ROG Ally X has a clear advantage in terms of performance, but not as much as one might have expected. In Hogwarts Legacy, for example, the performance differences are minimal, especially in the open world, where the Switch 2 sticks to its 30 FPS cap while the ROG Ally X only manages to run at higher than 40 FPS in Turbo Mode, and barely higher than 30 FPS in Performance Mode.</p>



<p>In Star Wars Outlaws, the comparison is even more interesting, as the ROG Ally X needs FSR in Performance Mode and Frame Generation to run in the ballpark of 30 FPS at low settings, highlighting once again <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-star-wars-outlaws-well-docked/">how good the Switch 2 port is.</a></p>

            <p>Another group of workers at Microsoft-owned Blizzard have voted to form a union, with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) set to represent them. The CWA say that this union will be made up of "nearly 400" workers across Blizzard's platform and technology department.</p>
<p>Their action follows the formation of a number of other unions at Blizzard over the past couple of years, with developers on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild">Overwatch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-450-diablo-developers-vote-to-unionise-because-passion-cant-protect-us-from-job-instability">Diablo</a> all having recently secured representation.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to a CWA press release, this latest union is made up of software engineers, project and product managers, graphic designers on Battle.net, localisers, QA testers, and customer support staff.  It's already been formally recognised by Blizzard parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>"I’ve seen too many of my talented coworkers leave the company, either due to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">layoffs</a>, a lack of fair compensation, or proper accommodations not being met," said Blizzard senior quality analyst and organising committee member Timothy Biley. "I’m extremely happy that we, the workers, have greater control over our workplace and that we finally have a seat at the table to truly make Blizzard a company we are proud to work for."</p><p>"Blizzard workers in Texas are joining a new generation of video game developers who know their worth and are standing up for it," the CWA's Ron Swaggerty added. "Together with our siblings in California and beyond, they’re proving that no matter where you work, organizing is how we make this industry sustainable for the people who power it."</p>
<p>A large number of staff at Microsoft have unionised in recent years, from workers at Call of Duty developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">Raven Software</a>, to Fallout and Elder Scrolls studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda</a>, and Elder Scrolls Online developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-ceos-got-dressed-up-for-the-game-awards-461-workers-at-zenimax-online-studios-unionised">ZeniMax</a>. Given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">cuts and cancellations</a> the company have dished out since they absorbed ActiBlizz, it's not hard to see why folks are seeking these protections.</p>
<p>Solidarity to these freshly-unionised Blizzard workers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-review.1326301/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nate probably needed a bit of a wake up call, a nudge or a hefty shove to get him out of his parent’s basement, out of his onesie and into some proper clothes, and out into the real world, but Baby Steps teleporting him out to a strange world without giving him shoes or any kind of survival gear is probably a bit much. Heck, he might actually be in need of physical therapy to relearn how to walk.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baby Steps is out now! Put one foot in front of the other  on PS5 and PC." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nu70MYCUtZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the mind behind QWOP and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy – so, it’s Bennett Foddy in collaboration with Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch – you should know what to expect from Baby Steps. It’s a game where the very act of walking is part of the challenge, and where failure will send you slipping and sliding back down like a cruel game of snakes and ladders… but without ladders.</p>


<p>Walking is pretty simple, though. It’s not as utterly basic as in most games, and needing more actual thought than you put into your day-to-day life, but easy enough to figure out. Left trigger lifts your left foot, right trigger lifts your right, and pushing a direction on the analogue stick moves your weight and legs in that direction. That’s all that you need to clumsily stagger through the landscape before you.</p>
<p>You will repeatedly end up falling flat on your face in Baby Steps, whether taking too large a step and simply losing balance, catching a foot on an inconvenient tree root, or failing to find sufficient purchase on a steep, slick incline. Every pratfall sees Nate’s onesie become progressively dirtier with a dynamic soilage system that makes belly flopping into a stream or pool a nice way to clean off. It helps that “swimming” looks as utterly insane as you could imagine.</p>


<p>It didn’t have to be this way. If only Nate had even a single non-awkward bone in his body and was able to accept the help of strangers. There’s something very relatable about that, of social anxiety making it difficult to interact with others. First there’s the groundskeeper Jim, who offers to help Nate to get better equipped for his walk, and who then starts to lightly antagonise while still being about as helpful as possible. Then there’s Mike the Hiker, who extols the virtues of having a map, of a grappling hook and more. Oh, and then there’s the anthropomorphic donkeys who only ever have shirts and tops on. One for the jennies out there, but you can turn on a bit of censorship if donkey dicks is a bit much.</p>
<p>All of these thoroughly awkward interactions have an improvisational style to them, and there’s an enjoyable amount of cringe, for those that like that kind of thing. It’s very of the moment.</p>
<p>I admire the commitment to the bit –&nbsp;both in terms of the narrative style and the gameplay – and there is a satisfaction and enjoyment to be had in overcoming the obstacles and world put in your way, but after a while I just found Baby Steps becoming a massively unenjoyable chore.</p>
<p>There’s a whole world and map that’s been created, filled with oddities and secrets to find, from watchtowers, to strange miniaturised buildings, fairgrounds that have sunk into the mud, but actually exploring it was the last thing I wanted to do after reaching the second campfire. Even the lure of hats was only enough to get me to go out of my way once, no least because fall off when you take too heavy a tumble, and then you obviously need to head back over and pick them up again.</p>

<p>A big part of my waning enthusiasm is down to never managing to truly adapt to the game’s walking. It’s insultingly easy to describe, and I can often get into the flow and rhythm of walking, but then I slip out of tempo, Nate falls flat on his face, and I spend the next five minutes repeatedly falling over until I have a hope of getting it back. It’s even worse after tackling a section that needs precision, where I shift to much more manual inputs, whether hovering each foot over a thin plank before placing it – Nate surprisingly has exceptional balance – or shuffle stepping up a slippery incline. After doing that, I’ve got no hope of being able to walk regularly for a while.</p>
<p>And so I don’t want to explore much, outside of getting a bit lost and failing to see the path ahead – though the section that leads you round in a circle for a few minutes did get a wry smile from me. When I did I found a place to grab a vase that some signs had claimed was stolen, only to smash it on rocks about 30 seconds later, or I tried to climb a swing up onto a tree and ended up plummeting into a pool that took me at least an hour to finally, painfully, drag my way back out of. Thankfully there’s no fall damage.</p>

<p>There’s no undo, there’s no reverting even back to the start of a chapter, there’s nothing to do, but sigh despairingly and figure out the painstaking path back or new route you need to follow. In fairness, the world has been carefully constructed so that you generally shouldn’t fall back too far if you’re following the main path, and that there’s often another route through, back or around to follow.</p>
<p>I know that’s meant to be part of the enjoyment here, that push and pull of failure and success. I see streamers basically zipping up and through the world with easy. What am I doing wrong or different? Are they playing with mouse and keyboard instead of controller? Am I the one that’s out of touch?</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s probably the best way to be able to enjoy this game, whether that’s watching someone play it or sharing it with a friend by passing the pad back and forth.</p>

            <p>The future of GZDoom, the community-updated engine behind many thousands of brilliant Doom mods, is in doubt following a bust-up over the lead developer's use of generative AI to create code. The fracas has seen a number of GZDoom developers announce plans to splinter off and maintain their own engine, UZDoom.
</p><!--more-->
<p>New to GZDoom? It's a fork of Doom source port Zdoom, first released by Christoph Oelckers, aka Graf Zahl, back in 2005. A vast number of Doom modding projects make use of it, including such RPS headliners as literary horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game">MyHouse.wad</a>, demon-petting add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-doom-mod-finally-lets-us-make-friends-with-the-cacodemons">Cacofrendo</a> (pictured), and unofficial Wolfenstein 3D sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blade-of-agony-doom-wolfenstein-mod">Blade Of Agony</a>.
</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">GamingOnLinux</a>, a moderator recently posted on Discord about strife between Oelckers and various members of the community. "Due to a conflict between GZDoom's lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl, a lot of other developers decided to leave GZDoom and work on a new fork of the engine now known as UZDoom," they write. 
</p>
<p>The fracas appears to be only partly to do with Oelckers' usage of ChatGPT. Going by the chat on Discord and elsewhere, the backlash is fuelled by long-term misgivings about his bulldozing leadership style. Aside from replicating all of GZDoom's features, the Discord moderator post continues, the UZDoom rebels aim to offer "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads'". 
</p><p>Further investigation takes us to this <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">Github page</a> for a GZDoom update that features some code by Oelckers, derived from ChatGPT. It has spawned a comments thread full of people arguing about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/oct/08/the-ai-valuation-bubble-is-now-getting-silly">the generative AI financial bubble</a> and the ethics and utility of coding with genAI. Oelckers has both defended his use of ChatGPT, arguing that a lot of programmers secretly deploy large language learning models for smaller tasks, and offhandedly invited the angry users to fork the engine and work on their own version.</p>
<p>The ire has spilled over into <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/issues/3395">later Github bug reports</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">this Reddit thread</a> summarising the situation, which includes further postage from pissed-off GZDoom devs. A few Doom modders have also been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/himynameischair.bsky.social/post/3m36lqd7kbc2s">airing their</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nashmuhandes.bsky.social/post/3m36nql4u3c2l">grievances</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>I can only scratch my head and look worried at a lot of this. I know eff-all about the twists and turns of GZDoom's long development - I am one of those drive-by Doomlites who downloads a cool wad every blue moon. Still, it all feels rather momentous, given the sheer number of projects that use the engine. More to follow, I'm sure.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-guns-battlefield-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-meta-gun-loadouts-in-battlefield-6%E2%80%94best-assault-rifle-smg-lmg-sniper-rifle-shotgun-class.1326289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Having the best meta guns will give you a huge advantage in Battlefield 6. At the very least, you’ll be able to compete with everyone else who is also using the best guns. We’ve got top weapons you should be using in Battlefield 6, along with the ideal loadouts to go with them.</p>



<p>If you’re not keeping on top of the ‘meta,’ you’re going to fall behind. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> features a vast array of guns, but selecting the right one for each class is crucial. You might love the AK4D, for example, but it’s not as good as the most elite assault rifle in BF 6.</p>



<p>We’ve put together the best meta guns and loadouts for the top weapon in each Battlefield 6 class.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Starting off strong. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The assault rifle category isn’t as strong as other classes in Battlefield 6. However, it looks like the <strong>M433 </strong>is the standard in the AR category and the bar that other assault rifles need to live up to.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>A demon. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>M4A1 </strong>is currently the best Carbine—and potentially best weapon overall—in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>. An assault rifle usually ends up being the most dominant gun in FPS games. For us, there’s no question it’s the M4A1 Carbine that takes the crown instead. It fires well, hits hard, and this best loadout brings out its true potential.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Baker 3.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Standard Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 14.5″ Carbine</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>It’s the MP5, always will be. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>PW5A3</strong>—AKA the MP5, let’s face it—rules the roost where SMGs are concerned. It’s consistently appeared throughout the course of FPS gaming history, and it’s here in Battlefield 6. It outclasses every other SMG up close, and it’s also quite handy at mid-range as well. If you need a gun that rapidly chews through bullets and tears through opponents in smaller maps, look no further than the PW5A3.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Compensated Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 245MM Custom</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Ribbed Stubby</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 40RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The best <strong>DRS-IAR</strong> loadout is a strange one, as it doesn’t even feel like an LMG in some ways. Our Magazine attachment gives it fewer bullets than our PW5A3 class, for example. But it’s still a powerful gun that can be just as powerful as an AR, and then some. If you’re looking for a different type of weapon, you should consider the DRS-IAR.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> CCO 2.00X</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Double-Port Brake</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ SDM-R</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Alloy Vertical</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 36RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> Magwell Flare</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> FMJ</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>Boom. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, chances are you were blown away by it, by blown away, I mean blasted in the face repeatedly by the <strong>M87A1</strong> Shotgun. Its dominance and superiority have carried over into the full game, and there’s no question that the M87A1 is the Shotgun to use. It’s a one-shot weapon of mass destruction.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Iron Sights</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 20″ Factory</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Adjustable Angled</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 7 Shell Tube</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Flechette</li>
</ul>







<figure><figcaption>King of Sniper Rifles. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 has a decent amount of medium-to-long-range maps. This allows Sniper Rifles to flourish, and if you fancy your chances as a precision marksman, you need the <strong>M2010 ESR</strong>. It’s flexible as both a quick-firing quickscope rifle, or can dominate at a distance. Our M2010 ESR loadout is the one we feel gets the most out of the weapon, but don’t be afraid to tinker with the slots here. You may want a suppressor, but we do not.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> SSDS 6.00X</li>



<li><strong>Optic Accessory:</strong> Anti-Glare Coating</li>



<li><strong>Left Accessory:</strong> Range Finder</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> 26″ Carbon</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 8RND Magazine</li>



<li><strong>Ergonomics:</strong> DLC Bolt</li>



<li><strong>Ammunition:</strong> Match Grade</li>
</ul>



<p>Now’s the time for you to get involved and share your thoughts. Let us know if any of these loadouts worked for you, what else you’d like to see, and you can also check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> to start your own Battlefield 6 conversations and share your own loadouts!</p>

            <p>Sony has fired back against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> as part of a continuing lawsuit over its Horizon "knock-off" Light of Motiram, claiming the Chinese conglomerate's defence is "nonsense".</p>
<p>Last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent revealed Light of Motiram</a>, which was immediately compared to Sony's Horizon games. As a result, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">PlayStation maker has sued Tencent</a> for allegedly ripping off its popular games; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">Tencent then retaliated</a> by stating Sony's claims of originality were "startling".</p>
<p>Now Sony is fighting back. In a new court filing (thanks <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a>), Sony has accused Tencent of "playing a shell game" with its subsidiaries to shield itself from liability.</p>

<p>"Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram’s release until 2027 after SIE sued," Sony said in its complaint. "This is nonsense. The damage is done - and it continues."</p><p>"Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct."</p>
<p>Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly updated the Steam page for Light of Motiram</a>, removing a number of screenshots and a cover image of its Aloy-like protagonist. However, as Sony has claimed, "the damage is done".</p>
<p>In its defence, Tencent claimed Sony was attempting to sue the wrong company. Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, but Tencent itself said the game is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, a developer operating under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent-games">Tencent Games</a>' and/or 'Level Infinite'".</p>
<p>"After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities," Sony has now said. "Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</p><p>It continued: "Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios' - the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram - without distinguishing between subsidiaries."</p>
<p>Sony has also claimed reactions from the public and media highlight the resemblance between the games and will jeopardise the success of the Horizon series.</p>
<p>"Light of Motiram - a knock-off game so blatant that the public loudly decried the obvious and pervasive copying of Horizon’s protected elements -  jeopardises Horizon's continued success, including current expansion plans for the franchise," said Sony.</p>
<p>"The copying was so egregious that numerous journalists and Horizon fans called Light of Motiram 'a major Horizon rip off', 'an obvious knock off',’ a 'copycat' with a main character that 'resembles Aloy to a tee', and 'extremely similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>'."</p>
<p>Sony has further claimed Horizon protagonist Aloy is a symbol of the brand, and that Tencent's "Aloy lookalike" is an "egregious" effort to trade off its character's "goodwill and reputation".</p>
<p>As a result, Sony has requested the court deny Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Squirrelled away</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Maximum Entertainment popped up at the Fall IGN Fan Fest to reveal that the delightfully weird sandbox shooter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>, will be blasting onto Switch 2 on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if you didn't catch this one on its PC release last year, the title tells you just about everything you need to know. You play as a squirrel. You have a gun. What you do with it is up to you.</p>
<p>There's a fair emphasis on the 'sandbox' elements here, with platforming, collectibles, weird little challenges and a bunch of funky gun abilities at your disposal. And let's not beat about the bush, the titular conceit paints a funny enough image on its own.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the official <a href="https://squirrelwithagun.com/">Squirrel with a Gun website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fight Tooth, Claw, and Gun</strong><br>
Discover what an erratic squirrel is capable of with a gun in its paws (or just its paws) and how far how far this fuzzy fiend will go to collect its acorns. Escape a secret underground facility and defeat the Agents. Upgrade your weapons and locate the other secret bunkers to take down elite bosses; even blow up a tank! Swap out weapons to try your paw at all 12 types of enemy takedowns.<br>
<strong><br>
Solve Intricate Puzzle Rooms to Collect Golden Acorns</strong><br>
Navigate unique puzzle challenges to collect all the golden acorns by getting creative with how you use your arsenal of weapons, using weapon recoil to give yourself a boost. Collect enough golden acorns to unlock hidden sections of the game.<br>
<strong><br>
Have Some Nutty Sandbox Fun</strong><br>
Explore the world from a squirrel's eye view or cruise around in your toy car. Harass the neighborhood or ask for nice pets from curious passersby. Help them out in exchange for goodies (or simply mug them) and unlock cosmetics to create your squirrely style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who stick around right to the very end of the above Switch 2 announcement trailer will see Maximum Entertainment and Dee Dee Creations showcase a Squirrel with a Gun <em>physical edition</em> too. We don't have any information on when we can expect to see this boxed copy just yet, but it's always exciting news — heck, the mock-up doesn't even have the Game-Key Card icon on it!</p>
<p><em>Will you be checking out Squirrel with a Gun on Switch? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-of-dead-or-alive-and-responsible-for-ninja-gaiden%E2%80%99s-reboot-has-passed-away-at-58.1326268/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game designer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58. The sad and unexpected news comes directly from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his own Facebook page</a>, where he had asked a friend to post a message in the event of his passing, which he must have seen coming.</p>



<p><em>The flame of my life is finally about to be extinguished.</em></p>



<p><em>The fact that this message has been posted means that time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have asked someone important to post this final message.)</em></p>



<p><em>My life was a continuous battle. I kept winning.<br>I also caused a lot of trouble.</em></p>



<p><em>I take pride in having fought to the end, following my convictions.<br>I have no regrets.</em></p>



<p><em>But I am filled with regret that I could not deliver new work to all my fans. I'm sorry.</em></p>



<p><em>That's how it is.<br>So it goes.</em></p>



<p><span>This is a hard-hitting message, to be sure, and one that is undoubtedly in line with Tomonobu Itagaki's unique personality, just like when he&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/itagaki-ps4-pro-just-rhetoric-vr/" target="_blank">criticized Sony for making the PlayStation 4 Pro console</a>. The game designer was mainly</span> known as the creator of the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and also as the man responsible for the successful reboot of the Ninja Gaiden series. Itagaki left KOEI TECMO in 2008 after sixteen years and filed a lawsuit against the company due to them withholding pay.</p>



<p>He then quickly launched a new game developer called Valhalla Game Studios alongside other former Team Ninja members. This studio released Devil's Third, an action/adventure game for the Nintendo Wii U. However, the game wasn't well received both critically and commercially. In November 2021, Tencent acquired Valhalla's parent company, Wake Up Interactive, for $44 million. The following month, Wake Up merged Valhalla Game Studios' staff and operations into another subsidiary, Soleil Ltd., effectively closing down Valhalla.</p>



<p>Tomonobu Itagaki once again did not despair and founded another company called Itagaki Games. The final news tidbit about the company was shared by Itagaki around a year ago, when he revealed that the company name had been slightly changed to Itagaki Games, Inc. Unfortunately, the studio never released a game before Itagaki's passing.</p>



<p>The news comes just days before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-tokyo-game-show-2025-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth installment in the Ninja Gaiden franchise</a>, many years after the previous iteration. </p>



<p>Wccftech would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to the friends and family of this important figure in the games industry.</p>

            <p>Around the time of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s release, the Metroidvania's Simplified Chinese translation was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-cherry-working-on-quality-issues-with-hollow-knight-silksongs-simplified-chinese-translation-following-mixed-steam-reviews">flagged as being a bit stilted</a>, with Team Cherry quickly promising to rectify the "quality issues". They've aimed to take the first step in doing just that with the game's fourth patch, which is now live in Steam beta with a fresh translation, but early impressions from players are largely negative.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To be fair to Team Cherry, they have <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/">made clear</a> that the fresh translation which has arrived with the beta release of patch 1.0.28954 is a "basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback". They added that "implementation of this new translation is not yet finalised, so please expect some display issues throughout." There's a <a href="https://teamcherry.notion.site/12c63da3a1a780f4a8cfd8441a243a6e">bug report form</a> via which folks can leave feedback on the revamped wordage.</p>
<p>A fair few Chinese players have also opted to leave early feedback on the translation in comments on the patch post, and these verdicts are far from glowing. While it seems the original translation's classical grammar might be gone (though the comments offer mixed views on that), fresh problems are being reported, with place and NPC names seeming like the main sticking point this time around. The Deep Docks in particular <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/#c506216918921801406">are cited</a> as now being referred to by a spoliery name.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your efforts in translating Chinese," reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=4#c506216918921814502">one of these comments</a>. "I have always been a fan of yours, but the new beta version of the translation has obvious shortcomings. The main problem is that the new translation version has changed the translations of place names and NPC characters that were originally well translated and recognised by most players. I hope the new version of the translation can keep the original NPC and place name translations, and make the dialogue and background introduction text more readable and understandable."</p><p>Team Cherry have been quick to acknowledge this initial feedback. "Thanks so much to everyone who's been sending in comments and concerns on the Simplified Chinese translation in public-beta," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/506216918921794871/?ctp=5#c506216918921817500">comment of their own</a>. "They've been a huge help. Two quick notes from us: We fully agree with comments that the names of characters, places etc, should generally remain the same as in the original version. Only a few specific names should be considered appropriate to change - those where the current translation is confusing or incorrect. We won't be releasing any translation that isn't up to the community's standards, and we'll continue to closely monitor feedback from fans."</p>
<p>Outside of this revamped translation, this beta version of patch four features a "short set of game fixes", set to be added to before full release. Among them are a switch to Unity's input system aimed at improving controller support and an update to the multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots.</p>
<p>Here's hoping Team Cherry are able to get a handle on these persistent translation problems soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dandy%E2%80%99s-world-codes-october-2025.1326262/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re a fan of both horror movies as well as old-school cartoon shows, then these Dandy’s World codes may well be worth your time.</p>



<p>Think of a Roblox game where you start in a building known as the Gardenview Center as a cartoon character, with the objective being to survive, while also collecting money to unlock new characters and solving puzzles to fix the broken elevator. Playable in a group of up to 8 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dandy’s World can be a rather scary experience, with scary monsters known as ‘Twisteds’ hunting the players down in every nook and cranny of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dandy’s World is a game where strategy and teamwork are of utmost importance, as various shocking and dark plot twists can happen with each playthrough. Dandy’s World players must also be on the lookout for Tickets and Trinkets, while Ichor is the main in-game currency, used to upgrade characters and their abilities. Although simply playing the game will grant players plenty of Ichor, using codes in Dandy’s World is a good way to boost the amount of currency you can get.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-dandy-s-world-codes-october-2025">All New Dandy’s World Codes (October 2025)</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>ICHOR</strong>: 50 Ichor</li>

<figure><figcaption>Dandy’s World Codes Redemption Page | Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Redeeming these free rewards in Dandy’s World is a simple process that doesn’t require too much effort at all. For players who may be new to the Roblox environment, though, here’s a step-by-step guide that should make redeeming the Dandy’s World codes a cakewalk:</p>



<ol>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Dandy’s World.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Use Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box.</li>



<li>Click on ‘Use’ to instantly receive your rewards.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-dandy-s-world-codes">Where To Get More Dandy’s World Codes</h2>



<p>Although there is only one active code in the game right now, Dandy’s World is a game that’s known to release new codes whenever it achieves a major milestone or launches an update for the title. With this in mind, it’s safe to assume that more are on the horizon, and players simply have to wait patiently to get their hands on more free Dandy’s World rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to stay up to date with all the latest codes would be to simply bookmark this page and check back every now and then. We update this article as soon as new codes are dropped by the developers. This can save players from the hassle of having to manually go into the game’s socials and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/blushcrunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a> each time to check if new codes have been released.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Gets Reduced Ticket Count in Conquest Mode and Players Aren’t Very Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-in-conquest-mode-and-players-aren%E2%80%99t-very-happy.1326259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is certainly off to a strong start. Sales estimates <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest that it has already sold more than six and a half million units across all platforms</a>, and the game launched to a positive vibe in the community.</p>



<p>That said, fans already disagree with the development team on a few things. For example, yesterday the developers <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a backend update</a> that reduced the beginning ticket count when playing Conquest on all maps:</p>



<p><em>We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Empire State from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</em></li>



<li><em>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</em></li>



<li><em>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</em></li>



<li><em>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The community isn't really convinced this was needed, though. Most comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o7cerx/backend_update_battlefield_studios_has_reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a> state that they never had that occurrence (rounds hitting the time limit instead of one team running out of tickets) happen to them. Some even go as far as accusing the developers of pursuing the Call of Duty crowd in Battlefield 6 with changes like this. That goes hand in hand with criticism leveled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-starts-october-28-roadmap-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the upcoming Season 1</a>, which will include new 4v4 and 8v8 modes. Veteran Battlefield players would rather get more large maps for classic franchise modes like Conquest, as they believe that the launch maps are on the smaller side.</p>



<p>For its part, Battlefield Studios has introduced a small change born out of user feedback: in the Manhattan Bridge map, when playing Conquest and Escalation modes, the Out of Bounds timer for vehicles has been doubled from five to ten seconds. Lastly, the developers actually just pushed a very small (27 MB on Steam) patch, updating the game to version 1.0.1.6. This update merely improves backend stability in anticipation of the Season 1 launch, scheduled for Tuesday, October 28.</p>

            <p>Tomonobu Itagaki, responsible for creating both the Dead or Alive and 3D <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series, has died.</p>
<p>The announcement came via one final post on his Facebook profile. This news was corroborated by Itagaki's friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k">James Mielke on Bluesky</a>, who posted their own statement mourning Itagaki.</p>
<p>The final message from Itagaki reads as follows:</p>
<p>"Final Words,</p>
<p>"The flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world. (I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. So it goes.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90's, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games and Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.</p>
<p>His career was not without strife. In 2006, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker of Itagaki sued him for sexual harassment</a> which he denied, losing his executive officer role as a result. Ultimately, he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007.</p>
<p>Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.
</p>
<p>Valhalla Game Studios eventually closed, leading Itagaki to form Itagaki Games in late 2021. This studio has been working on a new game ever since.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki, known for his love of sunglasses and long-lasting career in the games industry, leaves behind a daughter.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-november-7-path-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/open-world-mmo-sword-of-justice-launches-on-november-7-with-path-tracing-and-an-ai-metaverse-of-intelligent-npcs.1326232/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>ZhuRong Studio, an internal development team of NetEase, announced that the global launch of the open world MMO Sword of Justice has been set for November 7 on PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2782500/SWORD_OF_JUSTICE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netease.nshmna&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sword-of-justice/id6743792551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>.</p>



<p>This is a free-to-play game, although the developers have promised that there is no pay-to-win at all and character progression is gameplay-driven, with strict stat limits and regular seasonal resets, creating an even playing field, where players are rewarded for their skill.</p>



<p>The MMO's narrative is adapted from Wen Ruian's classic literary masterpiece, The Four Great Constables: Sword of Justice. The story is set during the Song Dynasty (between 960 and 1279), and players can explore a vast open world, conquer peaks and caverns, seek out lost weapons and martial techniques, solve ancient puzzles, and, most of all, master martial arts to battle mythical beasts and outlaws in the wilderness and in dungeons to gather rare treasures.</p>



<p>The Windstride and Shadowbearer skills facilitate traversal of the world, as players can parkour, sprint on walls, glide, and more. Furthermore, unlike most MMOs, there are many paths to character development, including life skills such as cooking, fishing, case solving, performing, farming, archeology, presiding over court trials, and many more. Combat roles also reportedly break away from genre conventions, allowing tanks to heal and healers to deal significant damage. Players will thus be able to create their own unique fighting styles.</p>
