			<p>After six years of waiting, Hollow Knight developer <a href="http://After%20six%20years%20of%20waiting,%20Hollow%20Knight%20developer%20Team%20Cherry%20has%20announced%20a%20release%20date%20for%20Hollow%20Knight%20Silksong%20during%20Gamescom%202025.%20The%20highly%20anticipated%20metroidvania%20will%20launch%20on%20PC,%20PS5,%20PS4,%20Xbox%20One,%20Xbox%20Series%20X/S,%20Nintendo%20Switch,%20and%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20on%20September%204,%202025.https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">Team Cherry</a> has announced a release date for Hollow Knight Silksong during Gamescom 2025. The highly anticipated metroidvania will launch on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025.</p>



<p>The waiting is almost over, but almost more importantly, the anticipation and disappointment at every major videogame related event that has taken place in the last six years is actually over, and we can now sit back and relax without having to wonder if Hollow Knight Silksong will appear at The Game Awards this year, or at Summer Game Fest next year, and so on.</p>



<p>The special announcement hosted by Team Cherry today was watched live by more than a quarter of a million people, which further shows how excited fans of the first game are to see something new from Team Cherry.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the announcement didn't disappoint, with even more gameplay showing off the wide variety of bosses, enemies, and new areas you'll be able to explore in this hand-painted adventure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Every version of the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">is now $50 more expensive</a> in the U.S., but at least for now, a new deal at GameStop will cover the difference. The meme stock retailer announced it will start giving anyone who trades in their last-gen consoles an extra $50 in-store credit toward the purchase of a new PS5.</p> <p>This deal applies to anyone trading in an old PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. If you really want a PS5, it‚Äôs better than nothing. The all-digital edition, the cheapest Sony offers, is now $500 starting August 21. So instead of just getting $55 toward that from trading in a PS4, you‚Äôll get $110. An Xbox One currently trades for about $45, so just $95 total. The Switch isn‚Äôt much better. You‚Äôll only get $60 for it before the new bonus credit, even though Nintendo recently raised the price of a new one to $340.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúOffer valid through 8.23.25‚Äù is in such small print at the bottom lol</p> <p>GameStop only has your back for a few days üíÄ</p> <p>‚Äî Carlton (@carlton_ec08) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlton_ec08/status/1958345035302240471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Xbox Series X/S owners looking to move over to PlayStation will have it a little easier. A Series S, now sold new at $370, will still get you up to $176, while a Series X, sold for $600, will get you up to $300. I could see taking that. When it comes to the other consoles, the price difference is harder to swallow. GameStop also buries in the fine print that this <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">bonus Trump tariff credit</a> will only be active through August 23.</p> <p>Is it better than nothing? Sure! But it still lowkey sucks in the worst way. This whole thing is basically GameStop saying, ‚ÄúReckless trade policy has hiked the price of a PS5, so here‚Äôs a bonus credit for these already terrible trade-in values that you‚Äôll have to give right back to us.‚Äù GameStop‚Äôs edgelord CEO Ryan Cohen, despite being Canadian, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1908538518919323827">a big booster</a> of Trump, even as the president rolled out the current tariff regime earlier this year. His Elon Musk-lite impression included using the sale of GameStop‚Äôs Canadian operation <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/gamestop-selling-canadian-french-operations-stores-ryan-cohen-wokeness-dei/">to dunk on DEI policies</a>. He‚Äôs currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">using GameStop to buy billions in Bitcoin</a>.</p>

And it's because of this (as well as the post's subsequent removal) that fans now believe Japan is Forza Horizon 6's setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exciting news!" the post read. "We have Cody here, from @forzahorizonofficial, shooting cars for the next installation in the series. As there are no late-model Kei cars in America, he has flown out from the states to use our cars as the basis for their digital versions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are HUGE gamers here at Cult and Classic, and it is an honor to be supporting Forza and making Kei cards accessible virtually for people who can't have them IRL."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">‚Äî Knoebel goes GamesCom (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958294206205858164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Japan has ranked highly among the most-requested locations for Forza Horizon 6, following previous series entries set in Australia, Mexico and the UK.

That impending release does appear to come with a small caveat, however. As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, while the base game will feature four clan types, there are two more that will be available at launch--as long as you're willing to pay for them.</p><p dir="ltr">These two extra clans, Lasombra and Toreador, will come as part of the Shadows and Silk add-on pack, which will set you back $22, and it seems like there's no other way to get them. Eurogamer notes how one big issue here is that not only do clans affect how you play, but even shape the difficulty of your playthrough. The original Bloodlines also notably features seven clans in total.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 | Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While attending Gamescom, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it" rel="nofollow ">Rock Paper Shotgun</a> had the opportunity to speak to The Chinese Room and asked about the decision to turn these clans into DLC as opposed to including them in the base game. The simple answer is just that the new clans were additional work on top of the developer's original plans for the game. This additional work occasionally came at publisher Paradox's request, so the overall argument is that it's fair to sell them separately because it was extra work.</p><p dir="ltr">Narrative director Ian Thomas further explained how over the course of development and those numerous delays, a "huge amount of changes" have been made to the game, "Including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it.</p><p dir="ltr">"So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go, 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it."</p><p dir="ltr">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is due out October 21, and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong has finally received a release date, as announced today by Team Cherry today along with a new trailer.</p>
<p>Silksong will be available on 4th September across Switch consoles, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, including on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>News of today's announcement was hinted at earlier this week at gamescom's Opening Night Live, along with a fresh look at gameplay. More of that was shown in the new announcement video you can watch below:</p>

<p>Silksong is playable at the event too, though it's the same demo that was shown back in 2019 - albeit in revised form. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gamescom-queues-over-an-hour-and-reddit-in-overdrive-hollow-knight-silksong-hype-has-outpaced-everything-from-opening-night-live">proving to be a particularly popular game</a> at the show.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Dom Peppiatt braved the queues to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gamescom-queues-over-an-hour-and-reddit-in-overdrive-hollow-knight-silksong-hype-has-outpaced-everything-from-opening-night-live">hands-on with Silksong</a>, and came away impressed with its high challenge and how Hornet's movement differs from the original game's Knight.</p>
<p>After seven years of development, finally Silksong is almost in our hands.</p>

			<p>Over the years, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have tried their hands ‚Äì or flippers, I guess? ‚Äì at numerous video game genres. There‚Äôs been Turtle inspired side-scrolling beat ‚Äòem ups, one-on-one fighters, platformers, a light gun shooter, and a roguelike. Heck, even the pinball genre has been taken on by the awesome foursome. Now, with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, the brothers are giving turn-based strategy a go.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown: CONSOLE RELEASE TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOjavINypzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The brothers have fallen out and gone their separate ways, again, which is a popular and often regurgitated plot device for Turtles‚Äô films, TV shows, and comics, but here it provides developer Strange Scaffold with the opportunity to teach the player the tactical idiosyncrasies for each solo ninja, before bringing them together for a bombastic finale. Each grid-based level sees a turtle nunchuck their way from one end to the other, bashing the hordes of bad guys they meet on their way.</p>


<p>In a neat touch, to avoid the potentially plodding pace of a TBS, a sense of dynamic urgency is created as each level begins to rapidly fall away as you progress through it, forcing you to keep moving forward at all times. Dilly-dally in one place too long and the ground will fall away beneath your Turtle‚Äôs shell, sending them plummeting into the void. Thankfully, there‚Äôs a pleasing tactical component provided by this, as each turtle has several attacks that knock enemies backwards. Get yourself into the right position with your limited number of action points and you can send packs of enemies to their demise in one satisfying scenery smashing moment.</p>


<p>And you‚Äôll certainly need every strategic advantage you can get, as Tactical Takedown is a surprisingly challenging game. This game is based upon the Nickelodeon division of the Ninja Turtles empire, so it‚Äôs ostensibly aimed at kids. Well, that‚Äôs not the case for Tactical Takedown, which keeps the pressure on throughout, sending vast swathes of new enemies every turn, forcing you to use each of the Turtles‚Äô abilities with precision to have any chance of success. One mistake and it‚Äôs game over.</p>
<p>In truth, things get rather grindy, the never-ending baddies popping into existence faster than you can clear the decks, turning proceedings into a real slog, particularly in the latter stages. Matters aren‚Äôt helped by the game doing a poor job of explaining its mechanics, likely leading to many players bouncing off the frequent difficulty spikes.</p>

<p>Stick with it through its runtime of a handful of hours, and you‚Äôll discover a smart and ultimately satisfying strategy game. And when the gameplay mechanics click, and you have a perfect turn in which your turtle flips, hacks, slides, and dropkicks their way through a multitude of foot ninjas, you can‚Äôt help but have a good time. It‚Äôs just a shame that I could never quite get on with the visuals. Tactical Takedown is a digital recreation of a board game. As such, there is little to no animation, each character plonking around the place like a pawn on a chess board. This stylistic choice lessened the experience for me. Sure, the game is telling me that Michelangelo just ollied on his skateboard over the head of some goons, striking them as he went, but it doesn‚Äôt want to show me that. All I saw was one static piece leaping over another static piece. For some, this lack of animation and characterisation might be no big deal, but it left me cold.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-free-story-update-the-lost-harvest-dlc-free-trial/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dune-awakening-free-story-chapter-and-paid-dlc-the-lost-harvest-out-next-month-free-trial-on-now.1276989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/chapter-2-free-update-and-the-lost-harvest-dlc/">announced </a>that the first free story chapter for its massive multiplayer survival game, Dune: Awakening, will be out next month on September 10, 2025. Alongside the free update, Funcom is also releasing a paid DLC called The Lost Harvest, which has a standalone storyline separate from the free Chapter 2 update. And if you've yet to try Dune: Awakening but have been keen to check it out, you can do so now with a free trial on until August 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Chapter 2 of the story will be added as a free update for all owners of the game, and beyond more story content to dig through, it'll add a few highly-requested features, like being able to re-customize your player character, new hairstyles and tattoos, new contracts, more dynamic encounters, and new armor archetypes.</p>



<p>The Lost Harvest paid DLC is available separately for $12.99 USD, though if you've purchased the Season Pass, then you'll be getting The Lost Harvest as part of the pass. On top of everything else that comes in the free update, players who purchase The Lost Harvest DLC and/or purchase the Season Pass will get a new vehicle to explore Arrakis in with the Treadwheel. Three new Imperial Testing Stations to plunder, five new base decorations, four new weapon skins, two new armor skins, new Dune Man-themed building pieces for your base, and a thumper emote, on top of the separate story content that comes with The Lost Harvest.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Regarding the free trial, it's available for those wanting to test out a journey on Arrakis for themselves from now until August 24, and lets you spend 10 hours with the game running around Hagga Basin before the trial ends. There are a few areas that are unavailable in the trial, such as Harko Village, Arrakeen, and the Deep Desert, though in fairness, it would take you more than just 10 hours of gameplay to reach at least one of those areas.</p>



<p>You'll also be restricted to free trial servers, but if you do purchase the game, all your story progress, character level, skill and tech points, and the contents in your backpack will be carried over. The only things you'll need to rebuild are your base and vehicle, and if you managed to acquire more than 10,000 Solaris, you'll lose anything over that limit. You'll also get a few cosmetic items when you go from the free trial to the full game.</p>



<p>This is the first major content update for Dune: Awakening, and players who've been down on Arrakis since the game launched earlier this year will be happy for it, since anyone playing with some level of consistency has run through all the content that was included with the game at launch. What'll be more interesting for those players beyond the new content, is how Funcom re-balances the game with this new update, as there are surely going to be more tweaks coming on September 10th.</p>

<p>All you really need to play&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;is the rulebook, three different sized measuring sticks, an assortment of classic RPG dice (two each of: d4s, d6s, d8s, d10s, d12s, and a d20), markers to track which units have activated, and any like-sized spaceship models you can muster. Much like another of my favorite Osprey Games releases,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frostgrave-fireheart-and-blood-legacy-preview-new-rules-for-frozen-north" rel="nofollow">Frostgrave</a>,&nbsp;</em><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is miniature agnostic. This means you can field old <i>X-Wing&nbsp;</i>miniatures, kit-bash something cool from parts you have lying around, or even use cardboard cutouts. All that's needed is a uniform size across you and your opponent's models.</p>

<h2>Playing The Game</h2>

<p><em>Voidfighter'</em>s rules are meant to get miniatures onto the tabletop as quickly as possible, while still giving the player just enough to crunch on to not make it feel shallow by any means. Each round of the game consists of five phases: the Command phase, the Initiative phase, the Movement phase, the Gunnery phase, and the Maintenance phase.</p>

<p>In the Command and Initiative phases, players gain command points (which can be spent on daring maneuvers and upgrades) and roll to determine who activates their models first. In&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>, you definitely&nbsp;<em>don't</em>&nbsp;want to be activating first, as it gives your opponent more information.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-1.jpeg?itok=fMXsR_RM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-1.jpeg?itok=eDECkteU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the Movement phase, players will take turns activating chunks of their units (you'll activate a quarter of your units at once), and it's here that you can roll to pull off tricky maneuvers like a Roll or an Immelmann (where you change the ship's facing 180-degrees without moving). To do these maneuvers, you're usually rolling piloting rolls to which each have their own downside should you fail the roll!</p>

<p>In the Gunnery phase, blasters are unleashed as guns send streaks of light through the cold dark of space! With opposed rolls (that's how the whole game plays out, you roll two dice, as does your opponent to contest you) and easy determining of who's in your line of sight and who's in range, this has to be one of the snappiest dogfighting games I've ever tried.</p>

<p>The book goes on to cover rules for terrain and scenario-based models like Asteroids and space creatures, helps you design your squadron and individual ships in The Shipyard, shows off ships for various factions within the game, offers up 12 different scenarios, and has rules for extended campaign play... and it all adds layers to the game without bogging it down.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-1.jpeg?itok=Ts7nNW9k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-1.jpeg?itok=xhOLLCpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Enjoying The Trip</h2>

<p>And that's what I love about these rules, and what makes reading this rulebook so fun. Everything is meant to be easy and intuitive, without feeling too simplistic. You'll find yourself zooming around the board, trying to outflank your opponents as you fire off round after round of guns, torpedoes, and more. It's fast and let's you chuck plenty of dice.</p>

<p>Of all the elements of&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>&nbsp;that most surprised me and kept me engaged throughout my read-through of the rules, the sense of humor and high-quality prose author Casey Garske most stood out. When cracking open a new rulebook for a sci-fi dogfighting skirmish game, I have to admit: I was expecting a pretty dry affair.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=RDewXm6O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-art-2.jpg?itok=9JpGsETK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But Garske's writing - even when writing out the rules for movement - can't help but shine with its approachable, breezy tone. On top of that, he's created a world for this game that feels wonderfully fleshed out&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;bogging the reader down with heaps of lore. You get a few paragraphs about the universe at large, and then its off to the (space) races.</p>

<p>Another element that really serves the game is its treatment of reality, which it keeps at arm's length. There's a lot of gleeful hand-waving away of hard physics, which is a very good thing, as this wonderful little spark of a game would grind to a halt if it worried too much about things like g-force.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=pEd2Bppw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/voidfighter-photo-2.jpg?itok=-7N10pUP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is another grand-slam from publisher Osprey Games, and it shows just how wide open the field of miniature agnostic wargaming truly is. And in the practiced hands of a designer like Garske, there's truly no limit to the amount of creativity and ingenuity we can see from this type of wargame. Untethered by trying to sell their own lumbering miniature line,&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter&nbsp;</em>is allowed to feel nimble - like a snubfighter just dropping into orbit.</p>

<p>If you've got a stack of spaceship miniatures lying around and you're looking for something to do with them, or you want to get into the world of kit-bashing or 3D-printing, or the light and easy tone of this game sounds appealing to you - then I cannot recommend highly enough&nbsp;<em>Voidfighter</em>. Jump in, pilot!</p>

<p>Elden Ring is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and it reportedly struggles to run on the latest Nintendo console?</p>



<p>According to Nintendo Life‚Äôs Felix Sanchez, who spent time with the game while in Cologne for Gamescom the game has serious performance issues on the Switch 2 when playing in handheld mode.</p>



<p><strong>‚ÄúPerformance wise, here at that big first fight, as soon as you step outside, the framerate drops quite substantially,‚Äù</strong> Sanchez said while mentioning that it‚Äôs always locked at 30 frames per second</p>



<p>He then continued: <strong>‚ÄúYou get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks. It‚Äôs really bad, and I understand why they don‚Äôt want you to see this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>‚ÄúIt is terrible. Of course, you‚Äôre never going to see the light of this because‚Äîwell, maybe it‚Äôll release in that state, but I can‚Äôt imagine it will.‚Äù</strong></p>



<p>Sanchez said it felt like 20 frames per second and, sometimes, as low as 15. It would happen, he said, doing the ‚Äúmost simple stuff‚Äù.</p>



<p>As far as the positives, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sanchez did say that</a> while it doesn‚Äôt look as good as PC or PlayStation‚Äîas should be expected‚Äîit did look ‚Äúreally good‚Äù. He also said the tutorial area of the game performed properly.</p>



<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch 2 later this year. A firm release date, however, has yet to be announced. </p>

<p>"I don't like when the politics get in the way, which they did with Krafton," he said. "There was no doubt about it. They told me that the game has to ship in December because of the Korean stock market. I should have just shut it down right there. I'm mad of myself on that one."</p><p>Schofield said the PC edition of The Callisto Protocol was a "sh** show."</p><p>The Callisto Protocol launched on December 2, 2022, and Schofield claims Krafton cut off communications with him on December 10. Krafton didn't engage with Schofield again until May 2023, he said.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol was originally envisioned as a horror game set inside the PUBG universe, but the connection to the battle royale game was later dropped. The team behind the game, Striking Distance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-cuts-more-jobs-in-gamings-latest-layoffs/1100-6529696/" data-ref-id="1100-6529696">underwent layoffs after the game was released.</a></p><p>Schofield said The Callisto Protocol sold between 6-7 million copies and "made a lot of money" for a debut title from a new studio. Even if the number was actually 5 million, the game "made its money," Schofield said. For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Krafton management said the game failed to reach sales expecations.</a></p><p>After leaving Striking Distance, Schofield <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-he-might-have-directed-his-last-game-in-the-industry/1100-6533481/" data-ref-id="1100-6533481">attempted to secure funding for multiple other games</a>, but nothing materialized. He's now focusing on his art and writing projects.</p>

                <p>Remember earlier this week when The Pokemon Company put out a teaser image for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-teaser-might-make-you-think-its-switched-genres/1100-6534065/">looked like it could legitimately be from something like the Blair Witch Project</a>? Well, the full trailer is out now, and unsurprisingly it isn't actually all that scary--apart from that one bit with the Espurr. That thing still is terrifying. Still, the trailer is a fun riff on the found-footage genre, and it even revealed a completely new Mega Evolution Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Titled The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident, the trailer follows a couple of people exploring an abandoned building as they come across more and more mysterious happenings. Surprising mirrors, mysterious purple sludge, that titular sweet scent, some Pokemon-oriented jump-scares--all of it builds towards the reveal of Mega Victreebel. And it's looking ‚Ä¶ large.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyfDz36JkkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Victreebel's Mega form essentially looks like a giant water balloon with some leaves growing out of it, and it bounces around the place as it moves. Over on the official <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel" rel="nofollow ">Pokemon Legends website</a>, a description explains, "It has so much acid that even closing its mouth tight isn‚Äôt enough to hold it in, so it contains the acid by wrapping its own vines around its throat." It certainly paints an uncomfortable picture.</p><p dir="ltr">According to a press release, Mega Victreebel's type stays as grass and poison when it evolves, but details like stat changes likely won't be shared until the game is out.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is releasing October 16 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> popped up at Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> reveal, it was a promising sign of third-party games finding their way to the new console.</p>
<p>Yet reports from gamescom suggest Elden Ring runs poorly on Switch 2, particularly in handheld mode, citing low framerates in open world environments. Even publisher Bandai Namco seems to be aware of this, as footage capture has not been allowed, which seems particularly damning.</p>
<p>FromSoftware doesn't have a great track record with performance, though, and after three years Elden Ring still doesn't run perfectly on PS5, Xbox Series X, or PC. But this is the studio's first effort on Switch 2, and it's perhaps a worrying sign for next year's exclusive The Duskbloods.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-bWgUgYJGE">IGN</a> described Elden Ring on Switch 2 as a "disaster" in handheld mode, after Eurogamer's Ian Higton went hands-on at gamescom.</p>
<p>Ian was only able to play in handheld mode, but played the very start of the game. And while he was impressed with the lighting and resolution, the framerate dropped dramatically during both the Grafted Scion tutorial boss and when entering the open world. "As soon as I opened up those double doors and entered into Limgrave and you see the Erdtree in the background, it started to chug," said Ian.</p>
<p>Further, the demo only has a single graphics mode with HDR switched on, but this could potentially change in the final release.</p>
<p>Both Jon Cartwright from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDiSIezfsrw">GVG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM">Nintendo Life</a>'s Felix Sanchez reported similar feedback. Cartwright noted how fog in the distance caused the framerate to plummet and while the game runs at 30fps, it goes "well below when anything a little bit challenging comes up", including bosses. He was able to test docked mode, which was "better but not perfect".</p><p>Sanchez, meanwhile, was impressed by the graphics despite being not quite on par with current consoles, but in the open world "the framerate just tanks - it's really bad and I understand why they don't want you to see this because wowee zowee it is terrible".</p>
<p>It's certainly disappointing to hear, especially when Elden Ring does run perfectly fine on PS4 and Xbox One, not to mention the Steam Deck already provides a handheld mode with steady performance. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1mvmoxw/elden_ring_on_switch_2_is_a_disaster_in_handheld/">reddit</a>, fans appear to be upset by the news, but not particularly surprised following FromSoftware's poor optimisation of games in the past.</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 is weaker compared to PS5 or Xbox Series X, but it does have VRR capabilities - it's not clear if this has been implemented by the developers.</p>
<p>Perhaps this poor performance shouldn't come as a surprise. Two years after the base game launched, FromSoftware released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. Yet, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-long-standing-tech-issues-have-been-ignored">Digital Foundry reported</a> last year, this still did not fix many underlying technical issues with the game, particularly its long-standing stuttering. Seeing issues with the Switch 2 version suggests FromSoftware just doesn't intend to fix them, with performance seemingly not a priority.</p><p>Digital Foundry also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTQXdP6sHfQ">examined the Elden Ring Switch 2 trailer</a> from its initial reveal, noting its seemingly poor performance, despite its impressive pixel count. It seems frame pacing issues from the trailer capture are present in the game itself. Still, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - an infamously more technically demanding game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-a-cutting-edge-game-translates-well-to-nintendos-console-hybrid">runs well on Switch 2</a>, it's disappointing to see FromSoftware struggling.</p>
<p>Elden Ring remains without a Switch 2 release date beyond this year, so there's still time for fixes to be implemented. It's the first FromSoftware-developed game to make it to Nintendo's Switch family (there's been no mention of an external team handling the port), as the previously released Dark Souls Remastered was handled by Virtuos. But it won't be the last. As revealed earlier this year, FromSoftware has the Switch 2 exclusive multiplayer game The Duskbloods on the way.</p>
<p>Will it suffer a similar fate? It's unclear what engine that game is being created in, but considering it's a Switch 2 exclusive from the ground up, you'd hope FromSoftware would optimise the game accordingly rather than shoehorning Elden Ring to make it fit. Yet the precedent of poor performance - and FromSoftware's seeming apathy towards it - has already been set.</p>

            <p>Mega Victreebel has been announced for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A.</p>
<p>Debuting in a video with strong Blair Witch and urban-exploring-gone-wrong vibes, Mega Victreebel is the Mega Evolution for this classic Gen 1 Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A will be the first appearance of this form and it's the second new Mega Evolution to be announced for the upcoming game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">first being Mega Dragonite</a>.</p>
<p>For the non-Pok√©mon fans, Mega Evolutions are temporary transformations that certain Pok√©mon can undergo. Doing so makes them more powerful, while also changing their appearance and, occasionally, type.</p>

<p>Mega Victreebel's type remains Grass and Poison, but its appearance has certainly changed! Victreebel is inspired by pitcher plants, with the majority of its body being the tube where unsuspecting insects - or Pok√©mon in this case - find themselves devoured. Mega Evolution sees Victreebel looking incredibly well fed and surprisingly bouncy. Meanwhile, its vine has become wrapped around its head, making its mouth smaller.

<p>With a particularly spooky reveal</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pok√©mon Company has revealed yet another new Mega Evolution that will make its debut in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</a>, and it's Victreebel being put in the limelight this time.</p>
<p>This classic Grass / Poison Type has been a series mainstay throughout the generations, and its new Mega design looks particularly... sweet (<em>heh</em>).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Mega-Evolution-of-the-Flycatcher-Pokemon-VictreebelMega-VictreebelAppe">The Pok√©mon Company</a>, Mega Victreel stands at 14'9" (4.5 m) and weighs in at 276.7 lbs. (125.5 kg). Yep, he <em>big</em>. The official description reads, "The volume of this Pok√©mon‚Äôs acid has increased due to Mega Evolution, filling its mouth. If it‚Äôs not careful, the acid will overflow and spill out". <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at Mega Victreel in-game. Relish in its goofy-smile glory:</p>

<p>The Mega was revealed in a particularly spooky little clip on TPC's official YouTube channel, titled 'The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident'. It shows two trainers making their way through a creepy house, following a trail of mysterious, sweet-smelling purple goo.</p>
<p>It might have given us our first look at Victreebell's new Mega form (not our first pick, but a nice addition), but our biggest takeaway is just how much a Pok√©mon horror game would <em>slap</em>.</p>
<p>If the above reveal was a little too spooky for your tastes, TPC also released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f79j5pSboEQ">in-game trailer</a>, which shows Mega Victreel hunting down 'mon in the wild. We'll be keeping an eye out for similar reveals in the coming months before Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A arrives on Switch 1 and 2 on 16th October.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Vampire Survivors Developer Announces and Launches New Game, Kill The Brickman]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/kill-the-brickman-poncle-launch-vampire-survivors-gamescom-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-developer-announces-and-launches-new-game-kill-the-brickman.1276938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Poncle, the team behind the hit and <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">award-winning auto-shooter</a> Vampire Survivors, has announced its next published title, Kill the Brickman, developed by Doonutsaur at Gamescom 2025, and it has also launched it on PC and Xbox at the same time.</p>



<p>The one-minute announcement and release trailer for Kill the Brickman mostly showed off gameplay of this Brick-Breaker-like game, before ending the presentation with a slew of Steam codes that, as far as we can tell, were quickly snatched up by anyone who was fast enough while watching the live stream.</p>



<p>Though, even if you missed grabbing a free code, Kill the Brickman is not an expensive game, and at the time of this writing you can grab it for only $4.49 USD with a 10% off launch sale that will end on August 28, 2025. It'll be back to $4.99 USD / EUR4.99 / ¬£3.99 after the 28th.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>More than just a brick-breaker game, Kill the Brickman is described as a "<em>turn-based, rogue-like bullet builder from outer space</em>."</p>



<p>The collaboration between Poncle and Doonutsaur began when the game was sent to Poncle over email, and the studio's director, Luca Galante, became immediately enamored with it. "<em>Yes, this is true. I love Bricks</em>," Galante said in a press release. </p>



<p>"<em>Kill the Brickman is not only a brilliant deckbuilder, it's also one of the strangest ones I've ever played. And that's a good thing</em>."</p>



<p>Galante is right in that Kill the Brickman seems like a strange game in a positive way. And there's no waiting to test that theory, since for the price of an expensive coffee, you can play Kill the Brickman on your PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S console, right now. There was no mention of a PlayStation or Nintendo version, though there's always a possibility those could be added down the road. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mega-victreebel-revealed-pokemon-legends-za</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-victreebel-revealed-for-pokemon-legends-z-a.1276935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new Mega Evolution for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>in the form of Mega Victreebel, and if you've ever felt like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>could stand a little more horror in its diet, then the new trailer is for you.</p>

<p>Two new videos have appeared on The Pokemon Company's official YouTube channel. The first is a fairly whimsical introduction to Mega Victreebel that shows off the 'mon's design in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, as well as some of its combat moves.</p>

<p>It's the second, however, that sparked my interest. "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident" is an honest-to-god found-footage horror video in which Mega Victreebel plays a role, and I don't want to spoil it, but it's well worth a watch if you're into the creepier side of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=KI6-3B6N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-victreebel-pokemon-legends-z-a-the-case-of-the-sweet-scent-incident.jpg?itok=saskKvDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, this still is from a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>video.</figcaption></figure><p>In essence, the new video short from the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>folks marries the warring worlds of the creature-collecting franchise and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, as two urban explorers investigate a building that's been giving off a sweet scent at night.</p>

<p>The conceit of the video is that the footage was discovered "on a video sharing website", so the creators are really leaning into the&nbsp;<em>Blair Witch</em>-style trappings of the genre. It's well worth a watch; you can check it out right here.</p>




<p>This has all been set up ahead of the launch of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is set for release on both Nintendo Switch 2 and the original Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">in October</a>.</p>

<p>Being set in the Kalos region's Lumiose City, the game will heavily feature Mega Evolution as a mechanic, and it'll introduce new Mega Evolved forms of existing Pokemon like Dragonite and Victreebel, as well as existing Mega Evolutions originally introduced back in Gen 6.</p>

<p>You'll be able to pick up&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>on the Switch family of consoles on October 16th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is adding several new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> when it comes to the Switch systems on October 16. We already knew Dragonite was getting one of these powerful alternate forms, and now another monster from the series‚Äô first generation is getting an upgrade almost 30 years later. However, while Dragonite is a long-time favorite from the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>games, Victreebel, the pitcher plant Pok√©mon, is a much more surprising pick.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Victreebel was first teased on Tuesday, August 19, through </span><a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1957790171216158990"><span>a social media post</span></a><span> on the official </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>social channels which showed a hand gripping onto a rusted gate, presumably somewhere in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>‚Äôs Lumiose City where the game takes place. The image looks pretty ominous, and if it weren‚Äôt posted by the official </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>account, you probably wouldn‚Äôt have known it was about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. The text even says ‚ÄúViewer discretion advised,‚Äù probably so parents don‚Äôt show it to their young children. </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>is no stranger to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-poltchageist-dlc-new-1850761666"><span>dark stories</span></a><span> in its promo material, and even the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-arceus-ghostly-new-pokemon-belong-to-a-special-1847938579"><span>some pretty spooky shit in its trailers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The video is presented as found footage, showing two unsuspecting characters searching an abandoned building and finding a toxic purple substance and a bunch of scary Pok√©mon. At the end we see Mega Victreebel, whose destructive power scares the humans off. However, its trainer calms it down, and it turns out it‚Äôs not a terrifying monster; it‚Äôs just a goofy guy who doesn‚Äôt know its own strength. The official description on the <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-victreebel">Pok√©mon website</a> says that it uses its own vines to keep all the acid it accumulates in its body by wrapping them around its throat. Mega Evolutions remain brutal.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Notably, Victreebel and Dragonite were both on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>list of leaked Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> from back in March.

<p>Once Human‚Äôs next big update lands next week, it was announced at Gamescom, as the title continues to grow with more features and experiences.</p>



<p>First released in July 2024, Once Human has grown in the year since, including the launch of a PvP spin-off, RaidZone. Now, the base game itself is getting a big update.</p>



<p>Stellar Resonance is a new gameplay mode that lands in Once Human next week, introducing Gravity Integrators and a host of rewards.</p>



<h2 id="h-once-human-stellar-resonance-releases-august-28">Once Human Stellar Resonance Releases August 28</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Defend mode. Image via NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a press release sent to Insider Gaming, the Stellar Resonance update is said to ‚Äúdrastically change‚Äù gameplay and offer ‚Äúall-new challenges‚Äù for players.</p>



<p>Further details were shared on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20250821/40780_1255304.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, with the event period beginning August 28 and running to September 25. After the update is live, players will receive a Gravity Integrator blueprint when a Star Advent Loot Crate is opened for the first time, which can be used at an Intermediate or Advanced Supplies Workbench.</p>



<p>Once placed and activated, the Gravity Integrator will begin to ascend, constantly accumulating Stellar Core Gravity Samples and unlocking tiered rewards the higher it ascends. However, it will also attract Deviants and must be defended.</p>



<p>Global Research is also available in the update, with progress shared across all servers for the same region, unlocking new bonuses and additional reward claim chances. However, the mission is ‚Äúextremely urgent‚Äù, and, if a new research phase is not within five days, bonuses will be lost and attacking Deviants will be stronger.</p>



<p>Additional optimizations were also deployed, including increased gliding and descending speed, improved airbone mechanics, and the ability to cancel aiming when performing a plunging melee attack.</p>



<p>Are far have you gotten in Once Human? Are you excited for the update? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>This week Steam made a small change to how it displays reviews and will now show a score for reviews in your language instead of an "all reviews" score. One game that has benefited from the change is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, which now shows Overwhelmingly Positive for all English reviews.</p><p>Palworld has been the source of some controversy since it first came to the public's attention, with some claiming the monster-collecting title is a direct rip-off of Pokemon--an opinion that seems to be shared by Nintendo, who eventually sued developer Pocketpair for patent infringement. The game has still proven popular with players, reaching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">huge player numbers</a> in its first month of release.</p><p>While Palworld used to show an all-time review rating of Very Positive on Steam, the reviews update has given the game a small boost in English, granting it the coveted Overwhelmingly Positive rating. The upgrade was celebrated by Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John "Bucky" Buckley, who posted to X about the milestone. Bucky clarified in the comments that Palworld isn't rated particularly low in any language--it "just happens to be higher in English," he said in a <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958048265720524913" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Due to the Steam review change (it now shows the overall score in your language), Palworld is Overwhelmingly Positive! <br>Thank you so much to our overseas fans who continue to support us and enjoy the game! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>As always, we‚Äôre so incredibly grateful for your continued support!üôá <a href="https://t.co/GswoERWfan" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/GswoERWfan</a></p>  ‚Äî Bucky | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1958045103588569460?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Looking through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld reviews</a> by language, the survival-crafting game has by far the most reviews in English, which average out to Overwhelmingly Positive. The language with the second-largest number of reviews is Simplified Chinese, which have rated Palworld Very Positive -- making it likely that the Chinese reviews were dragging down the average when all review scores were collated. English and Chinese together make up over half of Palworld's total reviews, with all other languages also sporting a Very Positive or Overwhelmingly Positive score.</p><p>Palworld is well into its second year of early access, and continues to receive major updates. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-x-terraria-crossover-update-is-out-now-game-discounted-significantly/1100-6532715/" data-ref-id="1100-6532715">last big update</a> included a crossover with Terraria, while Pocketpair has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">changed a few major systems</a> in response to Nintendo's ongoing lawsuit.</p>

So either we find a partner or we have get smaller," he said&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing what that partnership might take shape, Morten was adamant the foundational elements of Stormgate show clear potential and said the studio could leverage its tools and experience to give partners interested in building RTS games a "huge head start."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are some big IPs that would make a lot of sense to turn into an RTS, so there are a lot of conversations for us to have as a studio around that. The second clear area of opportunity for us is user-generated content (UGC)," he explained.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Newsbrief: Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"RTS has such a rich history of UGC and already with the first early release of our (UCG) tool there has been a tremendous amount of activity and creativity evident from the&nbsp; community.

I think people hear a number like $40 million and think, 'wow, that's so much money,' but the truth is, to build games of this scope and this quality requires more money."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Morten confirmed Frost Giant stuck to budget on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stormgate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but says he would have liked to raise additional funds because his vision for the project was (and indeed remains) so large. He believes that in a world where Frost Giant had been able to raise capital against its vision a different outcome would have been likely, but acknowledges that in the current climate indie developers must keep a "tight focus."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had to face constricting capital," he continued.

They're just different opportunities. What I see in the market today is that very small teams with very low cost who focus on a tight vision and differentiation, they can still succeed," he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think UGC is exploding, particularly Roblox but also UEFN and even platforms like CurseForge and mod.io. I think there are some exciting opportunities there. Then I think the companies that have evergreen franchises and therefore a stable base of revenue will to continue to try to innovate farm will continue to make exciting games.
