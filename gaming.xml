<p>According to some reports, however, it seems a small minority have been experiencing some pretty severe motion sickness with the game. This came to our attention via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1m1p5vm/playing_dk_bananza_atm_and_got_extremely_nauseous/">Reddit</a> thread in which user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/vruchtenhagel/">vruchtenhagel</a> said that they "got extremely nauseous in the first 45 minutes".</p>
<p>The thread has since garnered over 250 comments, some from folks experiencing similar issues, and others kindly offering potential fixes to alleviate the effects.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4torsuq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/bgrandis7/">bgrandis7</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was looking for someone who had a similar experience to mine! I felt really, really sick in the first area as well, never had something like that happen to me before.</p>
<p>"I think the zooming in and out from 1st and 3rd person on Ingot Isle might be the culprits. I really hope the next areas are less cramped and the camera can be a bit further away."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-motion-sickness-settings/">Nintendo Everything</a>, you can try disabling the motion controls and screen shake via Bananza's options menu to potentially help with the problem. Some commenters in the Reddit thread have stated that such actions have unfortunately not helped, while others have said that it does indeed reduce the motion sickness.</p>
<p>So, we thought we'd put it to you fine folks and see if this really is a potential issue. Have you been feeling any motion sickness from Donkey Kong Bananza? Why not let us know by voting in the below poll and expounding with a comment while you're at it.</p>

            <p>A few of the UK's fanciest former indie developers are going indie again... with help from venture capital. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes The Deep</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dear-esther">Dear Esther</a> creators The Chinese Room have slipped the surly bonds of former parent company Sumo Digital in the course of a management buyout, with "facilitation" from Hiro Capital. Now "fully independent", they're focussing on the creation of original games, with two unannounced projects in the offing once they've finished developing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>Founded in 2007 by a group of academically minded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> modders, The Chinese Room made waves initially with Dear Esther, an introspective first-person exploration game that emphasised environmental storytelling over mechanics, aggressively and affectionately described as a "walking sim".</p>
<p>They later worked with Frictional on Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs - sequel to The Dark Descent and perhaps the best-written Amnesia game - and Sony's Santa Monica Studio on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture">Everybody's Gone To The Rapture</a>, in which you chase golden phantoms around a sorrowful English village. I once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/08/a-video-game-garden-the-delights-of-virtual-botany">took a botanist on a walking tour of Rapture</a> and we both thought the flowers were excellent. I also love the soundtrack, which makes me want to wander off into the hills of Shropshire and die tragically of, nudge-wink, "Spanish flu".</p>

<p>The Chinese Room were acquired by Sumo Digital in 2018, who were themselves later acquired by Tencent. The developers' most recent project is Still Wake The Deep, a creature feature set aboard a Scottish oil rig: in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review">review</a>, Brendy concluded that it "doesn't push the boat out but still excels within its genre". Sadly, there has been some belt-tightening of late. Sumo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">confirmed layoffs at The Chinese Room and elsewhere in their operations this June</a>, as part of plans to move away from original game creation and "focus exclusively on development services for partners".</p>
<p>According to a PR email this week, Sumo put The Chinese Room up for sale earlier this year, with the expectation that it would be sold to private equity or an overseas buyer. The management buyout ensures that the studio will remain UK-owned, according to the email, though it's not clear how exactly Hiro Capital (who are based in London and Luxembourg) have "faciliated" the deal, and what they'll expect in return. Compare and contrast how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legends-how-amplitude-bought-their-independence-back-from-sega">Amplitude bought their independence back from Sega</a>.</p>
<p>According to studio director Ed Daly, "this management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision." Best of luck with it all, peeps. Please make another game about a subterranean hellfactory.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-current-developers-of-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-are-going-fully-indie-again]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Turtle Rock's Evolve was, for me, an almost-brilliant asymmetrical shooter straining to extract itself from the jaws of a live service kaiju maddened by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evolve-wot-i-think-in-progress-conclusion">a sludgy diet of unlocks and micro-transactions</a>. It was a huge round of hide-and-seek featuring one, very large and fast, upgradeable alien monster and four hunters equipped with jet packs, trackers, forcefield nets and assorted demolition gear. I had a grand old time at launch as the Wraith, a godawful sneaklizard with warping capabilities, like a xenomorph moonlighting as Corvo Attano. But such thrills were sabotaged by the grindiness of the early game and by an infuriating deluge of paid DLC. Publishers 2K Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evolve-shutting-down-dedicated-servers-and-f2p-version">delisted it in 2018</a>, after attempting to reboot Evolve as a free-to-play game. The beast clings onto a little life care of <a href="https://discord.com/invite/evolvereunited">a community Discord for existing owners</a>.</p>
<p>Even given the reaction to Evolve's nickel-and-diming, it seems unlikely a sequel would have stripped out the live service progression elements and reverted to something like the menu-light horror movie sandbox approach of the developer's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>. After all, Turtle Rock went onto make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a>, a zombie blaster marinated in grindogubbins. Still, I'd have liked to see them try it. And look, they almost did.</p> <!--more-->
<p>A <a href="https://www.tj-frame.com/evolve">concept artist portfolio</a> flushed out by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-evolve-2-was-once-in-development-concept-art-reveals-scrapped-sequel">MP1st</a> describes plans for a cancelled Evolve 2. These included ideas for what sound like more linear missions (boo!), and a level consisting of a massive spacerock-digesting facility that puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>'s USG Ishimura (yes please). "After Evolve released, the studio began work on a sequel," writes TJ Frame, who was senior concept artist at Turtle Rock between 2011 and 2017. "Sadly that project was canceled after several months of pre-production.</p>
<p>"At one point the game design included locations such as a huge asteroid mining station, tentatively named The Akhenaten, as well as more sequentially oriented missions back on Shear," the post continues. "It would have been fun to really flesh out new locations and architectural styles within the world of Evolve, but the studio moved onto other projects and pitches."</p>
<p>TJ Frame's portoflio includes a bunch of art for the abandoned Evolve 2, which I will hold off recirculating here because I don't have the developer's blessing. Some of the images are labelled "Evolve II", though one "Scraptown" or "Slagtown" area appears to be an outline for some Evolve DLC. The concepts for the aforesaid Akhenaten map are definitely the highlights, in terms of inherent munsterliness. The subliminal theme TJ Frame and their colleagues appear to have been working with is "nasty insect biting/liquefying paralysed and helpless prey". Now picture yourself standing on that insect's abdomen, attempting to harpoon Godzilla.</p>
<p>Alas and alack, such antics will probably never come to pass. Turtle Rock were acquired by Tencent in 2021 - their current project is <a href="https://www.turtlerockstudios.com/games">TBA</a>. If you too mourn the extinction of Evolve, you might be interested to hear that one of its spiritual progenitors, Aliens Vs Predator, is enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ancient-aliens-vs-predator-game-briefly-resurrected-by-steam-player-thirst-for-six-packs">a new lease of existence care of a sporadically reanimating community server</a>.</p></div>

            <p>The Chinese Room, the British studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has gone independent from previous owners Sumo Digital following a management buyout.</p>
<p>The Brighton-based studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumo-buys-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-maker-the-chinese-room">bought by Sumo Digital back in 2018</a>, which was acquired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> in January 2022 in a deal worth around £919m.</p>
<p>Now, The Chinese Room will continue developing original games independently, following its success with oil rig horror game Still Wakes the Deep that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the BAFTA for New Intellectual Property</a> at this year's awards, as well as both performer awards.</p>

<p>"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision," said studio director Ed Daly.</p>
<p>"This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">Sumo Digital announced it would refocus</a> on "development services for partners", which would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people". The news followed layoffs in June 2024, where 15 percent of the company were let go.</p>
<p>Sumo Digital put The Chinese Room up for sale earlier this year, but it was likely the studio would be sold to an overseas buyer. This management buyout therefore allows The Chinese Room to remain as an independent British studio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Still Wakes the Deep publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-publisher-confirms-small-number-of-layoffs-as-its-sold-to-investment-firm">Secret Mode confirmed a "small number" of layoffs</a> earlier this year as it was sold to an investment firm.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">worked on with Paradox Interactive</a>. It's then working on two further new original projects.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was previously aiming for a first half of 2025 release, but was delayed back in March. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-troubled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-another-delay">now aiming for an October launch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6f9923c11682/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in, and as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a hit, climbing all the way to the top to beat the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p>
<p>How well it <em>actually</em> sold, however, is a little bit more difficult to gauge. According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/">The Game Business</a>' Chris Dring, Bananza sold three times that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> on the Switch, but less than half of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious conclusion that we could come to is that digital sales far outweigh physical in 2025, but while the balance has certainly tipped <em>ever-so-slightly</em> in favour of digital, Switch owners still really value their physical games. In response to a post stating that more people buy digital over physical, Dring stated "Not so much on Switch. A little more".</p>
<p>It's a weird situation, then. One other potential explanation is that by the time Super Mario Odyssey launched in October 2017, Nintendo had sold a lot more Switch consoles since its release in March the same year. We're looking at between 14-15 million Switch consoles sold by the time Odyssey launched.</p>
<p>Bananza releasing less than two months after the Switch 2 dropped means that there are simply fewer consoles in consumers' hands – thus fewer sales. We also have to consider that, despite Nintendo's efforts to boost DK's appeal in recent years, Mario as an IP likely still commands a lot more attention.</p>
<p>Still, we're pleased to see Bananza top the charts – may its success continue in the weeks, months, and years to come!</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>British developer The Chinese Room has gained independence back from Sumo Digital, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports IGN</a>. As you might recall, Sumo Digital <a href="https://wccftech.com/sumo-digital-acquired-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> the development studio nearly seven years ago, in August 2018, for an undisclosed sum.</p>



<p>Now, though, The Chinese Room has sought independence because Sumo Digital had recently switched to a development-for-hire model. Moreover, the studio feared Sumo would sell it to some other company. The team will be headed by current studio director Ed Daly, who received funding help from venture capital firm Hiro Capital. Here's a statement from Daly:</p>



<p><em>This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision. This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.</em></p>



<p>Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital, added: </p>



<p><em>The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage. From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they've been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British. We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations. That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.</em></p>



<p>The Chinese Room, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/paradox-confirms-layoffs-at-the-chinese-room-claims-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-development-is-unaffected-by-the-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off some employees</a>, is working on two unannounced IPs. However, by far its most anticipated game is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took over from Hardsuit Labs on behalf of publisher Paradox Interactive</a>. Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now set to launch in October 2025</a>, and we expect to learn a lot more about it next month at Gamescom.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/waypoint-writers-quit-following-removal-of-articles-about-new-steam-policy.1248558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Steam quietly announced a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new rule</a> banning “certain kinds of adult-only content” that “may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks.” Following this, reporter Ana Valens wrote a series of stories on Vice’s video games vertical Waypoint about an organization called Collective Shout that <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/1946102182325219679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took credit</a> for the changes on Steam as part of a campaign aimed at payment processors. Valens says Vice’s owner, Savage Ventures, demanded the removal of the articles; Valens and several other Waypoint writers quit in response.</p><p>Two articles were removed from Waypoint Sunday morning: a July 18 article titled “<a href="https://archive.ph/USxe6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This Group Takes Responsibility For Steam's Payment Processor Censorship Policies--They Just Implied 'Pervert Nerds' Cause Society's Problems</a> and a July 19 article titled “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250719204151/https://www.vice.com/en/article/group-behind-steam-censorship-policies-have-powerful-allies-and-targeted-popular-games-with-outlandish-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Group Behind Steam Censorship Policies Have Powerful Allies–And Targeted Popular Games With Outlandish Claims</a>.” Valens told Aftermath she was informed by Waypoint managing editor Dwayne Jenkins Sunday morning that leadership at Savage Ventures had ordered Jenkins to remove the articles; Valens informed Jenkins that she would quit her Waypoint contributing role if this happened and, once it did, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hknazlbtwv5thavb7uw52xjz/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Faftermath.site%252Fpreview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced her departure</a>.</p><p>Valens said that both articles had been edited and approved by Jenkins, though did not go through pre-publication legal review. Valens told Aftermath that, as far as she’s aware, there was no legal threat from Collective Shout or other entities over the contents of the articles, though tells Aftermath it’s “possible that [Savage Ventures] simply were afraid of one coming eventually.”&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCGamer</a> notes, “The two retracted articles from Waypoint appear to be the first among the games press to point out the connection between Collective Shout and the recent changes on Steam, a connection which is public knowledge⁠—by Collective Shout's own statements⁠—and not an allegation made by Waypoint against the group.”</p><p>Valens discussed the situation further in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2517618111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch stream</a> Sunday morning, in which she claimed that Savage Ventures had previously worried about how Waypoint articles covering sexual or political topics might affect the site’s performance on Google. Valens said on stream that “I’ve been told very specifically with a number of articles that it’s an issue with… Google, Google overlords. We actually had to fight very hard to keep some of our more politically-oriented VTuber coverage up because [Savage Ventures] were nervous it was going to be too R-rated for Google… I was told especially [of issues with] Google Discover.” Valens pointed out on stream that the July 19 article had spread particularly widely on social media, including Reddit.&nbsp;</p><p>Requests for comment to email addresses for Vice and Savage Ventures bounced.&nbsp;</p><p>Following Valens’ announcement that she was leaving Waypoint, she posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lug2bx34522v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that “Savage Ventures requested I no longer contribute to VICE… several hours after my announcement.” Later on Sunday, Waypoint writers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shauncichacki.bsky.social/post/3lug2qty7m227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaun Cichacki </a>and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattvat.bsky.social/post/3lug2ywbiuc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Vatankhah</a><strong> </strong>both announced they were quitting the site. “I can't sit back and watch Savage Ventures silence Ana and stifle actual journalism out of fear of being ‘too controversial,’” wrote Vatankhah, while Cichacki wrote that “I cannot stand by and watch [Valens] be censored for doing her job and doing it properly.”</p><p>“Dwayne was a great boss to me,” Valens told Aftermath, adding, “The team I worked with at Waypoint treated me with the utmost respect and care. They were great colleagues.” Jenkins voiced support for Waypoint’s current and former writers on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lejenk603.bsky.social/post/3lug4fsvt4k2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, noting “At further risk to myself, that's all I can say at the moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>Waypoint previously removed several articles by Valens about VTuber Kirsche Verstahl following Verstahl releasing an “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErvbtgZ4xU4UhCbJeTBeD6G9vnmT6kLq/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open letter</a>” about the coverage that read in part “I don’t want to go to court over this. But… what else am I supposed to do?” An <a href="https://archive.ph/40kfD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article by Jenkins </a>about harassment Valens faced surrounding her VTuber coverage was also removed. Waypoint also previously cancelled a <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/vice-512785/4006265177530-friends-freaks-and-fans-look-forward-to-futa-fridays-featuring-on-um-fridays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column</a> Valens planned to write about adult games, and, Valens says, Savage Ventures, “wanted to pull <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/your-mom-and-dad-now-know-what-a-vtuber-is-thanks-to-this-arrest-maybe-sorta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article I did on right-wing extremism in VTubing</a> due to its political content” and over how “such political extremism could impact our standing with Google Discover.” Valens noted to Aftermath that, despite this seeming concern over Waypoint’s content, articles about <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zoophilia-zoophiles-animal-sex-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zoophilia</a> and “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/welcome-to-the-age-of-gooning-where-porn-and-pleasure-blur-into-obsession/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gooning</a>” appear on Vice itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking down articles is considered one of the cardinal sins of journalism at many outlets, especially if the outlet believes the article to be factual and to meet its editorial standards. (No public reason was given by Vice for the recent articles' removals.) Most outlets will update, edit, or amend editor’s notes to articles rather than remove them wholesale. Many outlets will also have sensitive stories go through multiple rounds of editorial and legal review before publication, though the scope of this process varies from outlet to outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>Waypoint’s process is unusual in this regard, in that Valens told Aftermath most stories, once approved by Jenkins, are edited after publication. Some sensitive stories are edited beforehand, which Valens told Aftermath happened with the July 18 story but not the July 19 one. Valens told Aftermath that "I do think Savage Ventures did not give adequate editorial support to Waypoint and Dwayne. During my time there, there wasn’t a second editor on staff to help with shepherding out news stories on any sensitive subject matters, whether my own work or others.’”&nbsp;</p><p>A lack of editors at Waypoint (or <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/journalism-job-cuts-2025-tracked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many journalism outlets</a> these days) is unsurprising: Vice shuttered the original Waypoint in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vice-shutting-down-waypoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023</a>, and much of its staff went on to form worker-owned outlet <a href="https://remapradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remap</a>. Vice declared bankruptcy in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/02/22/vice-media-shuts-down-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2024</a> and laid off the majority of its staff, then was <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/vice-digital-joint-venture-savage-ventures-vice-news-1235997565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a> in May of that year under the steam of Nashville-based “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/savage-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">venture operator</a>” Savage Ventures. In October 2024 <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waypoint began publishing again</a> with new <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writers</a>. Valens said on her stream that she was paid $30 an article; a contributor to the previous iteration of Waypoint, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nickcapozzoli.bsky.social/post/3lugc46uya22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Capozzoli</a>, said rates used to be at least $300.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Underpaid writers</a>, understaffed sites, and ownership that feels <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no allegiance</a> to the work their sites produce is pretty much <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">par for the course</a> in games journalism these days. As experienced reporters and editors leave or are forced out of the field, and as sites fall into the hands of <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private equity</a> or traffic-obsessed <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conglomerates</a>, there’s less support for writers day to day, and less support for sites from above. Ownership that is distanced from their sites’ writers or sees those sites as revenue sources more than news outlets providing a service to readers has little incentive to stand by a site’s work or to provide it with the editorial or legal support it needs. And, as usual, it’s the writers who pay the price, whether that’s losing their jobs or feeling like it’s necessary to quit.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon"><h3>Warframe, Still A Space Ninja Game (Technically), Is Now Drawing Inspiration From World War I</h3></a><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice]]></content:encoded>

<h2>DK and Pauline's Big Day Out</h2>

<p>The game opens where most Nintendo adventures do, a world at peace and our protagonist enjoying what they do the most. For Donkey Kong, this is to head into the mines to uncover Banandium Gems, a resource that seems to do everything from filling bellies or allowing you to power up your abilities, and even power gigantic drilling machines capable of reaching the center of the Earth.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline.jpg?itok=95jo2BwU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline.jpg?itok=CmVVoeUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Void Kong, CEO of the Void company, shows up with a massive vacuuming machine to absorb Banandium energy and begin drilling to the center of the Earth, DK first gets trapped, finding Pauline as a companion along the way. DK then learns about the Banandium Root, which will grant wishes and allow Pauline to get home and Donkey Kong to experience his greatest dream… more bananas.</p>

<p>This adventure takes DK and Pauline through a variety of themed layers as they descend through the Earth's crust. You've got the staple video game worlds filled with sand, lava, and ice, but also some fun and unique twists on the idea like a Resort Layer, Racing Layer, and even a Feast Layer (which immediately made me think of <em>Super Mario Odyssey's</em> Luncheon Kingdom).</p>

<p>This narrative is surprisingly deep as you learn more about Pauline, who at this point is just a child and prone to stage fright, and her dream to return to her city after being captured by Void Kong. You also get to learn about each of the different races that live in the different layers, how they've made homes for themselves, and what troubles they have.</p>

It was so nice to see the lifeblood of classic collectathon titles like <em>DK64 </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> live and well in the colorful world of <em>DK Bananza</em>.</p>

<h2>A Big Destructible World…</h2>

<p><em>DK Bananza</em> takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Each Layer (the levels of this game) is themed with is own enemy types, common mechanics, and materials. They're also filled to the brim with collectibles.</p>

<p>The biggest change for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is that a lot of the world is destructible. As DK, you'll be able to dig down, punch through mountains, and pick up and hurl chunks as a weapon. Immediately this gameplay change felt as groundbreaking as some of the building mechanics in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. A level of technical achievement and flexibility that I was not expecting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-breakable-environment.jpg?itok=IUnhW-sZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-breakable-environment.jpg?itok=xnGLUgGa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each world felt so much more complex, and confusing at times, as you'd sense a Bananium Gem through a wall and just start digging straight towards it.</p>

<p>A downside of the environment being so breakable was the number of times I found myself tripping into a Bananium Gem only to look around and realize that I'd missed some kind of platforming or laser puzzle by reaching the banana through the wall.</p>

<p>For a lot of players this ability to shortcut a puzzle or challenge could bring its own level of reward, but it felt like I was cheated out of a gameplay experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-puzzle.jpg?itok=1K8XZEfv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-puzzle.jpg?itok=W4nA8Bqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While there were more than enough Bananium Gems I obtained by reaching them 'correctly,' I'd assume a good 20% of the bananas I encountered were ones I didn't even realize I had run into until I was already punching them.</p>

<h2>…Filled With Collectibles</h2>

<p>Each Layer is filled with the Bananium Gems collectibles, which can be used to upgrade DK's abilities, as well as fossils of varying levels that can be used to purchase and upgrade outfits that provide additional boosts to different abilities.</p>

<p>In my time playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> I collected around 500 Bananium Gems by the time I reached the ending, and I think I would have been hard pressed to find a gap of longer than five minutes where I wasn't hearing the classic "Ooh, Banana!" to signify picking up a new one. [Editor's note: Some quick math on the 15 hour play time means our reviewer found a banana about every two minutes!]</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=CjXJn30i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=6bM4AcJ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Much like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, especially when first reaching a new area, you can pan the camera and spot half a dozen objectives. By the time you reach one of those, you're normally able to whip your camera around and find another dozen.</p>

<p>While I was always progressing towards a goal marker, the path that I took to reach them probably looks like one created by a madman.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Outfit And Abilities</h2>

<p>As you pick up collectibles, you can level up DK's abilities with Bananium Gems, or purchase outfits that deal incremental increases to DK's powers, defence, or abilities.</p>

<p>The Bananuim Gem abilities were fantastic to unlock. You can punch faster, recharge your meter quicker, and take your <em>Bananza </em>abilities and turn them up to 11. The costume abilities were far more underwhelming.</p>

<p>You might move 20% faster in mud, or take 20% less damage. Each of these outfits can be upgraded further, but they're so situational unless you knew what was going to be ahead of you there likely wasn't much reason to change. Those slight increases in speed or defence could be helpful, but I feel the time to reach a shop and get changed would almost take as long as just getting through that muddy patch, especially when something like surfing can allow you to mitigate the speed loss regardless.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-feast-layer.jpg?itok=GFVilU6t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-feast-layer.jpg?itok=ZEm4rFuT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It also doesn't help that probably the most useful piece of DK attire, a tie that makes chests appear more frequently while digging, is arguably the best upgrade for the whole game and you get it in the first world. Chests appearing can net you additional gold or treasure maps that put collectibles on your map.</p>

<h2>Music To Make You Clap Your Bongos To</h2>

<p>To top off the fun gameplay and charming visuals, the soundtrack is always good to tap your toe to. Whether you're exploring a world as DK, getting to jam along to any of the <em>Bananza </em>vocal tracks, or you've warped into a <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>-inspired sidescroller and get to hear reimaginings of tracks like "Jungle Japes," you'll always be having a good time.</p>

<p>It was so important not just for the game, but also narratively to link with Pauline and her love of singing and confidence issues, that the soundtrack would be a large part of this, and <em>DK Bananza</em> absolutely nails it on every front.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-classic-level.jpg?itok=K6O5Ul0W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-classic-level.jpg?itok=C-dT2pLO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>For Donkey Kong, who hasn't had a true 3D platforming outing since <em>Donkey Kong 64, DK Bananza</em> is an incredible return to form. Capitalizing on everything that <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> did so well — unique open worlds, fun platforming challenges, and an over abundance of quick to obtain collectibles — <em>DK Bananza</em> then spins off to create its own novel genre-bending game with destructible environments and a return of DK specific features like transformations.</p>

<p>While I did feel the destructible environment robbed me of experiencing some of the platforming puzzles of the game, the destructible environment still did far more to enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>If you own a Switch 2 and you are a fan of <em>Mario Odyssey,</em> then this should be a game you pick up immediately, whether you're wanting to marathon through the story or pick it up for 10-15 minutes at a time collecting a few Bananium Gems along the way.</p>

<p>The games have vastly expanded since those nostalgic '90s days, going from only eight characters and 20 tracks, to the vast roster and open world of the latest entry.</p>
<p>There have been some constants over the years, though.

<p>Mario Kart is all about having fun with friends, and what better way to continue that fun than by bringing everyone’s favourite video game characters to life in a cosplay <em>group</em>. Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Toad are four mains that Nintendo fans have loved since the start. As well as being some of Nintendo’s oldest avatars, they appeared as four of the eight original playable characters in the SNES original (although Donkey Kong was represented by his father, Donkey Kong Jr., in the first game).</p>
<p>Australian cosplayers Marvellous_cosplay and liormora_cosplay have crafted many costumes of their favourite characters over the years. They love to play the Mario Kart games together, and so decided to put together their own versions of Luigi and Toad.</p>
<p>As well as putting together the costumes, they also assembled the karts using cardboard, paint, and plenty of hot glue. Cosplay couple astrocyte_cosplay joined the group as Mario and Donkey Kong with their own outfits and handmade karts for the group to race around their local convention.</p>
</div><div><h2>9. Toadette</h2>
<figure><a title="Toadette" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88b7cd4e0f386/toadette.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/candicebcosplay/">CandiceBCosplay</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer and photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/candicebcosplay/">CandiceBCosplay</a></p>
<p>Toadette’s first appearance was as a playable character and cute companion to the Mushroom Kingdom's better-known Toad in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a>. The pink pigtailed 'ette has appeared in multiple games from the series since her debut, finally making it as a default, dont-need-to-unlock character in Mario Kart World. As well as the kart racing games, Toadette has shown up in many <strong>Mario Party</strong> and <strong>Mario Sports</strong> games, not to mention several Mario platformers, but she got her start in a kart!</p>
<p>US cosplayer CandiceBCosplay captures Toadette’s playful side perfectly in her cosplay made to pair up with a friend’s Nintendo cosplay at a convention. Attending conventions since 2018, Candice wanted to make a character that is rare to see on the con floor. Toadette’s signature style includes her pink spotted head, which CandiceB said was her favourite part of the costume to make.</p>
</div><div><h2>8. Princess Daisy</h2>
<figure><a title="Daisy Mario Kart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e550965c51ec6/daisy-mario-kart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hahex.arw/?hl=en">hahex.arw</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer:</strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anthea_time/?hl=en">Anthea_time</a><br>
<strong>Photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hahex.arw/?hl=en">hahex.arw</a></p>
<p>Daisy is one of the three main princesses in the Mario franchise, each being a ruler of a different kingdom. Reigning over Sarasaland since 1989, Daisy has arguably been seen to have more of a tomboy and adventurous nature than Peach or Rosalina.</p>
<p>It is that difference in Daisy that has given German cosplayer Anthea a love of the character since childhood. The lack of pink resonated with Anthea, and Princess Daisy helped her to feel secure in herself and about not liking stereotypically feminine things as a child. Daisy was always Anthea’s main pick, so her racing suit had been on her list to make for a long time.</p>
<p>This cosplay was Anthea’s first attempt to make a bodysuit, and the extra touch of the racing flag really adds to it.</p>
</div><div><h2>7. Waluigi</h2>
<figure><a title="Waluigi Mario Kart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d07cdf2feac9e/waluigi-mario-kart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mallorymariephoto/?locale=es&amp;hl=en">mallorymariephoto</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quinnjob/?hl=en">Quinnjob</a><br>
<strong>Photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mallorymariephoto/?locale=es&amp;hl=en">mallorymariephoto</a></p>
<p>Waluigi is the mysterious bad-boy counterpart to Luigi that originally appeared as Wario’s double partner in the Mario Tennis games. He is quite often seen as the sidekick to Wario, with his first kart-driving appearance in Mario Kart: Double Dash.</p>
<p>Waluigi appealed to Quinnjob because of that mystery behind the slender villain. Not knowing much about him and his adventures, he recognised that Waluigi has a sizeable fan base. Quinnjob added prosthetics and makeup to the cosplay that really emphasised the character’s troublemaker side.</p>
<p>Quinnjob also does vinyl wraps professionally, so as part of the cosplay he did a custom Waluigi kart vinyl wrap to take it one step further. The next stage for Quinnjob is to get a full group of Mario Kart cosplayers together.</p>
</div><div><h2>6. Lakitu</h2>
<figure><a title="Lakitu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc4c11015e576/lakitu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosplays_from_trash/?hl=en">Cosplays_from_trash</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer and photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosplays_from_trash/?hl=en">Cosplays_from_trash</a></p>
<p>Lakitu is a classic Mario Kart character who appears throughout the series. Being the <em>real</em> MVP of the games, Lakitu not only tells everyone when they can go, but also plops you back on track when you've gone off course. This cloud-riding Koopa has appeared in every Mario Kart game since the start, and even gets behind the wheel himself in the more recent entries.</p>
<p>Cosplay_from_Trash hates waste and uses his platform to champion creativity, sustainability, and community in-person and online. He has had an appreciation of Lakitu since MK64 and thought it would be an easy cosplay, but found making a cloud that stays around your waist and a backpack in the shape of a shell more difficult than expected.</p>
<p>He made the backpack base from a bucket, and the cloud base from elastic and a tightly bunched comforter. His favourite part of the cosplay is the cloud batting from the inside of the comforter.</p>

            <p>The director behind ICO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> believes the days of creating new and innovative gameplay mechanics "has already passed".</p>
<p>In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for "not relying on unique gameplay mechanics".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">Denfaminicogamer</a>, Ueda said he called up Takahashi when To a T was revealed, wanting to know if the unusual game involved any new or complicated mechanics to play. When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: "That's great!"</p>

<p>Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked "ah, these are the words of a professional", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-praises-katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-for-not-being-mechanics-based-the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"While I don’t know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed," Ueda said. "I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.</p>
<p>"Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. "Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition."</p>
<p>Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. "Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I’ve had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try</a>.</p>
<p>"As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it’s doing. What's the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed-says-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ready or Not, the violent and controversial shooter from Void Interactive, has topped one million sales on console in just four days.</p>
<p>Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7352240956261216257/">LinkedIn</a>, Void's CEO Julio Rodriguez said he was "incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together", saying he didn't take the milestone "for granted".</p>

<p>"When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach one million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days," Rodriguez wrote. "I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together. It’s a huge moment - and one we don’t take for granted.</p>
<p>"Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience.</p>
<p>"To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project - thank you."</p>
<p>It's not been a trouble-free rollout, however. When Void Interactive confirmed earlier this month that the console port needed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release">changes "as absolutely required by our first party partners",</a> including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence", some in the game's community hit back with a review-bomb campaign which has seen its "mostly positive" rating fall to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>The negative Steam reviews cited "content censorship", despite Void Interactive's attempts to to quell these concerns, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-developer-seeks-to-alleviate-censorship-concerns-following-community-outcry">stating it had seen "misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes"</a>.</p>
<p>The shooter is currently sitting on a 4 out of 5 score on the Xbox storefront, an average 4.69 on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access, but in a statement on Twitter shortly after its debut, Void <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-hits-1m-console-sales-in-4-days-despite-censorship-claims-from-its-pc-players]]></content:encoded>

Joined by an AI companion and his dim-witted robot assistant Ody-6, Alex sets off on a journey where every fight is a desperate battle against the unknown—and doom itself. The ship is a war zone. You may be outnumbered, but you are not outmatched.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Moros Protocol</em> is a relentless, fast-paced shooter where survival means adapting – or being consumed. To thrive against the monstrous hordes, players will need to dynamically adapt their loadout and strategy with each run.</p><p>Looking for a frantic, high-mobility approach to your enemies? Fill up your loadout with SMGs or pistols, augmented for speed and increased damage while moving—perfect for laying down a barrage of bullets on the go. Or for a slower, more methodical approach, put together a sniping build that focuses on powerful, precise shots that can take down enemies in a single hit.</p><p>Whichever you choose, your skills will grow during each run through thanks to <em>Moros Protocol</em>’s evolving combat system. Throughout your run you will find augments tailored to improve your skills in a specific playstyle. Find an augment that boosts your run and gun capabilities? Change up your loadout for a shotgun and let it rip!</p><p>Plot your own route through each run, with every branching path offering different risks. Do you want to play it safe, or face greater danger in pursuit of even greater rewards? Are you looking for a guaranteed new weapon, or a vendor to upgrade your skills? Choose wisely as you make your way towards your goal.</p><p>Beware, as death is around every corner in <em>Moros Protocol</em>—but death is not the end! Upgrade your abilities after each death before rejoining the battle as a better, more fearsome killing machine.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,728 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Combat</strong> – Inspired by classic shooters, Moros Protocol combines fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [2,880 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> with adaptability and customization.
