			<p>Today, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II developer/publisher combo Warhorse Studios and PLAION have unveiled the post-launch roadmap for the upcoming first-person roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-release-date-bumped-forward-by-a-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set for February 4</a>, is just the beginning of the players' new journey with Henry of Skalitz. Throughout 2025, the developers plan to constantly release updates that include various improvements and additions.</p>
<p>The roadmap kicks off this Spring with the introduction of several free enhancements, such as a Barbers feature to customize your looks, a Hardcore Mode for those seeking a harsher challenge, and Horse Racing, where you can hone your mounted skills and uncover hidden surprises.</p>
<p>In the Summer, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will receive its first premium DLC, called Brushes with Death. In this new quest, Henry must aid an enigmatic artist with a shadowy past. He'll have to face perilous encounters to unravel a web of dangerous plots.</p>

<p>In the Fall season, the Legacy of the Forge DLC will dig into Henry's roots by exploring the legacy of Martin, his adoptive father. Henry will work to restore a once-famous forge and test his blacksmithing skills while uncovering forgotten stories from the past.</p>
<p>In the Winter season, the third and final premium DLC, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released. Players must enter Sedlec Monastery, where intrigue is said to run deep. Henry is tasked with a secret mission and must navigate the complex dynamics of the area, uncovering hidden truths and navigating a maze of conflicting interests.</p>

<p>The three premium DLCs are included for those who purchase the more expensive versions of the game: either Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition (which is priced $20 higher than the Standard Edition and comes with the Season Pass, the Shields of Seasons Passing that lets players customize their shields with one of four unique designs, and the full costume Gallant Huntsman’s Kit), or the Collector's Edition that adds the following physical goods for a price of $199:</p>
<ul>
<li>a statue of Henry and his trusty steed, Pebbles</li>
<li>the exclusive cloth map Alleys of Kuttenberg</li>
<li>the enamel pin set Coats of Valor</li>
<li>the iconic Letter of Hope - which Sir Hans Capon was entrusted with</li>
<li>and the King’s Rebels collectible cards set</li>
</ul>

			<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Shooter Games of 2024 list</a>, we wrote that the genre had bested 2023's output thanks to new releases like Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Marvel Rivals. Well, now that we look ahead at what's coming in 2025, we can already tell this one's going to be even better - and it might even dwarf prior years if certain <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored launches</a> actually happen. That said, we'll stick to what's been confirmed by publishers to be scheduled for this year. It's already a great-looking list, anyway.</p>

<h2><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/sniper-elite-resistance.jpg"></a></h2>
<h2>Sniper Elite: Resistance (January 30)</h2>
<p>The year for shooter games begins with the return of Rebellion's Sniper Elite tactical shooter franchise, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sniper-elite-resistance-gets-january-30-2025-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is out in less than ten days</a>. This time, players will find Harry Hawker, who was available for selection in the cooperative modes of the three previous installments, as the lead character. An agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) division, Hawker discovers the existence of a new wonder weapon, reportedly so powerful that it would practically guarantee the Nazis' victory in the war. He'll have to work with the French Resistance in 1944 Vichy France (the events running in parallel to those seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-5-jager-beware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite 5</a>) to locate and destroy the weapon before it can ever be used.</p>
<p>Sniper Elite: Resistance is adding a new Propaganda Mode that is unlocked by discovering hidden Propaganda posters. In this mode, you get to play as a Resistance fighter in quick-fire challenges against the clock. The campaign is also fully playable in co-op, and the fan-favorite, Souls-like inspired <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/sniper-elite-5-how-axis-invasion-works-and-how-to-kill-your-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axis Invasion</a> returns as well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/245e7a61-0c9b-45f7-9dd2-481187b3641e.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>DOOM: The Dark Ages (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>Following the successful releases of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016's DOOM</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020's DOOM Eternal</a>, it's no wonder that The Dark Ages may be topping the personal most anticipated shooter games chart of many genre fans. id Software has successfully recaptured and reimagined what made the franchise great in the first place, and we can't wait to see how this new evolution plays out.</p>
<p>For now, all we know is that this is effectively a prequel that will show how the legend of the DOOM Slayer started. The developers have described it as a 'cinematic origin story' where the protagonist will become the last hope of a medieval fantasy-inspired kingdom against the onslaught of Hellish forces.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/BL4-The-Game-Awards.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Borderlands 4 (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>The fifth (despite the title) mainline installment in the cooperative looter shooter series by Gearbox Software was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Gamescom 2024 with much fanfare. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-4-story-trailer-debuts-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saw it again</a> at The Game Awards 2024, where Gearbox debuted a story trailer introducing the new big bad called The Timekeeper. According to the press brief, a world-altering catastrophe threatens his perfect order and unleashes chaos on Kairos, the planet Borderlands 4 is set on, which the developers described as the most dangerous planet yet in the series.</p>
<p>The main features revealed so far include deeper, more diverse skill trees; an expanded loot hunt;&nbsp; the ability to travel seamlessly between zones; a dynamic world filled with events and discoverable side content; new traversal mechanics available for both exploration and combat; and even a vehicle that can be summoned almost anywhere on Kairos.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ARC_Raiders_A_KeyArt_Main_01_Horizontal_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>ARC Raiders (TBA 2025)</h2>
<p>Swedish studio Embark may have launched The Finals as their first game, but that was not the first project they announced. That label goes to ARC Raiders, which evolved over the years from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original plan of a PvE co-op shooter</a> to its new form as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PvPvE extraction shooter</a>. We finally got a gameplay trailer of the overhauled game at Geoff Keighley's TGA 2024, and to go with it, Embark shared a thorough overview of the mechanics and features.</p>
<p>In ARC Raiders, players will scavenge the lethal surface in a post-apocalyptic future for supplies and materials, facing enemy ARC machines and other players. As with any extraction game, to keep their loot, players must reach extraction points, risking ambushes to extract vital crafting materials or items to sell to NPC vendors for in-game currency. Players will have their own workshop to craft new equipment, such as advanced weapon mods or unique gadgets, and can also customize their playstyle with a skill tree. NPC merchants will also offer quests to complete on the surface.</p>

<h2>Battlefield 6 (Fall 2025)</h2>
<p>Yes, last but certainly not least, we have the return of Battlefield. After what happened with Battlefield V and 2042, DICE cannot afford to miss again. To that end, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has put Respawn's Vince Zampella in charge of the franchise</a>, and the veteran game designer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the new game will take place in a modern setting. We don't really know many details about Battlefield 6 other than the goal to deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most realistic and exciting destruction ever seen in a game</a> and the fact that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four development studios busy working on it</a>: DICE (primarily focused on multiplayer), Criterion (both single player and multiplayer), Motive (they're crafting the new campaign), and Ripple Effect (working on a new Battlefield experience, possibly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored free-to-play Battle Royale mode</a>). We should get a lot more official info in the coming months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-we-learned-about-magic-gathering-aetherdrift<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic The Gathering</em> is off to the races with the new expansion, <em>Aetherdrift</em>, using the setting of an interplanar Grand Prix to bring together well-known characters and refresh lore on some less-seen planes and their inhabitants. <em>Magic The Gathering Aetherdrift</em> releases physically on February 14th.</p>

<p>Before it releases we got to sit down with members of the team behind <em>Aetherdrift </em>including Max McCall – Executive Producer, Miguel Lopez&nbsp; – Worldbuilding Lead, Sarah Wassel&nbsp; – Senior Art Director, and Lisa Hanson – Print Innovation Director. Through this call, we were treated to information about some of the different teams that would be competing in the Grand Prix, some unique mechanics to the set, and what kinds of new card treatments we'd be seeing.</p>

<h2>Welcome To The Ghirapur Grand Prix!</h2>

<p>There are 10 different racing teams from across the different planes that are being gathered to compete in the Ghirapur Grand Prix. Miguel Lopez took some time to explain to us just what that is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Aetherdrift </em>focuses on an edition of a multi-day multi-planar combat stage race called the Ghirapur Grand Prix. This is a race put on by the plane of Avishkar. It's intended to be, on the one, a thrilling spectacle that is inspiring to watch and a statement to the multiverse of the new Avishkari government's ability to manage and coordinate multi-planar logistics."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first Grand Prix has already happened off-screen, it's more chaotic and a test for the technology, and the second Grand Prix is the one that is the setting of <em>Aetherdrift</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/453115_muraganda_raceway_brian_valeza.jpg?itok=0i1UztHo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/453115_muraganda_raceway_brian_valeza.jpg?itok=rMKitX8x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The untamed raceway of Muraganda</figcaption></figure><p>For the Avishkar this isn't just a chance to show off their power but also to connect with their neighboring planes to spread their "currency, food, language, and establish embassies."</p>

<p>Other planes involved in the Grand Prix include Amonket and Muraganda. While it will be a return to Amonket, slowly rebuilding itself after the Phyrexian Invasion, it will be the first deep dive into Muraganda "a place where magic and life is raw and young."</p>

<p>But what is the prize for such an impressive tournament? The Aetherspark, a Planeswalker spark suspended in a super-cooled aether solution.</p>

<h2>The Mechanics Of Racing</h2>

<p>The key mechanic that <em>Aetherdrift </em>is introducing is Speed. At the start of the game you'll start with no speed, by playing a card that has the <em>Start your engines!</em> Trait your speed will become 1.</p>

<p>You can then gain one speed per turn by causing your opponent to lose life. If you <em>Start your engines!</em>&nbsp;and then <em>Lightning Bolt</em> will get you to Speed 2, but another <em>Lightning Bolt</em> won't get you to Speed 3 on the same turn. Once you've reached Speed 4 you'll be at max speed and can't increase it any further.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-vnwxt-and-speed.jpg?itok=lOnz_7ay 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-vnwxt-and-speed.jpg?itok=yLJk5AVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Use Speed to start your engines and use powerful abilities</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the cards that have the <em>Start your engines!</em> Trait also have a Trait that relates to an additional effect once max speed has been reached. An example given was <em>Vnwxt, Verbose Host</em> will let you draw two cards when you would normally only be able to draw one.</p>

<p>Another mechanic being introduced is <em>Exhaust</em>. This is a one-shot mechanic that does something powerful, that the player needs to know when to use to get the most effectiveness out of it. <em>Exhaust </em>can only be used once by a card, so if you see a card like <em>Loot, The Pathfinder</em> who has three powerful <em>Exhaust </em>abilities you'll only get to use one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-loot-and-exhaust.jpg?itok=aXAcHfdW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-aetherdrift-loot-and-exhaust.jpg?itok=vBFBbAQu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Exhaust is powerful, but you need to know the right time to use it</figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, if a card has been returned to your hand and played again the <em>Exhaust </em>gets refreshed. This allows for some tricky wants to be able to refresh that and use these powerful abilities again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In general, you can only activate Exhaust abilities once per game… unless you're doing shenanigans" - Max McCall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last key mechanic is <em>Saddle,</em> returning from Thunder Junction. This allows Mount cards to be saddled by other creatures you control. Some of the Mounts that appear in this set aren't just mechanical vehicles but also beasts such as beast mounts. When cards are Saddled normally something extra-good happens.</p>

<h2>The Ten Teams Of The Ghirapur Grand Prix</h2>

<p>There are ten teams from across the planes that are competing in the Ghirapur Grand Prix. Each team doesn't just represent a plane or group but consists of two colors, this will help players find the right team for their playstyle. These teams are:</p>

<ol><li aria-level="1"><strong>Guidelight Voyagers (White / Blue) -</strong> A returning team that was accidentally formed during the first Grand Prix who have been invited back.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Speed Demons (Blue / Black)</strong> <strong>-</strong> This is a crew led by Winter and The Speed Demon, they have a chance for freedom by Valgavoth if they manage to obtain the Aether Spark.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>The Endriders (Black / Red) - </strong>Survivors from Gastal, a harsh environment of natural disaster and road warriors (think Mad Max). Now at Ghurapur they're wanting to obtain the Aetherspark to bring it unlimited water.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Goblin Rocketeers (Red / Green) -</strong> This team is rocket scientists who have applied their knowledge to cars and other vehicles. Their goal is to break the velocity limit to escape from their plane and worship the BOOSTGOD. (We were specifically told that that's in all capital letters)</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Alacrian Quickbeasts (Green / White) -</strong> These racers ride beasts instead of vehicles and are interested in the Grand Prix based purely out of their enjoyment of competition.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>The Champions of Amonkhet (White / Black) - </strong>A team of living and undead representatives from Amonkhet led by Basri and Zahur.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>The Speedbrood (Black / Green) -</strong> A group of insectoid racers who are trying to grow their life into becoming velocity and speed itself.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Aether Rangers (Green / Blue) -</strong> The team native to Avashkar equipped with fast vehicles that slightly hover giving them an edge over any terrain.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Chordatan Keelhaulers (Blue / Red) -</strong> Fishfolk who are new to the Grand Prix but who have settled in Avashkar.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Cloudspire Racing Team (Red / White) - </strong>Racers from Kylum that specialize in high speed and low drag racing allowing them to be very quick. This team also won the previous year's Grand Prix.</li>

<p>Full Art Lands will show the different courses that the teams will be racing on from a first-person perspective of some of the drivers. You'll get to see sand-covered raceways, winding jungle tracks, and even scenes of vehicles racing down riverways.</p>

Each of these cards are meant to highlight a driver and their vehicle, working as a sort of glamour-shot showing off what is meant to be an inspirational scene.</p>

<p>Wassell likened these treatments to something you might see a full page ad for in a magazine, or the kind of poster that a fan of the team or driver would want.</p>

<p>There are two Commander Decks that will be released with <em>Aetherdrift</em>. One led by Temmet, Eternal Might, which will be a White/Blue/Black deck. This Commander Deck will not only have Temmet but also Hashaton, Scarab's Fist and will focus on creating zombies and building up to one big turn where you flood your enemy with damage.</p>

<p>The second Commander Deck is Living Energy, a Green/Blue/Red deck, that features <em>Saheeli, Radiant Creator </em>and <em>Pia Nalaar, Chief Mechanic</em> as Commanders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher PlayStack and developer LocalThunk have announced that smash hit indie card roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has passed yet another major sales milestone, further solidifying the game's status as a runaway success.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media platform X, the two studios reveal that&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has crossed the five million sales mark, which puts it about on par with Nexon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">"indie" hit&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver</em></a>&nbsp;or Focus and Saber's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-player-count-5m" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em></a>.</p>

<p>The studios thank everyone who's played&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>"after seeing it at The Game Awards", where it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2024-nominees-announced" rel="nofollow">nominated for</a> (and eventually won) the Best Indie Game prize. Rather charmingly, the studios then recommend trying to make playing indie games "a habit", as "there's some amazing stuff out there".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-sales-5m-game.jpg?itok=gTL0GZej 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-sales-5m-game.jpg?itok=wQX0ITQC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has broken yet another sales barrier.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been an excellent year for&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, all things considered. The game launched in February 2024 and quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million" rel="nofollow">crossed the half-million sales mark</a>, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">break a million sales</a> less than two weeks after that milestone.</p>

<p>In August last year,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon" rel="nofollow">hit two million sales</a>, and in December of the same year, Playstack and LocalThunk announced the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m" rel="nofollow">had reached 3.5 million</a>, which means it's managed to rack up another 1.5 million in the intervening weeks.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to come this far without either playing or hearing about&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(and you're not alone if you're in the first camp, because I haven't either), it's a poker roguelike in which the goal is to rack up points by utilizing "adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos".</p>




<p>While it bases itself on poker,&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s appeal lies in its array of powerful joker cards, which provide a range of bonuses. Stacking these bonuses up correctly is the key to building your score and breaking through to the next round.</p>

            <p>Many moons ago in the Before Times, a mysterious cataclysm scattered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mike-laidlaw-leaves-bioware">a number</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-lead-casey-hudson-returns-to-bioware-as-general-manager">of</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/david-gaider-bioware-dragon-age">seasoned BioWare developers</a> across the face of heaven. The developers fell upon the mortal planes like comets. Where each landed, a game development studio took root. Inflexion Games. Summerfall Studios. Humanoid Origin. Worlds Untold. Archetype Entertainment.</p>
<p>Summerfall appear to be <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/summerfall-studios-on-life-after-stray-gods">prospering</a>, but many of the studios founded by former BioWare devs have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-cant-outfly-the-stark-realities-of-the-industry-as-creators-inflexion-close-uk-office-and-lay-people-off">experienced hard times</a>. In particular, Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold have respectively <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-director-cancels-his-next-sci-fi-game-as-his-studio-closes-before-it-is-fully-revealed">closed</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">"paused operations"</a> without releasing a single game. I'm raising a tentatively congratulatory glass, then, to Yellow Brick Games, a studio founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> director Mike Laidlaw. The company's debut game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> will release on 28th January, and there's now a PC demo.</p><!--more-->

<p>I've yet to play the demo - it's just gone live, and I wanted to bang this out before the end of the working day - but I quite like the looks of Eternal Strands, emphasis on the "quite". It's a bright and breezy, hub-based fantasy action game in which you play a brawny battlemage who can kindle self-propagating wildfires, build ice bridges, and toss around breakable boulders with telekinesis. You're a Dragon Age Jedi, basically, with a pinch of Shadow Of The Colossus and ooh, Zelda's free-climbing in the bargain.
</p><p>
All those obvious parallels may suggest a project with no real identity of its own. It doesn't help that the visual direction feels a bit soulless - too clean and chunky and rounded for my liking. But I am willing to forgive all that if Eternal Strands succeeds at fulfilling what I hope is its secret agenda of capturing the spirit of mid-tier noughties action games with gimmicky real-time physics systems. Games like The Force Unleashed and Psi-Ops. Where my Psi-Ops fans at? I can sense the restless spirit of Midway in how Eternal Strands lets you freeze a golem's feet to the floor, then smash it over the head with the nearest tree.
</p>
<p>
The demo gives you two areas of the game's world, aka the Enclave, not including a basecamp area that populates with quest-giving NPCs and facilities in the course of the campaign. The demo includes the crafting system with three base weapon types - sword and shield, bows, and two-handed weapons, together with a selection of magic spells. It's apparently playable on Steam Deck but not yet verified, and your demo progress will carry over to the full game.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/interview-g2a-ceo-gaming-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-g2a%E2%80%99s-ceo-is-optimistic-about-gaming-in-2025-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98the-reset-button-has-been-hit%E2%80%99.1087899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/interview-g2a-ceo-gaming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The last couple of years in the games industry have been rocky, to say the least. From thousands of layoffs to studio closures and from the cancellation of dozens of projects to controversies left, right, and centre, it has been a tumultuous time for gamers and industry workers worldwide.</p>



<p>One organisation that’s thinking positively about the immediate future is G2A, the <strong>world’s largest marketplace for digital gaming products</strong>. Recently, I had the opportunity to catch up again with the company’s CEO and Co-founder, Bartosz Skwarczek, to talk about his optimism for the year ahead.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-gearing-up-for-a-breakthrough">‘Gearing Up For a Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>Following the struggles of the last 24 months or so, I was eager to see what Bartosz thought about the state of play for the games industry in 2025. This could be one of the most lucrative years on record, with some new hardware and <strong>massive </strong>titles set to hit the shelves.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>After the challenges of the past few years, 2025 holds significant growth potential, with innovation driving us forward. <strong>The reset button has been hit</strong>, and the industry is <strong>gearing up for a breakthrough</strong>. I believe we’re about to see a rebound in the gaming industry. </em></p>



<p><em>With exciting new hardware like the Nintendo Switch 2, game releases such as Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, Monster Hunter Wilds, Last Sentinel, and the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI on the horizon, the gaming sector is on the brink of a major breakthrough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>One area that’s expected to shine and continue to grow over the next twelve months is <strong>AI in gaming</strong>. It’s no big secret that plenty of developers have integrated AI-driven processes and protocols into their operating models, but Bartosz believes this is only the beginning.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>While there is much anticipation for upcoming game releases, an equally significant development is <strong>the growing integration of AI</strong> in game creation. A recent report from CVL Economics highlights that the gaming industry has embraced generative AI more extensively than other creative sectors, such as television, film, or music.</em></p>



<p><em>This technology offers transformative opportunities, enabling faster asset creation, dynamic content and story generation, and improved financial stability for developers. However, <strong>it also presents challenges</strong>, particularly concerning employees’ roles in the gaming industry, as automation reshapes traditional workflows and raises questions about the future of creative jobs. Balancing innovation with workforce sustainability will be key as the industry evolves.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was also keen to get Bartosz’s thoughts about the layoffs that have been commonplace and widespread across the industry over the last couple of years. It feels as though nobody is safe these days, and the impact that these vast waves of redundancies have had on the wider industry has marred the face of the market.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The layoffs we’ve seen <strong>have left a sense of uncertainty</strong> that won’t fade overnight—and while confidence may take time to rebuild, this reset is creating opportunities to rethink how we develop, play, and connect through games.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you agree with Bartosz Skwarczek’s thoughts, or do you have something different on your mind? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

However, one thing that Nintendo has been suspiciously quiet about is the technical prowess of its new handheld. While we have clear upgrades like new Joy-Cons, a redesigned kickstand, and a larger form factor, we still have no official word on just how powerful the Switch 2 is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does the brief glimpse at Mario Kart 9 in the reveal video provide clues? In <a href="https://youtu.be/4I6iydbep2M?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new YouTube video</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/indie-developer-behind-the-last-wii-u-and-3ds-games-says-switch-2-mario-kart-textures-are-extremely-telling-that-this-system-is-significantly-more-powerful-than-the-switch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar</u></a>), indie developer Jerrel Dulay of Sungrand Studios said that he expects the Switch 2 to be much more powerful than the original console. Dulay is credited as being one of the last developers to work on titles for the Wii U and 3DS, and is intimately familiar with Nintendo hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart 9 - First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay explained that the new Mario Kart footage in the Switch 2 trailer could give us a glimpse at exactly what the Switch 2 may be capable of. He first noted the presence of “physically-based shaders” on cars and other textures. These shaders can be applied to objects and can be affected by reflections, lighting, or other effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In late 2023, Digital Foundry published an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-inside-nvidias-latest-hardware-for-nintendo-what-is-the-t239-processor" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>extensive report</u></a> on the Switch 2’s new hardware, which allegedly includes the Nvidia T239 ARM mobile chip. The T239 chip reportedly inside the Switch 2 is projected to have 1536 CUDA Cores (these cores can process shaders), 40% fewer than the desktop variant of the RTX 3050 GPU, which is on the same 8nm Nvidia Ampere architecture. This was corroborated by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Switch 2’s motherboard leaks</u></a>, which showed a potential 8nm chip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Nintendo Switch’s Tegra X1 chip possessed just 256 CUDA cores, marking a 500% increase in pure availability of CUDA core count alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Every single piece of geometry I see here is using physically-based rendering for the shaders,” Dulay explained. He noted that using complex shaders on the original Nintendo Switch was demanding for the hardware, and using many of them could cause framerates to plummet. Dulay added that the Mario Kart footage also shows off additional material reflections from the ground, his face, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay pointed to the high-resolution ground textures used throughout the footage, saying: “ground textures, because they take up so much space, they are something that will have to be high-resolution." He went on to explain how high-resolution textures also demand available RAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Nintendo Switch has just 4GB of RAM to run games and its OS, whereas the Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to have 12GB of RAM. The Switch 2 motherboard leak showed off two SK Hynix LPDDR5 modules, which could offer up to 12GB of RAM, with each chip offering 6GB each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We currently don’t know the specific speed of the RAM modules, which could offer significant increases in efficiency compared to the original Switch’s 1600MHz while docked. A similar part from RAM manufacturer SK Hynix can run at speeds up to 7500MHz, increasing the amount of available bandwidth for the RAM pool significantly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that things such as texture loading could be much faster, allowing for the new Mario Kart to use high-resolution textures. “It’s not that they’re just high-resolution, but there’s a high number of unique textures being used," Dulay added. The potential higher memory transfer rate paired with the pure RAM storage increase could lead to significantly prettier Switch 2 titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay further stated that the Mario Kart teaser also includes “true volumetric lighting," which is taxing for any GPU to run. “It takes into account the distance, the height, you can have certain areas be more dense, you can have light rays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dulay, the Switch 2’s display of volumetric lighting in the new Mario Kart title is indicative of just how powerful the Switch 2 could be: “it tells me that the Switch 2 is significantly more powerful, because they want these games running at 60 frames a second."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is a massive deal, this is the most important part of the reveal trailer to me,” Dulay further commented, explaining that implementing volumetric lighting was a significant challenge for developers on the original Nintendo Switch. He also noted the presence of shadows at far distances in the trailer. “Shadows are quite expensive to calculate and draw," he said, as developers on the original Switch needed to cull the level of detail distances at which shadows were drawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with the compounding of the Switch 2’s power through the use of its CUDA cores, RAM capacity, and speed, it seems like those difficulties have been significantly reduced thanks to the new console’s raw power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dulay pointed out how the number of textures onscreen, high poly-count characters, in addition to the real-time cloth physics on the flagpoles demonstrate just how much of a leap in power the Switch 2 will be for developers used to making games on Nintendo’s 2017 console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we wait for more details and footage from the Nintendo Switch 2, Dulay’s video offers a unique insight into what you should expect in terms of graphical power from the new Nintendo console. Nintendo is scheduled to show off more about Switch 2 in a dedicated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announced-for-april"><u>Direct in April</u></a>.

			<p>Unknown 9: Awakening got a<a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-gets-new-gameplay-footage/"> lot of buzz</a> before its release, but then it seemed that there was no news or rumblings about it after the game was released. There was just silence. As a result of the game not performing to Reflector Entertainment's expectations, the company has now been hit with layoffs. Unknown 9: Awakening was the first game that was going to be in a series of action-adventure games with an expansive multimedia universe surrounding it. This includes a podcast audio drama, novels, and even comic books. Whether this will happen now is uncertain. It's been posted on the official Reflector Entertainment website that 18% of the workforce has been laid off. However, the post announcing this has now been deleted from the Reflector website.</p>
<p>It's claimed that the layoffs are due to the studio entering a new phase of development, and those who were laid off were not "assigned to roles that our active projects require." To support those impacted by the layoffs, the company has said that they will be supporting them by providing severance packages, "as well as access to medical, emotional, and career planning support."</p>
<p>Considering we aren't out of the first month of the year yet, there have already been a stark number of layoffs, which is what everyone was hoping to see less of this year. There have been approximately 295 people laid off in the gaming industry this year thus far, according to the <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gaming layoffs website</a> that tracks every known instance of layoffs.</p>
<p>At the moment it's not certain what areas of the company were impacted by the layoffs, but it's reported that it was employees from QA, marketing, art, and narrative. This includes employees like Narrative and Game Designer Anna Karina Bermudez as well as Brand Manager Manou Deneuvel, who have posted on LinkedIn about their new search for employment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hervehoerdt/?originalSubdomain=fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chief Content Officer Herve Hoerdt</a> has also confirmed on LinkedIn that they have canceled a new project that was in the conceptualization phase. It's been said that they scrapped the project as it wouldn't be sustainable for the future of the studio, which has led to redundancies.</p>
<p>Hoerdt also goes on to state that the game's cancelation comes off the back of the "failure" of the company's "ambitious and courageous first project," which was Unknown 9: Awakening. While the specific numbers haven't been stated, he says that the game's sales performance "didn't come near the company expectations."</p>

As such, Paramount has done another marketing push for the movie by releasing concept art of some of the film’s most pivotal moments. The images include what seem to be previous iterations of the movie’s post-credits scene, which was exciting, but a bit confusing. While the moment depicted in the art doesn’t appear in the final film, it still may nevertheless clear up one thing about the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-4-post-credits-amy-rose-metal-shadow-1851726285">post-credits scene</a></span> fans have been wondering about since the movie premiered in December.

Most of the moments shown in these (gorgeous) pieces made their way into the final film, such as Sonic and Shadow fighting as their super forms in space, Ivo and Gerald Robotnik duking it out inside the Eclipse Cannon, and Sonic’s family roasting marshmallows before G.U.N. comes to ask for their help stopping Shadow. But a few of them show scenes that were either cut from the film, or heavily altered for it. This includes two pieces that depict the characters introduced in the post-credits scene: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-amy-reverse-sonamy-relationship-1851730058">Amy Rose</a></span> and Metal Sonic.</p><figure id="" data-id="60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-recommend-id="image://60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-recommend-id="image://60f44164e54cb5e92651aa073183f57c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Amy is shown standing on top of a destroyed robot as Sonic is laying down in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The art of Amy closely resembles her introduction in the final movie. She’s shown wielding her hammer and taking down what looks like one of Eggman’s giant robots, seemingly saving Sonic from the threat. This is basically how she appears in the movie, except instead of taking down a giant, mostly non-descript robot, she saves Sonic from a squad of his metal doppelgangers. The art of Metal Sonic, however, is unlike anything seen in the final film. We see the robot standing guard next to Eggman, who is adorned in an extravagant red-and-gold robe and wielding a golden staff. In the background, we can see that the world behind him appears to have been desecrated, implying that Eggman and Metal Sonic have conquered it.</p><p>Notably, this image may clear up a question fans have had about Metal Sonic’s origins since <em>Sonic 3 </em>premiered. Metal Sonic does seem to have been created by Eggman, but perhaps not the one we’ve followed for three movies. Fans have been speculating that <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4 </em>may take place in a far-flung future, and that Sonic may have broken the time barrier at the end of the third movie. Amy’s hooded vigilante outfit, seen in the post-credits scene, is evocative of a hero who is on the run from some kind of police-state-level force. There’s also the possibility that Sonic, rather than moving forward in time, may have instead shifted to an alternate timeline in which Eggman is still alive and perhaps didn’t have the change of heart shown at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-recommend-id="image://e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-recommend-id="image://e42752224e2f6ae29ed0b6e110b11e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1320" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eggman stands next to Metal Sonic while wearing a long red-and-gold robe and holding a golden staff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s also possible this concept art tells us nothing about the movie that’s coming and is instead just a scrapped idea the team was toying with. But at the very least, this is the most concrete clue we’ve been given about Metal Sonic’s origins in the movies. It looks like he’s tied to Eggman in some way, even if the good doctor is supposedly gone. We’ll know more as we get closer to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-4-sequel-confirmed-paramount-2027-sega-release-1851725410"><em>Sonic 4</em>’s release in 2027</a></span>, but for now, we have more to speculate on than that incredibly vague post-credits scene.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The developers behind Balatro have announced that the game has sold an impressive 5 million units to date.</p>



<p>The announcement came from the games X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1881728578712474019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">account</a>, where it was said that the game had sold 5 million units. To put that in perspective, at its $15 price tag, the game has generated roughly $75 million in-game sales alone. </p>



<p>Taking to X, the developers behind Balatro, LocalThunk, said, “The last few weeks have been pretty wild. To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at</p>



<p>@thegameawards, we hope you’re having an amazing time with it! If this is your first time picking up an indie title, try to make it a habit!”</p>



<p>LocalThunk announced that the game had sold 3.5 million units before The Game Awards, a 1.5 million increase since it won at the event.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/"><strong>RELATED – Balatro Trophy Guide—All Achievements &amp; Trophies<br></strong></a><br>Balatro has quickly become one of the best Indie games of not only the year, but arguably of all time and has been praised immensely due to its art style and fantastic gameplay loop.</p>



<p>Its success hasn’t been without problems, though. In December 2024, Balatro received an 18+ rating from PEGI because of “links to gambling”. Following the news, LocalThunk took to X to say, “maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC” – A honestly hilarious dig to the rating board.</p>

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong fans are so desperate for any bit of information about the game that they've started asking whether it was abandoned.

<p>Updates regarding its development have been rare since it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-been-delayed/1100-6513963/" data-ref-id="1100-6513963">delayed from its original 2023 release window</a>.

            <p>
The studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">bold Assassin's Creed-meets-Tomb Raider transmedia attempt Unknown 9</a> has signalled an end to the franchise, following the poor performance of last year's initial video game.
</p>
<p>
Unknown 9: Awakening, a generic globe-trotting adventure starring The Witcher TV series' Anya Chalotra, "didn't come near the company's expectations," the boss of developer Reflector Entertainment Herve Hoerdt said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/">statement</a> today, "and didn't warrant any further exploration in this universe". Ouch.
</p>
<p>
One of the Reflector's two future projects - presumably another Unknown 9 game which had been in the "conceptualisation phase" - has now been cancelled, Hoerdt added. This therefore means the studio was "terminating this development line".

<p>
"This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio's ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe," Hoerdt continued. 
</p>
<p>
Reflector had ambitious plans for Unknown 9 as an ongoing series, supported by podcasts, comics, novels, and several web series. While many of these have now been released, some ahead of Awakening itself, following a lengthy delay to the video game, none appear to have made any real impression.
</p>
<p>
Reflector will now go through a second round of redundancies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-developers-report-layoffs">previous job losses reported back in November 2024</a>, as the company shrinks to a "single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future". 
</p>
<p>

			<p>The Trump tariffs on imports from Mexico could have a strong impact on the video games market in the United States and lead to fewer disc-based releases and higher prices for both physical and digital games, according to an analyst.</p>
<p>Speaking on Bluesky, Circana Executive Director and Video Game Industry Analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella</a> highlighted how 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico could lead to a "sharp downtick" in the number of physical releases in the United States, as much of the production infrastructure is located in Mexico. If they do get made, prices could rise for both physical and digital games, as digital games' MSRPs would be increased to remain at price parity with physical releases. No matter what happens precisely, however, Mat Piscatella doesn't see anything good coming for the physical video game market in the near future.</p>

<p lang="en">Alright, well, video games.</p>
<p>With 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico on the way, I can see a sharp downtick in the number of disc-based games that get released physically in the US, as much of that production infrastructure is in Mexico.</p>
<p>If they do get made, I expect higher prices both phys &amp; dig.</p>

<p lang="en">I would, were this to happen, anticipate digital MSRPs to increase to remain at price parity with physical, but who knows.</p>
<p>In any case, none of this is good for the physical video game market.</p>

<p>The analyst remarks that moving the production of retail releases to the US to avoid being impacted by the Trump tariffs is definitely possible with significant investment. However, this significant investment is unlikely to come, as annual US physical video game software spending is half what it was in 2021 and is declining rapidly. At the same time, moving production to the US wouldn't help when it comes to cost, so there aren't a lot of incentives to move production to the United States.</p>

<p lang="en">'Can't that production just be moved to the US?'</p>
<p>With significant investment, sure. But annual US physical video game software spending is now half what it was in 2021 and declining rapidly.</p>
<p>And this also wouldn't help when it comes to costs.</p>
<p>Not a good combo to incentive that investment. IMO.</p>

<p>No matter what is going to happen in the near future with the new Trump tariffs, it looks like a price increase for video games seems almost inevitable, and the whole industry seems to be pushing towards it, in one way or another. As highlighted in a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-growth-engine-pricing/">State of Video Gaming in 2025 presentation</a> by CEO of Epyllion Matthew Ball, much of the video game industry is hoping that Grand Theft Auto 6 will be priced higher than the current $70 barrier and thus re-establish packaged game pricing after decades of deflation despite rampant cost growth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bohemia-interactive-revenue-up-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Arma&nbsp;</em>studio Bohemia Interactive has reported an "extremely successful 2024", contrasting against what the Czech studio calls the "global stagnation" of the gaming industry at large.</p>

<p>In a press release, Bohemia says its revenue jumped 34% in 2024, reaching a total of $60.8 million. The company managed to sell 4.85 million copies of its games across PC and consoles last year, with player numbers hitting 17 million around the world.</p>

<p>According to Bohemia, 99% of those sales came from "abroad" rather than from its native Czech Republic, with the US enjoying a 42% market share. Bohemia also reports "significant growth" in Ukraine, which saw player numbers doubling year-on year, and points to Brazil as a market of "growing importance".</p>

<p>The studio also says that fans can look forward to "interesting game surprises" over the coming year, including the "intensive development" of&nbsp;<em>Arma 4</em>, which is now expected to launch sometime in 2027.</p>

<p>More games under the Bohemia Incubator program, through which Bohemia gives smaller teams funding and publishing support for their games, will also be introduced this year, with action platformer&nbsp;<em>Brute Horse&nbsp;</em>and sandbox RPG&nbsp;<em>SkyVerse&nbsp;</em>both on Bohemia's 2024 infographic.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that Bohemia's growth certainly goes against the grain in that regard, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-watering cash</a> some of these companies' C-suites <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">took home for themselves</a> last year and the year before, I'd question whether those decisions were, in fact, made due to industry trends.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll bring you more on what Bohemia Interactive gets up to in 2025 as and when we get it, so stay tuned for that.</p>
