<p>Launching on Switch on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>, Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection brings together seven DS Mega Man RPGs in one package that includes an art gallery, music, and other quality-of-life features.</p>
<p>PlayStation UK briefly shared a new trailer for the upcoming collection, though it's currently unavailable at the time of writing — perhaps they jumped the gun a little soon? Still, we have these clips:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xwglhv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-has-been-rated-for-switch">was rated for Switch just last month</a>, so the release date reveal shouldn't be too surprising. And, for a reminder, here are the seven games included in the collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Leo</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x Ninja</li>

		<p>Back in November, Brigada Games delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-release-has-been-delayed/">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check&nbsp;</a>after getting feedback from playtesters. The team was still aiming to get the game out for 2025, but has not been able to meet that goal. However, the release date for Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is not that far off with that confirmed for January 12th. It has been priced at $19.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Quarantine Zone | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT8ECnPXShk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is set in a world that is facing a zombie outbreak, and you are a checkpoint guard. Your job is to stop anyone infected with the zombie virus, as well as anyone carrying contraband, from passing your checkpoint to a safe zone. Fail and it could lead to catastrophe. As a guard, players are equipped with scanners to detect the virus, but other resources are limited so decisions will need to be made to keep the camp safe.</p>
<p>If you want to give Quarantine Zone: The Last Check a try there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">demo available on Steam</a>. More news about the game and some ways to address the challenges will be released ahead of the release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During The Game Awards 2025, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-launches-april-24-2026-switch-2-version-added-demo-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch date of PRAGMATA, its long-awaited new sci-fi intellectual property. Originally unveiled before the debut of the PlayStation 5 console as a 'next-generation' title, the game suffered multiple delays and was at one point thought to be going the way of Deep Down, another CAPCOM IP that vanished into thin air.</p>



<p>However, CAPCOM reintroduced it this year with trailers, hands-on opportunities at conventions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom</a>, and finally, the release date, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-romeo-is-a-dead-man-get-korean-ratings-launch-news-may-be-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rating by the South Korean board</a>. Moreover, the developers also released a free demo called 'Sketchbook' that allows players to try the unique blend of hacking and fighting that makes up the core mechanics.</p>



<p>Firstly, as part of the release date news and demo availability, the developers have shared the official PC system requirements, which are listed below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 (64 bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5‑8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td><td>Intel Core i7‑8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8 GB / AMD Radeon RX 6600 8 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>40 GB available space</td><td>40 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Additional Notes</strong></td><td>Estimated performance on “Performance” preset: 1080p/45 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. SSD recommended.</td><td>Estimated performance on “Balanced” preset: 1080p/60 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB required for ray tracing. SSD recommended.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As evidenced by the specs themselves, PRAGMATA does not aim to be the next Crysis. Indeed, CAPCOM themselves admitted <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-gave-pragmata-an-early-steam-demo-to-make-sure-the-full-release-runs-smoothly-across-a-wide-range-of-pcs-we-ask-the-developers-about-their-optimization-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Automaton Media</a> that their priority was to prioritize a solid frame rate 'even if it meant sacrificing certain graphical aspects'. In that conversation, the development team also revealed why PC was the first platform to receive a demo (console demos will be released later): this allows them to gather feedback from gamers and optimize the game across the virtually countless PC configurations that can be created with existing components.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRAGMATA PC 'Sketchbook' Demo 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1iM1DDPK74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Based on my time with the demo, I'd say PRAGMATA, which is powered by the RE Engine like every recent CAPCOM game, already runs very well, at least on a high-end PC. At 4K resolution and every single graphics setting pushed to the max, including ray tracing and NVIDIA DLAA (AI-powered anti-aliasing while rendering at native resolution), on an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition GPU, the demo averaged 173 frames per second. That's with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation enabled; there is currently no support for Multi-Frame Generation, so it was set to 2x. AMD users can enable FSR Frame Generation, and for the upscaling component, they can choose between AMD FSR 3.1.4 and AMD FSR 1.</p>



<p>More importantly, FLAT (the Frame Analytics Latency Tool software) registered a very low stuttering 'share' of 3,68%, much lower than most PC games, which range from 8-10%, let alone the worst example so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-performance-test-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with its 20,29% of stuttering time</a>. Indeed, subjectively, the demo felt smooth and almost entirely stutter-free.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PRAGMATA_SKETCHBOOK_DEMO_FLAT-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Now, it also didn't stand out particularly for its visuals. With the game taking place in relatively small interiors, at least based on the demo, perhaps CAPCOM could have delivered more detailed environments and assets as a whole. Still, based on the aforementioned statement, it was not their priority; they wanted to focus on performance instead. The game is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, as announced at The Game Awards 2025, and I can see it performing well even there.</p>



<p>On the other hand, those seeking a stunning game to show off their shiny new graphics card may want to look elsewhere. Granted, PC users will likely be able to inject path tracing through mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as was the case with previous RE Engine games</a>. CAPCOM only natively added ray traced reflections and indirect lighting to this game, whereas Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature native path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>The excellent performance exhibited by the PRAGMATA demo would be even better news if this were a challenging action game akin to Ninja Gaiden 4, to name one. However, this is not that kind of game. It's meant to be a far more relaxed experience, though I personally do hope that CAPCOM adds a Hard difficulty level before launch, as the demo felt far too easy.</p>



<p>Still, I largely enjoyed my experience with the demo and look forward to playing the full game when it launches on April 24, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">reports surfaced</a> that Larian are making use of generative AI during development of their new RPG Divinity - specifically, to come up with ideas, produce placeholder text, develop concept art, and create materials for PowerPoint presentations. In the same <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg article</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke sought to balance these revelations with the promise that Divinity won’t directly contain any AI-generated materials, commenting that "everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves."</p>
<p>As with generative AI in gamedev generally, the disclosure has sparked anger online - anger that is all the sharper for the love that has hitherto been directed at Larian, creators of amazing fantasy RPGs with sexy bears and demons. Inevitably, some of the outrage is from people who appear minimally familiar with game development, and in a few cases, haven’t read the report in full (unhelpfully, it’s behind Bloomberg’s paywall). Some of it, though, is from other game developers.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Imagine your team makes a generationally renowned piece of entertainment and then immediately turning around and using fucking ChatGPT to make concept art in an IP you own,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mitchyd.bsky.social/post/3ma4o3bku6s2f">writes</a> Mitch Dyer, a writer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-battlefront">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> 2 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-squadrons">Star Wars: Squadrons</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mitchyd.bsky.social/post/3ma4o4xoaic2f">adding</a> that “’we're writing everything ourselves’ cannot square with ‘we use AI for placeholder text’”.</p>
<p>“If you're using it for Concept Art, you are replacing people,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jefftalbot.bsky.social/post/3ma4o6vbsdc2g">observes</a> Jeff Talbot, senior concept artist at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/remnant-2">Remnant 2</a> developers Gunfire Games. “If you are using it for Writing, you are replacing people. If you are using it at all in the development of the product, then its in the final product. Just dont use it.”</p><p>Among the devs responding is a former Larian staffer, environment artist Selena Tobin. "consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI," Tobin <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">writes</a>. "reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas."</p>
<p>The backlash continues to lash. Vincke has now sent our terrifying office acquaintance <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">Ian Games</a> a statement, expanding on the Bloomberg report and attempting to counter accusations that Larian intend to replace developers with generative AI software, or ship a game made up of AI-generated assets. Here’s that statement in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists, writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p>
<p>Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p>
<p>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</p>
<p>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p>
<p>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games.</p>
<p>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p>
<p>While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Generative AI continues to be a murky, messy pain in the arse to report on for a number of reasons. For one thing, there are a lot of different generative AI tools besides the Big Chatbots that are busily <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">dragnetting all of internet culture</a>, while creating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-boss-tim-sweeney-is-right-to-call-genai-a-political-topic-its-a-mechanism-of-class-war">a pretext for layoffs</a> and contributing to an ever-larger share of <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">global carbon emissions</a>. Some videogame developers have created their own, proprietary and perhaps more responsibly operated technologies for internal use, such as the world generation software used by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-still-has-a-terrible-name-and-is-out-now-in-early-access">Plunkback</a>.</p><p>There are also older kinds of automation or machine learning tool that tend to get bundled in with New ‘n’ Improved genAI, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now">Embark’s technologies for robot animations</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>. Vincke hasn't specified which kinds of genAI Larian are using - he himself equates machine learning with genAI in the statement above - but the Bloomberg report does mention PowerPoint, which has a lot of Microsoft Copilot gunk built in.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, we know that a lot of game developers are using genAI tools without saying so. Generative AI is also being used at different stages in development or production, and across various disciplines, creating confusion about what degree of negative reaction is appropriate, and what it means to say that a game “contains” AI-generated material. I myself am sympathetic to the argument that if you’ve used generative AI in any aspect of development, it “exists in” your game regardless of whether the art assets look like chunks of rehydrated Fortnite.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess we will go back to Larian and ask for more comment. If you’d prefer to read about Divinity in itself – a turn-based CRPG sequel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> – here’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-talk-divinity-their-next-rpg-after-baldurs-gate-3-its-almost-as-though-its-the-first-in-the-series">my own chat with Vincke</a>. We did not discuss generative AI. Naturally, I am kicking myself about that. While I figured that Vincke might be more 'pragmatic' about the technology than many - he is, after all, a CEO, not a concept artist - it has genuinely never occurred to me that Larian might make use of such tools in any kind of deliberate, systematic way.</p>

In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Informer</a>, Howard — who is The Elder Scrolls 6 director and executive producer — and other Bethesda developers issued a more detailed update. Let’s start with Howard, who said of The Elder Scrolls 6:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s progressing really well. The majority of the studio’s on 6, but I’ll say this: we always overlap. So, we’re very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it’s a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster — or a lot faster — but it’s a process that we want to get right.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking the time to get The Elder Scrolls 6 right is a sentiment shared by studio design director Emil Pagliarulo, who pointed to GTA 6’s high-profile delays as the “smartest thing they could do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” he asked. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, studio director Angela Browder hyped up the technological advances that make The Elder Scrolls 6 “this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry. It’s gonna be dope. It’s dope! [laughs]”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, there remains no release window, which is what fans are waiting to hear right now. And fans are getting increasingly desperate for news. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-honestly-might-be-the-best-piece-of-evidence-we-have-for-a-release-date-fans-think-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-out-in-2027-because-of-a-speech-skill-in-a-live-action-skyrim-trailer">some thought Bethesda teased The Elder Scrolls 6’s release year in a live-action Skyrim trailer because one of Santa’s elves raised their speech level to 27</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can understand why patience might be difficult for some though. In January this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 was revealed on June 10, 2018</u></a> — 2,403 days afterwards. It is now seven-and-a-half years since the announcement, and we’re no closer, it seems, to the release of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the GQ article, Howard once again admitted that it had taken too long to get The Elder Scrolls 6 out the door, but did tease a The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered-style shadowdrop — without confirming anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” Howard said of making The Elder Scrolls games again. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break — The Elder Scrolls has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.” Bethesda is currently playtesting The Elder Scrolls 6, Howard revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard continued. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year it was confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-will-feature-a-memorial-character-for-a-much-missed-fan-following-85000-donation-to-make-a-wish"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan</u></a> after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>1385224</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">AI is "something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">This morning, the news broke that Larian Studios, developer of Baldur's Gate 3 and the upcoming, just-announced Divinity, is apparently using generative AI behind the scenes for things like concept art and placeholder text. The backlash has been swift and loud from the gaming community, and now Larian founder and game director Swen Vincke is responding to clarify his remarks, affirming that Larian is "neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI," and that AI is "something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The original news comes from a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg interview</a> with Vincke. In it, Vincke admits that Larian is "pushing hard" [Bloomberg's phrasing] on generative AI, even though it hasn't led to big gains in efficiency. Specifically, the studio is using the technology to "explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text." [Bloomberg's phrasing].</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke reassures that there won't be any AI-generated content in the final version of Divinity. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves." But it sounds like this approach isn't going over smoothly with everyone. Bloomberg's piece acknowledges that some internally at Larian have pushed back, though Vincke says, "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news hasn't gone over super well with the community, though. On Bluesky, Larian is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3ma4d2dzp5225" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being lambasted</a> by a number of individuals across the game development community, including some former Larian employees. "consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">writes Selena Tobin</a>, an environment artist and former Larian employees. "reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Divinity and Baldur's Gate 3 communities have a somewhat more divided reaction, with some defending its use for concepting, though there's still a significant amount of backlash. A few commenters have pointed out that games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-developer-confirms-it-used-generative-ai-text-and-translations-promises-updates">such as The Alters</a> suffered from significant fan anger over discovered generative AI use, but are willing to forgive Larian for the same offense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to this backlash, Vincke has issued IGN a lengthy follow-up response, which we've published here in full:</p><blockquote>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</blockquote><blockquote>Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</blockquote><blockquote>Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</blockquote><blockquote>Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</blockquote><blockquote>We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will  let us make better games.</blockquote><blockquote>We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</blockquote><blockquote>While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke then followed up further with a post on Twitter/X:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p><p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more.

                <p>In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>"It's progressing really well," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>. "The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right."</p><p>Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-a-skyrim-trailer-might-secretly-reveal-elder-scrolls-6s-release-year/1100-6536892/" data-ref-id="1100-6536892">reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer</a> as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">recently as last month</a>, Howard said that The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off" and he expressed regret for announcing the sequel when he did. Earlier this year, Bethesda teamed up with Make-A-Wish for a charity auction to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-donate-to-make-a-wish-for-a-chance-to-design-an-elder-scrolls-6-character/1100-6529534/" data-ref-id="1100-6529534">design a creature in Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p>Howard also held open the possibility of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-tv-series-is-possible-says-todd-howard/1100-6536747/" data-ref-id="1100-6536747">an Elder Scrolls TV series</a>, much like the hit Fallout show on Prime Video. However, Howard indicated that he's "willing to say 'no' for a decade" rather than rush into that.</p>

		<p>Paradox ARC, the indie publishing arm of Paradox Interactive, has announced alongside developer CoolAndGood Games that it will no longer be publishing the space sim Starminer. CoolAndGood Games will continue developing the game independently, but a reason for the split has not been given. Back in October, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/starminer-will-require-more-development-time-before-early-access-release/">Starminer would require more development time before early access release.</a></p>

<p>In a statement, Paradox ARC said,<em> “After several years working together on Starminer, Paradox ARC and CoolAndGood Games have mutually agreed to part ways. CoolAndGood Games will continue development independently and will continue independently as they move towards the release of Starminer. We want to extend our sincere thanks to the CoolAndGood Games team. Building a game is always a journey, and we’re grateful for the vision and dedication they’ve brought to Starminer and our collaboration. To everyone who has followed Starminer’s development so far: thank you for being part of this journey with us. Your enthusiasm and support have meant a great deal. On our end, we’ll be cheering them on from the sidelines as they continue developing Starminer.”</em></p>
<p>CoolAndGames Games also released a statement saying, <em>“After several years of developing Starminer together with our publishing partner, we at CoolAndGood Games will be continuing forward on our own as we prepare for the game’s upcoming release in February. <wbr>We want to thank our friends at Paradox ARC for their support, collaboration, and belief in the project. Starminer has grown a great deal since it was announced, and we’re grateful for the foundation we built together. <wbr>For our community; your enthusiasm and feedback have been invaluable. Starminer has always been a project driven by passion, and your participation has helped shape the development of the game. As we move into the project’s next phase, we’re committed to delivering the best version of Starminer we can, and we can’t wait to show you what’s coming next!”</em></p>

<p>A release date for Starminer is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Damn, The Outer Worlds 2‘s Flaw System Is So Good]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910</link>
            <guid>1385188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I was nearly 30 hours into <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> when I lied to a character during a conversation. A few moments later, a message popped up on my screen. I had lied enough times, apparently, that I was offered the chance to take a new secret trait that would force me to lie whenever possible, but I could do so perfectly. This is the Flaws System, and it’s one of my favorite features in a game I’ve played this year.</p> <p>Released earlier this year, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Obsidian’s bigger and better open-world RPG sequel to 2019’s <em>The Outer Worlds.</em> If the first game was a fun attempt at recreating Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> formula, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is the studio nailing it. In fact, I think in some ways the team has beaten Bethesda at its own game, with improved writing, better combat, and some other cool ideas, like Flaws.</p>

 <p>Technically, <a href="https://theouterworlds.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outer_Worlds_flaws">Flaws were a feature in the first<em> Outer Worlds</em></a>. But in that game, they offered a choice to take extra perk points in exchange for your stats being lowered in specific ways. Like, taking too much head damage would make you 100 percent worse at aiming guns. It was an okay idea that felt too punishing and wasn’t much fun. In <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2,</em> the Flaw system has been revamped to add more chaos to a playthrough. Now, Flaws can be really wild and offer a mix of negative and positive effects. For example, in <em>The Outer</em><em>&nbsp;Worlds 2</em>, if you steal a lot of items, the game will eventually detect this and offer you a Flaw that lets you sell stolen goods for double their value, but it also forces you to steal anything you get close to, which could cause some awkward moments in a store or town.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653924">©Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://theouterworlds2.wiki.fextralife.com/Flaws">Flaws in <em>Outer Worlds 2</em></a> can, if you desire, throw a wrench into your RPG experience and shake things up even dozens of hours into a playthrough. If you don’t look them up ahead of time, which you shouldn’t, they can spice up the latter half of the game<em>,</em> which can suffer from the same problem so many RPGs suffer from: letting you get stuck in a comfortable but boring rut.</p>

 <h2>How Flaws in <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2</em> make it a better RPG</h2> <p>You know that point in an RPG where you’re nearing max level, have the weapons that work perfectly for your build, and have your skills dialed in. Fights become boring. Exploration isn’t as exciting either, as you’ve been to most places a few times now. This is the point at which many players put down the game and walk away. Maybe you push through to wrap it up, having less fun as you go. But with Flaws, the final stretch of&nbsp;<em>Outer Worlds 2</em> was still a wild time for me.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/">When I tried to speed through dialogue too much, I was offered a Flaw</a> that would let me gain more XP, but would randomly choose options during dialogue. Another Flaw offered to make my melee strikes more deadly in exchange for taking more damage when I blocked, an offer which came after I spent too much time punching random baddies and not enough time blocking and dodging.</p>

 <p>I didn’t accept all of them (and I definitely didn’t take the Flaw that makes you accept all Flaws moving forward), but just having such strange choices to contemplate 20+ hours into the game was fantastic. Each time a Flaw notification appeared, I perked up. And when I accepted one, like the Flaw that made me scared of mechs but able to do more damage to them, it altered my playthrough in a way I really appreciated and helped get me out of that “stuck in a rut” phase so many RPGs tend to end up in.</p> <p>The only problem now is that when I started playing a different game, I found myself longing for silly, interesting, and possibly game-breaking flaws to appear as I played. It was a treat to have the game react to how I was playing, actively tempting me with ways to indulge in bad behaviors or silly habits (like reloading too much) in exchange for some equally silly punishments. Now I want more games to do that. So here’s me permitting RPG devs to steal Flaws from <em>The </em><em>Outer Worlds 2.</em> I’d like that, please!</p>

<p>We have another adjustment to the Akita ScorchLink Akimbo that partially adds back its original damage penalty.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href="https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Lora</a>. Vincke hates the little critter and wanted him gone for the re-release.</p><p>"It's funny that you like Sir Lora. I hate him. If there is one thing I regret about Original Sin 2, it's bringing Sir Lora into the game," he said.</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he "tried to remove him from the Switch 2 version," but Larian's QA team informed him that it was "too late."</p><p>"I really tried to get rid of him," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWITWd1GJk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yYWITWd1GJk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vincke added that his Head of QA informed him that the team undertook efforts to cut Sir Lora and the team "almost succeeded." But the problem was that removing Sir Lora led to an issue where "it works in one region and not in another."</p><p>"We couldn't figure out why. Sir Lora just wouldn't die. We lost several days debugging to find an answer to that. Now it's too late, so we have to keep him," he said.</p><p>Vincke also shared some Sir Lora lore, saying the publisher behind Original Sin II wanted to have free DLC for the game, so Larian created the squirrel NPC "as a joke that doesn't really add anything to the game."</p><p>"Later we regretted bringing Sir Lora in because it only happened due to publisher pressure. And now we just want to get rid of him. But it's okay; it makes me happy that you enjoy him. There are people who put a lot of effort into creating him," Vincke said.</p><p>Original Sin II just launched for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">free upgrade available</a> for people who already own the game on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.</p><p>Larian's next game is a new Divinity title, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">will not have any AI-created content in it</a>. The developer used generative AI to create concept art and to help with other development processes, however.</p><p>"It's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse," Vincke said, attempting to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">concerns raised by developers.</a></p>

While they're not the newest iteration of Sony's premium noise-canceling headphones (those are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM</a>6), they offer impressive noise cancellation. Sound quality is excellent as well, and it can be further customized using the companion Sony Sound Connect app. They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and quick charging support that can restore three hours of playback in just three minutes of charging.</p><p>As for the WF-C700N earbuds, they may not be as popular as AirPods, but they're still a great option, offering IPX4 water resistance, multiple silicone earbud tips, a built-in microphone for hands-free calling, and the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>If you're shopping around for other headphone deals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> headphones are also on sale for $398 (was $460) ahead of the holidays. This matches the all-time low price from Black Friday, though it's still quite a bit more expensive than the older WH-1000XM5. Most shoppers will find the WH-1000XM5 bundle to be the best offer right now, but if you need the latest and greatest gear, it's nice to see the XM6 back down to the same price as they were in late November.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> headphones are also quite cheap right now, with Amazon listing them for $180 (was $350). Offering up to 40 hours of battery life and a stylish design, they could be a nice alternative to the WH-1000XM5. Most colors are eligible for the discount, too, so it shouldn't be hard to snag something that fits your style.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>We <em>did,</em> however, hear a heated debate he had with his Mum (it really does catch them voices!), which wasn’t the kind of environmental storytelling we were going for, really. It turns out you can selectively lower the volume for different friends (and their Mums) in the chat - useful!</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957xkvyhj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p><em>Stories abound.</em> For a period this year, Silksong and GameChat was like a pub to me and some friends. Whereas previously of an evening there might be memes or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> smacktalk in the WhatsApp chat, suddenly the group was quiet. But I could turn up to the Switch about 9pm and reliably get a notification toot (after that slightly exciting anticipation lag) that three friends were online and there was a GameChat invite. Click that 'C' button!</p>
<p>Four of us had bought Silksong (only two of whom had finished <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>) and embarked on its punishing, rewarding, sprawling journey together. Smash aside — I main as Corrin — I'm not really one for online multiplayer or co-op, and don’t know the pleasures of being a sun-praising Soulslover who summons others to duet a boss (and I’ve only played <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/dark_souls_ii_scholar_of_the_first_sin">Dark Souls 2</a>, sorry!).</p>

<p>But playing Silksong as a Silkchorus was a 2025 highlight, a single-player journey but shared through GameChat, with new (or new to Nintendo) possibilities suddenly enabled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never watch Twitch but now found myself flicking across GameChat screens of an evening like channels on the telly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we had live fight analysis for some bosses, like the time Ibby was struggling trying to beat First Sinner, that frantic, fantastic, optional boss found in the Slab prison, <em>fwoomp</em>-ing in and out of the arena like Nightcrawler amidst a relentless barrage of lacerating silk and the music swells with violin violence.</p>
<p>But watching his screen, I noticed he wasn't making use of the hookshot — I don’t think it’s called a 'hookshot' — to gain that crucial horizontal distance and safety between threads. And so I told him, and he did, and bit by bit he began to make progress.</p>
<p>Though still not enough - there was a phase two. <em>Just one more go before calling it for today,</em> we agreed, and I watched his last run, the clean control and last-hurrah focus, and now it was phase two but I was keeping silent so as not to jinx it. Then I <em>erupted</em> as the Sinner went down.</p>
<p>At other times it was more rally-style co-driving, like when Sunny fought Disgraced Chef Lugoli in Sinner's Road, the screen busy with putrid globules and sideways bum barges, all of us chipping in to offload the overwhelm with shouts of "Cogflies Cogflies!" or "Heal heal heal!" at <em>just</em> the right moment.</p>
<p>(In theory. The chef went down later.)</p>
<figure data-uuid="bc5ce6ae7f71b"><a title="Silksong Co-op 17" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc5ce6ae7f71b/silksong-co-op-17.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Like this, but just boys. And Silksong. And no cameras. Okay, not like this. — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>An underrated effect of all this screen-sharing is that we’d get to repeatedly experience generational leaps in gaming, acclimatising to the fuzzy 10fps jerkiness of someone else's Pharloom, then — cool platforming section over — going back to our own game in gloriously rich, high-fidelity, full-screen wonder. In handheld especially, you get that shocking, popping clarity that looks like print, like a storybook given life. Silksong remastered!</p>
<p>So I started to really enjoy this Silksong TV. I never watch Twitch but now found myself flicking across GameChat screens of an evening like channels on the telly. And because of the game’s commendable open-ness — and tough-as-nails-ness — everyone would be somewhere different. There were rumours of a new area above west Greymoor, or a magical dice in the Blasted Steps that is <em>needed,</em> bro. Party members scouting out and reporting back with what the different key doors unlocked, telling each other to open our maps and leave waymarkers for secrets at places of interest we hadn’t even got to yet. This was our new version of the fabled playground chatter of yore, a co-created web of Silksong strategy (instead of whispers of a naked Lara cheat).</p>
<p>And for the record, we played plenty <em>ourselves</em>, too. I am, after all, primarily a solo, in-conversation-with-myself-and-the-game kind of player. But even then, there was that nice background awareness of a wider conversation, of having people to whom we could later recount the things we’d seen and done.</p>
<figure data-uuid="877c39a15a88d"><a title="Silksong Co-op 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/877c39a15a88d/silksong-co-op-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Much discussion was had about the platforming here. I got here before having the cloak. I do not recommend this. — <em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now hear me out - would it be a stretch to call all the actual chatting a game mechanic, too? Not just because of the shared intel and coaching, but because of that sort of <em>side-play</em> headspace you sometimes get into whilst chatting, like the long car drive catch-up where you barely notice the journey. We’d tap into the automaticity and free reps of working a section on repeat (that Bird’s Nest gauntlet owes me hours) whilst chatting life nonsense that kept the difficulty and seriousness <em>just</em> off the boil enough to get the details down. Then go off chat to lock-in and finish the job, sharing a video from the Nintendo app the next morning of you finally beating the Savage Beastfly.</p>
<p>(These posts were weirdly expressive of the different ways we’d all play. It was watching Mozo’s <em>clean AF</em> performance on Beastfly that taught me the usefulness of short-hop hits, even though he didn’t seem to do the badass last-minute ground dodge like Gothmog in <strong>Return of the King</strong>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I got more engrossed than most and ploughed through straight to the end of Act 3 and its gloriously exacting final battle, feeling the patterns out on repeat, going off chat for the final few goes, then re-entering and trying to act nonchalant when I'd beaten it. I’ve played it again since and it’s almost just rhythm action pattern matching now. Power in progress.</p>
<figure data-uuid="644dd95617f69"><a title="Silksong Co-op 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/644dd95617f69/silksong-co-op-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>You can't hear the music over GameChat, Hornet. — <em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the other guys fell off a bit after Act 2. New <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades</a> had come and provided some lighter respite, and another’s family member had begun some medical treatments. Just a small Silksong break, but it never picked up again. And so that specific pub made of joint momentum and shared moments had closed.</p>
<p>What a lovely place, though. What a cool Switch 2 time. Bring on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow">Sea of Sorrow</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-playing-silksong-in-co-op-was-a-2025-hivemind-highlight]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sucker Punch Productions, the first-party PlayStation Studios team behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-beat-assassins-creed-shadows-sales-on-ps5-in-three-weeks/">Ghost of Yotei,</a> Ghost of Tsushima, the inFamous series, and the Sly Cooper series, has officially entered into a new era with the departure of Brian Fleming, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-will-stick-making-one-game-at-a-time/">one of the studio's co-founders and longtime studio head</a>.</p>



<p>The news was announced with <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/the-next-chapter-of-sucker-punch/">a blog post on the official Sony Interactive website</a>, where the company confirmed that Jason Connell and Adrian Bentley will be stepping into new roles as co-studio heads, with Nate Fox staying on as co-creative director to round out the studio's full leadership team.</p>



<p>It's unclear what Fleming has planned next, because it doesn't seem like he knows what that is. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/">In a LinkedIn post from Fleming</a> that followed the official announcement, he began, "<em>So, what do you think I should do next? That's the</em> <em>big question - because after 28 absolutely life changing years at the helm of Sucker Punch, I've decided it's time to shake up the snow-globe..."</em></p>



<p>"<em>I leave Sucker Punch in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had - Adrian and Jason will do an amazing job as Studio Heads. And the rest of the directors - Nate, Joanna, Billy, Gail, Parker, Sonia, Rob, etc., they are all so capable and so ready for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish,"</em> he continued.</p>



<p>Fleming then confirmed that he hasn't yet seen his last day at Sucker Punch. That'll come in April 2026, as he'll continue to stay at the studio to assist with the transition for Connell and Bentley. Afterwards, he'll take a break and spend some time travelling with his family.</p>



<p>Beyond that, Fleming mentions that he's "<em>trying to sort out which opportunities</em>" he wants to explore, some of which he says are within the industry, "<em>some tech, some entertainment and some advocacy/politics stuff</em>." </p>



<p>Whatever Fleming does next, it'll be worth keeping an eye on. He might not be the creative genius behind everything at Sucker Punch for the last 28 years, but there are few leaders like him in the video game industry who are capable enough to lead a studio to continued strength and growth for over two decades. Sucker Punch has only grown in the eyes of players and PlayStation fans with each new franchise and remains one of the most beloved studios under PlayStation's umbrella.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what he does next, and how Sucker Punch continues without him in its new post-Fleming era.</p>

            <guid>1385131</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/the-last-of-us-co-creator-bruce-straleys-next-game-is-a-witchy">The Last of Us co-creator Bruce Straley revealed his next game, Coven of the Chicken Foot</a>, during The Game Awards 2025 earlier this month. Developed at Wildflower Interactive, a new studio Straley founded in 2022, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/coven-of-the-chicken-foot">Coven of the Chicken Foot</a> promises a witchy post-apocalyptic adventure about an old woman exploring a fantasy world after its dungeons have been plundered, its caves explored, and its enemies defeated.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the way, this witch will encounter an oddball companion that will autonomously work with you to complete puzzles, platform through levels, and more. During today's episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-3sQwv9arQQ?si=hwM9MUpOOpA-wqhh"><em>Kinda Funny Games Daily</em></a>, Straley appeared alongside host Greg Miller to briefly discuss Coven of the Chicken Foot before diving into the video game news of the day, which is what the show is about. During this chat, which happened at the top of the show, Straley explained that the idea behind Coven of the Chicken Foot had been lingering in his mind for years.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/mRNAbGYwvgg?si=n-0DFyB5fpuT2Wcg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRNAbGYwvgg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>While speaking to an old Naughty Dog colleague about game development, Straley recalls telling that colleague, "[I] have an idea that's been lingering for many years. It's actually an idea from way back when we started Jak and Daxter. It's just kind of been lingering; it's even in the Naughty Dog art book, like I drew some pictures and stuff." Presumably, Straley is referring to the 2014 Dark Horse Comics-published book, "The Art of Naughty Dog."&nbsp;</p><p>"The idea was there, and it was like, 'Okay, there are some things I still want to prove out.' Like, is there a way to tell stories that are more interactive with characters, in a world, rather than a story being told to me that's more about cutscenes and exposition?" Straley told Miller when asked about his journey back into game development after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/09/13/bruce-straley-director-of-uncharted-2-and-the-last-of-us-is-leaving-naughty-dog.aspx">a sabbatical that became a moment to depart from Naughty Dog back in 2017</a>. "Nothing wrong with that – I did a lot of that. For me, I wanted to go like, 'Okay, it's like a spiritual successor of Ellie.' Everything we learned about Ellie and making this character feel dynamic and responsive in combat wasn't the same Ellie that – when she got pouty or excited, those were scripted moments, and I wanted to know if I could create those kinds of moments dynamically, like in-game, letting the player drive the story and the relationship with the character and I was like, 'Okay, what if?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Straley explained that after a year of prototyping, Wildflower Interactive had three or four people on board and then created demos and pitched the game.&nbsp;</p><p>"The game said to me, 'I want to get made. This is a game I would play. It's a game that I'm proud to make,'" he concludes.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the show, Straley listed "Circe" by Madeline Miller and "The Buried Giant" by Kazuo Ishiguro as two significant sources of inspiration for Coven of the Chicken Foot.&nbsp;</p><p>There's no release date for Coven of the Chicken Foot yet, but it is currently in development at Wildflower Interactive for PC.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you excited to play Coven of the Chicken Foot?

<p>Sink your teeth in</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Poncle has just released a brand new gameplay trailer for its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> spin-off, <em>*deep breath*</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a>, which is coming out some time in 2026.</p>
<p>And it probably should come with a health warning, because the chaotic blobber-inspired (that's a term used to describe a number of first-person RPGs from the '80, broadly) dungeon crawling rogue-lite is going to be a huge time sink, just like Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Anyway, Vampire Crawlers will introduce your vampire hunting friends to turn-based combat, brand new abilities, new ways to use existing abilities, and... digging?</p>

<p>We've also got a sneak peak at some familiar locations, a museum, and other buildings that you'll likely need to use to progress. And yet somehow, it all seems to come together with that same moreish Vampire Survivors flair.</p>
<p>More details will be coming soon on the game, but for now, we just want to know when to take some time off work to sink our teeth into the game.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/</link>
            <guid>1385095</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda has been known to 'jump the gun' when it comes to announcing its upcoming titles. Starfield, for example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-reveal-e3-90-percent-likely-2021-launch/">was a game we knew about for years before it released</a>, and there's an argument to be made that it was to the game's detriment that we knew about it coming for so long. Now, the same could be happening with The Elder Scrolls VI, as Bethesda provided an update on the game's development in a recent interview that essentially amounts to the studio saying nothing more than it's still coming.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">GameInformer</a>, three lead members of Bethesda spoke about how things are going with The Elder Scrolls VI. Studio director Angela Browder, director and executive producer Todd Howard, and studio design director Emil Pagliarulo. </p>



<p>No one dared to suggest a release window of any sort, and all of them said some version of Howard's initial comment, which was that "<em>It's progressing really well</em>." Pagliarulo was perhaps the most blunt and furthest away from marketing-speak, as he said, "<em>I can say that it's going</em>!"</p>



<p>"<em>It's funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don't put on ourselves,</em>" Pagliarulo continued. "<em>And I know that can be frustrating for players who are dying to play a game. Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games they take not just a long time to make, but a long time spit and polish and iron out the bugs. And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That's what I think people are going to want. So, we're going to make our time and as long as it needs to be great</em>."</p>



<p>Howard was much more succinct with his words. After saying that it is "<em>progressing really well</em>," he added, "<em>the majority of the studio's on VI, but I'll say this: we always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We wish it went a little bit faster - or a lot faster - but it's a process that we want to get right</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, Browder added that they are "<em>actively excited about what's in front of us</em>," with how hardware and technology have improved since development on The Elder Scrolls VI first started, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uesp-wiki-met-bethesda-design-character-the-elder-scrolls-vi-excited/">a comment that we've seen before regarding the game's protracted development</a>. "<em>The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer</em>," Browder added.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it's good that the developers at Bethesda aren't putting a massive amount of pressure on themselves to try and get The Elder Scrolls VI done as soon as possible. No one does their best work if they're also always trying to think about getting their work done as fast as possible. Sometimes, you really do just need to sit with something and let it take as long as it takes before you end up in a good place.</p>



<p>That said, knowing that doesn't necessarily make the waiting easier for players. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">Even as Howard "<em>preaches patience</em>,"</a> the more the game sits in players minds as nothing but a short teaser that was shown to early, the more volatile its eventual launch will feel, which could be great for the game, or it could have the same impact it did with Starfield, where players are largely unimpressed with what Bethesda spent years toiling away on. </p>

(The older Bluetooth Classic mode requires more bandwidth than Bluetooth LE, so you typically see a big drop in audio quality with Bluetooth Classic when you try to add two-way voice communication to your audio stream.)</p><p>Microsoft actually branded that “don’t drop audio quality” idea back in August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/766569/microsoft-windows-11-bluetooth-super-wideband-stereo-le-audio-voice-feature">calling it “super wideband stereo,”</a> and any Bluetooth LE headset should be able to get you it in Windows 11 now. And, Bluetooth LE should also get you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/811795/microsoft-windows-11-bluetooth-le-shared-audio-headsets">Microsoft’s new shared audio Insider Preview feature</a> so your PC can stream audio to two sets of headphones (or headphones and speakers) at once. Super wideband isn’t ready for Xbox Ally quite yet though, it seems: “Coming soon to ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X,” reads the blog.</p><div><p>Yes, it’s only for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276564/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-update-release-date-price-features">2024 refreshed version of the headset</a>, not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review">the original 2021 version</a>, but it’s quite the update for free. Maybe it’ll take some of the sting out of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659430/microsoft-xbox-console-controller-game-price-increases-worldwide">Microsoft’s price hike on these headsets</a>; originally $99, they’ve cost $119 since May. (It may also help cement the idea that the next Xbox is probably a PC.)</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845491/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-bluetooth-le-free-update]]></content:encoded>
