            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the holiday approaching fast, now is a great time to get a head start on all of your gift shopping. Whether you have a low budget White Elephant coming up at your office or you’re just looking for another good stocking stuffer for your high school to college-aged kid, consider this. INIU’s portable charger is something anyone that owns a phone would greatly appreciate, which is probably most people you know. The portable charger is normally listed on Amazon at $36. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5555/">However, a limited time deal is bringing the price down by 37% and it’s not even Black Friday or Cyber Monday yet</a>. Right now, that savings of $14 brings the price you pay down to just $22.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5555/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Travel-Friendly Charging</h2>
<p>This portable charger from INIU is the perfect travel buddy. It’s small in stature, able to fit in your pocket alongside your phone easily. It only measures in at 3.2 inches by 1.5 inches by 1.1 inches and weighs just 4.1 ounces. The charger even comes with a built-in keychain so you can clip it easily to your backpack or bag. Or just keep it on your keys so you always have it with you. Perfect for charging during trips or long commutes. It’s also TSA compliant so you’ll have no trouble taking it with you through the airports while traveling.</p>
<p>You’ve got lots on things you carry on you that need to be recharged every now and again. This portable charger can help you out with it’s built-in USB-C charging cable as well as the 5W wireless charger for Apple Watch. It’s also got an additional USB-C port in case you need to charge two phones at once.</p>



<p>Despite it’s compact form , this portable charger can pack a lot of backup power. With 5,000mAH on hand, the power bank can provide an Apple Watch with six full charges or an iPhone 16 with up to 91% from zero, giving you that reliable boost of power when you really need it.</p>
<p>It’s fast too. With Power Delivery support and 20W output, you can bring an iPhone 17 Pro up to 56% in just 25 minutes time. When it’s time to charge the portable power bank itself, it can do that fairly quickly as well. It can reach full charge from 20% in just two hours time.</p>
<p>The digital display on the front is there to let you know exactly how much power the charger has left in it. This can help prevent you rushing out the door with it, expecting it to be at full charge but then you realize you had forgotten to plug it in. You get a simple three digits indicating what percent battery the charger has left.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lgs-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early-2000644001</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early.1352683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a quality monitor usually means choosing between paying premium prices for trusted brands or gambling on unknown manufacturers that might deliver terrible color accuracy and dead pixels. LG stands as one of the most prestigious names in display technology and finding their products at bargain prices rarely happens outside of major sales events.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/">launched an early Black Friday deal that brings the LG 32UR500K-B down to $199, slashed from its usual $299</a>. This record-low pricing puts a<strong> 32-inch 4K UHD monitor</strong> from a reputable manufacturer at the same cost as generic no-name displays that flood the market with questionable quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Justifies the LG Name</h2>
<p>The <strong>32-inch 4K UHD display lets you experience 3840 by 2160 resolution</strong> that reproduces sharp text and detailed images across the whole screen. This kind of pixel density means you can see fine details in photos, read small text without zooming and enjoy crisp lines in spreadsheets or design work. The panel expresses up to <strong>90% of the DCI-P3 color gamut</strong> – that’s the cinema-grade color space used in professional content creation and high-end displays. You’re seeing colors that match what directors and designers intended rather than the washed-out or oversaturated visuals that come from cheaper monitors that have poor color reproduction.</p>



<p>HDR10 support elevates compatible content by expanding the range <strong>between darkest blacks and brightest whites</strong>. HDR takes advantage of the ability to create realistic lighting and shadow details in modern games, 4K video content, and streaming services that are impossible on flat SDR content. You’ll notice the dramatic visual immersion when watching HDR movies or playing supported games.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in stereo speakers</strong> with <em>Waves MaxxAudio</em> save desk space and eliminate the need for separate speakers if you’re using a minimalist setup. The audio quality is also quite a step above the tinny sound most monitor speakers produce; it’s big and bold, making movies and games actually enjoyable without headphones. For video calls or casual consumption of content, this solution works perfectly.</p>
<p><em>OnScreen Control</em> software gives quick access to monitor settings <strong>without having to fumble around with physical buttons</strong> on the back of the display. You are able to split your screen into different zones for multitasking, tune brightness and contrast with mouse clicks, and switch between preset modes optimized for different tasks.</p>
<p>The <strong>ergonomic stand allows for tilt adjustment that lets you angle the screen to match your eye level and viewing position.</strong> Proper monitor positioning reduces neck strain during long sessions of work and prevents glare from overhead lights or windows. The borderless design maximizes screen real estate while creating a modern aesthetic that looks clean on any desk.</p>
<p>Multiple connectivity options include<strong> two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort</strong> for flexibility in hooking up gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops or media devices all at the same time. You can also easily switch inputs to avoid constantly plugging and unplugging cables, which is a plus if you use the monitor with multiple systems.</p>
<p>At $199, you’re paying what generic 32-inch 4K monitors cost while getting LG’s established reputation for reliability.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for its cosy Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, revealing new forms for series icons Pikachu and Snorlax.</p>
<p>Shown at the very end, Pikachu appears to be in ghost form, while Snorlax is made of stone with a flower on its head. Beyond outfits and Gigantamax variants, this is the first time either of these two Pokémon has had a new form.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these are Peakychu, a "pale Pikachu with drooping ears whose fur is a mysterious colour", and Mosslax, covered in moss of course. There's also a new Smeargle called Smearguru, who uses its tail as a brush.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the trailer goes into detail on Pokopia's life-sim gameplay that bears resemblance to both Animal Crossing and Minecraft.</p>
<p>You'll play as a Ditto who transforms into the image of a young girl, though the trailer later confirms you'll be able to customise the character to your liking.</p>
<p>Ditto is introduced to Professor Tangrowth, who appears as a sort of mentor figure. The professor explains the island used to be home to many humans, but now it's deserted. It's Ditto's job to regenerate the island, using the power of Pokémon of course.</p>

</figure>
<p>Firstly you'll need to create habitats to attract Pokémon to the island. That might be as simple as planting tall grass to attract the likes of Charmander, Timburr, or Eevee, while a punching bag will attract Hitmonchan, and a fishing rod will attract a Magikarp.</p><p>Ditto can then learn signature moves from Pokémon to further spruce up the island. Yes, you can learn Squirtles Water Gun move to vom up a load of water from Ditto's mouth to help plants grow. Other moves include Scyther's Cut and Bulbasaur's Vine Whip.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>This looks questionable. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Certain Pokémon will also have special moves allowing Ditto to transform. Lapras, for instance, will allow Ditto to swim to new islands, or with Dragonite you can fly.</p>
<p>Ditto can then craft items at a workbench using materials found on the island, like logs and straw beds to make Pokémon more comfortable. And yes, Ditto appears to vomit these items up too.</p>
<p>Appeasing Pokémon requests provides mini quests too, and Ditto can also use the power of Pokémon to help out around the island - Pichu's electric abilities can light up lamps, for instance.</p>
<p>What's more, Pokopia can be played with up to four players co-operatively, and uses Game Share to share with friends without the game across either Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-spin-off-pokemon-pokopia-gets-release-date-but-its-another-controversial-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Pokémon Pokopia will be out on 5th March</a>, as revealed earlier this week. However, it will also be a Game-Key Card, Nintendo's controversial physical media.</p>

		<p>Galactic Civilizations IV Expansion Pass 2 is kicking off with some new DLC on December 4th, with Stardock Entertainment announcing the Tales of the Terran Alliance content. This is just the first of five DLCs that will make up Galactic Civilizations IV Expansion Pass 2, with more coming in 2026 and 2027. Those are Federations &amp; Empire and Ascension, both penned in for 2026, followed by Hegemon and Underworld which are both scheduled for 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="Galactic Civilizations IV - Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B-JwUI8D5lU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“This expansion is a love letter to&nbsp;Galactic Civilizations&nbsp;fans who have been asking for deeper human lore,”</em> said Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock Entertainment.<em> “Tales of the Terran Alliance delivers not just new gameplay mechanics, but a rich narrative experience that explores what it means to be human in a galaxy full of ancient, powerful civilizations.”</em></p>
<p>The Tales of the Terran Alliance DLC will put players in humanity’s shoes as it looks at an era where the human race was expanding through space. In the DLC you will be playing as the Xendar, get access to a new human technology tree, experience new narrative events that shape the journey of humanity, and get new weapons, planetary improvements, defenses, and more ship components. This DLC pack will cost $14.99, though the Expansion Pack 2 will offer a discount on the total price of all five packs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has popped back into the top 10, probably following the announcement of the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> keeps on swinging steadily at eighth.</p>

			<p>While Elder Scrolls fans can rest easy in the knowledge that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> is the next major new release from Bethesda to come, Fallout fans are left wondering when the studio will ever get to Fallout 5. <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-fully-greenlit-according-to-new-report/">It might be greenlit</a>, but for now, the only new stories coming out of the Fallout universe <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/">are from the Amazon TV show</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-dev-qa-bringing-ghoul-tv-show-game/">Fallout 76</a>, and mods like Fallout: London. What we do have to look forward to in the short term, however, are the reported remasters on the way, one for Fallout 3, and, according to a new claim, one for Fallout New Vegas.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, following an interview Todd Howard did with GQ Magazine to discuss the latest re-release of Fallout 4, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-broke-your-mods-heres-how-to-revert/">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a>, it was claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-fallout-3-remaster-hundreds-of-people-working-on/">Fallout 3 Remastered was in the works</a>, and would be a similar release to this year's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</p>



<p>Now, this time from Windows Central's Jez Corden, it's claimed that a Fallout New Vegas Remastered is also on its way. Replying to a post on X (formerly Twitter) where a user is commenting on the Fallout 3 Remastered rumors and the fact that it's not New Vegas, Corden replied with a simple "<em>Dw, nv is coming too</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This is not the first time this year we've heard claims that a New Vegas Remaster is on the way, <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiple-fallout-projects-in-the-works-including-one-everyone-wants/">as a rumor popped up this past July</a> claiming that multiple Fallout projects, including remasters of New Vegas and Fallout 3, were on their way. It's also worth remembering that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-registered-9-million-players/">saw more than 9 million players flock to the new version</a> of Bethesda's classic, and has remained one of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmzub6k25">the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far</a>.</p>



<p>Bethesda knows <a href="https://wccftech.com/players-spent-more-on-remakes-than-remasters-in-last-two-years-ampere-analysis/">there's money to be made in those remaster/remake hills</a>, and considering the fact that the popular Amazon TV series adaptation is taking its characters to New Vegas in the upcoming season two, the timing is perfect for Bethesda to kick off a slew of Fallout remasters.</p>



<p>So while you should still approach claims around these coming remasters with caution, since, technically, it's possible these remasters don't make it out the door, if you're wanting to revisit Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas in a new, Oblivion Remastered-style light, you can take comfort in the fact that there are a lot of signs pointing to both remasters happening, and hopefully, very soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty Lets You Manage Your Own Stable of Horses Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-announcement</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-lets-you-manage-your-own-stable-of-horses-next-year.1352641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Italian publishing house Leonardo Interactive has announced&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>, an "open-world horse racing management game" that's set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>will marry "adrenaline-fueled competition" with "the calming art of horse care", allowing you not only to hit the track but also to care for your horses while they're not racing.</p>

<p>Leonardo describes its game as "the first horse racing management game to feature realistic and scalable 3D graphics built in Unreal Engine", so you can perhaps expect a slightly higher degree of realism here than you might be used to from the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-management.jpg?itok=E0bZ_68k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-management.jpg?itok=Ke8hEzDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>looks like a pretty thorough horse racing management sim.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to, you can "directly control [your] horses in dynamic, real-time races", but if you prefer, you can also take a more strategic approach by "planning and managing races from above the track".</p>

<p>This being a horse racing management sim, you will, of course, be given control over pretty much every facet of your stable, including breeding, finances, training schedules, and facility upgrades.</p>

<p>It's all in service of simulating what Leonardo Interactive calls "a living, evolving world where every number and gene can make or break your success". The game will even let you take part in horse auctions, scout new horses for your stable, and "carefully plan your genetic bloodlines to breed the next generation of champions".</p>

<p>It wouldn't be much of a horse racing sim if you couldn't race on real tracks, of course, so&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty&nbsp;</em>will boast several licensed tracks "in stunning detail", including the likes of Ascot, Flemington, and Capannelle, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-horse-racing.jpg?itok=YmM81Ns3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-stable-equestrian-dynasty-horse-racing.jpg?itok=sWU3fPUB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to take direct part in races or approach them more strategically in&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're interested in checking out&nbsp;<em>Champions Stable: Equestrian Dynasty</em>, you'll be able to do so on "PC and consoles" in 2026. No more specific release date has been revealed, and we don't know exactly which consoles the game will appear on, either.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-steel-frontiers-announcement</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NCSoft and Sony have announced&nbsp;<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, an MMO spinoff of Guerrilla Games'&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series, and it'll offer a twist on the franchise's "signature hunting-action gameplay".</p>

<p>Since NCSoft is responsible for this game's development, it seems that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-mmo-canceled-report" rel="nofollow">reports of the project's cancellation</a> were greatly exaggerated (assuming this isn't a completely different Sony-NCSoft collaboration, that is), although it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>

<p>When the game does launch, it'll arrive on PC and mobile devices, and it'll give you the chance to experience the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series' robo-dino-hunting gameplay with your fellow hunters. Full crossplay will be supported as well, so you can play alongside your buddies on PC or mobile.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-steel-frontiers-gameplay.jpg?itok=AXypeg7J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-steel-frontiers-gameplay.jpg?itok=0FuKtcfh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is a "hunting-action" MMO from Sony and NCSoft.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>series' iconic hunting gameplay, you can also look forward to "deeply customizable combat and extensive player freedom", so it sounds as though the open-world component of the games will be maintained as well.</p>

<p>New mechanical creatures and "large-scale battles" will also be introduced as part of the new MMO, and since it's almost certainly a live service-style game, it's likely it will be updated over time with new monsters and quests to tackle.</p>

<p><em>Horizon Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is just one of the spinoff projects being made around Guerrilla's series; there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">live-action movie in development</a>, and as of late 2022, the studio was also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guerrilla-working-on-multiplayer-horizon-game" rel="nofollow">making a multiplayer spinoff</a> of its own (although it's possible&nbsp;<em>Steel Frontiers&nbsp;</em>is a reworked version of said project).</p>

<p>One project that certainly won't be taking its place alongside these spinoffs is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow">Tencent's&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which is currently defending itself in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-tencent-light-of-motiram-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">copyright and trademark infringement court case</a> brought by Sony.</p>




<p>We don't yet have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, but when it does arrive, it'll be available for PC, iOS, and Android. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

              <p>If you want to play the latest AAA titles with immersive visuals, or work on heavy creative projects like 4K editing or 3D rendering without pushing your machine to its limit, investing in a dedicated gaming laptop makes a lot of sense. The best options out there, however, don’t usually come cheap. In fact, those packed with next-gen internals and high-end specs often run well over $3,000. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Asus TUF F16 Gaming Laptop to $2,200. That’s after a massive 46% discount off its original MSRP</a>. It’s highly rated on the platform, and this early Black Friday deal is offering the perfect opportunity to snag it up without paying the full price. Best of all, the laptop comes with a bunch of free accessories that are sure to improve your gaming experience even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Run All Your Favorite Titles, or Push Creative Boundaries</h2>
<p>Starting off with the power; you’re getting the Intel Core i7-14650HX processor inside, which is capable of delivering turbo speeds up to 5.2GHz across 16 cores and 24 threads. You can trust it to not flinch even when you’re working on multiple resource-intensive tasks or gaming for long.</p>
<p>The processor is paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU (8GB GDDR7). It’s much more powerful than the RTX 4070 generation, and you can expect smoother performance with advanced ray tracing and DLSS 4, even for the upcoming games. There’s a whopping 64GB of DDR5 RAM (5600MHz) to help you multitask during your busy days with ease.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span> Pokopia</span></i></a><span> is making a play for the cozy game market next year by giving us what is essentially an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>game in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. You play as a Ditto that transforms into a human and attempts to spruce up an island until it’s a suitable community for Pokémon. Most of these monsters look the same as they ever have, but in a new trailer, we learned the game will introduce new forms for some old Pokémon, including a white Pikachu that’s never been in the main games.</span></p> <p><span>This news came as part of an extended </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>trailer that gave fans an overview of how Ditto will work with its growing Pokémon community to create a new home for them on an abandoned island. Some of the big announcements included that Ditto can transform into other Pokémon like Lapras and Dragonite to get around the island faster, the citizens of your island will give you quests that seem to fill out the mysteries of the island, and through Gameshare you can play cooperatively with others, even across Switch console generations, without each person having to own the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But perhaps most excitingly, throughout the trailer we saw a few new forms for monsters like a moss-covered Snorlax, a graying Tangrowth that acts as the game’s Professor, a paint-covered Smeargle, and most mysteriously, a white PIkachu that is shown powering up the street lights on the island.</span></p>  <p><span>This pale, droopy-eared Pikachu is called Peakychu. It’s a female Pikachu, as you can see from her heart-shaped tail, but why does she look like she’s ill? We don’t know yet, but I want to help her however I can. Coincidentally, there was </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_unused_Pok%C3%A9mon_and_character_designs#White_Pichu"><span>supposed to be a White Pichu</span></a><span> in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span>, but it was scrapped in favor of the spiky-eared variant that made it into the RPGs as an event giveaway. Given that some of these monsters’ standard forms are probably recruitable villagers, it’s good that the actual characters have some defining features. I wouldn’t be surprised if these variants end up in games like </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> or the RPGs as a bit of cross-promotion. At the very least, </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>seems to have some intriguing mysteries happening alongside all the town management. We’ll find out more about Peakychu and these other forms when </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>launches on March 5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Plenty of details have been revealed by Nintendo for the upcoming Pokémon Pokopia title, though the most intriguing is the mysterious variants of popular Pokémon.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on March 4, 2026</a>, for Nintendo Switch 2, though the game will also be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable in a specific way on the original console</a>, and tasks players, playing as a humanoid Ditto, with restoring a barren environment to attract Pokémon to the region.</p>



<p>While new gameplay mechanics were showcased, showing the game will very much be akin to the Animal Crossing franchise, new variants of Pikachu and Snorlax were shown at the end of the new trailer, raising plenty of questions.</p>







<h2 id="h-meet-peakychu-amp-mosslax-in-pokemon-pokopia">Meet Peakychu &amp; Mosslax in Pokémon Pokopia</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Weird. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The extended trailer for Pokémon Pokopia, November 13, featured the emergence of a mysterious, monotone Pikachu, appearing almost ghostlike, before the camera zoomed in on a Snorlax covered in moss from head to toe.</p>



<p>Though the trailer itself didn’t showcase too many details, Pokémon’s <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/New-Details-Revealed-for-Relaxing-Life-Simulation-Game-Pokemon-Pokopia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official press site</a> had slightly more information about the ‘peculiar  Pokémon’, including that the pair are called Peakychu and Mosslax, respectively.</p>



<p>The duo, along with Professor Tangrowth, who was seen extensively in the trailer, and Smearguru, a variant of Smeargle, will be encounterable in Pokémon Pokopia—but it’s not clear in what capacity they will appear, nor do we know if they are variant species.</p>







<p>More will surely be revealed on Pokémon Day next year, which takes place just before the release of Pokémon Pokopia and will launch celebrations of the franchise’s 30th anniversary, so we’ll have to be patient until then.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon Pokopia Will be Available on Original Nintendo Switch, Sort of]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-will-be-available-on-original-nintendo-switch-sort-of.1352611/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh details have been revealed for Pokémon Pokopia,&nbsp;and, while the game is advertised as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, it will be available to play on the original Nintendo Switch—with a catch.</p>



<p>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on March 4, 2026</a>, shortly after Pokémon Day celebrates 30 years of the franchise, and it could be one of a few major Pokémon titles releasing next year.</p>



<p>Initially revealed in September’s Nintendo Presents, Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;is a fresh twist for the franchise with a new style of game, and it turns out that original Switch players won’t be left out after all.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Fun with friends. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDh6COB0Nqk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extended trailer</a> for Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;released by Nintendo, it was announced the title will support Gameshare, and that the feature would allow players on Nintendo Switch to join the fun.</p>



<p>However, the title will not be able to be purchased on the original Nintendo Switch. Instead, the only way to play on the older generation of the console will be through the Gameshare feature with somebody nearby using a Nintendo Switch 2 hosting the game.</p>



<p>In small print for the GameShare feature on the trailer, Nintendo states that games “can only be played during that GameShare session” and “up to two players can play via GameShare simultaneously.” Crucially, it’s added that “Nintendo Switch 2 system(s) must initiate a GameShare session.”</p>



<p>To access the GameShare feature, a Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account are required on both devices, and the progress will be saved on the host’s world. There’s no ability for a player on the original Nintendo Switch to save any progress from the session.</p>







<p>Although perhaps not the news original Nintendo Switch players had hoped for, it does open the door slightly for players to get a feel for Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;if a friend or relative owns the game before splashing out for the title and a Nintendo Switch 2 console themselves.</p>

Developer Guerrilla Games <a href="https://www.guerrilla-games.com/read/ncsoft-reveals-mobile-mmorpg-horizon-steel-frontiers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the studio is "busily working on" new experiences where players can "hunt machines in the world of Horizon."</p><p>"More on that to come," the developer said.</p><p>Guerrilla has not announced any new Horizon games, but it's been reported for some time now that the developer is making a multiplayer Horizon game. Reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reiterated this today</a> following the announcement of the MMO. The multiplayer Horizon game is "Guerrilla's next big project," he said.</p><p>The Horizon series debuted in 2017 with Horizon: Zero Dawn. The game came to PC in 2020, and a sequel, Forbidden West, launched in 2022. A VR game called Horizon: Call of the Mountain launched in 2023, while another spin-off, Lego Horizon Adventures, came out in 2024.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/" data-ref-id="1100-6535520">Horizon movie is now in the works</a> and could begin filming in 2026 and release in 2027.</p><p>In other Horizon news, Sony and Tencent are currently beefing in court over the game Light of Motiram. Sony claims the game is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">"slavish clone" of the Horizon series</a> and rips off a number of elements from Sony's game franchise.</p><p>As for Sony's PS5, the console just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">reached a new sales milestone</a> and celebrated its fifth anniversary.

NCSoft is developing Horizon Steel Frontiers in collaboration with Guerrilla, which developed 2017's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and 2022's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, and Sony Interactive Entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>Horizon Steel Frontiers is set in a new area called the Deadlands, where specialized machine hunters roam. NCSoft says the game "builds on Horizon's signature hunting-action gameplay while introducing advanced MMORPG systems, featuring deeply customizable combat and extensive player freedom."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN-NNgWIyIQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bN-NNgWIyIQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In this Horizon game, you won't be playing as Aloy – instead, you will create your own machine hunter with deep customization options inspired by tribes and factions from the single-player games, according to NCSoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though the game will be playable on PC, Guerrilla studio and art director Jan-Bart Van Beek says in the game's announcement video that Horizon Steel Frontiers has been built specifically for mobile, meaning this likely isn't the same <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/10/03/horizon-zero-dawn-remakeremaster-and-horizon-multiplayer-game-reportedly-in-development">rumored live-service multiplayer Horizon project Guerrilla is reportedly working on</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Players take on the role of machine hunters chasing opportunity in a region called the Deadlands," Van Beek says. "This is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. You're sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines, and other times competing with rival tribes – or fighting over resources – and that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script."&nbsp;</p><p>Van Beek says that at the heart of the Horizon story is the search for balance between humanity, nature, and technology, and that sometimes it's harmony and sometimes conflict, but it always creates a world of mystery and beauty.&nbsp;</p><p>Horizon Steel Frontiers executive producer Sung-Gu Lee says the game's core concept can be summed up in one phrase: "the thrill of taking down colossal machines."&nbsp;</p><p>"Our main focus is designing a new combat experience tailored for an MMORPG," Lee says. "In Horizon Steel Frontiers, we've added unique original gameplay elements to the process of taking down giant machines. For example, after destroying a specific part of a machine, you can quickly approach and climb onto it using the pullcaster and set traps on the damaged part and inflict status effects."&nbsp;</p><p>Lee says you can even pick up weapons knocked off of machines and carry them on your mount to use in subsequent fights. He continues, adding, "At the heart of giant machine hunts are two core values: cooperation and strategy."&nbsp;</p><p>"Players must take on their roles, act strategically, and work together seamlessly," Lee says."These combat mechanics truly shine in large-scale battles, offering the scale and dynamism that only an MMORPG can provide."</p><p><strong>Here's a look at gameplay from Horizon Steel Frontiers:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>NCSoft did not reveal a release date or whether Horizon Steel Frontiers is paid or free-to-play, but it will be playable on PC and mobile devices when it launches in the future.</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/horizon_zero_dawn/b/playstation4/archive/2017/02/19/horizon-zero-dawn-review-game-informer.aspx">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/horizon-forbidden-west/leaping-to-greater-heights">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you interested in playing Horizon Steel Frontiers?

            <p>The first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> community event, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">which asks players to contribute resources to unlock a new explorable area of the game</a>, has been made substantially harder mere hours after launch as the playerbase was completing it too quickly.</p>
<p>Community manager Ossen addressed the sudden change on the official Arc Raiders Discord server, writing: "You have been progressing the unlock event much faster than we anticipated. We had no idea all of you would be so altruistic for the Stella Montis cause, and you are donating so much more than we could imagine. We want this event to be experienced by Raiders all over the world and therefore we are raising the bar to unlock Stella Montis expecting you to surprise us again."</p>
<p>Eurogamer can confirm the change was substantial, seeing firsthand the progress bar had reached at least 8 percent completion this morning before it shot all the way back down to around 1 percent. So, you may have to wait a little longer to play on the new map: Stella Montis.</p>

</figure>
<p>If you were wondering why the progress bar was completed so quickly, there are a few explanations. The first is the simplest: the game is incredibly popular and Embark didn't expect people to be so keen to throw resources at this event.</p><p>It could also be down to the resources required. The community event requires players to contribute basic resources, like fabric and plastic. These aren't hard resources to gather, in fact Nugget (the resource gathering chicken in your raider hideout) gathers them for free in large quantities. As such, dedicated players have accrued hundreds of these resources. Personally speaking, I had over 600 of each basic resource this morning, and was easily able to contribute plenty to the effort.</p>
<p>This all begs the question: when will the community event conclude? Well, it's safe to assume players will have at least a few days to log in and contribute to the community event. The rewards for doing so are a mystery right now, but if you contribute a relatively small amount you can earn merit points that'll be redeemable when the event concludes. So get to it!</p>
<p>If this sounds exciting to you, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders review</a> to figure out if it's the game for you! In it, reviewer Rick Lane describes it as: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The first time I saw <em>Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2</em> in action was during <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-is-getting-a-sequel-1833479366?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a preview demonstration during the 2019 Game Developers Conference</u></a>. I watched a member of the development team leap around the rooftops of Seattle and return to an apartment for a conversation with a grimy side character named Dale. The next time I saw that digital apartment was in 2025. It was mostly unchanged from how it looked back then, but the final product I was playing was one that had undergone a truly hellish development cycle.</p><p>Was this the same game? Was this truly the long-awaited sequel to the 2004 cult-classic I loved? Those felt like complicated questions to consider. As I grimaced and pushed my way through <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, the disappointments I felt—this was in many ways absolutely not a fitting successor game—gave way to a begrudging acceptance. This wasn’t what I expected, and it wasn’t what most fans wanted, but I am not sure if that even matters. There was something interesting happening here, and I thought that, perhaps, if I could sit and play the game that was actually in front of me, there might even be something good. </p><p>When we play a game, we’re arguably playing two games at once. The first is the thing on the screen—Kratos swinging his chain blades at a legion of monsters, our latest <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> protagonist leaping from the rafters upon unsuspecting targets—and the other is the game in our minds. The game in our minds is hazy and messily defined. It is the game we imagined when our best friend said “Bro, you need to play this.” It is the game we were told about in magazines. It is this latter game that I am trying to ignore as I play <em>Bloodlines 2</em>. The game I was promised in that dark hotel room demonstration in 2019 is not the game on my screen. But what is it?</p><p>The hard truth of <em>Bloodlines 2</em> is that the most obvious answer to this question is that the game is a mess. It is a game whose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13KyBCKhVac&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>troubled development</u></a> (starting development with Hardsuit Labs before bleeding key writers and project leads and ultimately ending up finished by the team at The Chinese Room) is impossible to ignore. The final product was kitbashed together like a puzzle whose final image was made by smashing the wrong pieces into place such that they finally lock together anyway. <em>Bloodlines 2</em> feels obviously wrong.</p><p>But it mostly feels wrong when the game in front of players is held up to the game they imagined, or the game they were promised. When trying to decide what a game is, a player or critic doesn’t just ask themselves “what is this game doing?” but also “what is it <em>trying</em> to do?” With <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, its title is a statement of intent: “We’re trying to be a sequel to the first game.”</p><p>In this, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> largely fails. <em>Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines </em>was a messy game in its own right—the promising story gives way to a mostly linear and vaguely racist final act— but it generally functioned the way that you’d expect a roleplaying game to work. You created a character by choosing some initial stats and what mysterious vampire clan you belonged to and then were thrust into a moody mystery plot in what was, at the time, modern day California. The game world was peppered with various quests to accept, with outcomes depending on player choice. There were dialogue trees that you could navigate, sometimes using stats or your vampiric powers to affect the outcome of a conversation. You know, a roleplaying game!</p><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> has minimal character creation. You choose a gender and your starting vampire clan, but this hardly has an impact on the game. There is a lack of stat management entirely and, at least for the main segments of the game, essentially no way for the way you navigate dialogue trees to change depending on your powers. There is a branching story, but the hub lacks meaningfully structured side quests; you can take some missions to kill rogue ghouls or deliver various packages around the city, but this is not a game world packed with interesting side quests with unique characters. It was so dull that after a point, I avoided doing anything but the main quest at all. If the goal was to make a comparable roleplaying game to the original <em>Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines</em>, this game is mostly a failure.</p><figure></figure><p>This sucks, and accepting the reality of the situation can be hard. For players eager to find something on par with the cult-classic they’re nostalgic for, it’s positively heartbreaking. If you’re looking for an in-depth roleplaying experience where your character customizations can drastically alter the outcome of quests, you’ll need to look elsewhere. The promise made by the <em>Bloodlines 2’</em>s title is a false one. It wants to be the guy but it ain’t that guy. And yet, in spite of the bluntness with which I report this to you all, I’m here to tell you that I am actually very happy I played this game. This might even be the most interesting game I’ve played all year.</p><p>The moment you move on from the question of “what was this trying to do?” and the disappointment it brings, you are immediately free to engage with the actual goddamn game. For all the letdown and limitations, I think there’s something here worth engaging with. It’s hardly revolutionary, but it is interesting, and in a games ecosystem defined by free-to-play attention grabbers and rote prestige formula fare, a middling seven out of ten game manages to feel downright refreshing. If you sit and play what’s here, removing it from a long lineage of hype and expectation, you might have a good time. </p><p>So what is <em>Bloodlines 2</em> actually doing? Two things, and while neither feels entirely realized to their full potential, they mix together into a strangely compelling cocktail. I meant it when I said there’s two games here. You follow your customized character the Nomad, an Elder vampire waking up in modern day Seattle who finds themselves thrust into a new generation of vampiric politics. While there’s a snowy, moody nighttime hub to explore, the core experience is not one of diverging side quest chains and reactive dialogue.&nbsp; You don’t really roleplay, but do something closer to a feature-light immersive sim in the vein of the <em>Dishonored</em> series. </p><p>Once <em>Bloodlines 2</em> pushes through the initial stage-setting and starts to drive you from one infiltration set piece to another—a construction site full of anarchic vampires, a nightclub packed with human sacrifices and the violent devotees of an egotistic artist—it starts to forge an identity other than “sequel to that game I like from over twenty years ago.” The powers you unlock for the Nomad are mostly bent towards combat and stealth exploration. You can mark targets with a blood curse and make them explode from the inside out, literally drag them into a shadow realm, hurl blood-forged daggers at them, or mark points to instantly teleport back to in the event you’re spotted in enemy territory. Mixing and matching these skills can create moments where you truly feel like the most dangerous undead son of a bitch in all of Seattle.</p><p>These various <em>Dishonored</em>-esque sequences are threaded together by a narrative that gets quite compelling if you surrender your initial disappointment. Warring vampiric nobles clash with both each other and with chaotic “Anarchs” for supremacy of Seattle, all while the sudden influx of vampire hunters into the city threatens to ignite a purge. The Nomad has been marked with a mysterious sigil and let loose into the city for purposes unknown. And oh yeah, there’s another vampire in your head too, a snub-nosed detective who shares your body.</p><figure></figure><p>From time to time, your perspective shifts to that of “Fabien,” the Malkavian vampire detective who somehow is riding shotgun in your body. He’s been in Seattle for centuries, and the emergence of a strange murderer hunting down the city’s vampires seems connected to a long unsolved case from the 1920s. At periodic moments of the story, you flashback to play through Fabien’s old cases.</p><p>These sections can vary from recent detective adventures to cases from a century ago, and it all plays out like a bloodier, more magical Raymond Chandler tale. Armed with powers unique to Fabien—the ability to force characters to see you as someone else, a power that allows you to talk to inanimate objects—suddenly there’s actual dialogue puzzles and more playfulness to the trees that you navigate. Let’s say there’s a club you need to enter to find your next clue, but the bouncer won’t let you in. Muddling his mind so that he perceives you as someone else is a fun course of action, but when you use this power, there’s no sense of <em>who</em> he sees you to be. “How was today’s shoot?” he might ask, and you need to figure out what he means. Does he think you’re a movie star? A politician shooting a commercial? A hunter?</p><figure></figure><p>These dialogue puzzles are ultimately more linear than their first impression. There’s not really any penalty for navigating the options incorrectly; you can always try again if you fail. But they fit the character while offering a playfulness that the Nomad’s initial dialogue trees lack. Need to get some files from the evidence drawer in the police department? Well, you can’t just open it. You need to use your powers to talk to it and coax out permission to browse the station’s reports. These sections tease of a more functional roleplay experience, and while returning to the Nomad can be frustrating after this, the ways in which Fabien’s old investigations mix with the Nomad’s ongoing foray into Seattle’s bloody politics is enthralling.</p><p>Fabien’s sections are a highlight, but as <em>Bloodlines 2</em> progresses and moves away from its mediocre starting hours, there’s a lot to like. You might infiltrate a vampire hunter operation at the docks as the Nomad, culminating in a BioWare choice about whether to turn their leader into your own vampiric thrall. These moments aren’t many but can drastically alter <em>Bloodlines 2’</em>s ending. In another moment, you’ll flash to Fabien’s early life as an investigator in the Roaring Twenties or guide him through a more modern investigation that culminates with him having a conversation with a dying iPhone. Don’t die on me! Not before you tell me who the killer is!</p><p>None of this ever feels as cohesive as the first game, and the experience is not as replayable or customizable, but there’s a fun story here for the taking. But you’re only going to find it if you’re devoted to answering that ever-important question: “Okay, what is this game actually doing?”</p><p>I want to be clear here that I’m not saying <em>Bloodlines 2</em> gets better and that you “just need to play ten hours to get there, man.” I’m saying that this experience is there essentially <em>from the start</em> if you want to engage with it. This is true of all games, and all it really takes is a willingness to discard certain assumptions about what you want or what a game needs to be. Yes, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> doesn’t live up to the implicit promise of its title, or to the expectations many players might have for it, but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing there.</p><p>I’m not saying people should push through the game if they aren’t enjoying it. That’s a matter of economics–is this thing worth the money I’ve paid for it, and am I willing to push forward beyond my initial impression? It’s a bit crass of a calculus, but one that I can accept. But I think that if you are able to put yourself aside, shifting your tastes and desires and embracing an honest assessment of what’s before you—be it a game or film or anything else—there’s usually artistry to enjoy. Most art, even the worst of it, holds some beauty when viewed at the right angle.</p><p>It is possible to bring too much of ourselves to an experience, to insist too heavily on our own biases when we play a game. As a games critic, like others charged with playing a game professionally, it is important to develop the particular skill of keeping your finger off the scale when you’re examining a game. To play a game in this way means engaging in a conversation with the work and by extension the people who make it. Like any conversation, it is possible to turn the subject too insistent on yourself, your feelings, or your desires. As a writer, I eventually have to speak before an audience, but there’s a portion of a critic’s work that must involve active listening. This only happens if you don’t hog the conversation.</p><p>I was gripped with deep frustration when I started <em>Bloodlines 2</em>. Pushing that frustration aside, accepting that what I wanted was not what was there, allowed me to see what actually was. It’s a mess of a game, but within the chaos is an exciting story that I’m going to be thinking about even after I’m done writing this. Whatever next game comes along that frustrates me—even if it pisses me off—will receive the same courtesy. In return, I will receive the opportunity to have fun and perhaps even grow a little bit as a person.</p><p>I just need to honestly ask “what’s happening here?”</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-reveals-peculiar-new-forms-in-extended-10-minute-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-pokopia-reveals-peculiar-new-forms-in-extended-10-minute-trailer.1352569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Today we got an in-depth look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive which launches on 5th March 2026.</p>
<p>And the Extended Trailer didn't skimp on details; in Pokopia, you'll be teaming up with Professor Tangrowth to help restore an island that was once populated by people and Pokémon. That involves rebuilding structures, watering the grass, setting up fishing rods, laying rocks, grass, and flowers, and tons more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play with the Pokémon you bring to your island, but you'll also need to help some 'mons adjust to life or get out of sticky situations. You'll need to fulfill requests for them, which in turn will help develop the island.</p>

<p>Your Ditto will also be able to transform into other Pokémon, and in this trailer, we saw the little blob (well, blob disguised as a human) become a Lapras and a Dragonite.</p>
<p>Lapras allows Ditto to travel to other islands via the ocean, while Dragonite lets Ditto travel even further, flying to the furthest corners of the world.</p>

<p>Your Ditto avatar also doesn't need to stay pink, either; you'll be able to customise your character as you see fit, with different outfits, hairstyles, and hair colours.</p>
<p>And multiplayer sounds fantastic, too — four friends can play together to help build structures or just show off their islands. And Pokémon Pokopia is GameShare ready, meaning you can play with a friend who has a Switch 1 <em>or</em> 2 and who doesn't own the game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a83aa75418966"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a83aa75418966/pokemon-pokopia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest reveal came at the end of the trailer — three brand new Pokémon forms for a few beloved 'mons. If you don't count Professor Tangrowth, that is.</p>
<p>Pikachu, Snorlax, and Smeargle are each getting a unique form in Pokopia names Peakychu, Mosslax, and Smearguru. What role they'll play in the game remains to be seen, but let us say that, right now, Mosslax is a <em>mood</em>.</p>

<p>Today's trailer was teased by The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-gets-march-2026-release-date-brand-new-trailer-coming-this-week">back on Tuesday</a>, when it also revealed the 5th March 2026 release date. We also know this will be the first game published by Nintendo in the West to be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-pokopia-is-nintendos-first-game-key-card-release">a Game-Key Card release</a>.</p>

The console is Analogue’s reimagined and upgraded version of the Nintendo 64 with 4K output and full compatibility with original N64 cartridges from every region, including both PAL and NTSC versions.</p><p>Exactly a year after the original announcement, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">Analogue shared more details about the Analogue 3D</a> including the console’s design, which looks similar to the N64’s. As with the company’s other <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">consoles like the Pocket</a>, the Analogue 3D uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc">FPGA technology</a> to exactly replicate the functionality of Nintendo’s original hardware which has proven to be notoriously difficult to accurately emulate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">even for Nintendo</a>.

However, Analogue has expanded production runs of its previous consoles, and has released several versions of the Analogue Pocket in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">different colors</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197135/analogue-pocket-aluminum">finishes</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh shit, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> comes out tomorrow, November 14th. As you'd expect, Activision have been busy yelling about it amid the deafening din of about 10,000 other games whizzing past per minute. There are some launch day patch notes and a rundown of what the mode you unlock if you beat the single-player bit involves. Let's take a gander.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes">day one patch notes</a> can be found here, running through the myriad of adjustments which have been made since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">the beta</a>. There's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFtHucpVlJM">video</a> too. Things like the strength of rotational aim assist, increases to the rate at which weapon XP's earned, and a general slowing dow of player slideage are talked about. "Adjusted mantling for smoother, faster, and more consistent mantles" is fun to read, especially if you assume it means mantling in <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mantling">the Elder Scrolls sense</a>. There are also specific sections for multiplayer and zombies, if only one of those is your bag.</p>
<p>I'm not here for any of that, though. You see, a lot of the notes focus on outlining adjustments to certain weapons, and the formatting's very much the text on a screen equivalent of a candlelit diner. "My name's M15 MOD 0," an assault rifle says coyly. "I've gotten a new mid damage range. This will make it more difficult to achieve a 4-shot kill with headshots beyond close range." Ooh, saucy. May I pour a bit more wine for you to slurp up via one of your many attachments, which have also been tweaked?</p>
<p>They keep coming (ooh, Matron!). The MXR-17, the Peacekeeper Mark 1, the Ryden 45K, the Dravec 45, the M10 Breacher. Each showing off their fancy damage numbers and range stats, both old and new. They've changed, you see. "Do you love me now?" each asks. I dunno. You're just guns in a video game. That's a lot of commitment.</p>
<p>They're just too much, man. I've had to pull myself away and look at another Black Ops 7 thing Activision have been talking about this week.</p>

<p>As outlined in the dev chat above, it's called endgame. Basically, once you've finished Blops 7's campaign, you unlock a multiplayer mode revolving around a big fight with up to 32 players slugging it out across a huge map. Said map's a weird Frankenstein's monster of locations around fictional Call of Duty city-state <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a>, with maps from previous Blopses grafted onto it various places, for maximum nostalgia. "We wanted to continue the campaign in a replayable way," design director Kevin Drew.</p><p>There are "four escalating zones of difficulty" top work through, each of which has "more toxin, more enemies, harder challenges, and better rewards". You can also hop in with friends who haven't completed the campaign, so long as you have and are the host in order to invite them.</p>
<p>Oh no. Now all of those guns from before are asking me if I love them enough to invite them into endgame. Ah, uh, sorry, I'm gonna be washing my hair when Blops 7 launches at 5AM GMT / 12AM ET / 9PM PT on November 14th.</p>
