			<p>Hirogami is an origami platformer. What that means is that much of the world around you is made of paper, folded into elaborate shapes, and so are you. In fact, you can fold yourself into a variety of animal themed shapes to help you navigate your way through Hirogami’s levels, puzzles, and fights. But is it worth taking a gamble on, or should you just…fold?</p>
<p><iframe title="Hirogami | Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC &amp; PS5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBclwM6DNzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hiro is a little origami person who used to be able to fold himself into other forms. Unfortunately, he lost this ability when coming into contact with the blight that is ravaging the landscape, corrupting temples and animals alike. Now Hiro is stuck in his cool-origami-figure-with-a-cape self, so his self confidence isn’t great. Nevertheless, he’s still tasked with cleansing some corrupted temples and, whilst doing so, discovers that cleansing a corrupted animal will reawaken some of his missing power, allowing him to fold himself into the shape of that animal.</p>


<p>In addition to his humanoid form and just being a piece of paper, which is more useful than you might think, there are four animals you can shift into once you defeat them in-game. The armadillo can roll up into a ball and roll forward very quickly, handy for destroying obstacles and enemies alike, the frog can jump higher than all the other forms as well as spit sticky saliva at enemies, and the gorilla can smash things and swing on vines. The fourth form, the bird, only happens during certain gameplay sequences, and functions more like a fighter jet, complete with a boost and ranged attacks somehow.</p>


<p>You’ll be switching in and out of these forms regularly. The way it works I think is quite brilliant, with you holding the right trigger to flatten yourself into a simple piece of paper, then pressing a face button to refold yourself into your chosen form. Whilst you’re a piece of paper, you can also fit through tight gaps, float through the air, and ride up drafts. It’s a smart little bit of design, but it does have a few finicky little bits that get in the way. The most common one is that, when you’re unfolding into paper as you’re approaching something you need to break, you often find a corner of your now rectangular self goes under a little bit of scenery, which blocks you from transforming and forces you to back up again so you have space to transform. It’s a tiny little thing, but it happens so often and breaks the flow of the platforming.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the platforming is a bit simple anyway, so it starts to get repetitive after a few hours, especially once you’ve already unlocked all the animal forms. It’s a lot of fun initially, and switching between the forms multiple times to make it through a section can be very satisfying, but with the few control difficulties getting in the way, the challenge not really ramping up enough, and much of the stuff you’re doing being things you’ve done in other, more accomplished platformers, it just starts to get a little old after a while.</p>
<p>Combat is the same, but with one or two poorly considered enemies. One enemy just triggers a damaging shield when you get close, which it is happy to keep up for an extended period of time and retrigger almost immediately as you approach, making it a very annoying enemy to deal with. I’ve found that the best tactic in combat is to roll up into a ball as an armadillo and just charge into everything, both because it’s effective and because it’s good, chaotic fun – when there aren’t shielded enemies in the way, forcing me to switch to a frog and spit at them before I can hit them.</p>

<p>What doesn’t help either the combat or the platforming is the camera, though. It tries to frame the action on its own, without giving you control beyond tilting the camera, and that means the perspective can change from a pseudo third person view, &nbsp;to side scrolling, to awkward angles that feel slightly askew and make platforming a little more difficult to judge. There was one moment where the camera fully swung through the scenery as I was entering a new area, completely blocking the character and level from view, my only option was to continue going forward and hope it worked itself out before I hit a hazard or enemy, which it thankfully did. Similar things can happen during combat, where you can find yourself obscured by scenery, making it difficult to dodge incoming armadillos and apes. This fixed camera is at best inconvenient, but at its worst it can be an issue resulting in death.</p>
<p>One area where there is little to criticise is the aesthetic of the game. It’s gorgeous, whether you’re on the tilt-shift heavy overworld map or in one of the levels – it’s a very good looking game whichever way you look at it. What is a bit disappointing is the music, not because it isn’t good, but because there isn’t enough of it. The soundtrack repeats quite a bit and is often at odds with what’s going on in game. There shouldn’t be whimsical, happy music while I’m dealing with a giant lake of lava, for example. It just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<p>There are some oddities with how the game is presented as well. Levels are usually in a chain, at the end of the first level you can see the next area where you’ll be going to next, but it cuts to the overworld map after a brief chat or cutscene. Then you go start the next level, and you can see the end of the previous level, and you’re now in the next area, but for some reason you had to go to the world map to get here. It’s just a little strange. Another odd aspect is when you’re cleansing corrupted temples and altars. You have to go find a macguffin that is usually at the end of some platforming sequence, or a fight, or just something, but one or two just…aren’t. Just climb up a vine and there it is, no challenge involved. It just feels odd.</p>

<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e6c7f186c7aa/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in and the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has performed admirably, hitting the number 1 spot ahead of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have a couple more weeks or so to wait until the Switch 2 release, with Borderlands 4 scheduled to launch on <strong>3rd October</strong> on Nintendo's new console. It's difficult to say whether this early momentum spells good news for the Switch 2 release, but we'd wager the game probably won't sell half as much as it has on the PS5 (which commands 80% of the platform split).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> received its physical release, and although it's sitting fairly low down at number 25, the platform split just about favours the Switch at 52%. Jolly good.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>
Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update this year, but its solo developer LocalThunk has pushed it back in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">statement titled "I'm slow"</a>, the developer apologised for the delay, adding he "probably shouldn't have announced any date". "I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry," he said.
</p>
<p>
Since release, LocalThunk has been crunching alone on a balance patch and a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work slowly this year. "However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist," he said, "and it turns out that it's a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch."

<p>
LocalThunk said the prospect of rushing the work "felt terrible". "I am working slowly, but I like it that way," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realise how important that is for my process," he continued. "I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of 'work' for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don't want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets."
</p>
<p>
As such, the 1.1 update will be "done when it's done", and will be available for free across all platforms. It just won't be this year.
</p>
<p>
He concluded: "The Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game...Rest assured, it will happen."
</p>
<p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.

<p>This week, there are a few notable arrivals, including new Dying Light game The Beast. But will it be The Best? Are there any fans here excited for it?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Testing on the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started</a> via the BF Labs platform last week, and thanks to YouTube user Tomski, we've already got a 15-minute leaked gameplay video to check out. The first impression isn't exactly great, as this looks too much like Call of Duty's Warzone, according to most fans.  Of course, that may change when they actually get to play it.</p>



<p>One of the defining features of the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode is supposed to be destruction, which has been more or less synonymous with the franchise ever since the release of 2008's Bad Company. Beyond that, the mode retains Battlefield's trademark squad system. Each squad (so far, there's no talk of a solo or even a duo mode) selects its classes before the match, and the chosen class cannot be changed during the match. Players begin with two gadgets from their class and can level up during each match, gaining access to special traits, such as the Assault class being able to equip an armor plate more quickly. Experience is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Additionally, finding Intel Cases scattered throughout the map will yield experience to the entire squad.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 battle royale" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUfMY9pAb0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode also features a slight twist on the regular shrinking circle formula, or at least on how it affects players. Whereas most circles slowly damage those players on the outside, allowing for tactics such as sneaking from behind the circle, here the circle will instantly kill every player upon contact, therefore eliminating such strategies.</p>



<p>The rest is fairly standard fare for the genre. Squads will be randomly assigned missions that can provide powerful rewards, but players must always be on the lookout because those rewards will be air-dropped in and could technically be stolen by other squads. </p>



<p>There's no word or even rumor on when the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode will be released. It will likely depend on this testing phase; given that it will miss the main game's launch (slated for October 10) anyway, it doesn't make sense to rush it before it's ready and the players have provided their own feedback. </p>

But Mario Tennis Fever is the first all-new Mario sports game for Switch 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568010-mariotennisfever2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568010" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568010-mariotennisfever2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568010"></a><figcaption>Mario Tennis Fever (Nintendo)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568010-mariotennisfever2.jpg"></figure><p>Mario Tennis Fever will have local and online multiplayer for up to four players. It supports button/stick controls as well as motion controls with the Joy-Con 2. You'll be able to play as 38 different characters from the Mushroom Kingdom. The "Fever" moniker is a reference to this entry's new twist: Fever Rackets. There are 30 Fever Rackets with unique special effects such as freezing the court and shrinking your opponent's racket.</p><p>In the new Adventure Mode, monsters who inhabit a mysterious island turn Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies. Donkey Kong is also in the campaign, but he isn't a baby (sadly). Baby Mario and his friends will need to develop their tennis skills all over again to escape the island.</p><p>Other game modes include Trial Towers, Tournament, Ranked Matches, Online Room, and Mix It Up. Mario Tennis Fever will borrow from Super Mario Bros. Wonder by having Talking Flowers commentate matches in Tournament Mode and by introducing Wonder Effects to Mix It Up Mode.</p><hr><h3>Mario Sports Games for Nintendo Switch</h3><p>The last Mario Tennis game, Mario Tennis Aces, released back in 2018 and was the first Mario sports title for the original Switch, too. Since the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible, you can play the trio of Mario sports games for Switch on the new console: Mario Tennis Aces, Mario Golf: Super Rush, and Mario Strikers: Battle League.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Tennis-Aces-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B078XYF9SV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Tennis Aces</a> -- $51.87 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Mario+Tennis+Fever+Preorders+Are+Live+-+First+Mario+Sports+Game+For+Switch+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-09-14+22%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-14+22%3A01%3A38&amp;fnarticle_id=6534725&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FNintendo-Mario-Golf-Super-Rush-Nintendo-Switch-Games%252F432567681%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide%2F1100-6534725%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Golf: Super Rush</a> -- $46.49 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09SP2RMDG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> -- $52.69 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568012-mariosports.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568012" data-ratio="0.53883495145631" data-width="1030" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568012-mariosports.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568012"></a><figcaption>Mario Sports games for Nintendo Switch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568012-mariosports.png"></figure><h2>More Nintendo Direct Game Preorders</h2><p>Along with the new Mario games, Nintendo announced release dates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/" data-ref-id="1100-6530754">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/" data-ref-id="1100-6534713">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-on-track-2026-venom-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-on-track-for-2026-venom-game-still-in-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1297677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumors surrounding Insomniac's Marvel's Wolverine game are heating up. Earlier this month, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a State of Play could show off gameplay for the first time later this month. Last week, Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-looking-fantastic-according-playtesters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that he learned the game is being extremely well-received by internal playtesters, and a trailer is just about ready, although it might be shown off at The Game Awards in December instead of the aforementioned State of Play.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvels-wolverine-aims-2026-release-venom-project-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st</a>, through its anonymous sources, is assuring fans that Marvel's Wolverine is very much on track to be released next year. The report did not add anything else about the upcoming debut of the Canadian mutant; however, it does shed some new light on Insomniac's other project: <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-venom-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venom</a>.</p>



<p>Firstly, MP1st says the game is very much in development. Much like Marvel's Wolverine, Venom was the subject of Insomniac's leak, and there were fears that the project might have been paused or even canceled. MP1st's sources add that Eddie Brock should be the host of the alien symbiote this time around, after what happened in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, where Peter Parker and later Harry Osborn were its hosts. According to the report, Brock should be portrayed more closely to the comic book character than Venom's live action film trilogy (where actor Tom Hardy played Brock).</p>



<p>Insomniac's Venom game would also see the return of Carnage. Players glimpsed this in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, when Cletus Kasady, the leader of the Crimson Hour cult, leaves Peter Parker and Yuri Watanabe with the following words: <em>'And when the Crimson Hour rolls over this Earth, it shall bring truth, judgement, and carnage.'</em> </p>



<p>Of course, seeing Carnage in a Venom game makes perfect sense, since the two are closely related (in general Marvel lore, Carnage is Venom's darker, more powerful and destructive offspring). It should be noted that while Insomniac and Sony confirmed Marvel's Wolverine a long time ago, no such confirmation ever came for Carnage. The leaks confirmed its existence, but as always, we'll have to wait for an official reveal to be sure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.” That’s the very obvious understatement that announced the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nfso8x/please_read_rhelldivers_has_been_reopened_a/">reopening</a> of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme">inscribed messages</a> on the casings of several bullets found at the crime scene. One of those read “Hey fascist! Catch!” accompanied by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow, and three down arrows, a reference to the code to call down the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">500KG Bomb stratagem</a> in the cooperative shooter<em> Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, within minutes the official <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/">subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777614/discord-charlie-kirk-shooting-tyler-robinson">Discord</a> servers were thrown into chaos. Moderators quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nf6g7e/rhelldivers_is_locked_temporarily_requests_to/">locked</a> the Helldivers subreddit, pointing to a high number of posts that violated its rule against “Real-World Political Discussions.” Similarly, references to Robinson, Kirk, or the 500KG Bomb stratagem were quickly deleted on the Discord server, and some users speculated the code had been flagged for autodeletion. (Arrowhead Game Studios, makers of the Helldivers series, hasn’t released a public statement about the incident and didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Users merely asking why the subreddit was locked were shut down — “We are not allowed to discuss, I would suggest looking elsewhere,” one user was told.</p><p>Online and in conversations with <em>The Verge</em>, Helldivers fans mostly seemed confused and a little concerned about what might come along with all of this sudden attention. “I just don’t want to see a community I love get slandered to no fault of their own,” one Discord user, Inferionix, wrote.</p><p>Helldivers is hardly the first piece of media tied to an act of violence; the Columbine High School shooting famously put an unwelcome spotlight on <em>Doom</em> as commentators searched for a meaning behind the attack. But Kirk’s slaying inspired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/776293/charlie-kirk-maga-influencer-violence">widespread calls for retaliatory violence</a> by Republicans, making the still-ongoing search for Robinson’s motive particularly high-stakes. Even discussing it is risky, as lawmakers and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk are surveilling social media to police social media users’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/776840/charlie-kirk-death-social-media-jawboning">responses to Kirk’s death</a>, demanding firings at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777664/elon-musk-charlie-kirk-satya-nadella-fire">employers including Microsoft</a>. The subreddit mods said in their reopening post that nobody was banned during the initial flood of shooting-related comments, but anyone who discusses it in the future will be.</p><p>One brief bastion where fans of the game could share their feelings was the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/">Helldivers 2</a> subreddit, which doesn’t have the same strict ban on real life political discussions. A megathread there, at least for a while, was filled mostly was fans marveling at just how surreal the situation was. “Waking up and hearing a sitting governor of the United States say ‘Notices bulge OwO whats this?’ was a goddamn flashbang,” Reddit user Snaxwheels wrote, referring to one of the other, non-Helldivers-related inscriptions. But eventually that thread was also removed after moderators felt it had gotten out of hand.</p><p>Some posters there expressed concern that the attention could reignite the culture war around violent video games. One even pointed out that RFK Jr. had recently revived a largely dismissed theory <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-kennedy-says-nih-is-studying-possible-causes-of-u-s-gun-violence">linking violent games to school shootings</a>. Isadora, an active community member who spoke with <em>The Verge</em>, was more dubious. “Givin [sic] the short news cycles and the fact that such a large portion of MAGAs youth base are among the [conservative games streamer] Asmongold/gamergate type I don’t see the admin and its media machine coming super hard against the game itself.”</p><p>One outstanding question is what — if anything — Robinson thought about Helldiver’s politics. The series, which draws from Robert Heinlein’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> and Paul Verhoeven’s film adaptation, is a satire where players take the role of brainwashed military grunts fighting to spread “managed democracy” for a quasi-fascist Super Earth government. Isadora calls the gameplay the biggest draw, but “its politics is what made me fall in love with it,” they said. “I’m a big Paul Verhoeven fan and <em>Starship Troopers</em> was one of my favorites.”</p><p>As with other satires on authoritarianism, like <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, there’s a persistent discussion about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/helldivers-2-fascism-satire-debate-rcna140653">whether some players get the joke</a>. Isadora, largely, thinks they do. “I’m sad that this community has been drug into this as I think the game’s ironic criticism of fascism is a great outlet for so many people,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “It reflects negatively on a community that largely understands the criticisms it lays out.”<br>Helldivers will almost certainly go down as a footnote in Kirk’s death. But for some players, the strangeness of using the 500KG Bomb combo — or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dnnzys/for_democracy/">having it as a tattoo</a> — might linger. One Redditor suggested starting a petition to encourage Arrowhead to change the button command. Most disagreed, littering his message with thumbs down and big red X reactions. “Please don’t bring it here,” said the only reply.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777738/helldivers-community-reddit-discord-charlie-kirk#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/777738/helldivers-community-reddit-discord-charlie-kirk]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/miyamoto-explains-how-super-mario-bros-world-1-1-was-created.1297578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">World 1-1. We’ve all run, jumped, and brick-bashed our way through that familiar first stage. It seems so simple and second-nature to us now, but in this modern age of iterative entertainment, it is almost impossible to convey the magnitude of the leap Super Mario Bros. represented compared to everything that came before it. That cabinet, that game, might as well have descended from outer space. Its art, music, smoothness, and most of all, its level design were light-years beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World 1-1 introduced game design principles and a geometry of motion so perfectly calculated that it endures as one of the great works of the art form to this very day. But how was this miracle performed? Well, let us tell you, with the help of its creator, Shigeru Miyamoto.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The closest things to the opening level of the plumber’s first solo adventure up to that point were the stiff-but-serviceable screen-flipping Pitfall! and the gorgeous but terrible side-scrolling Pac-Land. Both were early essays on game design: Pitfall! presented a two-layered jungle with plenty of enemies and obstacles to jump over, but its flip-screen progression, huge non-linear map, strict time limit, and unintuitive treasure placement made it feel more like a puzzle to solve than a world to explore. Pac-Land was simply beautiful to behold and scrolled fairly cleanly in one direction, but the layout of the levels was haphazard and frustrating, and the controls felt maddening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, Mario was like exploring a realized, unified, and diverse world. Every step revealed new threats and sights. Leap over enemies or land on them? What’s in those question blocks? There’s a Starman?! Wait, hidden lives? A secret underground treasure room with its own music?! Wait, there’s a FIRE FLOWER?! You can hold B to run or blast turtles with pyrotechnics?! What even is this game????? But in order for all of this madness to be built, it first needed solid foundations, and that’s where World 1-1 really comes into its own — teaching you the basics in the most elegant manner possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Bros. isn’t nearly as big as it feels. In fact, World 1-1 measures only about 15 screens, including the underground room. It feels much bigger because over two or three screens, the tone of the terrain changes, from the intro section to leaping over pipes to platforming to pits. And yet within that tiny space, you have every power-up in the game, a hidden multi-coin block, a pair of traversable pipes, an invisible 1-UP, two enemy varieties, and a secret fireworks display.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/mario-1-1757588267401.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But perhaps the biggest secret of 1-1 is that it’s a school. And the course is Mario 101. In a 2015 interview with Eurogamer, Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka talked about the extraordinary degree of thought that went into the design, beginning with World 1-1’s iconic opening: a tiny Mario facing an empty plane. Then the team considered how to teach the player several skills at once: how to avoid enemies, how to destroy enemies, how question blocks work, and how to tell an enemy Goomba from a helpful mushroom. All three are accomplished within the first steps of this opening level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If a suspicious enemy appears,” states Miyamoto, “the player will need to jump over it.” Running forward into the first Goomba just kills you, a lesson a player need only learn once before discovering they’re much safer in the air. Then moving forward, the player discovers some low bricks and question blocks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we have a question block, they might just try to tap that as well,” continues Miyamoto. “If they see a coin, it will make them happy and they’ll want to try again.” Tapping the second block releases a mushroom that slides away, then bounces off a pipe to come hurtling at the character. The low ceiling makes it very hard to avoid, and the mushroom hits Mario, but instead of damaging him, it transforms him into <em>Super</em> Mario. In a matter of seconds, you’ve learned how both rewards and dangers work through the rest of Super Mario Bros.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/mario-2-1757588280610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“We kept simulating what the player would do”, Miyamoto explains. “So even within that one section, the player would understand the general concept of what Mario is supposed to be and what the game is about.” Even small details mattered. The opening screen’s first enemy was supposed to be a Koopa Troopa, but teaching the player the jump and kick movement necessary to overcome one worked less well at the beginning than they’d hoped. So they invented the simple-to-stomp Goomba (late in the game design process, according to Tetzuka) to help players understand the basics first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another valuable lesson, holding B to run before a long jump, is taught safely by two gaps later in 1-1. Pointing at this area, Miyamoto says, “Here we are preparing the player for the B-Dash”. He notes that the first gap is a pit with a filled-in bottom, a safe place to experiment and learn about long jumps without risking lives. This jump is followed immediately by a nearly-identical variant, a pit where, if the player falls, they will die, but by applying the skills they’ve just learned, they will easily survive. “By doing that, we wanted the player to naturally and gradually understand what they’re doing”, he continues. “The first course was designed for that purpose: so they can learn what the game is all about.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once the player realizes what they need to do, it becomes their game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto further explains that the tutorial nature of early stages usually comes only after the team has crafted more sophisticated levels, so the creators know what skills the players need to develop. “Usually when we have a really fun course, they tend to be the later levels”, Miyamoto confirms. “World 2-1, World 2-2, we create those first and then afterwards come back and create World 1-1. There’s a lot of testing whilst the game is being built. I don’t give them (players) any explanation and just watch them play and see how they do it, and most of the time I think they’ll play a certain way or enjoy a certain part, and they end up not doing that. I think ‘That's not what I intended!’ So I have to go back and use that as feedback”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The intricately crafted layout creates a satisfying illusion of choice and a constant curve of advancement. Miyamoto sums it up perfectly: “Once the player realizes what they need to do, it becomes their game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Super Mario Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The level layout is tuned to match Mario’s famous momentum, allowing a skilled player to perform precise jumps, slides, and combinations. An experienced Mario jockey can run forward at the beginning 1-1, squash a Goomba while hitting the first mushroom block, sprint forward, hit a coin block, reverse direction, jump up, catch the mushroom before it hits the ground, and hit the other coin. The team wisely mapped run and fireball to the same button, creating a slight degree of real-world physical dexterity challenge to trading momentum for projectiles. Likewise, the need to hold B to run and press A to jump made long jumps just slightly and satisfyingly more difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the music. Unlike most software development teams, the Mario team’s composer, Koji Kondo, was embedded with the developers. The famous Mario theme was composed and edited over and over as the level layout changed to match the pace of the design, and from then on, those few bars of digitized score would never leave our brains again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And all of this magic was achieved using only the most limited of tools back in 1985. To really understand why Super Mario Bros. works so well, you first need to understand how the NES renders graphics. The animated characters that move around the screen, such as Mario, are sprites, detailed and mobile clusters of pixels. The NES can only handle a few sprites onscreen at a time, so most of the rest of the world, including the ground, platforms, hills, and backgrounds, is made up of tiles and 8x8 blocks. Most of the objects you see in Super Mario Bros. are composed of these chunks. The question blocks, walls, and bricks are all made up of four combined 8x8 tiles, creating distinct 16x16 squares. It’s similar to the process used to build levels in Mario Maker, only more granular. These little tiles were the tools that Shigeru Miyamoto and team worked with to build a masterpiece.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/mario-4-1757588404839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Bros is an early NES game, created before advanced memory map chips stretched its graphical capabilities. That meant that to achieve their vision, the Mario team had to push the hardware to the absolute limits of its capabilities. The entirety of Super Mario Bros.’ source code is 40K. That means the entire game, including graphics, fits on about thirteen closely-typed pages. Crammed into that space are 32 distinct worlds, eight boss battles, a second quest, myriad secrets, and a memorable cast of characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That restriction meant the design team had to make every bit count, and that led to all kinds of clever tricks to save space. Ever noticed the clouds and the bushes are just the same palette-swapped tiles? Or that the blocks in 1-2 are just recolored blocks from 1-1? Both tricks (and many others) were used to compress space and make room for more features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add together the level design, gorgeous visuals, perfect controls, and iconic music, and you have a game that transcends the tropes of older action games. Super Mario Bros. took levels and made them worlds. And Mario just went on from there. World 1-1 to 1-2. An underground kingdom. Then later, forests. Castles. Bridges. Under oceans. Worlds upon worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But none would exist without that very first. Hell, it's arguable that video games as they exist now wouldn’t be a thing if it weren’t for World 1-1. From the most meagre of pixelated tools, Miyamoto and the team at Nintendo crafted a miracle, and one that’s still as fun to play today as it was 40 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Is &quot;Acting To Protect The Industry&quot; - Ex-Capcom Staffer Defends Switch 2 Game Key Cards 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0bc44a267aea/nintendo-is-acting-to-protect-the-industry-ex-capcom-staffer-defends-switch-2-game-key-cards-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since Switch 2 launched, one of the hottest topics has been Game Key Cards – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-switch-2-game-key-cards-somehow-manage-to-make-codes-in-a-box-worse">physical items which unlock digital downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Critics have said Game Key Cards are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">anti-consumer</a>, and Japan's National Library has since decreed that they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/japans-national-library-says-game-key-cards-are-not-eligible-for-preservation">cannot be considered eligible for preservation,</a> which stands to reason, as the Game Key Card contains no actual game data.</p>
<p>However, a Ubisoft staffer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">recently explained</a> that one reason developers are choosing Game Key Cards is access speed. More recently, composer and former Capcom developer Masakazu Sugimori has waded into the debate on Nintendo's side (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-game-key-cards-and-pricing-are-not-about-greed-ex-capcom-dev-argues-they-are-acting-to-protect-the-industry/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1965252381219901629">Speaking on social media</a>, Sugimori argues that physical items don't have the longevity of digital ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do physical items outside of digital products last forever? Most of the time, they don’t, right? Physical things always have a lifespan and will eventually break. Digital products, on the other hand, generally don’t have a lifespan."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others would argue that digital items only last as long as they're available online, and we've seen many quite recent games <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/12/psa-xboxs-forza-horizon-4-will-be-delisted-in-less-than-one-week">removed from circulation by publishers</a> – which shoots a hole in Sugimori's debate somewhat. However, he has a point; if digital games were made available forever, then they would certainly outlast physical games, which can be subject to wear and tear.</p>

<p>Sugimori also claims that Nintendo's Game Key Cards are also a measure "against illegal copying", as the data cannot be extracted from the cartridge and distributed online (it can still be extracted from the storage of the console it is downloaded to, of course). It also reduces the risk of Nintendo and other publishers holding excess inventory and potentially losing a lot of revenue, as Game Key Cards are far cheaper to manufacture.</p>
<p>"I feel that these moves are largely aimed at protecting the gaming industry and the digital entertainment industry," he concludes. "It might be a bit too optimistic of a view, but the fact is that because Nintendo takes the lead, other companies can more easily follow suit to protect themselves."</p>
<p>Greed is often cited as one of the main reasons for the Game Key Card initiative, but Sugimori disagrees on this point. "Do you think a company that’s already made that much profit would do this just to make even more money? Even if they stopped selling anything right now, they have enough cash reserves to support all their current employees until retirement (It’s so incredible it’s almost ridiculous)."</p>
<p>Sugimori composed music for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_anthology">Ace Attorney</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> series during his tenure at Capcom, and left the company in 2007 alongside Atsushi Mori, Kento Hasegawa and Masato Kouda to form DesignWave.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise of the recent Direct was Nintendo's Virtual Boy announcement for the Switch Online service.</p>
<p>If that wasn't already enough for one week, the developer behind the indie sensation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> has now timed in its own announcement with this news, revealing it will be adding a dedicated 'VB mode' in the title's next major update.</p>
<p>Here's the official rundown about this, along with how you'll be able to activate this mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Summitsphere:</strong> "<em>AND</em>, we are very proud to announce that we are adding a VB mode in the next major <em>ANTONBLAST</em> update. You will be able to play the game in this mode by purchasing the Virtual Visor from Brulo's for a measly 770,000 casino chips. You can then turn it on and off at any time by accessing the "Goodies" menu from your pause screen. ...wait, what?"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="FLqacb9dotM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4fd535rtxhng&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLqacb9dotM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>
