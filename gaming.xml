            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-announce-ai-copilot-for-pc-and-xbox-games-shoving-ai-into-minecraft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has presented their next generation AI enhanced PC’s and Surface tablets, and along with it the reveal that their AI Copilot software will soon be embedded in PC and Xbox games. The first will be Minecraft and you can see it in action in the short video below.</p>
<p>https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1792630909151133768</p>


<p>Microsoft has been aggressively pursuing AI over the past couple of years, investing billions into OpenAI, adding it to their Bing search engine and trying to find ways to apply it to Windows, Office and now Xbox gaming.</p>
<p>As you can see form the Minecraft demo, the player can simply use their own voice to ask for help within the game and Copilot will tell them exactly what they need to do with natural language interactions. In this instance, Copilot can be asked for a crafting recipe and the AI will check you have everything needed in your inventory, guide you through collecting anything else you need, and take you step-by-step through the process of crafting a sword.</p>
<p>it’s a clever demo that will send a shiver down the spine of gaming sites that rely on guides to be profitable, but there’s a lot of question marks for how this will actually work. Microsoft is putting an emphasis on privacy, which will mean that Copilot tools will try to run locally before polling the cloud, and that will require dedicated hardware with new chips featuring an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) – the demos used PCs with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite chips featuring a hefty built-in NPU.</p>

<p>There’s also other things to overcome. For an AI to be useful, it also needs to be all-knowing and always available. While AIs can analyse what they see on screen, that will be a much more intensive process than having APIs and direct hooks into the backend of a game – otherwise they can’t really know what’s in your full inventory, where you are on the world map you are, what the quest steps are or anything else that they need. Game developers and engine developers will probably need to put in the systems for AI to interact with.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, gaming AIs will also need to have all the answers, and who’s going to give these to them? If game guides become unprofitable (which they would do if everyone just asked AI what to do instead of visiting websites) then sites would stop publishing them… but without the game guides, the AI has nothing to reference and could give players the wrong information. And so it’ll then be up to the game developers to provide them, but devs have enough on their plate just making the games. Sony already has a developer-led video hints and tips system built into the PS5 system software for trophies, but they’re far from universal.</p>
<p>Then there’s Microsoft’s rivals. They can put this into all their games and systems, but they’re in third place this generation, and who knows what their future games business is going to look like? If Sony and Nintendo don’t put AI assistants in their future games consoles and chipsets, then third party developers almost certainly won’t bother. It’s not like Sony or Nintendo are going to use MIcrosoft’s AI for that anyway.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like the way things are going, but Microsoft’s vision for what AI assistants will be like when added into video games still has a long way to go.</p>

            <p>The music in haunting 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norco">Norco</a> was so good it’s one of the few soundtracks I’ve actually bought on Steam, so I’m deeply intrigued to learn that developer Geography of Robots are putting music - and dancing - front and center in the new demo for their next project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silenus">Silenus</a>. You can bop your way between screens, reader!</p>

<p>Swapping out Norco’s Southern gothic for techno industrial (also somewhat gothic) vibes, Silenus offers the chance to “uncover the secrets of an oil refinery operated by an obscure organization in this short, atmospheric narrative adventure.” Don’t take my word about Steam’s word about the developer’s word on it, though, that’d be sheer madness. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">free demo </a>available. I initially thought the choice to name it the ‘Umbilical Pre-Release Demo’ was just the devs being arty. But it actually refers to the album Umbilical from contributors Thou, who did loads of Norco’s soundtrack. By playing the demo, you’ll be able to unlock the entire album to listen to in-game. Creatives creatively boosting the creative work of other creatives? What is this, some sort of good timeline?</p>
<p>Here are some more Steam deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rubens Link, an enigmatic company with an unclear agenda, has taken control of the Gulf Flow oil refinery. Officially, they're introducing new automation technologies, but the changes they've implemented suggest something more confounding. In this narrative micro-adventure, you play as Titian, Rubens Link's flagship android. Explore the refinery’s machinery, tank farms, and offices, deciphering clues from computer logs, discarded journals, and the remnants of vanished workers. Solve puzzles, absorb the atmospheric soundscapes of FmAura &amp; Gewgawly I, interact with unique characters, and wander deeper down the rabbit hole of Gulf Flow Oil.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to do a bit about ‘Reuben’s link’ but I already linked the demo. Not a massive loss for comedy, honestly. For what it’s worth, I loved Norco to haunted little bits. It was a brilliantly written 2D adventure set in  South Louisiana that makes me want to use words like 'hauntological' and such. Silenus is in 3D and takes a completely different visual approach, but as much as I’d have eaten up another offering in Norco’s vein, it’s great to see Geography of Robots not pigeonholing themselves this early. Silenus is currently “very early in development”, which gives you enough room to go play Norco. Twice!</p>

            <p>I could pretend I understand Square Enix's action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series Kingdom Hearts, but I don't need to, 'cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/browse?q=kingdom%20hearts&amp;sortBy=relevancy&amp;sortDir=DESC&amp;count=40">Epic Games Store</a> in 2021, Squeenix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">have confirmed</a> that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The titles coming to Steam are Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, and Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC, which doesn't sound like a lot until you realise they're compilations that each contain several games therein. You could also get the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece, a bundle containing all three. At this point making jokes about Kingdom Hearts' naming conventions is about as tired as calling the actor who plays Dr. Strange "Englebort Cucumberthatch" or whatever, so I will just point you to <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Squeenix's post about it</a>, which has a pretty comprehensive breakdown of what is in which compliation. </p>
<p>To expand on my glib summary in the intro, Kingdom Hearts is actually about a young man with huge gloves called Sora, who becomes a hero in the first game when his homeland is almost consumed by a faction of evil goons called the Heartless. The Heartless are also encroaching on the Disney kingdom (ruled by King Mickey, obviously), and Donald Duck and Goofy are sent to find Sora. The series continues from there with many subplots involving Disney villains, new enemies, quests for special weapons, and so on. The popularity of the series, which plays quite like Final Fantasy, as I understand it, is in part because there are extremely dramatic scenes featuring love, loss, sacrifice, and so on, and, like, a cartoon duck without pants on is just there. Which, to be fair, is a good pitch.</p>
<p>Look out for Kingdom Hearts on Steam on June 13th</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-may-only-deliver-4k-30-fps-with-nvidia-dlss-but-it-would-be-a-%E2%80%9Cmisuse%E2%80%9D-of-the-upscaler.877017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be able to deliver only 4K resolution, 30 frames per second gameplay with NVIDIA DLSS, but we are unlikely to see this scenario much, as it would be a "misuse" of the upscaler.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> discussed if the next Nintendo console could be able to deliver 4K, 60 FPS gameplay with NVIDIA DLSS in a new video. The consensus seems it won't be able to for a few reasons. Upscaling to 4K resolution is more expensive than upscaling to 1080p and 1440p resolutions, and it would be an extremely large part of the frametime of a game, leaving 60 FPS off the table. Given how Nintendo tries to go for 60 FPS in most of its games, it is unlikely they will go for 30 FPS to have NVIDIA DLSS upscale to 4K resolution.</p>
<p>How 4K, 60 FPS is likely not viable on the Nintendo Switch 2 was also highlighted in a previous test where Digital Foundry attempted to replicate the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/">T239 chip</a> that will power the system. In this test, upscaling from 720p to 4K with DLSS Ultra Performance in Death Stranding added 18.3 milliseconds to frametime over native resolution, which would fail to deliver a 60 FPS experience. Upscaling to 1440p, on the other hand, looks way more viable, as it only added 7.7 milliseconds over native 720p resolution. As such, 4K, 30 FPS could be doable, but it would be a misuse of the upscaler, having over half GPU time spent on just upscaling. Such a high fixed cost on the GPU would also be difficult for developers to work around and greatly limit what they could achieve on the system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Will Switch 2 REALLY Deliver 4K DLSS Visuals?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CHz0iBN_7A?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is said to support Ray Reconstruction alongside NVIDIA DLSS, which would make it the best ray tracing-capable gaming console to date. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/">it won't take much longer</a> to see how these technologies will be used to deliver a next-gen Nintendo gaming experience.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Getting developers started with GameMaker]]></title>
            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker.877014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Gurpreet Singh Matharoo talks us through how the company is making it easier for newcomers to get to grips with the 2D-centric game engine</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It’s been almost 25 years since Dutch professor Mark Overmars created GameMaker, a game engine primarily devoted to 2D graphics and sprites.</p>
<p>While major engines like Unity and Unreal Engine also offer 2D tools in addition to cutting-edge visuals, GameMaker keeps things simple with its drag-and-drop visual scripting tool. Its 2D focus has helped small teams create incredible experiences like Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and Undertale.</p>
<p>GameMaker also saw a boost in awareness and use last year; just as Unity walked into a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unitys-pricing-is-a-symptom-not-the-cause-of-tougher-times-ahead-for-the-games-industry-opinion">massive pricing controversy</a> last year, GameMaker flipped the script and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamemaker-offers-more-free-options-for-non-commercial-use">made its tech free</a> for all non-commercial use.</p>
<p>We sat down with Gurpreet Singh Matharoo, a lead technical writer at GameMaker, to discuss how GameMaker plans to entice developers who weren't fans of the Unity fiasco. Matharoo works in the team responsible for the company’s documentation in addition to video content on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GameMakerEngine">YouTube channel</a>, "aimed primarily at first-timers to GameMaker."</p>
<p>Matharoo was quick to state that it’s "not particularly hard to create documentation and fill it with information"; instead the challenge lies in "making it easily digestible for new users, while keeping it informative for seasoned developers."</p>
<p>"For new users, I ensure that my writing (and that of my staff) is made up of short paragraphs, uses simple words that a fourth-grader could understand, and gets to the point," he said.</p>
<p>Nurturing new talent is an imperative that is becoming increasingly important as established studios engage in layoffs across the industry. Despite rising profits and popularity, the age-old question of '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-gieditorial-061006">What's a young person hoping for a career in this sector meant to believe?</a>' rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>While an indie gold rush would be held back by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-current-state-of-games-investment">investor caution</a>, there’s no denying that making games and creating them is becoming more accessible outside Western markets. GameMaker has its sights on a larger slice of an expanding pie.</p>
<p>"Developers can now export their [GameMaker] games to all desktop platforms, web, Android and iOS for free, for non-commercial use,’ Matharoo notes.</p>
<p>"Commercial exports are now a $100 one-time purchase, and half the price on Steam for Indian users. With GameMaker more financially accessible, I hope more people will adopt it as one of their engines."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The time cost for making 3D games and financial cost of learning the required skills is high. 2D development is easier and achievable on more affordable machines"</p></blockquote>
<p>Regional pricing can make all the difference, especially in countries that are beginning to embrace game subscriptions and digital purchases. But <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/not-everyone-bows-to-the-inevitability-of-subscription-models-opinion">not everyone’s sold</a> on this mode of expansion. Even fewer creators are optimistic about emerging tech like AI and NFTs.</p>
<p>As GameMaker’s parent company <a href="https://press.opera.com/2023/02/27/opera-openai-collaboration-announcement/">Opera collaborates with OpenAI</a>, the game engine is also poised to implement AI, reportedly without sacrificing individual expression. The official GameMaker roadmap suggests that this AI assistant is still a work in progress. If done right, it could help novices as they build their first game. But there’s enough <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ai-online-platform-regulation-and-loot-boxes-legal-trends-to-watch-in-2024#section-1">evidence of malpractice and talent theft</a> that any AI implementation warrants extra scrutiny.</p>
<p>Another aspect of GameMaker’s approach to accessibility is effective documentation. Matharoo mentions that, for newcomers and experienced users alike, "you don’t want to hide anything." When it comes to deconstructing technical concepts, Matharoo relies on one word: dissection.</p>
<p>"When a set of features is presented to me [to document], it’s usually a full page of information presented in no particular order," he tells us. "It’s a substantial task to digest all that information and understand it fully. Once I have an understanding of the subject matter, I create a document and compartmentalize everything into separate sections and sub-sections."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>GameMaker made its engine free for non-commercial use in the wake of the Unity Runtime Fee fiasco</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Focusing on "crucial steps to use the system for the first time" and "anything that impacts their use of the system" helps Matharoo design a "beginner-friendly guide that even non-beginners can benefit from."</p>
<p>"I first make a high-level plan of what I’m going to document. I usually divide all information into separate pages. I ensure each page is clean and digestible, and don’t hesitate to add another page if it makes things simpler. Using links is also important, as it’s an invitation to the reader to read more."</p>
<blockquote><p>"I hope more people within the industry educate others about game development and push schools to include game-making in their curriculum"</p></blockquote>
<p>Matharoo likens it to going "deep into a Wikipedia rabbit hole."</p>
<p>As an engine geared towards 2D development, it’s no surprise that GameMaker is finding a user base in emerging markets.</p>
<p>"The time cost for developing 3D games and the financial cost of learning the required skills is high," Matharoo tells us. "2D development, on the other hand, is easier to kickstart and is achievable on more affordable machines. For developers with a passion for 2D games, that is all they need. That is where GameMaker supports the indie heart of India. The program is easy to access (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and does not require a particularly strong system. We even have a Chromebook beta!"</p>
<p>Despite the layoffs and the turbulent weather faced by the gaming industry, Matharoo remains optimistic. He believes that game development is "an incredibly fun hobby, and as an ever-growing industry, a perfectly viable career path."</p>
<p>"As a fun way to learn problem-solving, programming, art, music, and many other skills, it’s incredibly fruitful," he concludes. "I hope that more people within the industry educate others about game development and push our schools to include game-making as part of their curriculum."</p>

            <p>Nintendo has made its first acquisition in two years.</p>
<p>The company has entered a deal with embattled Swedish games company Embracer to purchase Shiver Entertainment, a studio responsible for porting the likes of Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy onto Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>On the deal's completion, which is "pending satisfaction" of all relevant customary closing conditions, Nintendo will acquire 100 percent of Shiver's outstanding shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>

<p>"By welcoming Shiver's experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles," Nintendo said in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf">notice of acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>"Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver's focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch."</p>

Prior to these acquisitions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-luigis-mansion-3-developer-next-level-games">Nintendo also purchased Next Level Games</a> - the studio behind Luigi's Mansion 3 - in 2021.</p>

<p>Following the collapse of<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses"> a $2bn "major strategic partnership" last May</a>, Embracer began a "comprehensive restructuring programme".

The Kingdom Hearts series is coming to Steam, following PC exclusivity on the Epic store.

<p>
The first of these bundles, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX will feature improved textures, while purchasing either Kingdom Hearts 3 + ReMind DLC or the Integrum Masterpiece bundle will add a platform-exclusive Keyblade called Dead of Night.

<p>

<p>
If you're completely unfamiliar with the series, it originated on PS2 as a unique Final Fantasy meets Disney action-RPG, but has since expanded into a huge series of other games with a twisting, convoluted storyline that's taken on a life of its own.
</p>
<p>
The games are already available on PS4, Xbox One and Switch (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-back-catalogue-coming-to-nintendo-switch">poorly received cloud gaming versions</a>), as well as PC via the Epic Games Store.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> is also on the way, revealed in 2022 with a new trailer for the series' 20th anniversary. Director Tetsuya Nomura has said his team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nomura-trying-to-find-a-good-balance-of-final-fantasy-characters-in-kingdom-hearts-4">"trying to find a good balance" of Final Fantasy characters in the game</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a> is one of my fave <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> roguelikes, as it's a good time with pals and has all the hallmarks of things I enjoy most in my games: shooting and looting. That's why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there's a new map, too.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4184483630843392751">The Devotion Update</a>, AKA version 1.10, adds two new Artifacts - run modifiers, basically. The first of these is called the Artifact Of Delusion, which resets all chests once a teleporter event has finished (i.e., once you've killed a stage boss). You'll have a chance to return to chests you'd previously cracked open, but if you do, you'll be presented with three options: the item you were originally granted, and two you definitely weren't. If you remember what that specific chest gave you, then you'll get another! But if you don't, you'll lose the item entirely. My short term memory couldn't cope with this.</p>
<p>The other Artifact sounds like a winner, though. It's called the Artifact Of Devotion and it replaces drones (turrets, helpful healy bots etc.) with eggs that spawn Lemurian pals (little lizard guys). You'll need to sacrifice an item to hatch a lizard friend and if multiple Lemurians are present, items are shared between all of them. If a Lemurian survives a teleporter event, it'll grow stronger, giving them new attributes, plus an extra stack of whatever item you sacrificed to birth them. If they die, they'll drop a scrap of the same tier of item they were given and their item is straight up removed from the pool (ouch?). As someone who loves AI companions, I can't wait to raise my own lizardy guy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there's a new map called Verdant Falls to explore. It looks all lush and green with the odd waterfall, so that's me sold on it. There's also a new Mercenary skin that lets you dress up as the guy from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, and that I'm sort of indifferent about, but hey, it's a nice touch if you are a fan of Dead Cells Man.</p>
<p>Risk Of Rain 2's next DLC, Seekers Of The Storm, is "coming soon," so you may want to keep up with its progress over on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/">Steam page</a>. It'll add new maps, playable characters, items and more.</p>

            <p>The neighbourhood citizens of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-release-date">Life By You</a> are positioning themselves as bright-eyed pretenders to The Sims. But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. "[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead," said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, "rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th," said <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">the announcement from Paradox's deputy CEO</a>. "This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed."</p>

<p>Announced in March last year, the game was originally set to launch in September 2023. But was then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-early-access-launch-delayed-until-march-2024">delayed into March 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-early-access-release-gets-another-delay-to-june-4th">once again to June</a>. </p>
<p>This might be understandable, given the scope of the game's goals to create a town-sized simulation in which all NPCs can be possessed at a moments notice. Life By You is hoping to distinguish itself from The Sims with deeper customisation and pawns whose powerful command of actual human language (as opposed to Simlish babble) allows them to live out deep and fulfilling lives. Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-humans-are-always-watching-you-and-some-of-them-can-be-real-creepy-about-it">saw a demo last year</a> in which she witnessed "a conga line of complete strangers who followed our demo character home and stood around her in an ominous circle while she was trying to do some gardening". Uh.</p>
<p>But she was also impressed by the scale and ambition of the sim. According to the developer, players will be able to edit and create quests, write their own character dialogue, come up with new traits, and directly control the characters in a third-person view, among many other mod-friendly tools. When you'll be able to do this, of course, we no longer know.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">best management games</a> but we don't yet know when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-everything-we-know">The Sims 5</a> will be coming out either, so I guess Paradox technically is keeping up. Life By You isn't the only one treading on EA's toes, however. There is also indie contender <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paralives">Paralives</a> to consider, which is due out some time next year. </p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty launched in late September to great reviews, completing the game's comeback alongside the free 2.0 update. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in my review:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>
<p>The game went on to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units in 2023</a>. CD Projekt RED is now busy with the next The Witcher game, but they are also already planning the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel currently codenamed Project Orion. It will be made at their Boston studio, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently bolstered</a> by recruiting many high-profile industry veterans.</p>

    <p id="t0Af6B">Happy Cool Sword Day to all that celebrate. What, you forgot?</p>
<p id="paAPG3">We get it. It’s easy to forget Cool Sword Day, the #1 holiday dedicated to cool swords in all walks of media, because it arrives in the lead up to the “more legitimate” national holiday of Memorial Day. But that doesn’t mean it deserves any less effort or observation. After years of overlooking Cool Sword Day ourselves, Polygon decided we would finally step up in 2024 and do Cool Sword Day right. </p>
<p id="hyQKH2">Here’s what you can expect from Cool Sword Day: some cool flippin’ swords!!!!! You will find us dissecting the big-boi magnitude of <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s greatswords, writing love letters to <em>World of Warcraft</em> blades, rattling off some need-to-know sword trivia, talking to real-life swordmakers, and cementing lists of swords for the history books. Cool Sword Day demands cool sword coverage, so that’s what we did.</p>
<p id="3dr21P">You won’t find much Cool Sword Day coverage on other sites, perhaps because they’ve gone all in on [checks notes] <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/fun/talk-like-yoda-day">Talk Like Yoda Day</a>? With all due respect to the Jedi master, there are more cool swords out there than just lightsabers, and the world needs to know. Polygon is on the case this Cool Sword Day.</p>

  <p id="H36ijC">Weapons maker <a href="https://sabersmith.com/">Sabersmith</a> is a unicorn, according to general manager Mark Lienhart.  Founded in the 1990s by Tim Lawler, the manufacturer does all of its own work in its well-equipped 15,000 square-foot facility located in Sunfield, Michigan. That makes it the single largest manufacturer of 100% American-made swords in the country.</p>
<p id="dKU31T">“Last year alone I think we built over 2,500 swords,” Lienhart said. “It was over 7,000 weapons total, including knives, swords, polearms. The whole kit and caboodle.”</p>
<p id="guPt9s">On the occasion of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23922505">Cool Sword Day</a>, Polygon called on Lienhart to answer a simple question: What is the coolest sword to make? The answer surprised us. No, it wasn’t the hand-and-a-half or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/8/19/9165933/knight-classes-inside-chicagos-only-school-for-medieval-longsword">Italian longswords</a> that are so ubiquitous in cosplay, nor was it the gently curving Japanese katana. Instead, it was something far older.</p>

<p id="4DHTyO">“My favorite sword, hands down, has always been the gladius,” Lienhart said. The shortsword was the standard sidearm of the Roman legion, who attacked with it using quick thrusting motions from behind locked shields. But it’s not Lienhart’s favorite because of its martial past. Instead, it’s in part because of Sabersmith’s uniquely modern design.</p>
<p id="1acx5i">Turns out that, just like the food portions here in America, our swords are also bigger than average.</p>
<p id="I1mKy1">“Our customers are obviously American men and women,” Lienhart explained. “A traditional Roman gladius [...] was made for the Roman legion. My customer base is, on average, six inches taller than a Roman legionnaire. So why wouldn’t I proportionally make that sword fit my customers?”</p>
<p id="ydbsCY">There are traditionalists who might look down on these kinds of modern adaptations, but for Lienhart it’s right in line with his company’s overall philosophy.</p>

<p id="7nc8LK">“We do what we refer to as a combination of historical and modern techniques,” Lienhart said. That ethos extends beyond the design of the weapons to the manufacturing process as well. His factory floor obviously includes a traditional hammer and anvil, but it also has a high-pressure water jet for cutting large pieces of metal to shape. Instead of a coal-fired forge, he uses a vat of molten salt heated to more than 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Sabersmith even recently purchased a few computer-controlled milling machines for doing things like engraving and cutting fullers — long, deep channels in the blade that reduce weight and enable more elasticity in the final product.</p>
<p id="Aa6TPo">Despite those modern tools and processes, Lienhart says that “the core of swordmaking really hasn’t changed all that much” since the 1500s. All of Sabersmith’s pieces feature the same parts that you’d find on an historical blade — including a full “tang” that runs from the blade all the way through the handle. That’s what makes them “battle ready.”</p>
<p id="1uelqa">What’s his second favorite sword to make? Lienhart said it’s the Egyptian khopesh. The one-handed blade is just a little bit shorter than a gladius, but it features an aggressively curved blade in the shape of a half-moon. It’s a design you simply don’t see much of anymore.</p>

<p id="gi5TaL">“That blade [shape] did not end up sticking around long-term,” Lienhart notes, but it is nonetheless “a really cool blade.”</p>
<p id="BCyN4C">You can find Sabersmith’s work online, where dozens of models are ready to ship. Built-to-order swords are also available, which allow customers to choose everything from the color of the leather wrapping on the handle to the tint of the steel blade itself. You can also find Sabersmith on the Renaissance fair circuit, including a booth opening up July 6 at<a href="https://renfair.com/bristol/"> Bristol Renaissance Faire</a> in southern Wisconsin.</p>
<p id="y5pzaE">Just be careful. Everything on display is razor sharp.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156656/three-swords-at-once-tri-wielders-zoro-nightcrawler<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="IZwGkG">Cool Sword Day gives us plenty to celebrate each year. Meteorite swords. Video game swords. People commissioning swords from local swordsmiths. There are so many cool swords, you might be tempted to use two of them at the same time.</p>
<p id="Er6n2X">But to paraphrase Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker in the (sword-less) masterpiece <em>The Social Network</em>: You know what’s cooler than two swords? Three swords.</p>
<p id="y0GREf">Roronoa Zoro understands this. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23845804/one-piece-explained-anime-manga-netflix-live-action"><em>One Piece</em></a><em> </em>legend has never been content to let something as trivial as “only having two arms” hold him back from greatness. That’s what your mouth is for (another sword). </p>
<p id="00HORs">(<em>One Piece creator </em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/what-is-one-piece#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%20Japan%20there%20was%20a,giving%20him%20one%20additional%20sword.%E2%80%9D">Eiichiro Oda has said</a> that making Zoro a tri-wielder was a way to one-up legendary Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto, considered one of the greatest to ever wield a blade. “He was known for using two swords. My childish idea was to simply make Zoro even greater by giving him one additional sword.”)</p>
<p id="eT9TyY">Nightcrawler understands this. Ain’t nothing in the Bible says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhuyJ3SsLic&amp;pp=ygUVbmlnaHRjcmF3bGVyIDMgc3dvcmRz">you can’t wield a third sword with your tail</a>. Nightcrawler would know, he reads that thing every night.</p>

<p id="avZ5JU">General Grievous, the overachiever, understands this, using not two, not three, but <em>four </em>lightsabers. He gets eliminated on a technicality from this discussion — lightsabers aren’t swords, and having four arms makes this a whole lot easier — but his effort is appreciated nonetheless.</p>
<p id="VmQVv1">Shout out to these heroes (and villain) for their efforts in moving the sword game forward in fiction. It’s a tragically underserved character choice, but Zoro and Nightcrawler are more than happy to shoulder that burden. Please, if there are more characters you love who wield more than two swords at once, tell me in the comments. I anxiously await your response.</p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After already being turned into a two-part movie, the sci-fi slice of life manga series <em>Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction</em> is getting a TV adaptation too. And unlike the movies, this adaptation is getting an official Western release.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Even better is that the show is starting very soon, with the first episode premiering on Crunchyroll on Thursday, May 23 at 8pm PT / 10pm CT / 11pm ET (any UK readers will need to wait until 4am BST on May 24). There will be 18 episodes in total airing weekly and the show promises to feature “brand new footage” not seen in the movies. So, even those who’ve watched both movies have a reason to check it out.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">In case you’re unfamiliar with the original manga, <em>Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction</em> begins with an alien spaceship appearing above Tokyo. However, that’s not the focus of the story, with it jumping ahead three years later and centering around the normal lives of high school girls Kadode Koyama and Oran “Ontan” Nakagawa as they learn about growing up, adult life, and how the supposed alien invaders may not be the true threat to humanity.</p>
 <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Just like the movies, production has been handled by Production +h, with Tomoyuki Kurokawa as director, a screenplay by Reiko Yoshida, and music by Taro Umebayashi. All three held the same roles for the movies, so things should feel consistent between the two adaptations. Voice actors Lilas Ikuta and ano have also reprised their roles as the two leads, Kadode and Oran. There’s so far no mention of whether the show will get an English dub, but there’s little reason not to watch it regardless, especially since there’s no sign of the two movies ever leaving Japan.</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Written by Inio Asano, the original <em>Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction</em> manga ran from 2014 to 2022, and has sold over three million copies. At San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, it was named one of the year’s Best New Manga and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2019.</p>

            <p>To borrow a tired Xitterism: The Venn diagram between ‘games that have reference points outside of other games’ and ‘games I’m likely to get excited about’ is a circle. For the benefit of people who’ve discovered the one weird trick that therapists hate and improved their mental health tenfold by deleting the bad place, here’s an incredibly cool thread I stumbled upon this morning where indie developers share non-game influences on their projects.</p>

<p>Using variations on the line ‘The indie game we’re making and three of the non-game inspirations behind it”, devs are sharing their projects alongside the films, books, shows, and real-world happenings that have influenced the direction of their WIPs or released projects. Kicking things off with the place I first discovered the trend, here’s Dan Martin of this month’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/rps-game-club">RPS Game Club</a> pick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands">Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review.876951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Watching Senua emerge from a shipwreck onto the shoreline bruised, bloodied, and struggling to breathe immediately drags us back into the depths of desperation and despair of Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II’s psychosis-affected lead from the outset. What follows is a supremely taut, six-hour tour across the human realm of Midgard that’s conveyed through staggeringly vivid action sequences, stunning Nordic-inspired locations, and intense encounters with towering terrors intimidating enough to make a Viking mess their furs. Hellblade II serves up another satisfyingly brutal and consistently enthralling heroine’s journey, even if its streamlined swordfighting favours cinematic spectacle over substantial gameplay depth.</p><p>Although it’s been some seven years since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice">Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</a>, the events of Hellblade II take place shortly after the original’s vengeful highway to Helheim, with Hel’s belle now feeling empowered by her psychosis rather than encumbered with it. (Suffice it to say, if you’re jumping into Senua’s story here then the included story recap is mandatory viewing.) However, after the Icelandic slave ship she stows away on is wrecked during a severe storm, survivor’s guilt sees her prior struggles with self doubt reemerge to clash with her own stoic sense of justice, setting her down another gripping and tortured path towards battling both her own inner demons and the bloodthirsty monsters roaming Midgard as they take human and mythical forms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Senua is joined along the way by a handful of human companions, including a shackled slave master who begrudgingly accompanies her on her path and a settler she saves from a sacrificial altar. None of these supporting characters are given enough screen time to really develop much of a personality beyond the surface, but I appreciated having them along for various parts of the quest since their incidental conversation felt like a far more organic method to process exposition than the superimposed live action vignettes of the first game. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I completely bought into her determination to battle through the fear and self-loathing.</p></div><p>It’s the battle-scarred Senua herself who is the star, though, portrayed to stirring effect by Melina Juergens, returning from the still gorgeous original game now in near-photorealistic form. Juergens is a truly courageous and compassionate presence, and I completely bought into her determination to battle through the fear and self-loathing, from moments where she’s paralysed by anxiety through to shocking outward bursts of blood-boiling rage.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>Hellblade II once again takes Senua to some dark and disturbing places, but the sequel’s environments have been painted from a broader colour palette than the mostly bleak backdrops of the original. Sure, you’re still forced to hold your breath during crawls through heinous pits of blood and gristle and infiltrate marauder camps decorated with gruesome bouquets made out of human bones, but these darker moments are contrasted with peaceful mountain treks beneath beautiful coral-coloured skies and jaw-dropping glimpses of aurora borealis so vivid you can almost smell the steamed hams cooking in Principal Skinner’s kitchen. The impressive lighting and fog effects employed throughout bring added depth to each destination, making for a journey that feels grounded even as it shifts between reality and the haunting altered states that spill out of Senua’s psyche. The tradeoff is that Hellblade II runs capped at 30 frames per second on Series X, but I felt its visual design was gobsmacking enough to justify that limit.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Playing with headphones on is an absolute must.</p></div><p>These immaculate visuals are once again reinforced by first-class binaural audio design, and playing with headphones on is an absolute must in order to really appreciate the detailed environmental touches like flies buzzing around mutilated corpses and drops of water echoing in underground caverns. More importantly, the swirling voices in Senua’s head seem so close you can almost feel their breath on the back of your neck. This time around not only do these disembodied backseat drivers serve as the bickering angel and devil on Senua’s shoulders casting confusion over every decision she makes, but they also cleverly sow suspicion about the supporting characters around her, making it tough to know who to trust along the way to the story’s thoroughly cathartic conclusion.  </p><h2>En Garde in Midgard</h2><p>Whereas much of Senua’s war in the original Hellblade was waged against demonic manifestations of the Northmen who raided her village and murdered her lover, in Hellblade II the majority of her foes are flesh and bone human warriors. This means that every attack you land feels all the more brutal, with Senua’s sword splitting surface wounds in her opponents’ skin that continue to bleed for the duration of battle, and enemy encounters can be brought to a viciously abrupt end by jamming Senua’s blade so far down their Nordic necks that they’d need to perform a Helheim-lich maneuver to cough it back up again. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemy encounters can be brought to a viciously abrupt end.</p></div><p>The combat camera is so tight on each conflict that every weighted blow lands with concussive force, and I was acutely aware of Senua’s knees buckling under her as I blocked an incoming series of powerful slashes. Dodging feels far more physical too, lurching you out of harm’s way but leaving you open to a followup attack in the brief moment it takes Senua to regain her footing, if you don’t manage to time it just right. Timing is also now more key to performing successful parries relative to the original, and the window in which to do so has been shortened to the point where I wasn’t able to just calmly deflect each and every enemy assault with Jedi-like consistency anymore. That made each fight feel like a little less of a foregone conclusion.</p><p>That said, while I remained consistently engaged in each ferocious and remarkably fluid fight to the death, I do wish the team at Ninja Theory had done a little more to build upon the fairly modest combat template established in the original Hellblade with what they’ve served up here. Admittedly, Hellblade II’s swift six-hour run time leaves little room to cram in a skill tree to flesh out or additional attack combos to unlock, but it does feel a touch familiar to play through another campaign with the same basic two-button mix of light and heavy sword slashes, as superbly animated as they may be. </p><p>If anything, Hellblade II’s fighting feels even further streamlined than the original, where Senua also has a guard-breaking melee attack. That’s been dropped entirely, with nothing to replace it. Meanwhile, her slow-motion focus ability, which was unlocked midway through the original Hellblade, is made available in this sequel virtually from the outset, with no further attack-altering abilities to be found for the remainder of the story. Hellblade II’s combat encounters are consistently menacing and muscular as new enemy types like flame-spitting cultists and nimble ghouls are introduced, but without any additional charged attacks or alternative weapons to wield my basic methods for overcoming each marauding mob remained mostly unchanged from start to finish – even on the hardest difficulty setting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Hellblade II’s combat encounters are consistently menacing and muscular.</p></div><p>One combat change that I did appreciate, however, is the way Hellblade II limits each duel to one-on-one encounters. With no HUD to indicate incoming attacks and the whispers of warning from the voices in Senua’s head easily missed during the heat of battle, in the original Hellblade I often found myself getting stabbed in the back by an unseen offscreen assailant whenever I found myself outnumbered. Thankfully that’s no longer an issue here, and the way Hellblade II’s energetic direction brings new opponents seamlessly barrelling into frame the second another foe is violently dispatched successfully sells the illusion that Senua is stuck amidst a proper rough and tumble free-for-all, rather than the carefully choreographed turn-taking brawls of a Bruce Lee movie. </p><p>Speaking of direction, there are some exceptionally well executed sequences that revolve around murderous giants who have crossed over into Midgard from another realm and are hoovering up sacrificed slaves like they’re human-shaped snack bars. These encounters are urgent, desperate scenarios that put Senua through rigorous physical trials, and although they don’t ever actually put her in head-to-gigantic head conflict with one of the man-hungry monoliths, they still deliver some blood-pumping story peaks to Senua’s Saga that fill the void left by the absence of any traditional boss battles.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>10 of the Best-Looking Games on Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><h2>Norse Code</h2><p>Hellblade II isn’t all life and death fighting, though, and as was the case with the original game there’s an equal amount of environmental puzzles to tease your brain as there are combat challenges to test your reflexes. At regular junctions the path forward will be blocked by a swirling, kaleidoscopic gate made of fractalized body parts – one of the most disconcerting images to be found in a journey packed to the brim with startling sights – and the only way to progress past it is by carefully lining up elements of the environment around you and resolving them into the shape of a specific symbol. I was a big fan of these perspective-based puzzles in the original Hellblade, and was happy to see them return here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One mid-game stretch felt like something straight out of the PlayStation 2 classic, Ico.</p></div><p>In addition to a bit of Midgard Magic Eye, Hellblade II sprinkles in the use of torchlit braziers and bubble switches that each transform the terrain around you and open up new paths towards your goal. They’re effectively new spins on the landscape-altering portals from the previous adventure, and although they might not be quite as brain-bending to behold they’re still just as satisfying to solve. None of these environmental riddles are particularly taxing, though, and for the most part Hellblade II’s puzzles have seemingly been designed to momentarily stall Senua’s forward march rather than ever truly stump you, but there are still some stand-out sequences. One mid-game stretch that involved sharing Senua’s puzzle-solving torch with an unnamed spectral assistant on the opposing side of the arena was particularly inventive, and felt like something straight out of the PlayStation 2 classic, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ico">Ico</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Despite the wide-open appearance of its world, Hellblade II is every bit as much a linear adventure as the original. However, the lorestones that were hidden off the beaten path in the first Hellblade make their return here, triggering further teachings about the Northmen from Senua’s friend Druth, delivered with earnest gravitas by returning voice actor Nicholas Boulton. Supplementing the lorestones is a second new string of secrets: hidden trees of Nordic knowledge that can be stumbled upon by focusing on faces found in the world that then dissolve into hidden paths like one of the false walls in Jim Henson’s Labyrinth. Neither give you any gameplay benefit but I still felt compelled to collect them, and unlike its predecessor, Hellblade II unlocks a welcome chapter select feature upon completion so that you can go back for anything you may have missed without having to replay the entire story from start to finish.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

</header>  <div>



            <p>A new report has found that 46% of gamers play video games for the ability to create, use their imagination, and as a form of self-expression.</p>
<p>That's according to entertainment and gaming wiki Fandom, which published its fifth annual 2024 Inside Gaming Report on Monday.</p>
<p>Fandom surveyed 5,000 of its users from across the globe, and found that players using games as a form of self-expression has increased 10% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Of the top five different types of self-expression, character personalisation was the most popular at 76%, followed by usernames (48%) and gamer communication (35%).</p>
<p>The most popular motivation for playing games was to unwind and relieve stress, accounting for 54% of respondents.</p>
<p>Achievement and rank came in third at 40%, while 39% said they use gaming for social connection and community.</p>
<p>Other motivations included escapism (37%), challenge (33%), killing time and exploration (both at 31%), intellectual stimulation (20%), competition (18%), and control and ownership (10%).</p>
<p>The report also highlighted that players who feel that games allow them to be their true self are 30% more likely to spend time gaming than in previous years.</p>
<p>Games such as Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite, The Sims, and Stardew Valley were highlighted as some of the titles players use to express themselves.</p>
<p>64% of those surveyed found it was easier to be themselves online than in person, while 80% claimed that their online personality was different from what they present in real life.</p>

							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Xbox Game Studios</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Cambridge-based game developer Ninja Theory has produced praiseworthy yet commercially unsuccessful games for most of its history, ever since the days of Kung Fu Chaos, a 3D fighting party game made exclusively for the original Xbox console.</p>
<p>The same was true for Heavenly Sword, an action/adventure developed for Sony as a PlayStation 3 exclusive, Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, a multiplatform release published by Bandai Namco, and DmC: Devil May Cry, which was also controversial among fans for the changes it made to the beloved CAPCOM series.</p>
<p>Ironically, Ninja Theory found its big break when it opted to self-publish a game for the first time. I'm talking, of course, about Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, which the studio devised as a so-called 'independent triple-A' game. The game only took three months to break even, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hellblade-senua-sacrifice-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its stellar reviews</a> attracted Microsoft to the UK studio at a time when they were looking to increase the size of Xbox Game Studios. For its part, Ninja Theory clearly understood that despite the success of Hellblade, financial trouble was just a failed project away. They, like other independent studios in a similar position (Obsidian, inXile, Double Fine Productions), chose the (<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged</a>) security of having such a big parent company.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, Ninja Theory released the multiplayer online action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bleeding-edge-never-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bleeding Edge</a>. However, it wasn't received well, and development was shut down less than a year after launch.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SenuasSaga-Screenshot-01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>By then, the studio had already unveiled Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, the sequel to its most acclaimed game, at The Game Awards 2019. Between the first game and this announcement, Sony Santa Monica released the massively successful God of War reboot, also heavily rooted in Norse mythology and very much narrative-driven. Many Xbox fans initially hoped Senua's Saga: Hellblade II would borrow some things from God of War, especially when it comes to size and scope.</p>
<p>However, having played and finished Ninja Theory's first-ever sequel, I can tell you that despite the long development, the studio made the interesting choice of keeping the same short length. The game will last between six to seven hours, largely depending on how quick you are with solving the environmental puzzles that are dispersed throughout Senua's journey.</p>
<p>Its structure is also virtually the same. This is an extremely linear affair where players only have very limited exploration and interactivity with the environment. Sometimes, they can discover totem-like structures that provide bits of lore on the world designed by the development team, but that's it. There are no upgrades or new gear to be found nor resources to be gathered.</p>
<p>Combat is also largely unchanged from the first game, consisting entirely of one-on-one fights. You can perform many of the same moves: dodge, parry/block, light attack, and heavy attack. Actually, for some reason, Senua no longer has the kick move, which is a shame since her enemies sometimes use quick slaps and the like. Anyway, there's also still the same mirror item that allows her to focus and slow time for a few seconds.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SenuasSaga-Screenshot-08-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like the original, the game is entirely HUDless. In this sequel, Ninja Theory went one step further and delivered Senua's Saga: Hellblade II in a cinematic 2.39:1 aspect ratio, which means there are black bars on regular 16:9 displays, just like you'd find in most movies.</p>
<p>That is all to say, in most ways, this is really more of an experience than a game. Each step of Senua's brief journey acquires meaning thanks to the constant introspection enabled by her inner voices, once again one of the highlights of the experience. They are a reflection of her psychosis, yes, sometimes inciting her to press on and be strong, but just as often expressing her self-doubts and fear of failure. But they also serve as constant commentary on what's happening around Senua.</p>
<p>In Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, though, the protagonist isn't just left to deal with her own ghosts. There are real people Senua encounters and befriends once she gets to Iceland. Her objective quickly changes after she learns what's truly going on in this dark, forsaken, yet beautiful land. In her quest to free the people of Iceland from the giants, Senua has three companions: Thórgestr, Fargrímr, and Ástríðr, each with their own well-defined personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it would be a crime to spoil (besides the fact that it is forbidden by the review embargo guidelines) the story since it is so vital to this game, so I'll just say that it deals gracefully with universal themes like what loss, pain, and grief can to do a person. There's also Senua's own path to accepting her own inner darkness as well as dealing with the ever-present shadow of her past.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful, incredibly poignant story that anyone should experience for themselves. That is why I mentioned in the headline how Senua's Saga: Hellblade II might be the perfect Game Pass experience. Even gamers who would rather prefer a more traditional game are very likely to be driven to play it since it will be on the subscription service on day one. I certainly recommend it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SenuasSaga-Screenshot-14-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On that note, Ninja Theory will assuredly get their latest work in the hands of many more users, which is great for this type of experience. However, I'm not so sure Microsoft will be just as happy with the return on investment, especially since Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is otherwise sold at $49 (instead of the original's $29) and is unlikely to set sales charts on fire. I expect Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will eventually release it on PlayStation consoles</a> to maximize profits.</p>
<p>I still have to discuss the audiovisual department. There's not much to say here except that it is absolutely stellar. Unreal Engine 5 is used to its full extent, with Nanite making a particularly impressive showcase of its virtual geometry in the impressive rendering of Iceland's rocky environments. The atmosphere and lighting are fantastic, although I found certain scenes to be a bit too dark, to the point where you literally had to increase the gamma to see anything.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, the game had only minimal stuttering. On an AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D and NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, I could play with DLAA, DLSS Frame Generation at 4K resolution and max settings with around 80 frames per second on average, gaining around 30 frames thanks to Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The audio component is just as good. As with the original, the developers recommend playing the game with headphones for the best experience, but a good Dolby Atmos setup also works well to reproduce the voices and sounds that surround Senua. The voice acting is also excellent.</p>

<p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</p>

Players' latest journey with Senua will take them far and wide across a landscape of turmoil among warring factions and mythological beasts. But how long will her adventure take to see it through to the end. Here's how long Hellblade 2 is.</p><h2>How long to beat Hellblade 2</h2><p>Though its visual fidelity takes a big leap forward with arguably the best motion-capture work in video game history, the total time commitment to Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is about the same as the first game. That means you'll be able to complete it in roughly 5-8 hours on a normal playthrough. The game is very linear with only a few diversions that may take you off your path, including two types of lore-heavy collectibles. If you decide to go for all of those, expect to come in at the high end of that estimate, but it's likely you won't exceed it.</p>

<p>The only other thing that may extend your time with the game is a feature that unlocks once you complete the game for the first time. If you <strong>consider this a spoiler</strong>, just skip this next part.</p><p>Still here? Okay then. Once you beat Hellblade 2, you'll unlock alternate narrators, meaning the story can be experienced with other characters narrating it. The game still plays out in the same way otherwise, but you'll gain new perspectives from other characters in the story, which is a worthwhile touch in my experience.</p><h2>Hellblade 2 chapter list</h2><p>There are six total chapters in Hellblade 2.

			<p>Senua’s Saga – Hellblade II has a huge weight of expectation behind it. The sequel to an independent darling, whose AAA visuals disguised its small studio roots, its developer, Ninja Theory, was subsequently bought by Microsoft during its <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/10/microsoft-acquire-ninja-theory-playground-undead-labs-compulsion-games/">early raft of studio acquisitions</a>. And as the years have passed, Hellblade II has become one of Microsoft’s tentpole releases. The game used to announce the Xbox Series X, it’s then needed time to make good on both the original’s success and the sequel’s potential. Just like Senua, the game has had a tricky path to wend, but it’s found its way to release, with focus, willpower and sheer strength of spirit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. Animal Soul by AURORA)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRbOmIcVXak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/08/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review/">the original game,</a> Hellblade II prompts you to play the game with headphones to ensure you can make the most of the title’s incredible binaural audio. It also warns you of the content you’re going to experience, with a startling rendition of psychosis, graphic violence and an array of different trauma once again at the centre of this folkloric adventure. As someone whose family member found the original game’s content disturbing, and potentially triggered a mental health episode, it’s a warning that’s well worth considering.</p>


<p>We rejoin Senua’s tale as she has willingly given herself up to the Northmen, hoping to be taken to their leader to root out the evil that destroyed her home, family and love. However, her plan never reaches fruition, instead leaving her shipwrecked on the shores of a brutal land; half-mad, half-drowned, she crawls back onto land in search of the men who led her to this place.</p>


<p>Hellblade’s use of audio remains a trick that hasn’t been replicated, and here in the sequel, it’s an element that’s even stronger and more focused than before. Voices whisper in each ear, drifting in front and behind at times; sometimes feeling like an angel and a devil on each shoulder, at other points a storyteller or an antagonist. They’re comforting and vicious, condemning and cautious. They’re personal demons, and just as with the first game, you’re never sure what their true origin is. Are they internal or external, and what, exactly, is their purpose here?</p>
<p>While you continue to ask these questions, you can be certain that Hellblade II looks simply stunning on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a>. Once again, the team has made their game a showcase piece for Unreal Engine, and a big part of that is the motion capture and physical details of Senua herself. Her scarred features, her weariness, and her desperate strength are all depicted with an incredible level of fidelity. At times Hellblade II feels as much like an interactive animated movie as it does anything else.</p>
<p>One thing I had hoped for was more involved, or at least more precise combat, but so much of what is here feels scripted and prescribed rather than organic. There’s almost the illusion of control, but it seems as though Ninja Theory really want you to experience the tale they’ve weaved while punctuating it with bouts of hammering away at your controller’s buttons.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, all encounters can be beaten by dodging, parrying, or slowing time with your Focus, and once you’ve got the timing right they’re obstacles that you simply have to get through to move the story forward. It was my least favourite element of the original game, and it’s the same here.</p>

<p>It’s also not fully explained, leaving you to search out your way forward via disparate button presses and pattern watching until you’ve learned what it wants from you. If you haven’t played the first game, or you don’t traditionally opt for action titles, Hellblade II is unnecessarily unforgiving, though that in itself feels like an obvious design decision to put you ill at ease, and under yet more pressure. Fortunately, the atmosphere, narrative and presentation are absolutely stellar, and it’s these elements that Ninja Theory have nailed their reputation on, rather than the combat mechanics – if you find the combat a struggle, there’s a choice between an adaptive difficulty, and the usual Easy, Medium and Hard.</p>
<p>Everything about Hellblade II feels authentic, from the region-specific voice actors to the depiction of stone circles, monuments and settlements. Even the weaves within Senua’s hair look as you’d expect them to for the era, and despite the fantastical and psychological elements, Hellblade II feels like a historical journey to a specific moment in time, capturing both the benign and the brutal reality of this Nordic people’s way of life.</p>
<p>Despite the earlier warnings, they don’t truly prepare you for the graphic scenes and intense emotional pressure that Hellblade II puts you under. There is death here – a lot of bloody, visceral death – and it’s difficult to express the effect that it has on you and your psyche. The impact of what you’re experiencing as Senua is clearly impactful, and both her damaged mind and your own become intertwined through the horror you’re experiencing together.</p>

<p>While Hellblade II weaves its tale, the same location-specific puzzles return from the first game. At various points you’ll reach a gate, with sigils that appear within it being replicated in the nearby landscape. You have to focus on each element of the sigil to unlock it.</p>
<p>These have been made more accessible than in the original, with glyphs hanging in the air, and the elements you need to line up daubed in bright red inks/blood, but the puzzles feel as though they’re simply there to slow you down, rather than adding too much further meaning, beyond the continuous protestations of the voices.</p>
<p>Just like its forbear, Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II is an oppressive, powerful and haunting example of the power of video games, and one that sets its own parameters for what a digital experience can be. It is a game that must be experienced, not least because, there’s nothing else quite like it.</p>
<p><em>We’re not quite ready to put a score on Hellblade II, but if you’re desperate to see a number, come back in the next couple days to see what we settle on.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/senua%E2%80%99s-saga-hellblade-ii-review-%E2%80%93-binaural-bedlam.876912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the first couple of minutes, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </em>overwhelms the senses. Crashing waves, thunderous rain, whimpering pleas for mercy; Ninja Theory’s got it all. And that’s all on top of the voices in your head.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review-fear-is-mind-killer">sequel seven years in the making</a> amps up the scale, going for epic proportions of action and stakes. Instead of the deeply personal journey focused solely on Senua, Ninja Theory introduces a small cast of characters with their own motivations.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, this is Senua’s saga, and it’s wrapped in a highly polished production that’s as impressive as it is overwhelming, in a good way. Unfortunately, the narrative, while thought-provoking, ultimately doesn't quite stick the landing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-landscape-2.jpg?itok=hA03Moob 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-landscape-2.jpg?itok=OKC31ILS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As is cinematically appropriate, the game is rendered in this aspect ratio, even in a 16:9 window.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Technical Achievement</h2>

<p>When <em>Oppenheimer </em>hit theaters last summer, I distinctly remember two things about it: its serendipitous competition with <em>Barbie</em>, and the sheer power of experiencing a pseudo-nuclear explosion in an IMAX theater. It’s a visceral head-to-toe experience that easily stands out from the rest of the story, whether you liked it or hated it.</p>

<p><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> reaches that same level of technical prowess, really flaunting its ability to overwhelm you with its powerful, raw, and primal soundscape.</p>

<p>The game recommends using headphones, much like the previous game, and you’d be doing yourself a disservice playing it on speakers. I primarily used the <a href="https://techraptor.net/technology/reviews/razer-blackshark-v2-pro-review-its-scary-good">Razer BlackShark V2 Pro</a>, and it created this sense of immediacy, intimacy, and immersion.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat.jpg?itok=FCDuq_D7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat.jpg?itok=MQwRVpB0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is rendered in-engine during combat.</figcaption></figure><p>The Furies, the voices in Senua’s head, make a return, and they play roles both for gameplay and narrative. They’ll hint at how to solve puzzles or attack enemies, but also provide insight into narrative moments.</p>

<p>It’s never straightforward, though. Sometimes, they’ll say what just happened; other times, they’ll doubt someone’s intent. Or they’ll double back and doubt their own doubts. They’ll mock Senua for trusting a character or mock her for not listening to another. Sometimes, they’ll even cheer her on.</p>

<p>These Furies are a symptom of Senua’s psychosis. She perceives the world differently, hearing voices others don’t and seeing things others don’t see. That’s brought to life by the world literally shifting in front of your eyes, turning majestic scenes into menacing terrors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-photo-mode.jpg?itok=CNWphjhc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-photo-mode.jpg?itok=BbW65RSy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Those bodies in the water don't really exist (I think). They're one of Senua's visions that you have to live through.</figcaption></figure><p>The reality-bending warps feel even more intense with the audio design, and the sheer beauty of the graphics really delivers breathtaking scene after scene. Picturesque vistas stretch to the horizon, while all the cutscene camera work frames everything with the right amount of suspense and drama.</p>

<p>The facial animations stand out among the competition as well. In the prequel, it was just Senua’s face, especially her eyes, that impressed me. That lifelike fidelity has been upgraded and applied for most other major characters here, really selling the key emotional moments here.</p>

<p><em>Hellblade II</em> really isn’t much of a video game. It’s a cinematic experience. It’s a feast for the senses, especially your ears.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-closeup.jpg?itok=-z-Z0mw_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-closeup.jpg?itok=G4xxfiT9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Clashing Blades, Piercing Screams</h2>

<p>Where the audio comes most to life is in combat. The gameplay takes a primarily over-the-shoulder view, like the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation"><em>God of War</em> games</a>.</p>

<p>What kept me most engaged was the sheer emotion behind every one of Senua’s battle cries. Vengeance, fury, desperation, exhaustion; it all comes through actress Melina Juergens’s performance.</p>

<p>Fights are one on one, and after taking care of one enemy, another appears, usually with some canned animations of them interacting with another character or grabbing Senua. It’s a neat effect that really adds to that cinematic feeling, though it does get predictable partway through.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-finisher.jpg?itok=sKDjQMpI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-combat-finisher.jpg?itok=VQ2JIH-3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You use light attacks, heavy attacks, dodges, and blocks to beat enemies. You can also build up and burn meter to attack faster. It’s pretty standard action game combat, and there are accessibility options to literally make the combat encounters play themselves.</p>

<p>Aiding the simple approach to gameplay is the elevated animations. It’s a lot like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/uncharted-4-thiefs-end"><em>Uncharted 4</em>’s melee combat</a>, where the animations react to the context between Senua and her enemy. But these ones are brutal, definitely not for the faint of heart. I saw a few repeat, and they made me flinch every time.</p>

<p>Between combat encounters, <em>Hellblade II</em> plays a lot like a walking simulator, much like its predecessor. There are some light puzzling and occasional collectibles off the beaten path, but for the most part, you’re holding forward on the stick and occasionally hitting A to climb or interact.</p>

<p>While that sounds boring, that’s also prime opportunity for the narrative to develop. These quieter moments are when the Furies sow seeds of hope and doubt in Senua’s mind. It’s when the supporting cast tells Senua about the ways of the world and the giants who terrorize it.</p>

<p>For a narrative as dense as this, these moments let them breathe. There are a lot of allegories here; <em>Hellblade II</em> has a lot to say about societal power structures, family ties, religion, mental health, and hero worship.</p>

I know that’s the conceit of narrative-heavy games like this, but I did find myself getting bored on occasion.</p>

<p>These moments usually come from when Senua’s alone. As a leading character, she’s a woman of few words, which leads to lots of one-sided exchanges with the voices in her head. Even with other characters, she sometimes doesn’t answer their questions.</p>

<p><em>Hellblade II</em> offers her more opportunities to play off other people, which is an intrinsic way for us to understand her. But because of her standoffish nature, it doesn’t quite feel like she connects with any of them, even when the narrative implies a deeper bond.</p>

<p>Despite playing as her, I rarely found myself understanding her motivations and emotions other than suffering. She gets hurt a lot, physically and emotionally, and that’s most of the impression I’m walking away with. It’s almost miserable at times.</p>

A narrator will explain what’s going on, too. For a game that prioritizes cinematic storytelling, I can’t help but feel like these moments could have been more engaging than simply walking after ghosts.</p>

<p>I won’t spoil the ending of course, but it did leave me wanting more—and not in a good way. It feels abrupt and unresolved.</p>

<p>Completing the story unlocks an alternate mode where other characters will narrate, which is a neat way to add more context and encourage more playthroughs. However, even revisiting the last chapter with extra narration, I didn’t find myself feeling much better about the end.</p>

<p>On technical achievement alone, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> stands out as one of the better titles under Xbox’s banner. Environments are awe-inspiring, faces are jaw dropping, and combat is intensely visceral.</p>

<p>There are a lot of thematic ideas to dissect in the story, and I found the last two chapters especially interesting in what they have to say. Unfortunately, the overall journey is punctuated with slower, almost boring moments, and its ending leaves a bit to be desired.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Senua’s saga is one I’d want to follow if we get more, but it’ll definitely be more for the technical presentation over Senua herself.</p>

  <p id="npjSck">Finding the <strong>hiddenfolk</strong> in <em>Hellblade 2</em> is a long process full of puzzles and visions. You’ll start this part of Senua’s journey shortly after the (long) walk to Fargrimr’s village and your first encounter with Illtauga. Fargrimr will send you off to find the Hiddenfolk and earn their favor during the end of chapter 3, “Raudholar” (well, “Rauðhólar”).</p>
<p id="BYpAba">To solve the puzzles, you’ll have to collect stone balls from nearby and return them to the puzzle’s central pillar. It’s not as straightforward as just walking around, though, and involves some mind-bending visuals.</p>
<p id="YHN8jO">Our <em>Hellblade 2</em> guide will show you <strong>where to find the carved stone balls</strong> in all three of the hiddenfolk puzzles.</p>

<p id="BKIJJs">Backtrack down to the main floor, and use the water rings to (re)flip the path you just used. Head away from the central pillars to find the end of the path you’ve just created. Take a right, duck under the rock you flipped earlier, and follow the path back to the third stone ball. There’s a ledge right next to it so you can drop down and finish the puzzle.</p>

  <p id="WLRBUF">It’s no surprise that, as a sequel, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> is bigger and more expansive than the previous game. Though this game’s scope, length, and subject are quite similar to those of the original Hellblade game — it is, of course, still an action-adventure dark fantasy about a warrior woman suffering from psychosis in ninth-century Northern Europe — much more effort has been put into making it appear grand and seamlessly cinematic. It’s an immaculately composed long take cropped to filmic widescreen. One result of this glow-up, however, is <em>Hellblade 2</em> losing a bit of what made the first game — much smaller, more focused, and more personal, by comparison — feel unique. </p>
<p id="XkXgxu">Hellblade-the-first, <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, begins and ends with its hero, Senua, mourning her murdered lover, missing her mother, and struggling to break out from under the mountain of guilt and shame handed down by her father. It’s a private and individually focused story. Senua spends the vast majority of the first game alone, with little but her delusions to accompany her.</p>
<p id="49gSCE">It feels small and cramped as a result. Senua, returning from a self-imposed exile, is shattered after learning about the slaughter of most of her village, and spends the rest of the game lashing out against manifestations of her guilty and traumatized memories. It ends with her conquering her personal demons, coming to an understanding about her own unique way of seeing the world, and promising to take this newfound understanding with her, on to new adventures.</p>

<p id="dJ6lmW">This is where we find Senua in <em>Hellblade 2</em>. She has allowed herself to be captured by the Northman slaver Thórgestr, and taken far away from Orkney to the rugged alien world of Iceland. The series’ focus has opened up, passing beyond oceans and across mountain ranges. It’s a travel story, following a small troupe of heroes as they hike across the rocky steppes and wave-beaten shores of this uncompromising landscape. It’s a Saga, a tall telling of Senua as freedom fighter, liberator of her kidnapped countrymen; Senua as giant slayer; Senua as gifted clairvoyant, who can peer beyond the veil.</p>

<p id="ODn5gE">Beyond feeling epic, the game is simply beautiful. It feels like every last boulder, pebble, tall patch of grass, and copse of trees has been carefully modeled and arranged. The broad sky cycles between ash-clouded overcast and brilliant, fiery red sunset and star-filled auroras of blue and violet. Senua climbs over windswept, rocky cliffs down to dark dripping caves lit by torchlight flickering off of prismatic rock, out across mist-drenched forests and through flame-ravaged settlements. Everything, from top to bottom, is rendered in immaculate detail. </p>
<p id="8bo0JX">By shifting the focus from the small and personal to the grand and epic, Ninja Theory wound up changing something fundamental about the series. Though we still hear the gallery of psychosis-generated voices who add commentary to Senua’s actions, they don’t feel as important to a story that is far more interested in what she’s <em>doing</em>, rather than what she’s thinking or how she’s feeling. Here, she’s taking on tremendous tasks and facing impossible odds, and the dramatic tension lies simply in whether she can accomplish what she’s set out to. It’s less nuanced than the first game, which exists in a constellation of trauma and memory and the ways in which her psychosis impacts her life. </p>

<p id="idKevR">In <em>Hellblade 2</em>, Senua’s psychosis begins to resemble something more anodyne, like a superpower, a tool with which to delve into secret aspects of the world that others cannot see. It’s like a mystical version of the “detective vision” made famous by the Rocksteady Batman games. No one can do anything to save themselves until Senua arrives. Her psychosis is embraced as a boon by everyone she meets. No one questions or challenges her mental state, in a marked contrast to how things went in the last game. Her father’s dripping evil baritone occasionally rings out to chastise her, but it’s quickly drowned out by her other, more supportive voices, as well as by the many pressing events the game shuttles between in rapid succession.</p>

<p id="eAsbqg">For Senua, this is, of course, a good thing. She’s moved beyond the pain and trauma; she’s advancing in the world, becoming a leader where she was once an outcast. Because of this, some of the air has, unfortunately, been let out of the experience. The dramatic experience of the game feels softer; there’s less to hold on to, less personal conflict to drive the plot forward.</p>
<p id="540SbX">Senua starts the game on a mission to free her fellow enslaved Orkneyites, but she almost immediately brings Thórgestr over to her side, before shifting to a slightly tangential, if far more epic, mission of saving the local people from an invasion of giants. Down this route lie more impressive visual spectacles: harrowing fights against massive giants, mind-altering voyages into magical realms, and far less of Senua herself. </p>
<p id="7PaFgF">In the first game, Senua would constantly react to the voices in her head and to the hallucinations that haunted her. In the sequel, we’ve moved from internal battles to external ones, and Senua has much less to react against. Instead, she’s drawn along by the game’s events, rarely hindered or held back, but thrust forward with prophetic inevitability.</p>

<p id="Ny1KvO">The external does offer plenty to find interest in, particularly in terms of the aesthetic experience. There’s something richer and more exciting about having to fight flesh-and-blood people this time around, rather than the illusory figures that haunted Senua in the first Hellblade. There’s a more grounded sense of terror in being hunted by real men with a hunger for violence in their eyes, and a stronger sense of the gravity of having to take a life, even in self-defense.</p>
<p id="4nvjsJ">One of the game’s early sections, where you must sneak into a settlement that’s under attack by a band of draugar, a bloodthirsty group of warriors, stands out as an experience of high tension. Senua must crawl through piles of corpses and severed limbs, and hide as the ones responsible for this bloodshed leap around howling, seeking out and grabbing helpless villagers right in front of her eyes. It’s a horrifying sequence, and one that distinguishes <em>Hellblade 2</em> from the first game, where the traumatic events had already happened long before Senua arrived (and was forced to reenact them in her mind). Bringing in other people — whole societies and cultures, eventually — enriches the game and makes it feel more alive, even as Senua herself comes across as more deadened.</p>
<p id="2UaRcR"><em>Hellblade 2</em> doesn’t ultimately maintain the energy level of these early sections. There are long stretches of basic environmental puzzles that involve Senua navigating around enclosed spaces in order to stand at different angles from which to view puzzling runes and unlock them. It’s an iteration of a mechanic that saw plenty of use in the first game. Here, while the puzzles are more visually impressive, the essence of the gameplay is identical. And it doesn’t add anything to the game that isn’t brought about more effectively by its more dynamic combat sections, or its more ruminative moments of exploration, during which Senua traverses this strange new world listening to the voices in her head alternately describing it and reacting to it.</p>

<p id="ksymUh">So much of Ninja Theory’s focus in <em>Hellblade 2</em> seems to be on pure spectacle. An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/04/04/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-preview-studio-visit/">Xbox Wire post about the game</a> highlights the effort the creative team has put into stepping up the immersive feel, quoting studio head Dom Matthews: “We have a fantastic building; our performance capture stage, new technologies and techniques, but all of that exists to pursue the same goal. That goal is to create an experience that allows players to suspend their disbelief and immerse themselves fully in this world.”</p>

<p id="4QJTbL">Though there is arguably a degree to which having a head full of voices might prevent Senua and the player from ever being fully immersed in the game’s environment, the sense of verisimilitude is undeniable in <em>Hellblade 2</em>. Sprinting through enormous, terrifying fantastical spaces as Senua squares off against mythical enemies; fighting for her life as she is knocked back and forth between brutish warriors; clearing a battlefield, panting, her head still swinging wildly back and forth in search of further dangers — it all works as visual texture to make this game feel richly cinematic.</p>
<p id="18ARLN">But in all this spectacle, something of Senua herself is lost. Where the first game felt like a journey of self-discovery, both for Senua and for the player, <em>Hellblade 2</em> feels more invested in creating the myth of Senua: Senua as legendary giant slayer, as mystical seer touched by the underworld. There are moments where we do get glimpses at her actual humanity — in early chapters, where she is still struggling to survive and find her footing in this strange land, and in the denouements after later battles, where she falls to her feet, diminished, and mourns for those she was unable to save. But these moments are marginal to the central thrust of the narrative: a woman finding her place in the world; moving from a state of victimhood and isolation to one of heroic leadership; working to unite a people against their fears. It’s an inspiring story, and a hopeful one that seeks not to dwell in the mournful solemnity of the first game, instead pressing forward toward an impressively epic future. But, as with most epics, we only really get to see the broad strokes. We get the myth, but we lose the woman. </p>

But as I turn the next corner of clouding darkness, a bright red light paralyzes me as the forceful and commanding voice of my father tells me that not only am I doomed to fail in my struggles, but that I am actively causing the very harm I am seeking to alleviate. Be it through failure or a curse that he expects me to believe I carry with me that will spread to others, he calls me his daughter with a possessiveness that rattles me. It inspires fear and rage. Yet I continue to move forward, to find a way through, to find spaces where his corruption hasn’t spread. And I do this not only for myself, but for others to whom I have promised aid. But in my quest to kill godlike forces that are causing misery, I am ever aware of a creeping darkness that threatens to consume me and others. What must I do to heal this world? Is that  what I’m here to do? Can I do this? As I hear my father’s voice again, reminding me of his abuse, I realize I have no choice. I <em>must</em> survive and bring an end to the suffering of all those I encounter.</p><hr><p>Arriving on May 21, 2024 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> picks up shortly after the events of 2017’s <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em>. Continuing the story of Senua, a Pictish warrior who experiences psychosis and has lived through intense and tragic trauma, <em>Saga</em> delivers an experience that will be familiar to those who played <em>Sacrifice</em>. <em>Saga</em> is a tightly focused narrative of magical realism, though those magical elements may largely be part of how Senua <em>perceives </em>the world, rather than how it actually is. (And really, how much can any of us can attest to how reality “actually” is?) Senua’s altered perceptions of reality enable her to contend with seemingly supernatural forces inspired by Norse mythology. But she also, and perhaps most importantly, is in a battle with her own trauma in a way that allows her to see into the internal struggles of others.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Senuas-Saga-Hellblade-Standard-Windows/dp/B0CWL1LQ85/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CWL1LQ85" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmia2xa7OWn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmia2xa7OWn" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fsenua%25E2%2580%2599s-saga-hellblade-ii--xbox-series-x-s%2F408729.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fsenua%25E2%2580%2599s-saga-hellblade-ii--xbox-series-x-s%2F408729.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-recommend-id="image://1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua stares at the camera from the sides of her eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua stares at the camera from the sides of her eyes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-recommend-id="image://1b009af1ebf68f247c5c6d29930e27ca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua stares at the camera from the sides of her eyes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A third-person action-adventure game, <em>Saga</em> features cryptic mazes and puzzles typically solved by observing matching runic symbols and other methods of altering the world around Senua to traverse the environment. Long sequences of maze-drifting give way to moments that prioritize the game’s combat. Battles consist of one-on-one showdowns in which Senua must use her skills with a blade and her mirror, which grants her a limited bullet-time (or perhaps sword-time?) ability to deal rapid slashes against her opponent. </p><p>There are also plenty of lengthy cutscenes and “walk-and-talk” moments of exposition and dialogue, both from the three NPCs who accompany Senua on her journey and from the voices that speak to her in her mind, which are inspired by contemporary understandings of psychosis in the 21st century and produced in collaboration between developer Ninja Theory and experts in the field of psychosis and mental health. That experience is brought to life through a binaural audio design that necessitates playing this game with headphones. With headphones, the audio takes on outward and inward spatial roles: The world outside Senua sounds vividly real, and the internal sound of the voices she hears create distorted, gripping emotional contours over the narrative and virtually all other elements of the game.</p><p>In all of its elements, <em>Hellblade II</em> delivers numerous highs, and what many will find as some lows. Like the first <em>Hellblade</em>, the sequel has a run-time of about eight to nine hours. Though there is very little room for exploration outside of <em>Saga</em>’s main story, the game does reward another playthrough or two upon completion; you may replay the game with different characters narrating portions of the game’s story. It’s a neat and rewarding way to re-experience the game immediately after–and it does really help you connect many dots you might’ve missed on your first time through.</p><p>There’s also an additional unlockable feature rewarded for discovering all of the game’s hidden mythological lore lessons. Sadly, I cannot speak to this last element as, despite finishing the story in just under nine hours, I was unable to discover all of these hidden “collectibles.”</p><figure id="" data-id="b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-recommend-id="image://b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua holds up an object just out of sight of the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua holds up an object just out of sight of the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-recommend-id="image://b82bef4cf25b834bb54a46c347c5e7a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua holds up an object just out of sight of the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Hellblade II</em> rarely failed to provide me with an emotionally stirring experience that ensnared my full attention and refused to let it go. And I didn’t want it to. I found it to be a riveting journey of lush, beautiful darkness and torment with a beating heart of hope and perseverance. It left a dramatic, if not haunting, impression on me, one that’s still capable of bringing me to tears as I make my way through it again with the alternate narration. </p><h2 id="h79077"><a id=""></a>Senua’s story continues</h2><p><em>Senua’s Saga</em> follows the warrior as she allows herself to be captured by Vikings who are rounding up Picts to be transported to Iceland as slaves. These captors are of the same militant force that slaughtered her village and her beloved, and her motivations are both a kind of revenge as well as a desire to prevent the continued suffering of her people. </p><p>Following her violent arrival in the north, Senua is introduced to additional characters and the central driving focus of the narrative: The people in Iceland live under the threat of unstoppable, menacing giants.</p><div><h4> Should you play <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em> before <em>Saga</em>?  </h4><div><p> Experiencing Senua’s first outing is only to your benefit as a player. Yes, there is a brief recap in <em>Saga</em> which you can also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/oSZpsmHIrV4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/oSZpsmHIrV4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch on YouTube</a></span>. That said, since neither game is very long at all, playing <em>Sacrifice</em>  for the first time or even revisiting it if you haven’t played it since  2017, makes for relatively light homework before diving into <em>Saga</em>. </p><p>&nbsp;What’s most valuable about experiencing<em> Sacrifice</em> before <em>Saga</em> is less the “lore” and more Senua’s emotional journey, which is one through trauma, not merely through a fictional landscape.  </p></div></div><p>Over the course of six chapters, Senua must persist through difficult trials that bend reality for her, and by extension, for you. Challenging you with solving cryptic puzzles strewn about its mazes, fighting a variety of tough foes in blade-to-blade combat, and dealing with its protagonist’s own inner turmoil, <em>Saga</em>’s premises are simple, but Senua herself is not. She experiences a persistent chatter from the “Furies,” voices she hears in her mind that narrate her decisions, question them, encourage her, doubt her, and offer up unpredictable lines of dialogue that take on different tones throughout the course of the game. </p><p>It can be a lot to sit with, and as you face vicious depictions of violence and human subjugation, the voices frequently turn to hold Senua accountable for everything around her. As a result, she experiences swallowing thought spirals of self doubt and failure which stem…yup, from her father.</p><figure id="" data-id="620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-recommend-id="image://620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark silhouette pierces a glowing red light before Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dark silhouette pierces a glowing red light before Senua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-recommend-id="image://620f2e084a38222cd59d8d8bc95d98ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dark silhouette pierces a glowing red light before Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Her father is an abusive figure in her life. He persists in her mind and attempts to cast her as being responsible for the suffering she has endured, as well as that which she witnesses around her. </p><p>The end result is a dark and multidimensional narrative that shifts and shapes itself through mythology and metaphor. It’s a gripping, painful experience through arduous mental anguish and trauma. It outpaces its existence as a fantasy game and becomes relatable to real life real fast. And you should be prepared for that going into it. </p><p>At least the girl has some friends. As the story progresses, <em>Hellblade II</em> introduces three other characters who’ll accompany Senua. They won’t fight alongside you, and are often absent during the majority of Senua’s trips through altered states of reality, but they have a direct and vested interest in the struggles of those living in fear of the giants. </p><p>These NPCs offer a dynamic arguably absent from <em>Saga</em>’s predecessor. Here, Senua must contend not only with the struggles of her mind and the supernatural forces surrounding her, but also with the bonds she must forge with these characters, some of which start off rougher and more complicated than others. </p><figure id="" data-id="830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-recommend-id="image://830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two characters talk in front of Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two characters talk in front of Senua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-recommend-id="image://830066f17e25175346439bfa4a30363d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two characters talk in front of Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s an interesting change from the first game, one that gives this game a richer and more varied range of characters to center while also making the world feel larger. </p><p>Unlike <em>Sacrifice</em>, this isn’t just a story of Senua’s own trauma and inner turmoil; it’s also about those who have lost safety and security as a result of the giants. That said, <em>Saga </em>is clearly dealing with themes of human violence that aren’t just about menacing monsters that go bump in the night. Whether or not the supernatural elements of the game are merely powerful metaphors for human violence and trauma or not, Senua persists through the same reality as everyone around her. She just sees it differently. And with that, she brings hope to the world.</p><p>The presence of additional flesh-and-blood characters positions Senua as a different kind of protagonist than she was in the first game. She’s now a savior for the people she encounters. And her unique perspective on reality, something seen as a gift by others, is valued for what she can do and learn. We get to see who she is in relation to others, and how her experience of reality positions her in this culture. It’s a smart decision for the sequel to make.</p><figure id="" data-id="077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-recommend-id="image://077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A glowing red light surrounds Senua as she holds her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A glowing red light surrounds Senua as she holds her sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-recommend-id="image://077426c6e9753fa82eb7e412949f7097" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A glowing red light surrounds Senua as she holds her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h79078"><a id=""></a>Wear headphones, kill the lights, turn off your phone, and <em>focus</em></h2><p>When you start up <em>Hellblade II</em>, you will be told the game is best experienced with headphones. And while I imagine that a well-designed, likely  expensive, home theater setup could deliver a compelling experience, headphones will better create the sense that the game lives in your head in a powerful way.</p><p>The only way to experience <em>Hellblade II</em>, in my estimation, is to devote as much of your attention and sensory abilities to it as possible. <em>Saga</em> is a game that lives to exist on a large screen in a dark room, and you should remove all possible distractions. </p><div><h4> You should play <em>Senua’s Saga</em> with a controller on PC  </h4><p> Unless you’re a forever-keyboard gamer, I heartily recommend playing <em>Senua’s Saga</em>  with a gamepad for the sake of rumble alone. The added physical  movement of the controller in your hands very much adds to the intensity  of the experience. As I said, you should devote as much of your senses  as you can to this game, and controller rumble provides a satisfying  physical sensation. It’s worth it.  </p></div><p><em>Saga</em> presents a direct and focused path that Senua and her inner demons traverse as she searches for solutions for the people of Iceland. There are no menu systems to dive through and virtually no HUD elements to distract you. This game wants its world to swallow you up.</p><figure id="" data-id="3526ec3e89ad6bab403eaa88ecb45098" data-recommend-id="image://3526ec3e89ad6bab403eaa88ecb45098" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua fights someone wearing an animal skull as a mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua fights someone wearing an animal skull as a mask." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3526ec3e89ad6bab403eaa88ecb45098" data-recommend-id="image://3526ec3e89ad6bab403eaa88ecb45098" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua fights someone wearing an animal skull as a mask." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Hellblade II</em> rapidly dissolves the barriers between cutscenes and interactive gameplay. Sometimes this does make it hard to tell exactly when you’re in control of the game, which can be disorienting. And in fact, I think the way <em>Saga</em> moves seamlessly from moments of interaction to moments of observation contributes to a bit of narrative exhaustion; your actions in the game are almost always focused on the next story beat with little time to stop for air. And no one’s here to ask you if you want to try your hand at some fishing, or gather 30 units of sheeps’ wool to make a new garment for Senua.</p><p>The end result is a seamless, distraction-free narrative journey that pulls you in and wows your senses with its audio and visual flair. And while there are definitely impressive technological feats on display here, they all serve to create an experience that bucks so many current trends that often define what we think makes a game “game-like.” And I mean that in a good way.</p><h2 id="h79079"><a id=""></a>A breath of focused fresh air amongst modern games</h2><figure id="" data-id="da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-recommend-id="image://da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua traverses through a dangerous-looking environment with skulls mounted on sticks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua traverses through a dangerous-looking environment with skulls mounted on sticks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-recommend-id="image://da96b50c09f106f28106a15fb8573b0e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua traverses through a dangerous-looking environment with skulls mounted on sticks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As I’ve said, <em>Saga</em> has virtually no HUD.

And there’s no ever-present NPC or nagging menu system that begs you to take your attention away from the immediacy of pain and suffering of the narrative. </p><p>The combat is certainly not as adorned as that in many other action games.

Succeeding in combat grants the feeling of growing with Senua as a warrior, while suffering from poorly timed attacks sees her battered about in a way that feels thematically congruent with the game’s themes of struggle and strife. Every attack you land as Senua, or suffer from an enemy who got the better of you, seamlessly feels like part of the narrative experience. </p><div><h4> A few notes on graphics settings for PC  </h4><div> <p><em>Saga</em> is a gorgeous game with beautiful  character models and mesmerizing landscapes. It’s also a very narrative,  dare I say “cinematic,” experience, so if you can only run it at 30  frames-per-second, you’re still likely to have an enjoyable time. There  are a few musts, I found: Definitely switch the game’s upscaler to DLSS  if you have an Nvidia card, or FSR3 if you have AMD GPU. </p><p>&nbsp;Additionally, I  struggled a bit with some visual artifacting early on that seemed to go  away when I bumped the “Effects Quality” setting to “High.” By hitting  the space bar in the graphics settings, you’ll get a preview of how Senua  and the world look based on your settings. You can also rely on the performance  meter in the “Graphics” options to get a sense of how to fine  tune your experience on PC.  </p></div></div><p><em>Hellblade II</em> is also very short, and I do wonder if it could’ve spent its time a little better. Fight sequences get a little repetitive with constant, rotating one-on-one showdowns. And some of the puzzles, particularly an early one after Senua learns a bit more about the plight of Iceland, overstay their welcome. It’s very easy to get lost. But just when I began to feel a little tired of skulking around in the darkness, the game would take a narrative turn that hit me square in the heart, thanks in no small part to actor Melina Juergens’ emotionally powerful performance as Senua.</p><figure id="" data-id="cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-recommend-id="image://cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Runes surround Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Runes surround Senua." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-recommend-id="image://cb5538f9568f18be6738d628da918748" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Runes surround Senua." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lasting just eight or nine hours, you can maybe work your way through the game in a weekend. In a world of games that want to have your attention forever, that is one of the great gifts of <em>Saga</em>. There’s an almost counter-cultural vibe going on with this game, one where you think less of how to “game” it, and instead are simply focused on the gripping narrative, which itself is aiming to subvert a few expectations of what a warrior is and what they should do to earn such a title. The game sustains that up until its conclusion, which I’m still thinking about as I come to understand what this journey has been for Senua…and perhaps for myself.</p><hr><p><em>Hellblade II</em> is a special game of complicated emotions. In fact, on one occasion when I attempted to play it on Steam Deck (where the experience was less than ideal but but certainly playable), I had to stop as I was in public and began to get overly emotional during a specific part that meditates heavily on identity and suffering. </p><figure id="" data-id="2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-recommend-id="image://2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side shot of Senua shows her face wrought with grief." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side shot of Senua shows her face wrought with grief." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-recommend-id="image://2a07c10a702cff5dd946484b47d2efec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side shot of Senua shows her face wrought with grief." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Saga</em> is focused on unearthing the nature of monsterhood in a way that you might not be prepared for, especially if you’ve had struggles with mental health or have deep personal traumas of your own. And, I might add, this is especially the case if you identify as a woman. You should, and perhaps must, take the time to care for your own emotions during <em>Saga</em>’s eight-hour duration, one which I think ultimately will lead you to perhaps consider ways in which both individuals and humanity might escape from perpetual, spiraling patterns of destruction.</p><p>Senua’s enduring compassion and dedication through a rage-inducing journey of pain left a significant impression on me. Despite dealing with a fantastical world, <em>Hellblade II</em> is often, hauntingly, all too real. <br></p><p><strong>Buy <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Senuas-Saga-Hellblade-Standard-Windows/dp/B0CWL1LQ85/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CWL1LQ85" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmia2xa7OWn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmia2xa7OWn" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fsenua%25E2%2580%2599s-saga-hellblade-ii--xbox-series-x-s%2F408729.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fproducts%2Fsenua%25E2%2580%2599s-saga-hellblade-ii--xbox-series-x-s%2F408729.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo will acquire US game developer Shiver Entertainment from Embracer Group.</p>
<p>Shiver is best known for its port work, and most recently handled the Switch ports of Warner Bros’ Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>Nintendo says it has acquired the firm to ‘secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles’. It adds that post-acquisition, Shiver will continue to port and develop software ‘for multiple platforms, including Nintendo Switch’.</p>
<p>Nintendo doesn't make too many acquisitions, certainly compared to its rivals. However, it has made some strategic moves in recent years. In 2022, it acquired <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-long-running-partner-studio-srd-co">long-term development partner SRD studio,</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-completes-dynamo-pictures-acquisition-relaunches-as-nintendo-pictures">Japanese animation firm Dynamo Pictures</a> (later renamed Nintendo Pictures). It also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-next-level-games">acquired Luigi's Mansion developer Next Level Games in 2021.</a></p>
<p>The company has been investing heavily in expanding its development capacity due to the longer development cycles required to make modern video games. This includes a new development centre, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/opening-of-nintendos-new-development-centre-delayed">which is set to be completed by 2028.</a></p>
<p>In the firm’s latest financial call, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa discussed the company’s approach to the expansion, and said that although acquisitions may form part of the strategy, the firm’s focus is on building up its internal resources and maintaining its relationships with existing third-party dev partners.</p>
<p>“We have continuously expanded our development resources over the past several years through the recruitment of recent graduates and mid-career hires,” he said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to actively work to secure the necessary development resources to increase the long-term value of our IP and to constantly offer unique entertainment proposals. Although development resources could be expanded through M&amp;A, first we will work within the company with our developers, who thoroughly understand and have built up the Nintendo brand over the years, to have them nurture talent who can drive Nintendo's future development. In addition, many of our external development partners have gained a deep understanding of Nintendo's way of thinking and game development methods over the many years of collaboration, and we would like to further strengthen our ties with such partners.</p>
<p>“The process of game development will inevitably become longer, more complex, and more advanced. It is vital that Nintendo offers consumers new and unique experiences through game development, so we will actively invest in expanding our development resources”</p>
