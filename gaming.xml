			<p>Digital Extremes has announced a demo release for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999 update</a>, due later this Winter. The demo is available starting today on all platforms where Warframe is playable. Any player can access the Warframe: 1999 demo after completing the Awakening and Vor's Prize tutorial quests. They just need to find a mysterious infested terminal in the main ship's flight deck.</p>
<p>Stepping into the shoes of Arthur (played by Ben Starr) and his trustworthy Atomicyle, the demo lets players check out a small slice of the twisting alleyways of downtown Höllvania in a replayable Exterminate-style mission. You'll find the new enemy faction, the Scaldra, and their toxic goo weapons, barring your way. Those who manage to complete the Warframe: 1999 demo before the full update launches this Winter will get the Protokol Longsword Skin.</p>
<p>New cosmetic items are also hitting the Warframe Market today to celebrate the in-game Halloween event, Nights of Naberus. Get spooky with the Lycanblight Syandana Backpiece and Shoulder Armour or the Charger Liset Ship Skin.</p>
<p>By the way, as promised at TennoCon, Digital Extremes has now released the full musical track originally featured in the TennoCon demo. "The Call" by Matthew Chalmers and featuring vocalist Francesca Hauser is now available on Spotify, Apple, YouTube Music, and Bandcamp.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warframe: 1999 will see the introduction of a romance system. Players can send email messages to other members of the Hex Squad and, if they 'play their cards right,' even receive a New Year's kiss. Hex Squad will be voiced by an amazing cast: Amelia Tyler (Baldur's Gate 3's narrator), Kevin Afghani (Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder), Melissa Medina (Zanuhali and Nitowikwe in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail), Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge (one of the available player voices in Forza Horizon 5), and Alpha Takahashi (Hanako Arasaka in Cyberpunk 2077).</p>

Perhaps you’ve realized that gathering them all can be an overwhelming task. Maybe you’ve had a cry. Luckily, we can take the guesswork out of <em>one </em>of those many currencies in this guide by telling you the ways you can obtain the all-too-rare Ornate Coins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h144645"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Ornate Coins?</strong></h2><p>Ornate Coins are one of two main currencies you use in <em>Throne and Liberty’s</em> Shop tab. Unlike Lucent, the game’s premium currency that is purchased by breaking out your credit card and paying up, Ornate Coins can’t be bought with real money. Instead, these special coins are obtained in-game or via another odd method we’ll explain further down.</p><p>As for what you can buy with Ornate Coins—well, there’s a lot, actually. There are some <strong>exclusive Amitoi</strong> (pets) and titles for your character, as well as limited weekly stocks of important materials like <strong>weapon growthstones, armor growthstones, accessory growthstones, and fishing bait chests</strong>. You can even buy dyes and sewing threads to customize your armor and outfits.</p><h2 id="h144646"><a id=""></a><strong>How to get Ornate Coins</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-recommend-id="image://b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-recommend-id="image://b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are two main ways to get Ornate Coins: Finding codex entries or waiting for in-game mail from the dev team. Let’s dive into how it all works.</p><h3 id="h144647"><a id=""></a><strong>Finding codex entries</strong></h3><p>If you’ve been exploring the vast open world in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, you’ve almost certainly noticed the purple books and pages scattered around most zones in the game. By clicking and reading these, you’ll pick up codex entries, which grant you Ornate Coin x3 each.</p><p>Since codex entries are finite, this means you have a cap of how many Ornate Coins you can find with this method. Even if you round up every single codex entry, you’ll score just over 450 coins, meaning you’ll need to patiently wait to get your hands on them in other ways. And as of right now, there’s only one of those…</p><h3 id="h144648"><a id=""></a><strong>In-game mail</strong></h3><p>So, look, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is an MMO, which means that server issues are inevitable. Hell, at the time of writing this guide, the world server is down and making it impossible for me to access the game. But while that’s undoubtedly irritating, it has one silver lining: You may get more Ornate Coins because of it.</p><p>That’s right—the dev team will frequently send you Ornate Coins as an apology for server maintenance (particularly when it’s unexpected). So any time the game is down for a while, consider taking a look at your mail next time you log in to see if you’ve obtained some coins for your trouble.</p><p>That all being said, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is still a new game with a lot of fresh players arriving daily to increase the server load. This means that it’s likely to have more issues early in its life cycle and unexpected maintenance periods may be less frequent in the future, so I wouldn’t count on this method being consistent. Besides, we don’t know for sure if the team will continue doling out Ornate Coins for these problems permanently, or if it’s just a temporary way of keeping folks happy. Only time will tell.</p><hr><p>Ornate Coins aren’t the only thing that can be tough to come by in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, though. Salt is also a bit scarce—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-how-to-find-salt-cooking-amazon-1851667910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-how-to-find-salt-cooking-amazon-1851667910">unless you know where to look for it</a></span>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game quickly earned a loyal fan base thanks to a phenomenal main cast of characters and a compelling narrative hook. The game puts you in the shoes of Max Caulfield, who discovers she has the ability to rewind time after saving a friend from being shot by a bully in the school bathroom. She and her friend then team up to unravel the mysteries of their quaint Pacific Northwest town, including uncovering the whereabouts of a missing girl.

You’ll microdose <em>Groundhog Day</em> throughout the game as you rewind your mistakes in order to try again and impress your friends, or do better on a pop quiz. Time manipulation also becomes a mechanic for navigating the world, as sometimes you need to move or replace objects to get into previously closed-off areas. Max’s gift, however, isn’t all powerful. You can only turn back time so far and it can’t always save you from making dumb decisions. And eventually, because of its limitations, you have to choose one version of reality to live with.<br></p><p>Beyond the fascinating central mechanic, <em>Life Is Strange</em> thrives on its characters and world. The supernatural intrigue and mystery of the town only serve to hook you in, but the characters will keep you hanging on. That begins with Max herself, a young woman on the verge of graduating and hopefully leaving her home town to pursue a career in photography. She’s somewhat of a loner and only falls into the circumstances that drive the game’s plot due to that chance encounter with her old friend in the bathroom. That friend is Chloe, who Max was close with in childhood but hasn’t spoken to in a while. Every other student, teacher, and Arcadia Bay resident you interact with has a story of their own that connects to the larger plot taking place in the town. At the end of the game, though, Max and Chloe’s relationship proves to be the beating heart of <em>Life Is Strange</em>, and each episode adds layers to the two characters and their connection until it ends in a climactic final choice that only the two of them can make. It’s a beautiful game and it’s worth brushing up on before <em>Double Exposure</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-starforge-otk-shambles/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-starforge-otk-shambles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Asmongold recently uploaded a lengthy apology video following controversial comments made about the Palestinian people during a Twitch stream. Following his tirade, during which he labelled Palestinians as ‘terrible people’ and ‘inferior’, he earned himself a temporary ban on Twitch, but it seems that has been something of a wake-up call for the creator.</p>



<p>In his video, he revealed he’s cutting down the amount of time he spends streaming. He also confirmed he’s stepping back from leadership positions at both OTK <strong>and </strong>Starforge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-winding-down">Winding Down</h2>



<p>Zack ‘Asmongold’ Hoyt has seen his fair share of scandals over the years, but this latest escapade takes the prize. His recent racist rant earned him the backlash of a global community, and he has recognised in this latest video that he might have hit an all-time low.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I need to get myself in check. I need to get my mind under control. I need to fix my fucking life. It’s insane. I think about it – it’s just in shambles. Everything about my life is basically fucked.</p>



<p>I’m going to step away from my leadership position at OTK and Starforge and everything. They’re fine with that – they respect that, and I want to do this. I want to do this not only for them but mainly for myself so I can be a better version of myself.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>He then went deep on his apology, explaining that he has ‘read a lot of very bad things about Islam’ and has always cast an ill light on the religion because of that. With that in mind, the 34-year-old creator plans to visit the Middle East to witness Islam first-hand. It was also mentioned that as a punishment, he’s going to clean his home without a cleaning company to back him up.</p>



<p>If you know how Asmongold lives, then you understand how immense a task that will be.</p>



<p>Stepping back from leadership positions at OTK, a streaming organisation, and Starforge, a custom PC company, is just the start.</p>



<p>Going forward, Hoyt plans to make big changes to his content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My plan is to, when I get unbanned, I’ll keep streaming regularly, and I want to focus more on trying to do things that are fun, trying to laugh more with people rather than at people. It’s about a focus, and it’s about a tone. I listened to my tone in that clip and I just sounded like such a piece of shit. </p>



<p>I don’t want to be that person anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you accept Asmongold’s apology, or do you think he’s going to slip back into his old ways as soon as he’s back? Let us know in the comments.</p>

The C3 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TVs, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements.</p><p>The C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 120Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps. The C3 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including Nvidia G-Sync and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.</p><p>A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C3. The 65" TV weighs in at only 36.6 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.</p><h3>What's the difference between the 2023 C3 and the 2024 C4?</h3><p>The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $300 price difference, not much. The most important trait – picture quality – is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate, all of which are updates that you may very well never notice.</p><h3>Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p>Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> will definitely have more options available, however if this particular model drops in price even more, it certainly won't be by too much. Whatever you decide, this discount makes this easily one of the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-deals-labor-day-2024-sales"> best TV deals right now</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

Now, a little over a month after launch, Space Marine 2 has hit 4.5 million players.</p><p>Last month, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. At the time, Willits wouldn’t go into hard numbers, either in revenue or profit terms, but did go on the record to say <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-id-software-execs-space-marine-2-is-selling-faster-than-any-of-their-games-including-doom-and-quake"><u>Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on</u></a>, and that includes all the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, and Rage games id Software released over the 24 years he was at the studio.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Willits revealed that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he was id Software studio director on before leaving to join Saber in 2019. It seems likely that Space Marine 2, whose standard edition currently costs $59.99 on Steam and $69.99 on console, is already a highly profitable endeavor for all involved.</p><p>There are already ideas floating around for the now inevitable Space Marine 3, but in the shorter term Space Marine 2 has a confirmed Year 1 roadmap of post-launch support to deliver. Speaking of which, Focus has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-reveals-new-tyranid-enemy-the-huge-hierophant-bio-titan"><u>the imminent arrival of the Tyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan enemy type</u></a>, the new Neo-Volkite pistol, and the hotly anticipated Dark Angels chapter cosmetic pack. But that’s not all that’s coming to Space Marine 2. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels">Eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</a>, and even an unannounced new Thousand Sons enemy type.</p><p>Saber recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-30-adds-pc-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more"><u>Space Marine 2’s game-changing patch 3.0</u></a>, which made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-patch-30-made-a-seemingly-innocuous-change-to-the-games-ending-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-losing-their-minds"><u>a seemingly innocuous change to the ending that got Warhammer 40,000 fans excited</u></a>.

Leveraging<em> NBA </em>2K25’s platform has given us that opportunity,” said Thomas. </p><p>Thomas described <em>Gravity Ball</em> as a “mashup of <em>American-Gladiators</em>-meets-futuristic-basketball-meets-paintball,” and added that it’s “pure off-the-walls mayhem.” </p><p>As for why <em>Gravity Ball </em>exists and will be released through <em>NBA 2K25</em>, Thomas explained that every game studio wants to “try new things” and bring “new fun” experiences to players. </p><p>“Good concepts deserve a chance to find an audience and shouldn’t die on the cutting room floor. We hope you enjoy this game as much as we do and look forward to your feedback,” said Thomas. </p><p>The reaction to <em>Gravity Ball </em>has been...not great. Across Twitter and YouTube, many players aren’t happy with paid DLC being added to<em> NBA 2K25</em> and are also upset that the basketball sim needs more updates and fixes, but is instead getting a DLC game. There were also some fans who criticized <em>Gravity Ball</em> as 2K desperately trying to turn the basketball game into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>It will be curious to see if these superfans on social media represent the opinions of most <em>NBA 2K25</em> players or if, as is often the case, most of the game’s players aren’t online all the time and will be happy to check out <em>Gravity Ball </em>on October 18. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This weapon--another part of the game we're not spoiling--sounds like it'll require quick reflexes to master as Supergiant teased that players will be able to guard and retaliate with powerful attacks when using it.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Early Access GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Other updates in the weapons department include a reworked special attack for the Witch's Staff, a deadlier Moonstone Axe that sacrifices its blocking ability for a powerful rising slash attack, and projectiles from Umbral Flames that will spin left or right depending on your movement. Overall, weapons are going to be even more powerful with all the changes that Supergiant is making in this update.</p><p>The Dash ability will also be innately faster and more responsive, allowing players to more reliably dash out of hit-stun effects from certain foes' strikes. Supergiant didn't go into too much detail on its new region, but the studio did reveal that this will be a fully realized zone that has various locations within it. Several other regions will also receive new locations, and on a welcome note, you'll find a Pool of Purging in the space before you enter Tartarus. Fishing points should also be easier to reach, and various other fixes have been made to the locations.</p><p>This is just the tip of the Hades 2 iceberg, and if you're looking to read through the exhaustive update notes--while dodging some light spoilers--<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/7057794870234137717">you can click this link</a> to read them in their entirety.</p><p>While it's still early days for Hades 2, the current build of the game already feels like it offers enough to confidently stand as a complete product. "Hades II is an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it, balancing them beautifully to create one of the best roguelites on the market even in its incomplete state," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review-in-progress</a> back in May 2024.</p><p>Hades 2 is currently available for $30 on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but Supergiant has mentioned that the price could increase after its full release.</p>

Thankfully, there's a little trick that might work for letting you play before your region's scheduled release time. You just need to pretend you're from New Zealand.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past few years, eager Call of Duty fans have tricked their devices into thinking they live in New Zealand. This only seems to work for consoles, and the rules will be different for PlayStation and Xbox. PC users might be out of luck unless they have some VPN method to relocate them to New Zealand, but this is usually a console only trick.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[My very brief stint as a race car driver at the F1 Arcade]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271687/f1-arcade-racing-simulator-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-very-brief-stint-as-a-race-car-driver-at-the-f1-arcade.1011420/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271687/f1-arcade-racing-simulator-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Confidence was my first mistake. As I plopped down in one of the 83 racing simulators in the new <a href="https://f1arcade.com/us/">F1 Arcade</a> location in Washington, DC, I told the company’s CEO, Adam Breeden, that I’d raced plenty of times before. I picked Semi-Pro difficulty, even as Breeden told me he recommends most first-time arcade visitors pick something simpler. I adjusted the Vesaro simulator, started the race, and caused a six-car pileup on the race’s very first corner.</p><p>Luckily for me, the F1 Arcade is designed more for fun than fidelity, so my race wasn’t over. It ended four minutes later, in dead-last place, as the onscreen timer mercifully ticked to zero. On a normal day at the arcade, this would signal it’s time for someone else to race. For me, sitting at the wheel a few days before the arcade opened to the public, it just meant my shameful drive was finally over.</p><p>The DC outpost of the F1 Arcade is the company’s second location in the US — the first opened in Boston earlier this year, after two locations in the UK have been huge hits. (Breeden says one location did twice its projected revenue in its first year.) The project started a few years ago, when Formula 1 reached out to Breeden about building a more experiential product for racing fans. Breeden has been doing this kind of thing for a while — he calls it “competitive socializing” — and has built brands for Ping-Pong, minigolf, bowling, and darts — and says he landed on the idea of racing simulators right away. Millions of people have sat in arcade chairs and driven onscreen cars in games like <em>Cruis’n World</em>, and lots of people are willing to fork over hundreds or thousands of dollars to get a wheel and pedals into their own home. A fun, social, competitive racing experience seemed like a winner.</p><div><figcaption><em>The F1 Arcade is just rows and rows and rows of simulators. And a bar.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: David Pierce / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>All 83 simulators inside this huge DC space are the same: an all-in-one machine built by a company called Vesaro. (The company sells a modified version of the setup, which it calls <a href="https://www.vesaro.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=775&amp;idcategory=645">the V-Zero Mark II</a>, for a hair under £40,000.) It has a steering wheel and two pedals and a seat that rumbles and moves as your car does in the game. “If you’re playing this thing with full manual settings,” Breeden says, “it is functionally a professional-level racing simulator.” He says his team is already working on new versions of the rig, but he’s happy with the state of things, too. And he’s trying to make sure he thinks of everything — even the F1 Arcade’s food menus were designed in part to make sure you don’t bring messy fingers into the cockpit.</p><p>Racing simulators are not, by nature, fun to watch or even particularly social. Sims are complicated and require full attention, races last for hours, and watching someone’s heads-up view isn’t fun for very long. For Breeden and his team, the most important thing about the F1 Arcade was making it a group activity.</p><p>That process started with building an entirely new game to play. Booting up 83 copies of <em>F1 24 </em>just wasn’t an option. “Ultimately, the console game is not really fit for a concept like this. It’s very complicated,” Breeden says. What the arcade needed, he thought, was a way for racers to just sit down and start racing without having to make lots of choices and wait through loading screens. It also needed to be connected so people could race against the person next to them or even everyone else in the bar.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Booting up 83 copies of <em>F1 24 </em>just wasn’t an option</p></div><p>The F1 Arcade’s game is based on rFactor 2, a well-known simulator and rendering engine that is often used and modified for various kinds of professional simulating. (It’s also the game that real-life F1 champion Max Verstappen <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/max-verstappen-rants-after-virtual-le-mans-debacle.909/">rage-uninstalled last year</a>, after it crashed and cost him a virtual race.) Everything other than the core racing experience has been modified for the arcade, Breeden says. “And it’s not just the software,” he says. “It’s the booking system, the points, how it leads into the leaderboards, how that fuels the virtual currency we have.” The F1 Arcade team has designed a whole online system for gameplay, too: you play the reflex game by scanning a QR code rather than dropping in a quarter, and you win that virtual currency instead of tickets. It all took years and a team of engineers. Breeden says he’s much more of a tech company CEO than he ever expected to be.</p><p>The game has several different modes designed for in-person racing. Most people will race head-to-head against the other people in their group — the arcade rents simulators in 30- or 45-minute increments, the way you’d reserve a lane to bowl. You can also team up and take turns racing against up to 19 other teams around the venue. And for the more skilled and competitive racers, the F1 Arcade will have overall leaderboards and full-length races.</p><p>You win not by taking the checkered flag but by accruing points. You get points for being in first when the four-minute timer ends, yes, but also for overtaking other racers and doing other things on the track. The idea is to give everyone a chance, even the newbies —&nbsp;each player selects their skill level, which can be anything from essentially “Full Manual Simulator” to “The Car Basically Drives Itself,” and the game should adjust to keep everyone competitive. If you just imagine playing a photorealistic, really high-end version of <em>Mario Kart</em>, you’ll understand exactly how the F1 Arcade is supposed to feel.</p><div><figcaption><em>Everything, including the decor, screams F1.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: David Pierce / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>When you’re not playing, of course, the idea is you’ll eat and drink. And watch. Each simulator has two ultrawide, 49-inch ROG Strix displays, stacked vertically in front of the seat. The bottom screen shows your racing view, while the top one shows something more like you’d see on TV, so the people behind you can watch the race and cheer you on. “You get a close race, everyone’s banging the back of the simulator, screaming and shouting for their team,” he says. “And it’s just so participatory, which is what you want.”</p><p>There’s more to the F1 Arcade than the simulators. There’s a huge, upscale bar, with a menu overseen by Lauren Paylor O’Brien, the champion of the first season of Netflix’s <em>Drink Masters</em>. There are other games, like a wall of lights meant to test your reflexes. Most of the decor is F1-related in some way: the overhead lights are in the shape of various tracks or telemetry data coming from cars, and there are those iconic round red lights everywhere. Breeden is adamant that the way these places succeed is by appealing to people who don’t care about the activity and just want a place to hang out; the people who love racing will come anyway, you know? Still, it’s a room full of simulators.</p><p>So much of the arcade acknowledges the fact that everyone’s a gamer now and that modern socialization so often includes screens. This digital-IRL collision is happening everywhere you look: Nintendo built an AR Mario Kart experience at Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Osaka, Dave &amp; Buster’s is filled with mobile games and VR headsets, and kids are hanging out in <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> the same way they hang out at the mall. Breeden’s fine with all that. He’s just trying to build something worth leaving the house for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You might be able to guess what that region is based on the update’s title — “The Olympic Update” — but if you haven’t played the game yet, I’m not going to say anything else. I’m looking forward to exploring it as soon as I can and trying to take down the boss, who seems to be featured in the update’s release trailer. (I’ll probably try to get there with the new weapon, “Xinth, the Black Coat.”)</p><p>There are a bunch<em> </em>of other updates, too. Supergiant has added two animal familiars to the game: a bird and a dog (which, yes, you can pet). You can get boons from Athena and Dionysus, who were both in the original <em>Hades</em>. There’s new music; the song in the update’s trailer is <em>very</em> good. I could go on, but you should just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWH3jT53hIYM">watch the trailer for yourself</a> or read the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1145350%2Fview%2F7057794870234137716">extensive patch notes</a>. </p><p>As for what’s next, Supergiant plans to add a “climactic confrontation” after the new region, additional boons, and more enemies. The company says it’s planning to launch its next major update in “early 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, IO Interactive is shedding some light on its ambitious plans for Bond and a hoped for trilogy that will unveil a new origin story for the world famous spy.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," said Abrak. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>Abrak didn't offer any concreate details about when Project 007 will arrive, but noted that "the production's going amazingly well." He also reiterated his hope to use it as a launching point for additional James Bond games.</p><p>"I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come," added Abrak. "And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p><p>Project 007 doesn't currently have a release date. But we do know that Ubisoft veteran <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">Rodrigo Santoro was hired earlier this year</a> to be mission director for the game. As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-we-know-about-the-next-james-bond-movie/2900-5158/" data-ref-id="2900-5158">the next James Bond movie</a>, chances are good that Project 007 may come out first.</p>

<p>Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mara-Yama, horrifying Celestials, twisted into monstrous forms, are unlike anything humanity has ever faced in the battle for survival. The Mara-Yama feed on fear, delight in cruelty, and revel in the agony of their prey. They aren't just hunters - they are sadistic predators who savor every moment of psychological torment they inflict.</p>
<p>Stalking the deepest shadows of the Centauri Cluster, the Mara-Yama strike without warning, targeting the isolated and unsuspecting. But they're after more than cargo - they harvest minds, memories, and even emotions, leaving survivors forever haunted by the terror that hides between the stars. Few escape their grip, but those who do know the frightening truth that lurks out there in the void.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've yet to see any in-game footage of Exodus. While there's definitely room for a new sci-fi yarn in the Shepard vein at the minute, I hope it's not <em>too</em> much like Mass Effect, and is able to do something fiddly and fancy with time dilation in particular. Signing up McConaughey must have cost a pretty penny - it'd be a shame if the Interstellar connection turned out to be purely a question of cutscenes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod-likely-facing-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Don’t Nod, the developers behind Life Is Strange and the upcoming Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, is facing layoffs. The French studio announced on Wednesday that it was launching a “reorganization project” that could affect “up to” 69 jobs.</p>



<p>“Amid deteriorating results, and despite the actions already taken, the company is now compelled to consider a reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem,” Don’t Nod said <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">when reporting its latest earnings</a>.</p>



<p>“This project could impact Don’t Nod’s workforce in France and may affect up to 69 jobs. An initial exchange took place today with the employee representative bodies, and an information-consultation process with these same bodies will subsequently be initiated regarding this project.”</p>



<p>The studio added that the reorganization is aimed at strengthening the role of its editorial committee to meet market expectations, restore organizational agility, align technologies for better efficiency, and secure the company’s financing.</p>



<p>“Management is committed to fostering dialogue with employee representatives, with the aim of reaching agreements on accompanying social measures, including the possibility of a voluntary redundancy plan, should the project be adopted,” Don’t Note said.</p>



<p>Despite the falling revenue and reduction in staff, the company says ongoing development of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage as well as two other games will continue.</p>



<p>Don’t Nod reported an 11% decline in revenue for the first six months of 2024. It also announced a write-down of €24 million ($26.1 million) due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poor performances of Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>. Another €7.6 million ($8.3 million) write-down was made due to the temporary pause of games P12 and P13 in order to “prioritize resources and maximize the chances of success for the most promising titles at present.”</p>



<p>There was no mention as to what areas of Don’t Nod would be impacted by the layoffs, or when they would take place. Insider Gaming will have more when that information becomes available.</p>

"Hotfix #28 addresses a few crashes and blockers, integrates a handful of gameplay bug fixes, and resolves some issues with the Mod Manager," Larian said.</p><p>Though myriad improvements are hitting all platforms, the PS5 gets namechecked a few times in particular. PS5 players will enjoy quality of life improvements such as the Continue button working the same as Load Game in terms of reporting mod issues, the Mod Manager now correctly reporting the amount of remaining memory after uninstalling a mod, and the fixing of a bizarre bug that saw the DualSense lightbar update with different colors for every single frame of gameplay.</p><p>Larian has otherwise fixed the animated downloading bar not appearing when downloading a mod, addressed a crash that occurred when changing pages in the Mod Manager, and improved loading times for players with many mods installed.
