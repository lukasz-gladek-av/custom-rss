            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618616/logitech-powerplay-2-wireless-mousepad-charger-price-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve never reviewed a perfect product, but Logitech’s Powerplay Wireless Charging System comes close. For over three years and counting, I’ve never even had to <em>think</em> about charging my wireless mouse. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">It’s so dead simple, it feels like magic</a>, and it’s shame that most people probably can’t afford it at $120.</p><p>The good news: Logitech is releasing <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fpowerplay2" rel="sponsored">a new $100 version in March</a>, called the Powerplay 2, and it’s just as easy to set up. Plug in mousepad, snap a magnetic “Charging Coin” into the base of your mouse, then put mouse on mousepad to continuously charge.</p><p>The bad news: It’s only $20 cheaper, yet it feels like Logitech made its mousepad more than $20 cheaper to hit that goal.</p><p>The mousepad does come with improvements. Logitech boasts it has a 15 percent wider charging area and is thinner at just 3.5mm, and that’s what I see with my review unit. Now, as long as the entirety of my G502 Lightspeed mouse is resting within any corner of the mousepad, the charging indicator lights up, which wasn’t quite true of the original. My calipers do read 3.5mm when I’m measuring the charging base and its thin fabric mousing surface together.</p><p>But my calipers also show the charging base is exactly the same 2.7mm thickness as before, and the old mousepad wasn’t all that much thicker: just 4.3mm before vs. 3.5mm now, a difference I do not feel. And do you leave your mouse all the way at the corners of your mousepad? Again, I’ve spent over three years charging this mouse on the old mousepad without even thinking about it. I never bother to reposition my mouse on my old Powerplay to make sure it’s charging; I just drop it when I’m done using it, and I’ve never once run out of charge.</p><p>What do we lose with the Powerplay 2? First, while Logitech has ditched the old micro-USB cable, we’re <em>not</em> getting USB-C. Instead, Logitech’s opted for a <em>fixed</em> cable, so I can’t as easily take the mousepad off my desk on days I need more space on my desk.</p><p>The big one: there’s no more wireless mouse receiver built into the Powerplay 2, a feature I found handy with the original. Now, my mouse requires two full-size USB ports instead of one because I still have to leave the mouse’s dongle plugged into my PC, too. I can’t leave the dongle stowed in the mouse for grab-and-go travel, and I can’t leave it in my laptop and switch between laptop and desktop anymore by turning the mouse on and off and yanking the Powerplay’s plug.</p><p>There’s also no more programmable RGB light inside the Logitech G logo. I don’t terribly miss that, since I don’t sync up gamer lights. But the dull black Logitech G feels cheaper; before, the RGB was at least a nice reassuring reminder that my mousepad was properly receiving USB power and ready for action.</p><p>And, while I do like the new thinner mousepad that comes with the Powerplay 2, which looks like it might not delaminate from its backing as easily as the original (it’s the one piece of my Powerplay that has deteriorated over the past three years), the original Powerplay came with two mousepads (one hard, one cloth) in the box. Now, you get the one.</p><p>(Also, just as FYI, the new Powerplay 2 charging coin doesn’t seem to work with the original pad and vice versa. You can’t mix and match those parts.)</p><p>I tried hard to get Logitech to show me more benefits, because the original’s one of my favorite products. Perhaps this one’s so much easier for Logitech to produce that it’ll offer some great discounts, or sell amazing bundles after launch? Or perhaps that 15 percent larger charging area will come in handy for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194631/logitech-g309-gaming-mouse-powerplay">possible additional supercapacitor mice</a> that’d react worse than battery mice if they aren’t getting reliably fed, though the current supercap G309 seems to work fine with the original Powerplay in my early tests.</p><p>Logitech wouldn’t comment on future supercap products, wouldn’t hint at sales, and wouldn’t promise its own bundles — though Logitech does “anticipate retailers will be offering bundles shortly after launch,” according to Logitech senior global marketing manager Andrew Siminoff.</p><p>The original Powerplay is no longer in stock at major retailers, so I expect it will soon fetch a premium price on eBay. But the Powerplay 2 still seems like a good product that achieves the core goal. Fingers crossed that come Black Friday, we’ll be able to buy a combo pack with it and Logitech’s cheapest compatible mouse — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24194631/logitech-g309-gaming-mouse-powerplay">that G309</a> — for under $100 in total.</p><p>The Powerplay 2 should be available on Amazon <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us" rel="sponsored">and Logitech’s site</a> on March 11th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-fallout-crossover-make-me-play-indie-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro is one of those games that passed me by. Not because it’s bad, but because I have no idea how to play card games. It was a couple of months ago that it was revealed that Balatro had sold a whopping 3.5 million copies, which is a stellar performance for a game pieced together by a solo developer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was announced that Balatro will be landing on the Game Pass subscription service. To usher in this addition to the library of games, the ‘Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4)’ reveal was dropped, showcasing a series of cosmetic collaborations including Assassin’s Creed, Slay the Princess, and most importantly, <strong>Fallout.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-learn">Time to Learn</h2>



<p>If you know me, you’ll know I’m dizzy for the Fallout franchise. I’m a die-hard fan with thousands of hours invested across the series. When I first played Fallout 3 in 2008, it introduced me to a veritable feast of post-apocalyptic potential that became a burning adoration for the genre and setting.</p>



<p>Balatro, on the other hand, never took my fancy. It was released just over a year ago to an overwhelmingly positive reception, but I never saw the attraction simply because I know flat-nothing about card games.</p>



<p>To herald the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-game-pass-friends-of-jimbo-pack-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro on the Game Pass</a> service, a trailer was released showcasing the Friends of Jimbo (Pack 4) DLC, a cosmetic crossover featuring iconic imagery from some of the biggest and boldest franchises ever made.</p>



<p>To cut a long story short, there’s a cosmetic card upgrade featuring Fallout’s Vault Boy character, which you can see in the below trailer.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>And just like that, my curiosity is piqued and I have some connection to the chart-topping indie game that has won stacks of awards.</p>



<p>It helps that I’m also a huge Assassin’s Creed fan, and having Ezio Auditore on a card face has me eager to secure the pack and find out what all the fuss is about.</p>



<p>Recently, Balatro’s solo developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-luck-be-a-landlord-win-pegi-ratings-appeals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won a PEGI ratings appeal</a>, months after the game was classified as a game for adults because of the ‘promotion of gambling’. The developer, LocalThunk, also teased the impending ‘1.1’ update for the game, which is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-balatro-update-details-intentionally-being-kept-under-wraps/">being kept under wraps</a> until it’s the right time to reveal what’s coming.</p>



<p>Do you rate Balatro as one of the best indie games to emerge in years? In 2024, it was the Insider Gaming community’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/">Indie Game of the Year</a>.</p>

<p>It has just been revealed that Tekken 8 has already sold three million copies, passing the milestone inside a one-year window. The successful fighting title is also getting a new DLC fighter in the form of Anna Williams, a classic character who has been a stalwart figure in the franchise since the original Tekken in 1994.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco released an exhilarating gameplay trailer to showcase the imminent arrival of Anna Williams, who will join the game on March 31 for pass owners and April 3 for everyone else.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-blast-from-the-past">Blast From The Past</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been all that long since Anna Williams was last in a Tekken title. She surfaced in Tekken 7 as a DLC character and was in the starting line-up in Tekken 6. Her impending release in Tekken 8 was heralded by a three-minute gameplay trailer published recently by Bandai Namco:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="TEKKEN 8 – Anna Williams Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b6hYwWoOrDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Anna Williams will appear at the end of March wielding her trusty rocket launcher, but in a switch-up to her moveset, she’ll be wielding that bazooka as a melee weapon as well as a ranged accessory.</p>



<p>The trailer above showcases a classic clash between Anna and Nina Williams. These sisters have been an iconic duo for years, but Nina has arguably enjoyed a little more time in the limelight. In 2005, she headlined a game on PlayStation 2 named Death by Degrees. </p>



<p>If you could complete the game, you’d unlock Anna as a playable skin, which represents her assuming the role of second fiddle.</p>



<p>Despite never being a Tekken fan, I somehow managed to find and play Death by Degrees when it came out twenty years ago, and for some reason, it has stuck with me all this time.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Anna Williams arrive in Tekken 8 in just a few weeks? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bossa-games-more-layoffs-industry-turmoil/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bossa-games-has-made-more-layoffs-amid-%E2%80%98industry-turmoil%E2%80%99.1118004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bossa-games-more-layoffs-industry-turmoil/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In January 2024, Bossa Games (formerly known as Bossa Studios) laid off ‘around one-third’ of all employees, citing a ‘perfect storm of circumstances’. Recently, it was revealed that further layoffs have hit the company, with Bossa Games’ CEO stressing that the industry is in a place of turmoil.</p>



<p>These layoffs represent the second round of redundancies to strike Bossa Games since the company revealed Lost Skies, an innovative open-world title that’s a far cry from the games the company is used to producing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-is-not-a-phase">‘This is Not a Phase’</h2>



<p>Henrique Olifiers, the CEO of Bossa Games, posted a lengthy statement on LinkedIn highlighting the state of the wider industry. It’s his opinion that the tens of thousands of workers laid off over the last two years don’t represent ‘a phase’ but ‘a fundamental transformation’ of the business at large.</p>



<p>The co-founder of the company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve had to make the painful decision to scale back, focusing on the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future. Once Lost Skies is established and enjoying live operations, we’ll reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wasn’t mentioned how many people were impacted by this round of redundancies, as Olifiers’ statement only mentions letting go of ‘extremely talented and treasured colleagues’.</p>



<p>This has already been a terrible year for the industry when it comes to layoffs and studio closures. Recently, it was suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/">NetEase is preparing to divest</a> overseas studios, which could result in several offices closing entirely. That news came days after the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-developers-laid-off-as-netease-guts-entire-team/">laid off a North American team</a> formerly working on Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>Bossa Games is best known for Surgeon Simulator and the quirky title, I Am Bread. The reveal of Lost Skies came out of left field, as it’s like nothing that the studio has worked on before, but gamers were enamoured by the exciting trailer and have been looking forward to the title since.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Activision Has Been Forced To Admit It uses AI To Generate Assets in Call of Duty]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-has-been-forced-to-admit-it-uses-ai-to-generate-assets-in-call-of-duty.1118001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-forced-gen-ai-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty players have accused Activision’s studios of using generative AI to produce in-game assets, namely calling cards, stickers, and some skins for at least a few months. For instance, a festive-themed calling card showing a ‘zombified’ Santa Claus bore clear traces of gen-AI usage – the character in question had too many fingers.</p>



<p>Now, the proof is in the open, and it’s all thanks to a recent Steam policy update that requires developers to clarify when generative AI has been used in the production of <strong>any </strong>game on the storefront. </p>



<hr>







<p>In a recent update to Steam’s policies, developers must disclose the use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-players-want-to-filter-out-games-that-use-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any generative AI</a> in a sub-section listed under any game’s core description. This comes as a result of new rules published by the United States Copyright Office, which has decreed that any AI-gen content cannot be classified under copyright laws.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page for Black Ops 6</a>, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Call of Duty is one of the most ambitious development efforts in modern gaming, with Activision’s studios boasting thousands of developers working concurrently across multiple projects. It rankled with <strong>many fans </strong>that these teams would need to ‘resort to’ using generative AI to produce in-game assets.</p>



<p>In most cases, the content produced has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ai-modern-warfare-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">branded ‘AI slop’</a> by followers of the legendary FPS franchise.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Activision has leaned on AI to support the Call of Duty series, though. In 2023, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-anti-toxicity-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI and ML-based tools</a> would be used to moderate in-game voice and text chat. This news wasn’t taken as harshly as the revelation that the team is using gen-AI to supplement the work of artists, though.</p>



<p>What’s the worst gen-AI asset you’ve seen created in Call of Duty? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nvidia originally confirmed that some of its new RTX 50-series graphics cards had a “rare” manufacturing issue that left them missing some promised render units and a slight amount of performance as a result, it only named three affected cards: the RTX 5090, RTX 5090D, and RTX 5070 Ti. But now, Nvidia has confirmed to us that RTX 5080 production was affected by the same issue as well.</p><p>“Upon further investigation, we’ve identified that an early production build of GeForce RTX 5080 GPUs were also affected by the same issue. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement,” Nvidia GeForce global PR director Ben Berraondo tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>In response to <em>The Verge</em>’s questions, Berraondo adds that “no other Nvidia GPUs have been affected” — we specifically asked about the upcoming RTX 5070, and he says it’s not affected either. Nor should any cards be affected that were produced more recently: “The production anomaly has been corrected,” he says. In case you’re wondering, he also told us that Nvidia was not aware of these issues before it launched these GPUs.</p><p>Here’s the company’s full amended statement:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>We have identified a rare issue affecting less than 0.5% (half a percent) of GeForce RTX 5090 / 5090D, RTX 5080, and 5070 Ti GPUs which have one fewer ROP than specified. The average graphical performance impact is 4%, with no impact on AI and Compute workloads. Affected consumers can contact the board manufacturer for a replacement. The production anomaly has been corrected.</em></p></blockquote></div><div><p>One specific Redditor was the one to discover <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618102/rtx-5080s-are-missing-rops-too">that their RTX 5080 also demonstrated the issue</a>; he’s since said he’s worked out a deal to hand that card to <em>GamersNexus</em>, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvBtfqU6svo">investigating the RTX 50-series issues</a>, for more study.</p></div><p>While it doesn’t seem like a lot of GPUs were affected, given how few of these GPUs have shipped so far, and Nvidia is also promising replacements, it’s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/617901/nvidia-confirms-rare-rtx-5090-and-5070-ti-manufacturing-issue#:~:text=But%20it%20is%20the%20latest%20in%20a%20line%20of%20annoyances">latest in a line of annoyances</a> with Nvidia’s new cards.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Plug being pulled in May.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Just weeks after laying off the "majority" of its staff, developer Phoenix Labs has announced it's shutting down its free-to-play Monster Hunter-style action game, Dauntless.
</p>
<p>
Dauntless' fast-paced take on the Monster Hunter formula received a warm reception when it launched into PC early access in May 2018, but it struggled to maintain that early momentum following a wider launch a year on. And its journey is now officially near its end.
</p>
<p>
Announcing Dauntless' closure in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayDauntless/status/1894090939267702888">terse message on social media</a>, Phoenix Labs wrote, "Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025. Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. Dauntless will no longer be available to play on and after May 29th, 2025 at 11.45pm PST. Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey."

<p>
Confirmation of Dauntless' demise follows several rounds of layoffs at Phoenix Labs, which was acquired by crypto company Forte in 2023. Last May, the studio announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">cancelling all projects other than Dauntless and Fae Farm</a> and laying off staff - a move believed to have impacted 140 employees - in order to "pave a path for a strong future". Then came the news last month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dauntless-and-fae-farm-studio-phoenix-labs-lays-off-majority-of-employees">a "majority" of employees would lose their jobs</a> in another round of cuts - which the studio blamed on "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".
</p>
<p>
At the time, it said it would discuss the future of Dauntless and Fae Farm "in the coming weeks". And while Dauntless' fate is now sealed, Phoenix Labs hasn't yet shared its plans for Fae Farm.

He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ongoing scarcity has made it challenging to purchase Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo since its soft launch last year, but it appears those days are behind us. The $99.99 alarm clock is now readily available from third-party retailers in the US, starting with <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/z73qyjwthc940">Best Buy</a>. You can also buy it directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo</a> without a subscription, with the only caveat being that you must sign in with a Nintendo account.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->100</span></p><div><p>The Alarmo takes dozens of characters and scenes from classic Nintendo franchises and places them in a charming alarm clock that’s designed to help you sleep and wake. It uses motion sensors to detect whether you’re still in bed and gets more aggressive the longer you sleep in.</p></div></div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">announced its alarm clock in October</a> while we patiently awaited (any) news regarding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which is set to launch later this year. Although the Alarmo is certainly not as exciting as a new console, it is unapologetically Nintendo, with a cartoonish look that calls to mind a vintage alarm clock — albeit with a few modern features.</p><p>Nintendo’s bright red alarm clock features an illuminated button on top and a rounded face that houses an LCD display. The 2.8-inch panel shows the time/date and will attempt to wake you each morning with scenes and sounds from several iconic franchises. It makes room for visits from beloved characters like Link and Mario, as well as pikmin. There are currently 35 scenes across five franchises available, and Nintendo says you’ll be able to download more in the future. An integrated motion sensor can detect whether you’ve moved, too, and each scene will get progressively more aggressive based on whether you’re knocked out cold or making an effort to get out of bed (it goes silent once you’re up).</p><p>Button mode enables a more traditional alarm clock experience by allowing you to start and stop alarms or access the settings by tapping and twisting the button on top. The Alarmo can also automatically initiate sleep sounds once you’ve jumped into bed for the night, provide basic insights into your sleeping habits, and even sound hourly chimes to help you keep track of time throughout the day. Individually, these features don’t always work as well as those on a dedicated alarm clock or sound machine, but most of those aren’t nearly as cute.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2D “Metroidbrainia” was first revealed back in 2024 and it continues to look very neat. You have to uncover secrets and manage the clock to liberate yourself from a glitched time loop. It’s the next game from the creators of the beautiful puzzle adventure <em>The Wild at Heart </em>and it looks like it could be something special. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Keepsake Games' Jump Ship is a co-op FPS where up to four players attempt to leap across the universe by selecting from a variety of hand-crafted missions. As the action plays out, they can seamlessly transition from operating their ship to on-foot planetary exploration, even space walks if need be. There's also talk of scavenging to make upgrades and repairs, as well as random elements to keep things fresh. Jump Ship comes to early access this summer.

<p>
Echo Weaver is a "time loop metroidBRAINia where time is [the] best resource and secrets are [the] only upgrades." It sees players navigating the remnants of a ruined society - a task made more challenging by the fact they're stuck in a glitching time loop. To escape, they'll need to rely on the energy of the loop itself, using it to heal, trade, and more. Developer Moonlight Kids also proudly proclaims, "No upgrades, no unlocks, just secrets... you can already do everything, you just don't know how yet." Echo Weaver doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to Xbox and PC with a day one release on Game Pass.

<p>
Fans of rogue-lite dungeon-crawling and shop management can witness their loves smash together again later this year when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass. On a basic level, developer Digital Sun's sequel promises more of the same, but it does have a few new tricks - including a new setting and a leap from the original's charming pixel art to striking 3D.

<p>
There's a lot of buzz already for developer Dogubomb's "atmospheric architectural adventure", Blue Prince - a deeply intriguing puzzler set in an ever-changing house. The ultimate goal is to find the elusive Room 46 by unravelling the secrets on its 9x5 grid of chambers, but players can only venture so many steps before it reconfigures itself again. Blue Prince looks like fiendishly clever stuff and it now has a release date, coming to PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 10th April.

<p>
If, like me, you've been itching to get back into an orange camper van ever since your family's beloved Volkswagen dramatically burst into flames in the middle of the road somewhere in the 90s, developer Square Glade Games' Outbound should be pure bliss. It's a game of open-world wilderness roving and survival, where you'll need to grow your own crops, harness natural resources for energy, customise your vehicle, and build a comically impractical house on your roof. Sadly, it's not out until next year, but I'm ready and eager.

<p>
Herdlings, the latest from Far: Lone Sails developer Okomotive, is a "stirring and beautiful journey into the mountains... and beyond" that sees players shepherding (or herding, I guess) mysterious creatures across a strikingly picturesque landscape of sweeping peaks, fog-shrouded forests, and more. You'll need to hone your skills to overcome its challenges, threats, and a smattering of light puzzles - and you'll probably need a few tissues too given it's promising an "emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing through a fallen world". Herdlings is out this summer on PC and consoles.

<p>
Wax Heads, from developer Patattie Games, continues to look a treat. It's a "cosy-punk" narrative game about running a struggling record store, where players are tasked with satisfying eccentric customers by rooting out the perfect musical purchase. It's got puzzles, arcade cabinets, stickers, and "punchy, humorous" dialogue - and it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC in "summer" next year.

<p>
The Lonesome Guild is a single-player action-RPG "full of heart, battles, and bonds that change everything". It's the work of developer Tiny Bull Studios and follows protagonist Ghost (a ghost) and their ragtag team of friends as they try to save the world. It promises puzzles, intense battles, and a land full of mystery and treasure that players can explore by seamlessly switching between party members - with new side quests and abilities unlocking as bonds are strengthened among the team. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC this autumn.

<p>
Pretty much everything you need to know about Buckshot Roulette is right there in the title. Developer Mike Klubnika's grimly comedic twist on Russian Roulette - the twist being that it involves a shotgun - is a game of bargaining, begging, and betrayal, as players battle to walk away rich over the course of a 15-minute match. It was a bit of a viral sensation when it launches in 2023, and it's coming to Xbox and Game Pass "soon".

Its weird, wild premise sees novice federal marshal protagonist Justine - who's got an insane serial killer named Dr. Carnival living inside her - breaking up a serial killer shindig in the titular Pittsburgh hotel. That involves rampaging across seven levels, each inspired by a different horror movie and featuring a distinct boss. She's also got a bit of extra help from the ghosts of her previous attempts, which manifest to fight alongside her.

Developer LocalThunk's poker-inspired roguelite Balatro has been a smashing success since releasing last year. But if you haven't had chance to play it yet, you've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">now got the option to do so via Game Pass</a>. And to accompany its arrival on Microsoft's subscription service, a free new DLC - adding cosmetic card backs inspired by the likes of Assassin's Creed, Fallout, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> - launches today on all platforms.

The last band management game I can remember playing was Rockstar Ate My Hamster, and that came out over 35 years ago. Yet Rockbeasts from developer Lichthund somehow reminded me of that game's anarchic spirit, even if you're playing grumpy, grungy animals instead of parodies of real-life musos here. "Lead a band of misfits on a roller-coaster ride to stardom in the age of MTV, rock anthems, and bad haircuts," explains its official blurb, before dropping the bombshell that it also stars Iggy Pop. Rockbeasts, officially a "story-driven, role-playing management game" is coming to Steam and consoles later this year.

Ratatan, if you're unfamiliar, is the spiritual successor to Sony Japan Studio's beloved PlayStation Portable rhythm adventure Patapon. It managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patapon-creators-ratatan-kickstarter-funded-within-an-hour">smash its crowdfunding goal within an hour of launch</a> back in 2023 and development's been quietly ticking along since then. Helmed by Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani, with original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also onboard, it promises a roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes. Ratatan was originally targeting an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC release this April, but its latest trailer - shared during ID@Xbox - now only says "2025".

When last we heard from developer Witch Beam, it was gracing us with Unpacking - a lovely little thing that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">go on to be crowned Eurogamer's game of 2021</a>. Four years later and it's poised to release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tempopo">Tempopo</a>, a vibrant musical puzzler set across a world of floating islands. Each island is a puzzle and finding the solution enables protagonist Hana to reclaim a lost musical bloom and replant it in her garden. Finding the solution, however, involves using Hana's conducting skills to guide the titular Tempopo onward, encouraging them to smash, block, lift, and push their way to victory. It's coming to PC, consoles, and Game Pass on 17th April.

<p>
Tiny Monks Tales' Woodo is absolutely adorable, and I'm already sold based on that fact alone. But more specifically, it's a "cosy 3D puzzle matching game" in which players work through a series of dioramas charting a new episode in the life of Foxy and Ben the frog. Each new stage brings a new selection of items - lovely, chunky wood-carved things - and players have to figure out where they belong, dropping them into a scene with a satisfying plop. There's no release date for Woodo yet, but it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation, and PC.

<p>
In Denkiworks' Tanuki: Pon's Summer, the Tanuki Festival is just a month away. Unfortunately, the shrine is also in need of repair - and so enters Pon, a well meaning Tanuki who gets himself a part-time job delivering packages, all in the name of raising some coin. There's a colourful cast of characters to befriend, a whole bunch of side activities and sports to pursue - from baseball and sushi-making to enthusiastic drumming - and best of all, you get a BMX you'll be using to hurtle around the game's four towns, inspired by Kyoto, Aomori, Sapporo, and Beppu. It's a delightful looking thing and it's out on PC, Switch, Xbox, and Game Pass later this year.

<p>
Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to developer RageSquid's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has a release date and is coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass on 9th April. It's an intriguing one too, ditching the exhilarating mountain biking of its predecessor in favour of basically as many extreme sports as possible. That's obviously a pretty ambitious goal, so Descenders Next is starting smaller and focusing on boarding sports - the snow kind and otherwise - across "multiple huge biomes". It's got extensive customisation, a Monstercat soundtrack, and support for up to 12 players.

After getting its neon on in 2023's Tron: Idenity, Bithell Games is back with more future action in Tron: Catalyst. It's an "all-new story-driven, isometric action adventure game" in which players ride Light Cycles and engage in Identity Disc combat as they traverse the crumbling Arq Grid. There's talk of "intriguing stories within a budding revolution", as well as secret areas and shortcuts to find - all of which players will be able to experience when Tron: Catalyst comes to  PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 17th June.

After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-studios-33-player-co-op-roguelike-33-immortals-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">bit of a delay</a> nudged Spiritfarer studio Thunder Lotus' 33 Immortals into this year, it's finally launching into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access on 18th March. It's an intriguing thing too, serving up a striking action roguelike in which players, in the role of damned souls, must co-operative to defeat hordes of monsters and massive bosses in order to rebel against God's final judgment and fight for their eternal lives. There's a twist, however; as its name implies, this is a chaotic quest designed to be tackled by 33 players.

And finally, a bit of a treat for twinky puppet fans. Lies of P: Overture, the eagerly awaited expansion for 2023's well-received Souls-like adventure, just got an atmospheric new story trailer. Overture, a "dramatic prequel" to the base game, transports players to the city of Krat to witness its final days before the Puppet Frenzy massacre. They'll meet a legendary Stalker and journey through Krat together, uncovering untold stories and hidden secrets. And probably a bunch of extremely tough battles too. There's still no release date for Lies of P: Overture, however, so you'll just have to make do with its latest trailer for now.

  <div>
      <div><p>A new <em>Catan</em> Kickstarter campaign has gone live. Fanroll LLC's new <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> campaign isn't for a revised board game edition but for a series of artisanal, bespoke game components in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-3d-expansion-and-dawn-of-humankind-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan 3D</em></a>. The campaign was fully funded in an hour.</p>

<h2>The Catan Masterpiece Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the Kickstarter page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultimatecatan/catan-masterpiece-series/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a> campaign started as a premium dice set. This escalated to the studio wanting to reimagine every element of the beloved board game. Those reimagined elements include game pieces made of wood, metal, resin, and cut gemstones.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/catan-masterpiece-ancient-civilization-pieces.jpg?itok=bgJO1-GM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/catan-masterpiece-ancient-civilization-pieces.jpg?itok=cQUfq52_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That is what you are backing with this Kickstarter. Not a premium version of the <em>Catan</em> board game, but individual components made with pristine materials. Backers have tons of options from resin or painted wooden dice to metallic or resin Robber pieces to gemstone hex tiles. There are even three sets of player pieces: Metal Classic, Plastic Civilizations, and Metal Civilizations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CATAN Masterpiece Series is a tribute to the game that has brought joy and camaraderie to so many. It's a celebration of the countless memories made around the table, the friendships forged through friendly competition, and the sheer excitement of watching your settlements and cities come to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the Catan Masterpiece series are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Explorer for $25: Your choice of two plastic Ancient Civilization pieces and one of eight plastic pins</li>
	<li>Harbormaster for $69: Everything in the Explorer tier, a full set of nine Ports, a wooden dice set, and your choice of resin Robber and two of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Traditionalist for $99: Everything in the Harbormaster tier, a set of Classic Metal player pieces, a set of Sharp-edge Dice, your choice of Metal Robber, and three of eight pins</li>
	<li>Architect for $149: Your choice of four plastic Ancient Civilizations, one Metal Ancient Civilization, a set of Nine Ports, a set of Sharp-edge Dice, a Gemstone Robber, and four of eight pins</li>
	<li>Woodcutter for $299: A set of wood hexes, wood sea frames, Acryllic number discs, everything in Architect tier, and five of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Artisan for $499. A set of Sparkle Resin hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, everything in the Architect tier, and six of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Stonecutter for $749: A set of gemstone hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, everything in the Architect tier, and seven of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Noble for $999: a set of gemstone hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, all Ancient Civilizations, a set of Metal Classic Player Pieces, a set of Nine Ports, a set of Painted Wood and Sharp-edge dice, a Resin Robber, a Metal Robber, a Resin Robber, and all eight pins.</li>
</ul><p>For those wanting a more specialized bundle, the individual pieces can be purchased as separate add-ons once you have backed the project.</p>

<p>At time of writing the <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$286,318, more than five times its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign concludes on March 21.</p>

After a messy run with Zack Snyder, the new plan was to reboot the DC film franchise, connect the shows and movies to it, and give creators more freedom to make varied projects in different genres. And the two said that the goal is to create a universe that feels interconnected, but with films that still feel separate and standalone. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As covered by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> who attended the recent DC Studios press event, Gunn doesn’t want people to feel like they need to do homework and watch a bunch of past content before they see the next big DC show or film. </p><p> “We remain steadfast that each of these projects work as a standalone project,” said Gunn. “So you can see <em>Superman</em>, you can watch <em>Lanterns</em>, without having to see both of them. Although if you can, there will be special things in there for people who have seen both.” </p><p> And this is all part of a larger six-year plan, which the duo confirmed will culminate in an <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>-like crossover movie. Neither exec had any more details to share about this big movie, which is not likely to hit theaters until 2030, but Gunn has experience producing these kinds of superhero event films, having served as an executive producer on Marvel and Disney’s <em>Endgame </em>in 2019. </p><p>To reach the point where such a project is viable in the new DC universe, Gunn and Safran laid out a plan that calls for a lot of content. According to the DC Studio bosses, the company will produce two-live action movies, two live-action shows, and two animated shows every year, some of which will be created exclusively for WB Discovery’s Max. </p><p>It’s an ambitious plan and I worry that it might be too much, too fast, but Gunn and Safran are committed to making sure every movie has a solid script before production begins. Likewise, they admitted they are flexible and will change the plan as needed. </p><p>For example, in 2023, they had no intentions of making a movie about Batman villain Clayface. But then Mike Flanagan, the filmmaker behind works such as <em>Doctor Sleep </em>and <em>Midnight Mass</em>, pitched them one and wrote a script they both loved and it got greenlit. Of course, I’ve not seen <em>Clayface</em>, but it at least sounds like Gunn isn’t too worried about changing plans or fiddling with canon if it means getting a cool movie. That might be the key to defeating superhero fatigue and competing with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913">Marvel’s massive MCU</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t release until March 20, but that hasn’t stopped some players from getting their hands on a copy of the game. Ubisoft knows about the situation and has, in turn, released a statement to players about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting out to the public early and the leaks that have followed.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1894135156312617339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledges that players have</a> “accessed Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its official release”. Ubisoft says that players, if they see the gameplay, should know that there is still some work being done to prepare for the day one experience.</p>



<p>“The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game,” Ubisoft said.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dauntless-being-shutdown-by-phoenix-labs-in-may">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dauntless-being-shutdown-by-phoenix-labs-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dauntless Being Shutdown By Phoenix Labs In May</a></h6>



<p>The studio also called the leaks “unfortunate” and “can diminish the excitement for players”. To that point, they suggest those with the game avoid publishing anything to avoid spoiling it for those who are waiting until the game launches.</p>



<p>“We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others,” they said. “Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.</p>



<p>“Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s launch comes after multiple delays from its original fall 2024 release.</p>

			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>
<p>What DC games would you want to see from NetherRealm and Rocksteady? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

Three years later, the game has been brought over the finish line by the rest of the team at Indonesian studio Pikselnesia, with a result that feels unavoidably prescient. Though <em>Afterlove EP </em>isn’t without its flaws, its meditation on the mundane ways grief distorts us, and the unglamorous journey of finding our way back to the light, offers an understated catharsis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>follows Rama, an indie band frontman who loses a part of himself when his partner Cinta unexpectedly passes away. He spends a year in self-inflicted isolation, and by the time he’s ready to crawl out of his apartment and try to be a person again, he’s surprised to see how much of the world has moved on without him. Or, at least, tried to. His bandmates have felt trapped in his indecision, so they’ve been looking for lifeboats off a sinking ship with new projects and career paths. Rama expected everything to be where he left it a year ago. <em>Afterlove EP </em>spends much of its time underlining that while grief deserves sympathy, it doesn’t become a free pass to treat people however you want.</p><p>Grief requires some grace. No one handles the loss of a loved one “perfectly,” and a story that criticizes someone going through that pain can be a tough sell, and easy to fuck up if its characters come off as irredeemable or its approach feels insensitive. <em>Afterlove EP </em>starts out with Rama hearing the disembodied voice of Cinta encouraging him to get back out there and perform again, but as the game goes on, it becomes clear it’s less an echo of a lost loved one and more a manifestation of Rama’s inner monologue. Cinta is defensive and accusatory, and puts Rama’s feelings above everyone else’s. As I lived out Rama’s life, I gradually became frustrated when Cinta would weigh in. This wasn’t the compassionate person her grieving friends described, it was someone who almost always defaulted to Rama’s point of view, siding with him even when his friends had grievances that were more than reasonable.</p><figure id="" data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If that disconnect between player and protagonist sounds frustrating, it is, but it makes Rama’s growth and the story’s pay-off so much sweeter. Rama starts off sympathetic. He’s grieving the loss of someone who was clearly close to him, but the longer I played <em>Afterlove EP</em>, the more it became clear he was myopically obsessed with his own pain and ignoring how others were affected by his absence. The identification I felt with him gradually gave way to alienation as I stood by and watched his relationships unravel, like I was a friend powerless to stop someone I care about from falling further down into despair. <em>Afterlove EP </em>gave me plenty of opportunities to argue with my friends who felt abandoned by me, but for most of the game, I couldn’t find dialogue options that resembled an apology for my absence, my belligerent musician’s ego, or the selfish way I talked about my grief as if it was more important than anyone else’s. I spent hours of <em>Afterlove EP </em>watching people who cared about each other nearly lose one another because Rama couldn’t see past his own pain. Every time I met up with bandmates trying to pick up where things left off, it felt like the ties between them were one wrong word away from snapping as he insisted on his own vision of the music and the band’s future, and was indifferent to his friends’ pain after they lost a friend, too. Rama can be a frustrating character to pilot in a dialogue-based game, and Cinta’s inability to challenge him made me skeptical of her from the beginning, but <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s commitment to its damaged hero and his dysfunctional friend group is a crucial piece of the story it’s telling.</p><p>There’s a fine line between a sympathetic protagonist and a selfish one, and <em>Afterlove EP</em> balances on it so well that by the time I was hours into Rama’s story—watching him be so fixated on his own shit that he was hurting those closest to him—I only felt sorry for him. He couldn’t see the forest for the trees, even in the face of so many possibilities for forming new connections and repairing old ones.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>plays like a <em>Persona </em>game in which you manage relationships and work each day, deciding whether to spend your limited time seeing friends, busking for money, going to therapy to unpack all the discord within your social circles, or possibly building a relationship with a new suitor. I spent most days hanging out with Satria, a record store shopkeeper who knew exactly how to push Rama’s buttons. He’s part of a queer community that plays music in the local park. Rama hasn’t explored this side of himself, and that kind of self-discovery isn’t made easier by having the disembodied voice of your ex talking to you while you try to form new connections. However, <em>Afterlove EP </em>doesn’t reach for the low-hanging fruit I expected it to when it comes to Rama finding new love. Given Cinta’s hold on him, I feared that Rama moving on to a new partner might see the game create a toxic love triangle in his mind, but instead, things play out quite differently. It was a welcome change after Rama’s mourning had gotten in the way of him moving forward for most of the game. Grief is the foundation <em>Afterlove EP </em>is built on, but its waxings on the topic aren’t the only thing it has to say.</p><p>The thread connecting all these relationships is the indie rock music Rama plays. When you’re not chatting with friends and potential lovers, <em>Afterlove EP </em>is a rhythm game with some really catchy tracks that capture the spirit and gusto of young performers who want a life for themselves outside of the bars and kitchens they work at now. Even if I can’t understand the Indonesian lyrics, I feel the pain and yearning in Rama’s voice and the heavy riffs underneath.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That being said, <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s rhythm game segments are exceptionally hard to read. Each note you play runs down a sheet music-like track, prompting you to press one of the four directional buttons when it reaches the center of the screen. The way it’s presented can be disorienting and frustrating—its use of directional inputs comes with a muscle memory expectation that some of the movement you’re seeing should correlate to which button you’re pressing. Instead, I tripped up a fair bit as notes came from the right side of the screen but required me to press up or down. Rhythm games, like playing a real instrument, are meant to be instinctual. You train yourself on something long enough and it becomes muscle memory embedded in your fingertips. <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s UI design is minimalistic, and doesn’t communicate its mechanics well, so it never quite reaches that level of intuitive rhythm you need to get lost in the music.</p><p>Like Rama’s music, <em>Afterlove EP </em>balances the thorny and heartwarming parts of love and loss. Given what the Pikselnesia team went through to make it happen, it’s not surprising that it understands all the ugly and beautiful parts of losing someone you care about. A lot of <em>Afterlove EP </em>guides you by the hand through the mundane parts of becoming a person again. When you lose parts of yourself, finding something new, good, and healthy to fill that void isn’t always glamorous or fun. It can be awkward and uncomfortable, and require talking to people who see through your bullshit and call you out on it when you can’t see past it yourself. <em>Afterlove EP </em>is sympathetic to the fact that none of us handle grief in a way that is easy to swallow for everyone around us, but its best moments come when it’s willing to slap you across the face and tell you to do better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Phoenix Labs is officially shutting down its free-to-play action RPG Dauntless this spring. In a post on Steam and social media, the studio kept the announcement pretty short and sweet.</p>



<p>“Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement reads</a>. “Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates.
