			<p>Starting tomorrow, October 1, 2025, you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points towards Xbox Game Pass subscriptions, which means today, September 30, 2025, is the last day you'll be able to redeem any Microsoft Rewards points you may have towards Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m22wu2q4st2f">first spotted by Wario64</a>, who shared the statement from Microsoft announcing that you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points for Xbox Game Pass. That said, there is still a way to get Xbox Game Pass through redeeming Microsoft Rewards points; you'll have to use your Rewards points towards redeeming an Xbox gift card.</p>



<p>As Wario64 points out, that means if you want to use your points to get even just one month of Game Pass, you'll need 6,000 more points than you would have if you could still redeem them directly for a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<p>It's the latest change to the Rewards Points system, and one that hasn't been met with favour from those who actively use the system. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1nuhtri/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">quick scroll through the Xbox Reddit page regarding the news</a> shows users are not happy that they'll need to spend thousands more points than before. </p>



<p>In other Game Pass news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">Microsoft and Xbox are reportedly putting more behind the subscription service than ever before in 2025</a>, while former Microsoft and Bethesda executive Pete Hines says that <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">subscription services like Game Pass don't properly reward the developers and studios making the content that fills the services</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrities are just like you and me. They enjoy some video games, just like the rest of us. And back in 2002, Sony was thrilled that so many famous people really enjoyed playing the PlayStation 2. Sony was so excited, in fact, that the PlayStation maker compiled a large list of “celebrity testimonies” and shared it with the press via the company’s 2002 E3 Press Kit. And thankfully, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ultrabrilliant.xyz/post/3m22r6klg722i">as spotted by Devolver Digital PR manager Andy Kelly</a>, someone all the way back in 2016 uploaded this <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2CelebQuotes">press kit to the Internet Archive</a>. Now we can all enjoy it.</p> <p>I’ve formatted all of the testimonials below, with minimal editing or tweaks. Now you can easily enjoy all of these testimonials, some of which don’t seem like something Sony would actually want people to read or share. And yes, some of the people below are not great and are super canceled in 2025. Take a shot for each time that happens. (Don’t do that.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Matthew Perry, actor, <em>Friends</em></h2> <p>“I used to have a social life, go on dates, go to dinner parties, have a job. Now all I do is sit in a big chair and play PlayStation 2. 1 never leave my house. My friends have wondered what happened to me. Howard Hughes must have had one of these.”</p>

 <h2>David Arquette, actor,<em> Scream 3</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is to the gaming world what the computer was to the typewriter. It’s not just an entertainment luxury, but a necessity.”</p> <h2>Hayden Christensen, actor, <em>Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em></h2> <p>“I just got [PlayStation 2] a few days ago, but I’ve been playing it non-stop; it’s a great system. The graphics are fantastic, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”</p>

 <h2>Luke Wilson, actor, <em>Charlie’s Angels</em></h2> <p>“Freedom from everyday life can only mean one thing – the arrival of PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Sandra Bullock, actress, <em>Miss Congeniality</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the only place where I can legally explode things and not harm anyone.”</p>

 <h2>Chris Klein, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve been playing game systems for a really long time, but once you go PlayStation 2 you can never go back. . .It’s the best system for sure.”</p> <h2>Jason Biggs, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I do play PlayStation. I have a PS2 console and it is awesome…It is amazing. PS one is still great, but the graphics and the concepts on PS2 are incredibly realistic…I had PS2 in my trailer for <em>American Pie II</em>. Me and the rest of the guys would get into some heated games.”</p>

 <h2>Jason Lee, actor, <em>Almost Famous</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is the most amazing game I’ve ever played. Amazing graphics, too. The console looks like it’s straight out of <em>Blade Runner</em>!”</p> <h2>Justin Timberlake, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I play PlayStation 2 all the time, not just on the road. The play action is really easy and has the best graphics.”</p>

 <h2>P. Diddy, rapper</h2> <p>“No doubt I am a [PlayStation 2] fan. My kids and I play together.”</p> <h2>Snoop Dogg, rapper/actor, <em>The Wash</em></h2> <p>“The rush to get the new PlayStation 2 is more out of control than the Cabbage Patch Kids. I want my music on there – I want it to be Snoop Dogg and PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Nick Carter, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“I’ve been playing PlayStation 2 since it came out. I take it out on tour and play on the bus, in my hotel room and backstage before the shows. The graphics are totally awesome, and I like that I can use it to play DVDs, too.”</p> <h2>Vin Diesel, actor,<em> The Fast &amp; The Furious</em></h2> <p>“If I’m not playing Sony PlayStation or rereading a classic or watching a foreign film. . .my friends and I get on the Internet and find out who I’m dating, and it’s always hysterical.”</p>

 <h2>Tara Reid, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation is fun. It’s innocent and fun. It is nice to be kids and have a good time… I bring PlayStation 2 into my trailer on every movie I do.”</p> <h2>John Leguizamo, actor, <em>Moulin Rouge</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the coolest thing ever. Forget my kids, this is MINE!”</p> <h2>Wayne Brady, comedian/actor, <em>Whose Line Is it Anyway?</em></h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2. I’m all over my PS2. . . I tour so much now doing my improv act, that it’s great because my wife doesn’t let me play games at home, so I play them in the hotel room.”</p>

 <h2>Seann William Scott, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve never seen anything like it. . . I’ve played other games before but PlayStation 2 is just amazing.”</p> <h2>Shannon Elizabeth, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is the best thing ever.”</p> <h2>Tom Green, actor, <em>The Tom Green Show</em></h2> <p>“They’ve all got Sony PlayStations and I don’t.” (On what he most values in his friends) “FINALLY, I’ve got my very own PS2″</p> <h2>Jimmy Fallon, actor, <em>Saturday Night Live</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is sweet! The new Madden game sounds insane…I want to play it now. I’m also excited about playing over the Internet. If they make an Olympic game it will be awesome to actually play someone in China. Too much fun.”</p> <h2>Forest Whitaker, actor/director, <em>Waiting To Exhale</em></h2> <p>“I can’t wait to get the PlayStation 2 for my kids. They’re going to love it.”</p>

 <h2>Ashley Angel, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“It’s midnight in Milwaukee and it’s 20 degrees outside and instead of being in a warm hotel room, Jacob, Erik and I are out playing PS2 in the tour bus.”</p> <h2>Howie Dorough, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“We are all fans, but Nikki [Nick Carter] is the biggest. That is why I can’t beat him at <em>Who </em><em>Wants to Be a Millionaire</em> – I am trying to get that thing down.”</p> <h2>Dave Matthews, singer, Dave Mathews Band</h2> <p>“The band is so into PlayStation 2. I can’t imagine being on the road without it. Our lounge on the bus is dedicated to PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Danny Masterson, actor, <em>That 70’s Show</em></h2> <p>“The games are really cool – they’ve got good soundtracks on them and look very, very real…I’m at work and in between scenes we play video games. We should probably read more books, but PlayStation 2 is so darn good.”</p> <h2>Bill Bellamy, MTV VJ/actor,<em> The Brothers</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is fascinating to see. The graphics are so incredible, so lifelike — it’s fast, it’s fun, it’s challenging, it brings people together. You feel like you’re really in the game. That’s the part that’s cool and that’s what people get excited about.”</p>

 <h2>Patricia Arquette, actress, <em>Little Nicky</em></h2> <p>“We can’t get enough of PlayStation 2 at our house.”</p> <h2>Lee Ann Rimes, singer</h2> <p>“It’s a total stress-buster at the end of a long day – it’s a lot of fun!”</p> <h2>Marlon Wayans, actor/writer, <em>Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“It’s the truth. I played John Madden. . .one sack hit me so big, it broke my rib. You really feel like you’re playing the game. It’s the true experience. . .PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, actress,<em> X-Men</em></h2> <p>“When I saw my friend [playing PlayStation 2] I became determined to become as much of an expert as she is.”</p>

 <h2>Tom Arnold, actor, <em>Best Damn Sports Show Period, True Lies</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is so intense that when they play they don’t want to talk to anyone around them.”</p> <h2>Jermaine Dupri, So So Def Founder/Producer/ Recording Artist</h2> <p>“I am a die hard PlayStation 2 fan, I don’t like nothing else. But PlayStation is my favorite. . .You can play music, games, DVDs – there isn’t anything better.”</p> <h2>Billy Campbell, actor, <em>Once and Again</em></h2> <p>“It’s going to be a long time before anybody beats it…”</p> <h2>Brendan Fehr, actor, <em>Roswell</em></h2> <p>“In terms of graphics, it’s far superior to [the original] PlayStation. In between scenes, you see the players come out of dressing rooms, and there are little clips like you’re watching TV. It’s a lot of fun. . . PlayStation 2 is great because it plays both DVDs and games. . . and the graphics are so cool.”</p>

 <h2>Carmen Electra, actress/model,<em> Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“I grew up playing video games. PlayStation 2 takes it to the next level.”</p> <h2>Jeff Probst, host of TV’s <em>Survivor</em></h2> <p>“When we did the first <em>Survivor</em>, I didn’t realize I’d have some downtime between challenges and Tribal Councils, but for <em>Survivor 2</em>, I was ready. I brought a PlayStation 2 as my luxury item. So, we’d finish Tribal Council, head back to base camp, toss in a game and start jammin’. It was a great way to get your mind out of your work and not a bad way to relieve some tension as well.”</p> <h2>Joey Fatone, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I use PlayStation 2 because it is fun and has good graphics. It gives us something else to do on<br> the bus and helps pass the time while traveling from city to city. Got a PS2 in my car too like Chris [Kirkpatrick], and I play at least four to five hours a day. PS2 is the BOMB!”</p> <h2>Joshua Jackson, actor, <em>Dawson ’s Creek</em></h2> <p>“I can’t go to a [movie] set without my PlayStation 2 ”</p> <h2>Sean Stockton, singer, Boyz II Men</h2> <p>“I am a huge fan of [PlayStation 2’s] <em>Grand Theft Auto.</em> . . for adults like me it is the bomb.”</p> <h2>Donald Faison, actor, <em>Scrubs</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is everywhere – they’re always at the most happening spots. It is the coolest brand.”</p>

 <h2>Drew Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I’m keeping [my PlayStation 2] in my bunk on the tour bus because I’m afraid I’ll play it too much at home and cause fights with my wife.”</p> <h2>Eddie Cibrian, actor, <em>Third Watch</em></h2> <p>“You are talking to a true PlayStation 2 fan. I can’t wait for <em>Tony Hawk 3</em> to come out…I play <em>Madden</em> all day long.”</p> <h2>Bryan McFayden, MTV VJ</h2> <p>“At MTV, a PlayStation 2 is never more than 30 feet away from where we’re taping.”</p> <h2>Erik-Michael Estrada, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“<em>NCAA Gamebreaker 2001</em> for PS2 is the most incredible college football game ever. Since we’ve gotten the PS2 on the road we have not been getting any sleep on the bus.”</p> <h2>Jason Cerbone, actor, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I have a PlayStation 2 at home and play all the time. I am a big fan.”</p> <h2>Jeff Timmons, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“We’re going to test out all of the games for Sony and post our recommendations on our website.”</p> <h2>Justin Jaffe, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is going to take over our football lounge on the bus.”</p> <h2>Kevin Richardson, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2’s <em>Madden 2002</em>, I am addicted to that game. I am addicted to football and loved to play in high school, but was not good enough to play college or professional ball. With <em>Madden</em>, I get to live out my fantasies on PlayStation 2.”</p>

 <h2>Lance Bass, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2 because it helps me to get rid of stress on and off the road.”</p> <h2>Michael Rosenbaum, actor, <em>Smallville</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is more fun than my blow-up doll.”</p> <h2>Nick Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I know we’re going to bum through the first PlayStation 2 unit on the first leg of the tour.”</p> <h2>Robert Horry, athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I went to the launch party last season and it was the best party I went to and I had to come back and check out the anniversary party. I don’t play the basketball games because I get frustrated. The games won’t let me do moves that I know I can do in real life.”</p> <h2>John Salley, former athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“My daughter and I compete [on PlayStation 2]. Whenever we get in a fight, we say ‘See you on PlayStation.’ It’s better than a spanking. Just spank them on PlayStation.”</p> <h2>Simon Rex, actor, <em>Jack and Jill </em>(2002 TV show)</h2> <p>“Incredible fast graphics that would make Mario run for the hills. If my friends thought I spent a lot of time on PlayStation, just wait until [PlayStation 2] comes out!”</p>

 <h2>Stefan Lessard, bassist, Dave Matthews Band</h2> <p>“People know when they can’t find me, I’m in my bunk playing PlayStation 2. It’s my saving grace on the road – but I love playing it at home too!”</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel, host, <em>The Man Show</em></h2> <p>“My son is eight years old and is hooked up like an IV to the PlayStation 2 — it keeps him busy.”</p> <h2>Adrien Brody, actor, <em>Dummy</em></h2> <p>“I don’t even have a TV, but I’m going to get one and go crazy with PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Vincent Pastore, actor, A<em>fter the Storm</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I am into it.”</p> <h2>Tia Carrere, actress, <em>Wayne’s World</em></h2> <p>“Actually, I have to admit to jumping to the head of the line in Canada to get a couple of PlayStation 2s for Christmas — I was part of the craze. Now I want one for me.”</p> <h2>Nick Stahl, actor, <em>The </em><em>Thin Red Line</em></h2> <p>“The PS2’s graphics are amazing. I can’t wait to own one of these. . .I’ll play it all the time.”</p> <h2>Norman Reedus, actor/model,<em> Gossip</em></h2> <p>“I love playing the PlayStation 2. It’s like meditation.”</p> <h2>Vincent Young, actor</h2> <p>“The sports games are addictive. I can’t put <em>Madden Football</em> down once I start playing. The graphics are so realistic – you can even see the hair on the players’ arms move.”</p> <h2>Catherine Bell, actress,<em> Jag</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is amazing and it looks really cool. Plus, the graphics are incredible. I love the fighting games, especially <em>Tekken Tag</em>, because I find all these crazy combinations, and when I play against my husband I always win.”</p> <h2>Ashley Poole, singer, Dream</h2> <p>“Me and my dad play PlayStation 2 when I go home — I love it. I love it. Holly and I are the PlayStation 2 babies of Dream. On our bus we have all the games and love to play.”</p> <h2>Daphne Zuniga, actress, <em>Melrose Place</em></h2> <p>“My whole life, I’ve never liked video games, but after playing PlayStation 2, I have to get one…”</p> <h2>Debra Cox, singer</h2> <p>“I am a huge, huge, huge PlayStation fan. They are in every recording studio — how could you not be a fan?”</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades.1312933/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Yakuza fan, I’ve recommended the series from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, otherwise known as RGG, to plenty of people, but it has long come with one big caveat: Yakuza 3. It’s not that there is anything necessarily wrong with it, but with high-quality remakes of the first games in the series, and the more modern and refined graphics and gameplay of the newer entries, it has stood out a bit as a bit of an odd duck, looking and playing worse than the games before and after. However, with the just-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-studio-direct-2025-confirms-yakuza-kiwami-3-remake-spinoff-dark-ties-and-more-heres-everything-announced"><u>Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</u></a>, a twin pack combining a remade Yakuza 3 alongside a brand-new companion game, that might all be about to change. I had a chance to play both at Tokyo Game Show 2025, and I came away impressed by how much RGG Studio is trying to improve and expand on the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 isn’t just an up-rezzed port; it’s a full remake. Everything is rebuilt, from the graphics to the combat to the new cut scenes and voice acting – including some modern motion capture to better bring the characters to life. While it will still follow the story of Yakuza 3, some scenes will play out differently or expand. It’s an ambitious agenda, but probably the right one to bring the now 16-year-old game to modern audiences. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My hands-on begins with Kazuma Kiryu chopping wood outside the Morning Glory Orphanage, where he was raised and now runs, in Okinawa. The modern graphics look great as he swings his axe, his sweat glistening in crisp 4K (for those that are into that sort of thing). After the events of Yakuza 2, he’s moved on from being a Yakuza and is trying to live a peaceful life running the orphanage. An eviction notice arrives, and Kiryu heads into town to confront the head of the Ryudo family, the owners of the land on which the orphanage is built. He runs into Rikiya Shimabukuro, a member of the Ryudo clan and, naturally, a brawl ensues, giving us our first taste of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-official-combat-gameplay-trailer"><u>updated battle system</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s head never gets old.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiriyu has two fighting styles to employ. The first is Dragon of Dojima, his classic brawling style, mixing punches, kicks, throws, and environmental weapons like street signs, traffic cones, and even the odd bicycle when the opportunity presents itself. It’s as flashy as ever, and charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s (in this case, Rikiya’s) head never gets old. The real magic comes when I switch to his brand new Ryukyu style, however. This style is rooted in Okinawan culture, and while using it, Kiryu combos through eight different weapons, like a pair of tonfa, a weighted chain, or, my personal favorite, a boat oar. I put away my opponent with a mix of all of the above, which was enough to convince Rikiya to direct me towards where to find his boss. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This opened up an opportunity for a bit of open-world exploration, which I took full advantage of, exploring a nearby street market, beating up some ruffians with a crowbar, and taking in a quick round of a golf mini-game. Okinawa looks great on the modern engine, and getting around was a breeze thanks to the new Street Surfer Mk. 0, a Segway-like rideable that Kiryu seems to be able to summon out of thin air for some quick joyriding. Zooming around on that, hopping off to beat the snot out of some goons with my tiny shield (also part of the Ryukyu set), then making a speedy getaway was so Yakuza in the best way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I turned my attention back to the main story. As Rikiya escorts me to his headquarters, we are interrupted by a commotion as a rival family trashes a local market, taking the shop owner hostage. Kiriyu, sweet guy that he is, agrees to help, leading to a massive nine-vs-two melee, as he and Rikiya take on the boss and his lackeys. This really showcased how much more refined the combat is, as I was able to take advantage of the smooth movement and dodging, creating windows to bash the bad guys and escape, with a slick double-team KO of one poor crony eating a massive kick to the face from Kiryi while restrained by Rikiya. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My time in Yakuza Kiwami 3 ended there, but I barely scratched the surface of everything new coming to it. There will be more personal moments with supporting characters, time dedicated to running the daily operations at the orphanage and taking care of the kids, even a new team battle mode where you build your own biker gang to fight for turf with others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dark Ties</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bigger surprise of the Yakuza Kiwami 3 announcement was the reveal of Dark Ties, an all-new companion story to the main game.  This places you in the role of Yoshitaka Mine, the antagonist of Yakuza 3. Dark Ties covers Mine’s rise from a disgraced businessman, driven from his own tech startup, to the underworld boss that acts as Kazuma’s foil in Yakuza 3. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-a0751c8f4adedccafc6ce8de3d09f3147e1c1ff7-1920x1080-1759256313741.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">His story begins with Mine reflecting on his life and the loneliness that drove him to pursue wealth and influence. By happenstance, he witnesses a deadly fight between rival Yakuza families, and seeing the bond of men willing to die for their boss, Daigo Dojima, acts as a catalyst, and he sets out to see if he can find that same loyalty in the criminal underworld. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo takes place early in the game, with Mine tracking down Tsuyoshi Kanda, an infamous Yakuza just released from prison. Mine hopes Kanda will be his entry point to begin his own rise, though as is Yakuza tradition, you don’t go more than a few early steps before some punks decide to pick a fight. Apparently, Mine's suitcase looks expensive, and they want whatever is inside. A bad decision. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-ba732b95bcacaf8be1e93757deb185452b404294-1920x1080-1759256328386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists. Mine’s fighting style is very different from Kiryu’s, relying heavily on quick boxing combos, technical wrestling moves, and new aerial attacks. He can jump and plant a foot on the chest of one enemy, then leap to another, dishing out damage all around as he delivers an array of flying moves, like springboard jump kicks or mid-air tackles. They look very cool, and make for a fun bit of planning ahead as you scope out which enemies to latch onto and jump towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the standard Heat Gauge that fills up to enable special moves, Mine has three chained hearts that fill up as he lands attacks. Once at least one is full, he can activate a powerful buffed mode called Dark Awakening. This functions like a new fighting style, with a different moveset unleashing extremely powerful attacks.  More than one chained heart can be activated at once, increasing the potency of Dark Awakening. It’s a neat twist to make Mine’s gameplay more distinct, and tapping into the rage behind his calm exterior fits his character well. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-9cba6bf65a0beef3fe9d84599989fa573efcdfb4-1920x1080-1759256341008.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became clear these punks picked the wrong suitcase to try to snatch, as I knocked them senseless to the cheers of onlookers who witnessed the attempted robbery. With the ruffians handled, I’m given the option to head to the prison to track down Kanda or kill some time exploring the city. This sorry mission seems important, so naturally I… immediately go find a karaoke bar to sing a song. Hey, it is Yakuza after all. I rent the room, and Mine pours his heart and soul into his solo performance, which is really funny given his normally extremely stoic nature. I nail rhythm on my button presses, delivering a perfect performance befitting a man of Mine’s talents. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buoyed by my outstanding singing, I decide it’s time to get down to business and try to hail a cab to the prison where Kanda is being released. One more group of punks tries to stop me (nothing a fireman’s carry followed by a quick kick to the face couldn’t solve), and I find myself outside of the prison as Kanda takes out his frustration on his paltry, two-man welcoming committee. Kanda is penniless, his branch of the Yakuza family disgraced. As Mine tails him through the streets of Kamurocho, my hands-on time ends just as he rounds a corner to meet his future right-hand man for the first time. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-f6d5496302d2de4c46d55e782221f7e6f0f03ffb-1920x1080-1759256356109.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a sucker for a good organized crime story, I’m definitely intrigued to see how much we get to witness Mine channel his inner Vito Corleone and build his criminal empire from the ground up, especially if it means some proper bromance time with Mine and Diago. The fact that it comes as part of the package with Yakuza Kiwami 3 is great, and I’m excited to see how it all turns out when Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties release on February 12, 2026. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades]]></content:encoded>

                <p>No one likes waiting, especially when there's nothing to do to pass the time. Peak developer Landfall Games had that same thought when working on Peak's most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DillyDally update</a>. It adds a handful of activities to lobbies while waiting for other players to join, including a basketball hoop, photo booth, and chess pieces.</p><p>Players went straight to work with the chess pieces, but not according to official rules the classic game uses.</p><p>"My friend and I got bored after we finished a climb," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Imanthony89/" rel="nofollow ">Imanthony89</a> in a post on the Peak subreddit. "Used all the chess pieces and bing bong. That's a queen and a few pawns above the rafters"</p><p>The update released last week, and social media was flooded with chess pieces stacked ceiling-high in the airport lobby over the weekend. Peak's physics system, which can lead to some quirky antics on climbs, turned out to be perfect for some extracurricular activities for the scouts.</p><p>Peak lobbies are set in airport waiting areas, as the game begins with a playful loading-screen plane crash that sets you and your friends off on your journey to summit a procedurally generated mountain. The climb is almost never easy, so it makes sense that scouts should have some fun while waiting in the terminal.</p><p>Landfall Games and publisher Aggro Crab have released a few updates since Peak became a massive hit when it launched in June. A new biome, the Mesa--complete with tornadoes, scorching heat, and scorpions--was added in August. Another biome has also been teased, but no confirmed details have been shared yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my article about the $55 billion EA buyout deal</a>, I singled out BioWare as the likely target of potential layoffs following the closure. Indeed, later today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming posted an article</a> citing inside sources from the Canadian studio, revealing that the employees are already worried about this sudden transition.</p>



<p>Two of the anonymous sources allegedly said:</p>



<p><em>Look at the negativity that came after Dragon Age. If we felt it was only going to get worse then, you can imagine what some of us think now.</em></p>



<p><em>I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs. Kind of feels like a matter of time.</em></p>



<p>The reference is to last year's launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the studio's first new game since the massive failure of Anthem. Unfortunately, despite a fairly positive critical reception, the game did not sell nearly as well as publisher Electronic Arts had hoped (the goal was to hit 3 million players, but in January 2025, EA said Veilguard had only 'engaged' 1.5 million players), <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to layoffs that brought the studio headcount to less than a hundred</a>. </p>



<p>BioWare is now focused on making the next Mass Effect game, but will they even get the chance? For now, the sentiment inside the studio is simply to go ahead until they are told otherwise:</p>



<p><em>We're going to keep working until they tell us we are done. It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.</em></p>



<p>Insider Gaming even reports having heard that there were attempts to sell off BioWare at some point, though they must have gone nowhere for the time being, as there was no such official news alongside the buyout deal.</p>



<p>Perhaps that would be the best chance for the studio that made some of the greatest Western roleplaying games of all time, such as Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. As things stand, on one hand, Electronic Arts going private could mean slightly less pressure to deliver right away; on the other, the publisher has a lot of debt and its new owners (PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners) may want immediate cost-cutting measures to deal with it. </p>

            <p>
What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> was a bit less sci-fi, and a lot more medieval? You would, in theory, get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pax-dei">Pax Dei</a>, a game that first entered early access in June last year. Responses to it so far appear to be, well, mixed, but as seems to be quite common with These Kinds Of Games, everyone that's played it appears to be going through some kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of situation, as the game is still going. It's going so far as to launch into 1.0 in fact, and developer Mainframe Industries have even put a date to it.
</p>
<p>
That release date is October 16th, about half a month away at the time of writing (assuming I still know how to read calendars). Mainframe outlined what you can expect in the leadup to the launch, as well as what will happen at launch itself in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/510718530665054707?l=english">Steam news post</a> too.
</p>
<p>
From October 6th until the 14th, servers for the game will be completely offline. On the 14th, at 3am PDT, anyone that owns a founder's pack will have access to the game's 1.0 servers, and then on the 16th at 8am PDT, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> will be available to everyone. Something to note is that with the launch of 1.0, everyone that has been playing so far will have everything wiped - shards, characters, plots, inventories, skills, and more. This is the final wipe though, Mainframe explained, so you won't have to worry if you're new to the game.
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that Pax Dei will also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/524223243273373577">subscription model</a>. You can just play the game by buying it, but memberships give you a whole bunch of extras that do seem a little bit unfair. In particular, depending on which membership plan you go for, you'll get a number of plot tokens, which let you literally own certain pieces of land - that you have to continuously pay for with said tokens. Yes, this is essentially digital rent. Whether this works out or not, well, we'll find out in the next few months.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/suda-51-would-like-to-make-peacemaker-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suda51-would-like-to-make-a-peacemaker-game.1312870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi Suda (also known as Suda51) is undoubtedly one of the most eclectic Japanese game designers, not to mention one of those whose opinions are always interesting to read. Recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxQxndH7QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he made a statement to the Future Game Show channel</a> about wanting to make a game based on the character Peacemaker. When asked which DC Comics character he'd choose if given the chance, he replied (via a translator):</p>



<p><em>Peacemaker. I'd like to see some new ways of murdering people that aren't in the show and in the comics. That's one of the things we're good at Grasshopper Manufacture: finding ways to kill s*it and making it grotty and bloody and stuff. So, yeah, I'd like to see Peacemaker find some new, interesting ways of murdering people.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Suda51 already collaborated with James Gunn, the current co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, on the 2012 action/adventure game Lollipop Chainsaw. Gunn specifically aided with designing that game's story and characters.</p>



<p>Nowadays, James Gunn is the grand architect (alongside Peter Safran) of the new DC Universe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which includes games, movies, and TV</a>. Truth be told, there hasn't been anything in the gaming space related to the new DCU, but Gunn <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-gunn-excited-about-one-dc-games-in-particular-still-early-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided an update last month</a> when he said that he was excited about 'one specific thing' when it comes to DC games. He also clarified that it's still in the early stages, however.</p>



<p>Incidentally, we just published an exclusive interview with Suda51 about Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action/adventure game ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN. <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read it here in its entirety</a>.</p>



<p>As for Peacemaker, the character also made our headlines because Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the character-specific dance emote from their popular game Fortnite</a> after the latest plot twist seen in Episode 6 of the show's second season, currently airing on HBO Max.</p>

              <p>Will<em> Threads of Time</em> be <a href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165">the next<em> Sea of</em> <em>Stars</em>,</a> or instead another tedious JRPG homage that emulates the classics without being able to capture what really made them tick? That was my question when it debuted during <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tgs-2024-tokyo-game-show-final-fantasy-game-pass-1851658415">last year’s Xbox Tokyo Game Show livestream</a>. But every time this indie game has resurfaced since, it’s looked better and better. It returned to TGS 2025 with yet another trailer perfectly calibrated to play on fans’ hopes and dreams for another great 16-bit homage to all-time greats like<em> Chrono Trigger</em>.</p> <p>The turn-based RPG with beautiful pixel art and an amazing 2.5D depth of field is being made by Canada-based Riyo Games and published by Humble Games. There’s a team of over 30 people working on it. We still don’t have a release date but it’s looking in better shape than some flashy projects that dazzle with trailers but fail to actually ship. I hope the team isn’t biting off more than it can chew, especially amid a tough funding environment for smaller indie developers and publishers, because everything in this trailer is exactly what I want from a <em>Chrono Trigger</em> spiritual successor:</p>

  <p>The time-travelling adventure spans millions of years, from a prehistoric past to a cyberpunk future. Turn-based combat takes place in a dynamic view with bespoke attack animations. There’s an overworld map, town hubs, and NPCs to chat up. You’ll recruit characters from different eras and unlock team combos for battle. Why are you doing all this, exactly? It sounds like you’re working for the Order of Time Knights to try and protect the integrity of the timeline or something. Also: cool boss fights.</p> <p><em>Threads of Time</em> is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 with hand-crafted 2D pixel art. I can’t stress enough how great the environments and characters look. If that can hold up over an entire 10-20 hour adventure it will be an impressive achievement, especially for the indie studio’s first project. 2023’s <em>Sea of Stars</em> was the last game to pull this trick off, selling like hotcakes and winning nods at The Game Awards that year (DLC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sabotagestudio.com/post/3lpmbdqu7w22w">released earlier this year</a>). Before that, there was 2021’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/eastward-the-kotaku-review-1847753920">incredible-looking <em>Eastward</em></a>. I hope <em>Threads of Time</em> can deliver something equally special in the next year or two. It’s currently only confirmed for PC and Xbox.</p>

        <p>Late summer, 2000…</p><p>During a ritual held at a remote temple, Yuni loses consciousness, and awakens inside the cold, dark confines of a refrigerator. Outside, the world is unrecognizable—and no trace of Yuni’s mother is to be found.</p><p>Otherworldly horrors lurk the lantern-lined tunnels and temple-like structures.

                <p>As part of the Call of Duty: Next event today, Activision made a series of major announcements about the FPS franchise, including what's next for Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>To begin with, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s integration into Warzone will begin in Season 1, and this will include a brand-new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow. This is a smaller map than Fortune's Keep but larger than Rebirth Island.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982" data-ratio="0.55223880597015" data-width="2144" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982"></a><figcaption>Haven's Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The map takes place in Liberty Falls, which is the town from Black Ops 6 Zombies prior to the zombie outbreak. Given that timeline, the map doesn't include a zombies aesthetic and instead has a more vibrant color tone, along with many points of interest to explore. The map was designed and developed by High Moon Studios.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLfZ0GiNs8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QSLfZ0GiNs8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big Warzone news from Call of Duty: Next is that Warzone's very first map, Verdansk, is remaining the main map for Warzone going forward. It's not exactly the same map as you remember it, though, as two new POIs have been added: Factory and Signal Station.</p><p>Verdansk was the OG map for Warzone when the game launched in 2020. It remained playable until 2021 when it was removed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-discusses-verdansks-return-and-feedback-so-far/1100-6530838/" data-ref-id="1100-6530838">only to come back earlier this year.</a> Its return prompted a resurgence in Warzone players, so it's no surprise to see Activision stick with it.</p><p>There are gameplay updates in Warzone coming as well, including a limit of five attachments and no Wildcards. Additionally, tactical sprint has been removed and is now only available via the Sprinter perk. The combat roll ability from Black Ops 7 is also coming to Warzone through the Mountaineer perk. Finally, there is greater ground loot coming to Warzone. All of this was confirmed by Charlie Intel.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Warzone gameplay updates:</p><p>- Weapons: 5 attachments only, no Wildcards, Overkill by default <br>- Tactical Sprint removed, now in Sprinter Perk<br>- Combat Roll from BO7 added via Mountaineer Perk <br>- Greater ground loot, including curated weapon builds <a href="https://t.co/C1WWQKT8Z7" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/C1WWQKT8Z7</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973086382529691700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dont-starve-board-game-coming-from-glass-cannon-unplugged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em></a> has gone live. Glass Cannon Unplugged's tabletop adaptation of Klei Interactive's acclaimed survival game has been a blockbuster success, reaching its initial funding goal in five minutes and continuing to climb.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for Don't Starve: The Board Game describes the game as a cooperative roguelike experience. Much like its video game source material, 1-4 players are dropped into a land of magic, mad science, and overwhelmingly filled with cruel elements and monsters. Players will need to work together and do all they can to survive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-starve-the-board-game-box-contents.jpg?itok=CRyLRWyr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-starve-the-board-game-box-contents.jpg?itok=BXmVFos2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is broken up into three different parts. Exploring the wilderness for food, resources, biomes, and secrets. Crafting those resources into weapons, tools, structures, and devices to help you withstand the weather, the dark, and the locals. Finally, the survival element, where you have to manage your hunger, sanity, and health as you traverse the dark world.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has several early bird incentives. If you back the game within its first 72 hours, you'll get the Wolfgang expansion, which introduces the playable Wolfgang character, at no additional cost. The expansion will include an unpainted Wolfgang miniature, a holographic character card, and two ability cards.</p>

<p>In addition, each playable character in the board game has a Fortune digital skin, which can be unlocked in the video game spin-off, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-starve-together-sharing-unlocks-across-platforms-in-future-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve Together</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>For those interested in board game add-ons, the campaign includes playmats, dice towers, cardboard terrain packs, and acrylic monster standee packs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;pledge tiers for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Standard Pledge for $79:</strong> The regular edition of the game with acrylic monster standees, any and all unlocked stretch goals, and Don't Starve Together digital character skins</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $129:</strong> Everything in the standard pledge but with unpainted miniatures for monsters and characters</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$746,128, completely decimating its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign ends October 23.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-shows-off-everything-coming-to-multiplayer-at-launch.1312795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ahead of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s November 14 release date and the early access beta running from October 2 to 5<em>, Call of Duty </em>Next showed off some live footage from the latest entry in the long-running of the military shooter series. The game looks like a solid, speedy, competitive shooter that’s utilizing its futuristic setting for some war-themed sci-fi fantasy. So let’s jump into what stood out during CODNext.</p>  <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> multiplayer looks tactile and fast</h2> <p>I don’t blame those who think all of these games look the same, but if you like a fast shooter with some interesting opportunities for gravity-defying tactics, you might want to check out footage from today’s event–especially if you’re a fan of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2</em>, to which <em>7</em> is intended as a spiritual successor.</p>

 <p>Set in the near future,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> has some fancy tech that builds off the advanced movement techniques in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Wall-jumping, sliding, tactical stance, it all combines very seamlessly in both the scripted sizzle reels and the actual gameplay shown off today.</p>

 <p>The wall-bouncing, which looks like it’ll owe&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>a royalty check, is particularly exciting as various streamers showed off how these techniques can be used for some vertically lethal plays and opportunities to get new, unexpected sight lines.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> will ship with 18 maps, mostly focusing on 6v6</h2> <p>In what’s shaping up to be a healthy roster of maps,&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>will feature 16 6v6 maps, with 13 of those being brand new designs joined by three remakes of&nbsp;<em>BLOPS6 </em>maps. The remaining two maps are for 20v20 battles.</p> <p>During the beta, folks can jam on six of these maps, all of which are of the smaller, 6v6 variety. Map design in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>is particularly focused on standard, three-lane construction. That tried-and-true design, however, might be just what allows the game’s advanced movement techniques to really let players mix things up.</p>

 <h2>Overclocking equipment</h2> <p><em>BLOPS7</em> will contain many of the usual loadout options we’ve long come to expect from&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>, but you’ll be able to further customize your class by “overclocking” lethal, tactical, field upgrades, and score streaks. Once unlocked, these let you equip two modifications in addition to the ordinary functions of the equipment. One such example shown off today was the Stim Shot, which lets you either cancel out enemy-induced debuffs&nbsp;or gain a speed boost when using it.</p>

 <h2>Weapon build sharing</h2> <p>In what stood out to me as one of the coolest features in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>, folks will be able to quickly share weapon builds with each other by way of a simple code the game generates when you finish a specific setup. This should make it pretty easy to just grab an effective meta build and jump into a match.</p>

 <h2>Season one aims to be the ‘biggest’ in <em>BLOPS</em> history</h2> <p>Though&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em> has a pretty sizeable stock of maps to choose from at launch, Treyarch announced today that seven additional multiplayer maps will join the game over the course of its first season, with six of them for the 6v6 mode. Ranked play will arrive in season two.</p> <h2>Nuketown returns</h2> <p>Looking like it came straight out of Bethesda’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> games, the end of the multiplayer reveal showed off a couple of shots of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> map Nuketown. Check it out:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000630311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630311">© Screenshot: Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nuketown is expected to arrive “soon” after&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>‘s launch.</p> <hr> <p>All in all, the big takeaway from CODNext is that if fast-paced, competitive shooters are your thing, <em>BLOPS7</em> is looking pretty solid.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Reveals Everything Coming Before The End Of The Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-reveals-everything-coming-before-the-end-of-the-year.1312792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA has released a content roadmap for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> that outlines all the new goodies and free DLC players can expect during the online shooter’s first season.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s next installment in the popular military sim series, is nearly here. The FPS arrives on October 10 on console and PC. But in 2025, games like <em>Battlefield</em> can’t just launch and be done. No, they need roadmaps! Promises of more content coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And that’s just what’s been revealed,</a> with <em>BF6</em>‘s season one roadmap confirming two new maps are arriving in <em>BF6</em> before the end of the year, as well as new modes, guns, and more.</p> <p>As seen in the new roadmap shared on September 29, season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> doesn’t start at launch. Instead, it begins on October 28, a few weeks later. The first season is being split into “phases” that will bring in new content every month for the rest of 2025.</p> <figure><figcaption>© EA</figcaption></figure> <h2>Phase One of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>The first Phase is Rogue Ops, and it adds a brand new map: Blackwell Fields. This is a big map set in the California badlands, and it will support all modes as well as land and air vehicles. The first phase also adds Strikepoint, a new 4v4 mode all about “intense, small team tactical” combat. Squads fight over an objective across multiple rounds, but only have one life each round. Sounds tense. Not sure it’s something I’ll play, but different strokes, etc.</p>

 <p>Also being added in the first phase are an APC vehicle, a compact carbine rifle, a new sidearm, and some extra attachments for weapons.</p> <h2>Phase Two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Phase two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season kicks off on November 18 and adds a new map, Eastwood, which seems to be a bit smaller than Blackwell Fields. This new battlefield is also set in the United States and is located in a “sleepy, affluent suburb” next to a golf course. All modes supported, but it seems no jets will be available on this one, just helis. A new mode called Sabotage is being added in this phase, too. The new mode is another smaller one focused on 8v8 combat as teams try to destroy as many objectives as possible before time runs out. One team defends, the other attacks. Once again, not sure if this is what I want from <em>Battlefield</em>, but cool for folks who like it.</p>

 <p>Also being added in phase two: Battle Pickups. This is a returning feature from some past<em> Battlefield</em> games. Players will be able to find powerful and advanced weapons that can be picked up and used until they run out of ammo or you die and drop them. I’m excited to see how this might change up some maps.&nbsp; A new double-barreled pump shotgun, revolver, and attachment is also being added during this phase.</p>

 <h2>Phase three of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Finally, on December 9, phase three of the season arrives. EA says this is the last phase of the season. This phase doesn’t add a new map, but instead changes up an existing map. <em>BF6</em>‘s Empire State map, set in NYC, will temporarily be covered in snow during this phase of the season. According to the roadmap, this won’t simply be a fun cosmetic change, but will actually affect gameplay. There will be a new “Freeze” mechanic introduced on the snow-covered map that EA describes as a “gameplay modifier.” No other details yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the third and final phase will add an ice-climbing axe as a new melee weapon option, and a new limited-time “Ice Lock” even that will happen exclusively on the snowy Empire State map.</p> <hr> <p>Phew! That’s a lot of content and all of it is, assuming nothing gets delayed, arriving in the game’s first few months. I’ll be curious to see how much content future seasons include. Can we expect two maps and multiple guns in every season? That seems like a lot. But if the devs can pull it off, <em>Battlefield 6</em> might end up being one of the best entries in the series. And that might help distract people from the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s prince and Jared Kushner’s investment firm</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

                <p>EA is preparing to go private, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">as the veteran video game company will be sold</a> for an eye-watering sum of $55 billion to an investor consortium made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. While this deal will require regulator approval and a sign-off by stockholders, EA is expecting the deal to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p><p>A privately owned EA could be a very different company when compared to its public incarnation, and it will also have to work off $20 billion of new debt that is being used to finance the buyout. So what does $55 billion buy you these days? Quite a <em>lot</em>, as EA's potential new owners will be acquiring studios, brands, and much more. Here's a broad overview of all things EA</p><h2>EA's various entertainment studios</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817"></a><figcaption>EA has established a rich library of games over the years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg"></figure><p>EA has built up a sizable collection of studios under its portfolio, and several of these have become responsible for EA's biggest hits. Criterion Games has developed several Need for Speed titles, DICE is best known for its work on the Battlefield series, and Maxis made a name for itself with The Sims.</p><p>Then there's Motive Studio--a developer that has alternated between being a support studio and working on big projects like Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake--PopCap Games has developed several popular mobile titles, and Respawn Entertainment has been responsible for several of EA's best single-player games in the modern era.</p><p>BioWare has a storied history, but after mass layoffs at the Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio, it's not certain what state the famed studio is in. Work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-team-should-scapegoat-dragon-age-to-get-more-resources-former-bioware-dev-says/1100-6533885/" data-ref-id="1100-6533885">new Mass Effect game</a> has been going on for several years now, but the high-profile flop of Anthem and underwhelming sales for Dragon Age: The Veilguard have left people wondering what its future looks like under a privately owned EA.</p><p>The studios listed above are just the tip of the EA iceberg, as the company also has Skate developer Full Circle, EA Gothenburg, Codemasters, and even more subsidiaries.</p><h2>EA Entertainment</h2><ul><li>BioWare (Includes BioWare Austin)</li><li>Criterion Games (Includes Criterion Cheshire)</li><li>DICE (Includes Frostbite Labs)</li><li>EA Baton Rouge</li><li>EA Galway in Galway, Ireland.</li><li>EA Gothenburg</li><li>EA Korea Studio</li><li>EA Capital Games</li><li>EA Redwood Studios</li><li>Firemonkeys Studios</li><li>Glu Mobile</li><li>Playdemic</li><li>Slingshot Games</li><li>Tracktwenty Studios</li><li>Full Circle</li><li>Maxis (Includes Maxis Texas and Maxis Europe)</li><li>Motive Studio (Includes Motive Studio Vancouver)</li><li>Pogo Studios</li><li>PopCap Games (Includes PopCap Shanghai and PopCap Hyderabad)</li><li>Respawn Entertainment (Includes Respawn Vancouver and Respawn Wisconsin)</li><li>Ripple Effect Studios</li></ul><h2>EA Sports</h2><p>The other jewel in the EA crown is its EA Sports division. Anchored by titles with annual soccer, Madden NFL, PGA Tour, and NHL games, recent years have also seen these respective titles become even more lucrative with live-service and online elements added to them.</p><h2>EA Sports studios</h2><ul><li>Codemasters (Includes Codemasters Birmingham and Codemasters Kuala Lumpur)</li><li>EA Cologne</li><li>EA Madrid</li><li>EA Orlando</li><li>EA Romania</li><li>EA Vancouver</li><li>Metalhead Software</li></ul><h2>Big game franchises</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577696"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4577696-october2025games%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>Throughout its existence, EA has amassed a sizable number of video game IP under its banner. Sure, a lot of these franchises like Army of Two and Titanfall haven't received new entries in years, but ownership of them is still potentially lucrative in an age of transmedia projects. Then there are the licensed IP that EA has worked on, with several Star Wars games under its belt--and more on the way--collaborations with smaller studios that have resulted in critically acclaimed games like Split Fiction being released under the EA Originals label, and various sports games that feature hundreds of official licensing deals to make them as authentic as possible.</p><ul><li>Battlefield</li><li>Need for Speed</li><li>Medal of Honor</li><li>Madden Football</li><li>EA Sports FC</li><li>The Sims</li><li>Mirror's Edge</li><li>Titanfall</li><li>Apex Legends</li><li>Mass Effect</li><li>Dragon Age</li><li>Dead Space</li><li>Plants vs Zombies</li><li>Command and Conquer</li><li>Skate</li><li>Army of Two</li><li>Bejeweled</li><li>Peggle</li></ul><h2>EA All Play</h2><p>EA's mobile-focused label, this part of the company is also involved in digital titles and digital board games.</p><h2>EA Competitive Gaming Division</h2><p>Founded in 2015, the EA CGD focuses on growing esports competitions through games like EA Sports FC and Battlefield.</p><h2>SEED</h2><p>The Search for Extraordinary Experiences Division is EA's incubator for research and development on new technologies, with offices based in Los Angeles and Stockholm.</p><h2>EA Platforms and services</h2><p>In addition to its PC distribution EA App, there's also the subscription service EA Play that's available as a standalone service or as part of a Game Pass Ultimate subscription.</p>

                <p>As part of Call of Duty: Next today, Activision and Treyarch hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>'s post-launch support, which begins with Season 1. It will be the "biggest in franchise history" as it relates to a Season 1 for a new Call of Duty game, the developer said.</p><p>Specifically, there will be <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1973074806607405487" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seven more 6v6 maps</a> added to Black Ops 7 multiplayer in Season 1, along with two new Zombies Survival maps, and one new round-based Zombies map. There could also be new Call of Duty: Warzone content as well.</p><p>Activision historically releases Call of Duty's seasonal content over time and not all at once, often divided between content available at launch and then down the road in a Reloaded update.</p><p>Fans don't have to wait until Season 1 for a new map, though, as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-brings-back-iconic-nuketown-map-and-heres-when/1100-6535119/" data-ref-id="1100-6535119"> latest iteration of Nuketown will arrive prior to Season 1.</a> Black Ops 7 will launch with 18 maps, including 16 6v6 maps and two maps for the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><h2><strong>When does Season 1 start?</strong></h2><p>Activision did not say when Season 1 will begin. For comparison, last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/" data-ref-id="1100-6527587">Black Ops 6 had its own Season 1 begin on November 14, 2024.</a> The game released on October 25, 2024, so Season 1 debuted 20 days after the game launched. If a similar timeframe follows for Black Ops 7, then Season 1 could start around early December, but nothing is confirmed at this stage.</p><p>All of the post-launch maps are free, but it's expected that Black Ops 7 will have its own in-game store filled with things people can buy with real money. We may not see as many outrageous and wacky skins, however, as Activision has said it might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">shifting focus away from those kinds of skins.</a> Black Ops 6's skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">won't carry forward to Black Ops 7, either. </a></p><p>Fans will get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">try Black Ops 7's multiplayer during a beta</a>, which begins on October 2 and continues through October 8.
