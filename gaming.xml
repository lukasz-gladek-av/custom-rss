<p>"The first CoD Switch version is nearly done"</p>

<figure data-uuid="8b372b96a42be"><a title="Call of Duty Warzone" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b372b96a42be/call-of-duty-warzone.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following a rumour last week about Bethesda's <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a> coming to the Switch 2 next year, there's now been a supposed update about the Nintendo version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>According to Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden, the "first" Call of Duty Switch release is "nearly done" and could be launching in just a matter of months. He goes on to mention how it's definitely "on the way" and has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530">apparently been "hitting milestones"</a>, so a 2026 release window looks like a possibility.</p>

<p>Our colleagues at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/12/rumour-xbox-nearly-done-with-first-version-of-call-of-duty-for-nintendo-switch"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a> have shared their thoughts about what this release might even be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're going to guess this probably relates to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_warzone_2_0">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> — the ever-evolving free-to-play experience — rather than a port of Black Ops 7 that may get in the way of a potential Call of Duty mainline release in late 2026."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="SLvDnhHkJZk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytSLvDnhHkJZk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLvDnhHkJZk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3938bdspglhz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2022/12/microsoft-enters-10-year-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms">original 10-year deal</a> was made to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms, there have been multiple reports about how it's still on the way. Most recently, in November, some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/call-of-duty-dev-sledgehammer-games-seeking-talent-with-switch-experience">Call of Duty job applications</a> seeking "Switch experience" were discovered.</p>
<p>Activision also shared an update earlier this month about the Call of Duty series "going forward", mentioning how its development and release strategy was changing. This followed on from a negative fan reception to the latest outing, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, this follows the news last week from the same source, claiming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/rumour-bethesdas-newest-ip-is-still-reportedly-on-course-for-switch-2">Starfield will land on the Switch 2</a> at some point next year.</p>

<p>When the Switch 2 was announced, many Nintendo fans were already calling for themes to be added to the HOME Menu.</p>
<p>While there have been no developments on this front, there is something else that at least <em>some</em> fans are excited about. From the system HOME Menu, if you navigate to the 'Nintendo Switch Online' icon, you'll be presented with a "Happy Holidays" theme featuring Mario and the rest of the crew.</p>
<p>This limited-time theme has even got its own music, and when you flick through the menu, a jingle sound effect plays.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nyulqk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The music appears to be 'Snowball Park' from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/super_mario_3d_world">Super Mario 3D World</a>, and there's also a small easter egg. If you <a href="https://x.com/DeboReynoldsJr/status/2001893719860293660">navigate to the bottom of the menu</a> and keep pushing the analogue stick down, you'll see some Mario-themed characters and a "Happy Holidays" message pop up.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we've seen themes added to <em>other</em> sections of Switch systems before, and it probably won't be the last.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo is also offering special holiday-themed Switch Online icons. You can get these icons for 10 Platinum Points each, and borders and backgrounds will set you back 5 Platinum Points each.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ddc17bf70fdbe"><a title="Cyberpunk 2077" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ddc17bf70fdbe/cyberpunk-2077.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: CD PROJEKT RED</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> for the Switch 2 was spotted going for <strong>75% off</strong> its regular price in the US, reducing it from $69.99 down to just <strong>$17.49</strong>.</p>
<p>Fans were convinced it was an error, and now, sure enough, <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/2003602413702512780">CD Project Red has confirmed</a> the price displayed on the Switch 2 digital store "in the Americas on December 22, 2025" was "incorrect". It seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - Complete Edition</a> for Switch was also accidentally discounted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, CDPR is in a festive mood, and if you did manage to purchase either of these games at the discounted prices, you'll be able to keep them. Here's the official notice about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CD PROJEKT RED:</strong> The discounts for Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Complete Edition displayed on Nintendo Switch 2 eShop in the Americas on December 22, 2025 were incorrect.</p>
<p>The situation is a result of an error we made when submitting the discount. We have corrected the error and new discounts have now been applied.</p>
<p>Purchases made at the previous discount rate are unaffected by this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, there have been "new discounts" applied to the titles in the Americas. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition is currently available for <strong>$39.99</strong> instead of $69.99 (that's <strong>42% off</strong>), and the Witcher 3 Complete Edition on Switch is now priced at <strong>$14.99</strong> instead of $59.99 (<strong>75% off</strong>).</p>
<p>The Ultimate Edition of Cyberpunk 2077 includes not only the base game, but also the DLC expansion <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Phantom Liberty</a></strong>. And the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3 comes loaded with Geralt's original adventure and the two expansions.</p>

                <p>In early 2025, partway through a subathon to mark her second birthday, the AI VTuber Neuro-Sama became the world record holder for the largest Twitch Hype Train. Many claimed her achievements were possible thanks to Riot's competitive shooter, Valorant, gifting one subscription for each five gifted by the community. Now, only a few days into her third birthday subathon, Neuro-Sama and her creator Vedal987 have smashed that world record. She completed Hype Train level 120 with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits gifted to the <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a> Twitch channel within a limited time.</p><p>Neuro-Sama is an AI VTuber who recently completed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-finally-completes-hardcore-minecraft-but-some-arent-happy/1100-6536784/" data-ref-id="1100-6536784">Minecraft Hardcore</a> run with her creator and friends Filian and Crelly. She streams on Vedal's Twitch channel, and is powered by an artificial intelligence system that utilizes a large language model with vast capabilities. She can "see" games and respond to them, even being able to play some, she can read her Twitch chat and interact with viewers, and this week she's been playing around in virtual reality with her friends thanks to her new(ish) 3D model.</p><p>Neuro-Sama debuted on Twitch on 19 December 2022, and each subsequent year on the same date she begins a subathon--a continuous stream that has its length determined by the number of subscriptions the community has gifted. When an abnormal number of subscriptions or Bits are gifted within a limited timeframe, a Hype Train is triggered, which shows an on-screen percentage, level, and how many subscriptions are required to progress to the next level. While Neuro-Sama met level 111 in January 2025, this time around she didn't need Valorant's help to decimate her own world record.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N29b-o4fJBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N29b-o4fJBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When Neuro beat the world record for the first time, she was rewarded with a global emote from Twitch--one which can be used anywhere on the platform, by anyone, whether they're following her channel or not. She's the first streamer to consecutively hold two Twitch Hype Train world records, so it remains to be seen whether a similar protocol will follow this achievement.</p><p>After beating her world record again, Vedal prompted Neuro to comment on the achievement. "I'm speechless," she said. "I'm blown away by the amount of support. Thank you so much everyone." Vedal had some further comments, adding, "This has changed my life completely. I'm very grateful that I have the opportunity to do something cool like this and that you guys are here to support it, but I do not deserve it." Neuro was quick to dispel her creator's self-doubt though, saying, "It doesn't matter whether you think you deserve it. What matters is that you've created something unique, and people are willing to support that." The wholesome exchange stopped short of Vedal telling Neuro he loves her too, though. Shame.</p><p>As it stands, Neuro-Sama's subathon is now set to end in around 345 hours. You can watch the rest of her antics on <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987's Twitch </a>channel.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mario-parody-viral-voice-actor-ue5-instagram-2000655479</link>
            <guid>1391338</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Games don’t shut up anymore. At least most of the big-budget ones. There are potentially lots of reasons for that but it mostly sucks. Not sure what I’m talking about? Look no farther than this Unreal Engine 5 fan render of what a gritty Mario game might look like that’s going viral again thanks to a perfect set of new voiceovers.</p> <p>It’s actually broken up into two videos. The first was shared earlier this month on Instagram on by voice actor and cosplayer ryanstewartvo. It shows Mario navigating a dark, linear jungle environment at night with question blocks, Goombas, and green warp pipes. “A mushroom…I should take a look at that,” he says to no one in particular. He follows it up with other cringe dialogue barks like “A coin…this could be useful” and “maybe I should go this way.”</p>

 <p>It’s a perfect send-up of the type of hand-holdy presentation that’s become all too common in some AAA games.</p>   <p>The quotes ryanstewartvo voices were actually taken from the comments section for the original fan render video that was uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCVubOzbFzI">YouTube back in 2022 by Funkyzeit Games</a>. That, too, was meant to be a joke, but didn’t include any voice acting. It just used ultra-violent animations to convey gritty seriousness, another unfortunate tic of many modern blockbusters. Still, viewers could practically hear the Joss-Whedon-esque MCU banter just waiting to fill the silence.</p>

 <p>“This is a satire,” Funkyzeit Games wrote at the time. “It’s obviously an over-the-top alternate version of Mario that isn’t supposed to lecture you about what Mario game should be instead. I get that the ‘remake of X in UE’ and ‘HIRE THIS MAN’ have become a meme and you are free to joke about it (this video does to some extent), just don’t be the person that takes the video with Goomba blood-explosions too seriously.”</p>   <p>The new voice acting adds a fresh layer of parody that sends the whole thing over the edge, though. The first dub was so popular that ryanstewartvo ended up uploading a second one with fellow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arielhckva/?utm_source=ig_embed">voice actor Ariel Hack</a> playing the role of Princess Peach, who chats with Mario over a comms signal.</p>

 <p>“A monarch’s job is never done,” she quips. “But we can talk more later. Bowser’s Castle should be just up ahead.” Mario responds, “I thought I smelt something burning…” Peach cuts him off. “Focus, M. Bowser’s got the Power Stars, and you&nbsp;<em>know</em> what that means,” she continues. It is pitch perfect in every way, including when she hints at giving him upgrades if he brings back enough red coins.</p>

 <p>All of this is of a piece with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-says-there-are-times-when-yellow-paint-is-definitely-needed-2000639876">backlash against yellow paint</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">chatty NPC companions</a>. They can both serve important functions, but their pervasiveness has gotten to the point that players often feel like they’re just Band-Aids for hard-to-solve design challenges. Instead of implementing better workarounds, whether because of budget constrains, time issues, or other production limitations, the games saddle fans with absurd video game-isms that break immersion or make the experience more annoying.</p> <p>All that said, I would definitely play the full version of this <em>Mario</em> fan game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>IO Interactive has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> has been delayed by two months to 27th May 2026.</p>
<p>In a classic text image announcement on social media, IOI CEO and game director Hakan Abrak writes:</p>


<p>“007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p>
<p>“The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game.”</p>
<p>What’s a bit daft is that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-gets-a-march-2026-release-date/">they only announced the previous March release date back in September</a>, and just had a splashy cast announcement at The Game Awards, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/lenny-kravitz-revealed-as-bawma-in-007-first-light/">Lenny Kravitz playing the villain Bawma</a>. And then they’ve waited right up until Christmas Eve Eve to confirm this latest delay…</p>

<p>I’ve no doubt that IO are very, very thankful that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">GTA 6 was recently delayed to the back end of 2026</a>, having <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">previously been slated for 26th May 2026</a>. Otherwise the studio would have really painted themselves into a corner with 007: First Light wanting more polish. They’re pretty lucky to now have this extra breathing room.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">Head here for our wider 007: First Light preview</a>, with insights on how they settled on James Bond’s look, brought cars, vehicles and high speed chases in alongside action set pieces and, of course, the more open stealth action style inherited from the Hitman franchise.</p>
<p>So… 007: First Light is coming out on 27th May 2026 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC. The game is an Xbox Play Anywhere title, meaning you can buy it once and play across both Xbox and PC through the Microsoft Store.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-game-devs-share-stories-after-tragic-loss/</link>
            <guid>1391311</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Vince Zampella, one of the video game industry's most renowned and respected creators, tragically died this past Sunday after a fatal car crash. <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-died-in-car-crash-call-of-duty-apex-legends-battlefield/">The news didn't break until yesterday</a>, and across the video game industry, game developers, players, and everyone in between have shared messages of sadness upon hearing of his death and condolences to Vince Zampella's family and loved ones.</p>



<p>Zampella was, in every way, a titan of the modern video game industry. As a co-founder of Infinity Ward and a co-creator of Call of Duty, he left an immeasurable impact and legacy on video games and the modern video game industry, though to the people he worked with and who knew him, the impact they had on their lives will be the one they remember most.</p>



<p>One of the stories shared comes from Robert Bowling, a game developer and current studio head at Weatherfoot LLC, who worked on music for Call of Duty 2, 4, Modern Warfare 2, and Modern Warfare 3. The post he shared <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fourzerotwo_i-loved-vince-zampella-unconditionally-and-activity-7408978227269971969-fsKG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">on his personal LinkedIn account</a> is incredibly touching and a stunning example of the kind of person Zampella was.</p>



<p><em>"He has protected me and rescued me from tragedy, when I've been at the bottom, he'd find a way to nestle up next to me there and provide the ladder to climb up. When my father passed, he asked me to stay at his house, he knew I needed a shoulder and space to share my grief. He secretly paid for my Dad's entire funeral (with full military honors). Whenever something happened in my life, Vince was the</em> <em>first text I'd receive to make sure I was okay</em>."</p>



<p>Bowling goes on to say that he, and "<em>everyone he [Zampella] ever met had countless stories like this, full of unfiltered kindness, understanding, and generosity</em>," and even from a quick look into the comments of Bowling's post, it's clear he wasn't exaggerating. Just below his story is another, more comical story of Zampella pretending to grill a colleague for a hiring decision, before letting him in on the gag.</p>



<p>Laura Miele, head of EA's Entertainment division and one of the lead executives who worked closely with Zampella, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ealaura-miele_yesterday-we-lost-vince-zampella-an-icon-activity-7409023999239970816-E3xD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">shared on her LinkedIn</a>, "<em>He was a wickedly talented creator whose honesty, grounded approach, and sharp perspective made everyone around him better. Vince was a dear friend of mine who challenged me in the best ways and made my work more meaningful, not to mention a lot more fun. Beyond his extraordinary professional legacy, he was also a remarkable dad, which is something I deeply admired about him. I loved him dearly and will miss him more than words can say.</em>"</p>



<p>Jordan DeVires, a UI/UX designer at Respawn who worked on the Star Wars Jedi series, <a href="https://x.com/theastralj/status/2003200678253199585">said of Zampella</a>, "<em>As a creative he had my two favorite qualities: he always had an opinion and he always gave it to you straight. I wouldn't get to work on video games (let alone star wars games) if it weren't for what Vince made. My heart goes out to his loved ones and those that knew him best.</em>"</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2003400118868046169">Hideo Kojima also shared his own story of Zampella</a>, providing a bit of insight into the relationship they shared, and how Zampella reached out to Kojima when he was starting his own independence journey and opening Kojima Productions. </p>



<p>"<em>I first met Vince during his time at Infinity Ward, when he and Jason were creating “COD: MW2.” After they were forced out of Infinity Ward, Vince went on to found Respawn. When I was preparing to go independent myself, and maybe because he felt we were in similar situations, he took the time to listen to me, offered advice, and supported me in many ways. He even showed me around the studio. Even after he moved to DICE, whenever I went to Los Angeles, we would have meals together and talk about our respective futures. I honestly don’t have the words. It’s far too soon. This is heartbreaking. R.I.P. Vince.</em>" </p>



<p>Katsuhiro Harada stepped in to add, "<em>I’m deeply saddened by the passing of Vince Zampella. He was a creator who reshaped modern gaming and left an indelible mark on the industry through his vision, leadership, and commitment to quality. His work set new standards for competitive play and player experience, influencing countless developers across genres.</em>" Harada continued to say that he would find himself playing games Zampella worked on for hours into the night, even when he was busy trying to make his own games. "<em>Proof of how compelling and inspiring his work truly was</em>."</p>



<p>Alex Frostwolf, a community lead on <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">the upcoming multiplayer title Highguard</a>, who previously worked on Apex Legends and Overwatch, <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2003222453066039663">added</a>, "<em>While most knew him as the co-creator of Call of Duty and head of Respawn, I had the great fortune of also witnessing his particular brand of leadership, which often included standing up for what he believed in over politics, and protecting his people. The embodiment of a legend if I ever saw one. The industry has suffered a deep loss with this tragedy. My love and sympathy go out to his family. Thank you for everything, Vince</em>."</p>



<p>These are just a handful of messages that have been shared since the news of Zampella's passing was made public. It's clear that his loss is one the video game industry will not wholly recover from, and that the industry is now worse off without him in it. Our deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones.</p>

<section><p>The secret? Making parrying undeniably glamorous and mesmerizing.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Parrying is about subtlety. It's the act of scrutinizing fisticuffs and sword fights with a furrowed brow, familiarizing yourself with the cadence of combat right down to milliseconds, and learning the precise moment of performing a counter attack. For instance, a small variation in animation may point to a rare opening. A slight note change in the audio cue may indicate a shift of attacks from the enemy. To parry well is to understand these details and adapt to them dexterously.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, doing so is exhausting. The requirements needed to pull off a parry in most games can be steep and exacting. It's why I'd usually avoid parrying if there are other ways to minimize damage during combat, such as blocking or dodging.</p><p dir="ltr">The painterly Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, one of my favorite RPGs this year, has been the exception. Within its dazzling combat system I've discovered the joy of parrying, every encounter an exhilarating sequence of silky-smooth attacks and ripostes. Fighting in Expedition 33 is a resplendent affair, thanks to its surprisingly in-depth and complex structure. Its skirmishes enhance JRPG-inspired turn-based combat with real-time elements that get players to dodge--and parry--at the right moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Expedition 33 doesn't mince its challenges. Some enemies are capable of dealing massive amounts of damage, which renders every turn nail-bitingly intense. As such, every decision made in combat is a matter of strategic importance. During your enemies' turn, you have to pay close attention to the scene, from the way a behemoth swings its unwieldy battle axe into your team, to the minute changes in visual and audio cues when a particularly damaging attack happens. To stave off these attacks, dodging and parrying become imperative. This is how Expedition 33 encourages you to stay engaged during battles; it simply will not let you get distracted. Watch, learn, and adapt.</p><p dir="ltr">Pulling off a parry is about paying close attention to a combat sequence, but it's a process I typically abhor. That's because at its core, parrying is a test of reaction time. The idea behind the mechanic is to memorize a plethora of details, from timing to attack patterns, in order to nail the timing of a key button press. This may seem fun to many players, but for others it can be labored, time-consuming, and tedious. It's a cycle that can seem immensely frustrating when you just can't press a button within the fraction of a second you're granted to execute the parry. A lesser game can even make parries feel unavoidable but unfair, the reward from executing the parry too paltry to justify the effort, but the fight unwinnable if you don't land it.</p><p dir="ltr">But Expedition 33 exudes sheer style to the point of pageantry, making combat impossible to look away from. For instance, dodging has a bigger window for execution, and it does feel satisfying, especially when you can seamlessly avoid a cascade of attacks. A successful parry has a smaller window but elevates that emotion to a dizzying height as it lets you retaliate with a counter attack. When that happens, the scene slows down for a few seconds while the camera tilts back slightly, the motion concluding with your sword slicing the air with several chromatic trails. The opponent recoils with a howl. This is accompanied by a satisfying clank of weapons, and the orchestral splendor of Expedition 33's soundtrack only makes these moments more invigorating.</p><p dir="ltr">Making parrying even more compelling in Expedition 33 is the fact that it's also an extremely high reward maneuver--as long as you can time it exactly right. Some of its most challenging fights hinge on impeccably performed parries. Not only can a counter-attack deal a monstrous amount of damage, it also awards action points that are necessary for performing each of your characters' special skills. Gaining more action points translates to access to more powerful skills, which is why a perfect parry can turn the tide of battle. I've once salvaged a losing battle with just a single hit point left. The incredible payoff for parrying means I was ready to put in the time to practice and grind. I was soon anticipating attacks and landing parries with pizzazz.</p><p dir="ltr">Other factors helped to amplify the parry-ability of Expedition 33. The gradient counter, a variation on the basic parry, adds a new wrinkle to the mechanic, and is one of the most flamboyant moves in the game. Unsurprisingly, it's used against the gradient attack, a powerful move that temporarily colors the scene with a monochromatic filter. Then there are other defensive moves that can heighten the adrenaline of pulling off a parry, especially when done in quick succession. On top of dodging, there is also the jump counter; while not strictly a parry, it can only be performed when you successfully leap over a sweeping attack. It’s a much easier move to pull off than the parry, as you only need to jump when the icon appears, while the combat slows down slightly to indicate that an impending opportunity for a counter attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Thus when certain encounters require you to pull off a cascade of these moves--jumping, parrying, and performing a gradient counter--landing these can truly intensify the satisfaction of a well-performed parry. Executing these moves seamlessly is one of the most heart-palpitating stunts in Expedition 33.</p><p dir="ltr">Astoundingly, these merits are still not inclusive of the other aspects of Expedition 33's stellar combat system, such as the game's Pictos and Luminas. These transform the game's tactical depth, allowing you to tailor your play style--as well as extend the mileage of your parries--with passive boosts. Combined with a build that lets you garner as many action points as possible, for instance, parrying becomes even more of an effective means to mete out a great deal of damage.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, paying attention to numerous parrying cues only made my eyes water with exhaustion. My ears strain from fatigue, and I get salty, frustrated. But Expedition 33 has allowed me to realize the incredible potential of a solid, powerful parry. Figuring the intricacies of this move may still be time-consuming, but it's at least time spent well in this RPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A recent third-party <em>Daggerheart</em> crowdfunding campaign has reached its funding goal. The new supplement, <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em>, is a modest addition to Darrington Press' fantasy TTRPG, introducing new campaign frames to the game.</p><h2>The <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ericlazure/hope-springs-eternal?ref=rascal.news" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter campaign is a 120-page supplement that brings five original campaign frames to <em>Daggerheart</em>. Each frame is complemented by a location that is usable in any campaign. The campaign joins a small group of other third-party material for the game, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-triumphs-on-kickstarter-hitting-funding-goal-in" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a> conversion.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first campaign frame is the Ever Rime. As the name implies, the setting is set in a frozen land. The last remaining patches of society survive by living on landmasses attached to gigantic, magic-consuming beasts. Players can play as Shepherds, who guide the beasts to sites of natural magic to keep them alive, or Shamans who commune with the Primordial Fire for guidance. Or...they can chart their own path through the ice.</p><p>The second frame in <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> is The Eternal Song. This is set in the land of Fermata where the fabled Eternal Song has ceased. As for why The Conductor has stopped the song, it is because the notes have become too old and too worn. The players are tasked with finding new notes for the Eternal Song, all while exploring the role culture plays in society, both large and small.</p><p>Frame number three is Gutterpunk Rhapsody. This gritty, dystopian setting is in a gigantic tower where the players, a group of punks, take matters into their own hands to fight back. It is a setting full of alchemical enhancement and unbound greed. Essentially a fantasy spin on cyberpunk dystopia.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The fourth campaign frame, The Last Curtain, is a more contemplative frame designed for caregivers. Players will join a legendary hero on their final journey, their body and mind slowly decaying over the years. It is a frame that explores themes of trauma and reconciliation.</p><p>Last but not least, <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> has the Poisoned Roots campaign frame. This frame is an intense land where both beauty and rot coexist, one where the focus is less on combat and more on difficult decisions, ones where the greater good may come at the cost of lives your characters hold dear.&nbsp;</p><p>The design team for this supplement includes Eric Lazure, who has written supplements for the Nordic TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/vaesen-lost-mountain-saga-brings-nordic-horror-this-halloween" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Vaesen</em></a>. The book will also include artwork by Hector Rodriguez, Kalin Kadlev, and Galen Pejeau (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dusk" rel="nofollow"><em>DUSK</em></a>).</p><p>The different pledge tiers for Hope Springs Eternal are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital Backer for $20:</strong> A PDF of the book</li><li><strong>The Book Lover for $36:</strong> A softcover physical copy of the book</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter campaign has raised $5,725, well past its initial funding goal of $5,000. If you want some extra campaign frames in your <em>Daggerheart</em> games, or want something extra with the recently announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Hope &amp; Fear</em></a> expansion, you have until January 6, 2026, to back the campaign.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>(Strokes cat) Good eeeeeevening, Mr Bond. You thought you could escape 2025 without your game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, catching a delay? For shame, Mr Bond. It has, and will now Bondily emerge in May 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's May 27th, 2026 as the new date, Bond. Exactly two months later than the previous date of March 27th.</p>
<p>"007: First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more," IO CEO Hakan Abrak wrote in a delay announcement, which he's nicely faxed to my eeeevil villain fortress. "As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiac42vdctekxf2usehw6ymmttdlv2gcenw6q35xsujh2ssg4oebqu" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:lrjgagnmuiitghpprrw6rzj3/app.bsky.feed.post/3mao7ytthlk2t"><div lang=""><p>An important update regarding the release date of 007 First Light.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:lrjgagnmuiitghpprrw6rzj3/post/3mao7ytthlk2t?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— 007 First Light (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:lrjgagnmuiitghpprrw6rzj3?ref_src=embed">@007game.ioi.dk</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:lrjgagnmuiitghpprrw6rzj3/post/3mao7ytthlk2t?ref_src=embed">23 December 2025 at 17:01</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end," he continued, citing a desire to further polish the Bondage and set it up for "long-term success". Finally, Abrak promised more Bondly updates early next year.</p>
<p>Right, Mr Bond. Now that's out of the way, let me level with you. The main reason I've dragged you here to relay this information - despite already having sodded off for the holidays - is because when I first saw the news, I thought one of the 2026-dated games I've written about in a most anticipated article going up around the new year might no longer be a 2026-dated game. Thankfully that isn't the case, so I'll instead blame this brief crimbo news cameo on my admirable devotion to RPS and also the fact that having hopped on to do the same thing for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">most recent delay</a>, it just felt right.</p>
<p>Also, it's that moving of GTA 6 to November 19th next year which created the nice free window in May that IO have just snapped up for First Light.</p>
<p>So you see, Bond, it all fits together perfectly. The video game news. My master plan to take the world hostage by grafting rocket launchers to stoats, voles and other small mammals. Now, come here so I - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-leak-reveals-that-its-villain-wants-to-flyyyyyyy-awayyyyyyy-just-like-a-dragonfly">Lenny Kravitz</a> - can strap you to a table and point a laser at your nuts.</p>

            <p>The promising James Bond game 007 First Light has been delayed. Danish developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> announced the release date change this afternoon, signalling a two-month shift to 27th May 2026. First Light had been due to launch in March.</p>
<p>"007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/007game.ioi.dk/post/3mao7ytthlk2t">wrote IOI CEO Hakan Abrak in a statement</a>.

I imagine it mnust have been hard to pin him down, given his want for flying away. I'm sorry; it's nearly Christmas - forgive me.</p>
<p>Alex Donaldson, one of our resident Bond mega-fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">got a chance to see 007 First Light in action recently and was very impressed</a>. He described it as "so much more than Hitman" - a reference to IOI's iconic assassination franchise - and suggested the game may be the "ultimate composite video game".</p>

We’ve seen a few other 6K monitors from <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/finally-asus-6k-rival-to-pro-display-xdr-will-debut-within-weeks-and-will-cost-a-fraction-of-its-apple-rival">Asus</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/3/23537262/dell-6k-monitor-apple-4k-webcam-ces">Dell</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/788916/lg-ultrafine-32u990a-32-inch-6k-monitor-thunderbolt-5-preorder">LG</a>, though they don’t come with the Odyssey’s 3D effects or a focus on gaming. For now, select games like <em>Stellar Blade</em>, <em>Lies of P:</em> <em>Overture</em>, and <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em> are optimized specifically for the Odyssey 3D, but <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp8lx6slrzb813?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">several other titles</a> still support its 3D effects, including <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Palworld</em>, and <em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p><p>A 6K 3D display isn’t the only notable upgrade coming to Samsung’s lineup; the company is launching the Odyssey G6 G60H, which it says is the “world’s first” 1,040Hz gaming monitor. The 27-inch monitor only supports this ultra-fast refresh rate in HD, while its native 1440p resolution still offers speeds up to a very fast 600Hz. It’s also compatible with AMD FreeSync Premium and NVIDIA G-Sync.</p><p>Samsung has also revealed three new Odyssey G8 monitors, with the 32-inch G80HS offering a 6K resolution with refresh rates up to 165Hz (or 330Hz refresh rate at 3K), as well as a 27-inch 5K G80HF model with speeds up to 180Hz (or 360Hz at 1440p). There’s an Odyssey G8 with a 4K OLED display, too, featuring an up to 240Hz refresh rate, 300-nit brightness, and True Black 500 certification for deeper blacks. All three models support AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and NVIDIA G-Sync.</p><p>Samsung hasn’t yet revealed the pricing or release date of any of these models, but the Odyssey 3D is bound to be a bit pricey, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635554/samsung-odyssey-3d-monitor-pricing-preorder">given the $2,000 price tag attached</a> to Samsung’s 4K 3D screen.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/849850/samsung-odyssey-gaming-monitors-6k-3d-ces-2026]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>When we look back on the standout games of 2025 in the years to come, in many cases it’s as likely to be for the characters who populated them as it is for the greatness of their mechanics or level design. Whether it’s the heroes we inhabited, the villains we faced, or the random side characters we met just for a fleeting moment, there were some memorable newcomers in the best games of 2025, as well as a few characters we’ve known for years that had a moment worth celebrating.</span></p> <p><span>Here are our picks for the best video game characters of 2025.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000655444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655444">© Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <h2>Garmond and Zaza –&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i></a> <span>has a lot of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shakra-bell-beast-garmond-zaza-2000624954"><span>weird little guys</span></a><span> in its cast, and Garmond and Zaza are two of the most memorable. This regal-as-fuck little guy and his flying steed become Hornet’s allies when she saves them from captivity, and Garmond’s battle cry as he charges in to face one of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s tough bosses is enough to get anyone ready to fight god. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655445">© Toby Fox</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Tenna – </b><b><i>Deltarune</i></b></h2> <p><span>Every year when compiling the best characters in games, you’ve gotta have some absolute gremlin-level freaks on the list. Tenna, the TV host with a TV head, is one of 2025’s standouts on that front. </span><i><span>Deltarune</span></i><span> is full of colorful and memorable characters, but few pop off the screen like Tenna, whose 1950s variety show host schtick is perfectly punctuated by the game’s use of Word-Art-style text flourishes and a 3D model that lets him get more animated than most other characters in the cast. Tenna is technically interfering with your group’s journey in Toby Fox’s RPG, but he smokes too tough and his swag is too different for you to be mad about it. All his crazy antics lead to one of </span><i><span>Deltarune</span></i><span>’s most insane boss battles, which is practically an extended </span><i><span>WarioWare</span></i><span> mini-game barrage. All of this showmanship masks a deep-seated fear of being forgotten, and boy, does it reach a tragic finale — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000633328" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633328"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633328">© Screenshot: Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, Bennett Foddy</figcaption></figure> <h2>Nate –&nbsp;<em>Baby Steps</em></h2> <p><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span>, a cross between the insufferable movement controls of </span><i><span>QWOP</span></i><span> and a climbing game like </span><i><span>Only Up</span></i><span>, could have easily been content with being a $20 shitpost of a video game with no real character development to speak of and still been successful, but its main character, Nate, actually has quite a bit going on as he walks barefoot up the side of a mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>All of Nate’s problems in </span><i><span>Baby Steps </span></i><span>could be avoided if he merely accepted or asked for help. He could have shoes to help him take more confident steps, a map to tell him where he’s going, and a bathroom to empty his full bladder, if he only would say “yes” instead of “no” any time someone offered to help him. The quick wit of </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span>’ writing makes scenes showcasing Nate’s obstinacy, which should be frustrating to watch unfold, a hoot instead. But as the game goes on, it becomes clear Nate has a degree of social anxiety that dwarfs any I’ve experienced giving my order to a server at a restaurant. His biggest problem isn’t walking in the awkward way he does; it’s realizing that he wouldn’t have to suffer half as long if he let himself be uncomfortable for just a moment. But for some, the molehill of an awkward interaction is larger than any mountain we have to scale. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

  <h2><b>Swann – </b><b><i>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</i></b></h2> <p><span>Like </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span>,</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-2-review-dont-nod-swann-1851776436"><i><span>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</span></i></a> <span>is basically a social anxiety simulator, and it stars Swann, a teenage introvert just trying to find a space to occupy around a group of girls she doesn’t know, but would like to. From </span><i><span>Life Is Strange </span></i><span>creators Don’t Nod, the studio’s return to narrative adventure lets you determine the nature of the girls’ relationship, and if their reunion is one of rose-tinted nostalgia or tense discomfort. But no matter how you play Swann, there’s a melancholy sense of yearning for not just love, but belonging. She’s the kind of girl who could easily be talked over, or invited to the party but still left out of all the conversations and moments of connection that transpire. Don’t Nod manages to capture the sense of isolation you can experience when you’re standing in a crowded room, and Swann is at her most memorable when she’s able to break through her own barriers and find a place among friends and summer loves. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000655446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655446"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655446">© Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure> <h2>Dollman –&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></h2> <p><span>Dollman, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> living puppet, could have been a joke character, but instead, he ends up being one of the most tragic figures in a series full of them. Still, he’s not without moments in which his silly appearance as a mouthy, stop-motion doll matches his in-game actions. You can throw him around to do surveying for you, and then when you turn in for the night, he’ll tell you scary stories about him doing scary doll shit. </span><i><span>Death Stranding </span></i><span>has always been a mix of dramatic political commentary and unhinged absurdism. Dollman just wears that juxtaposition on his sleeve more than most. And damn, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/DJq0jJhPSjg?si=fdqDcDTIjHcd6puS"><span>the dude can dance</span></a><span>. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

  <h2><b>Hazel – </b><b><i>South of Midnight</i></b></h2> <p><span>There’s something about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-of-midnight-game-pass-xbox-series-pc-south-review-1851775149"><i><span>South of Midnight</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> southern gothic fantasy that speaks to me as a former southerner. Hazel, the game’s sorceress heroine, embodies a lot of the ideal parts of the south. She is the best of us: a kind-hearted person who seeks to help those in need, but is able to do so with wit and while taking no shit from those who meet her empathy with a thorny disposition. Hazel respects those who have long gone without consideration, but never gives up her own self-respect to offer a helping hand. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000655447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655447"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655447">© Kaizen Game Works</figcaption></figure> <h2>Pinky –&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em></h2> <p><span>Pinky is cute on the outside, vile on the inside. As her name implies, she’s…well, a severed pinky but made to look like the kind of mascot you might see at Disneyland. </span><i><span>Promise Mascot Agency </span></i><span>is full of whimsy and chaos in equal measure, and Pinky dials up the latter with her frequent angry outbursts. Pinky is, as the kids say, a mood. You never know what she’s going to say next, other than that it will be one of the filthiest reads you’ve seen put to paper. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000000906" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000906"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000906">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2>Pauline –&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <p><span>For better or worse, the connection between Donkey Kong and Pauline is foundational to the history of video games. It was there in 1981’s </span><i><span>Donkey Kong</span></i><span>, the game that launched the career of gaming’s greatest and most versatile superstar, where it helped establish the “damsel in distress” template which hundreds of games would employ in the decades to come as an easy way to create some kind of basic motivation for the player.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what makes Pauline’s presence in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><i><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i></a><span> so refreshing is the way that it reimagines both her as a character and her connection to DK. No longer a kidnapping victim in need of rescue or an object of weird obsession, Pauline is a talented but insecure singer who forms a fast friendship with Donkey Kong as the two find themselves flung together on the game’s grand journey. Their abilities complement each other, with Pauline’s voice providing accompaniment to DK’s rhythm, and her confidence in her own abilities grows over time thanks to DK’s unwavering belief in her. More than 40 years after they first debuted, it’s a thrill to see these two embark on an epic adventure in which they just get to be BFFs, enjoy each other’s company, and help each other out, without a Mario anywhere in sight to come between them or spoil their fun. — Carolyn Petit</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000655448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655448">© DotEmu</figcaption></figure> <h2>Cider –&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em></h2> <p><span>Cider is the kind of character that just oozes cool. They tear into enemies with their vicious, fast-paced battle style while also basically dancing across the battlefield with acrobatic flair. Also, just look at their sick, masked design.

The live-action scenes in which Starr embodies the kind of face-punchable nepo baby ego that hides something far more sinister underneath its surface are some of the most frightening in Surgent Studio’s horrifying escape room adventure. Here’s an actor we largely know as the stoic, noble heroes of Verso and Clive, revealing a capacity to terrify us as someone rotten to the core. It’s a performance made all the more effective by the knowledge that people like this guy, who was willing to sabotage his friends for the role of the lifetime, walk among us. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-is-40-hours-long-will-launch-in-2026-confirms-chris-roberts/</link>
            <guid>1391230</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Chris Roberts</strong>, the video game designer known for the Wing Commander series and most recently for <strong>Star Citizen</strong>, penned his usual end-of-the-year <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/comm-link/transmission/20960-Letter-From-The-Chairman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Letter From the Chairman'</a> to the SC community, including a few updates on <strong>Squadron 42</strong>.</p>



<p>The single player campaign was initially supposed to launch its beta in <strong>Q2 2020</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-beta-delayed-by-three-months-now-targeting-q3-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then in <strong>Q3 2020</strong></a>, before being delayed indefinitely, with Chris Roberts <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-will-be-done-when-its-done-says-chris-roberts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting in October 2020</a> that the game would be 'done when it's done'. </p>



<p>The tune finally changed in October 2023, when developer Cloud Imperium Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Squadron 42 was now <strong>feature-complete</strong> and would enter its polishing phase. A year later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-gets-2026-release-window-and-new-gameplay-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the new target release window: <strong>2026</strong>. However, a few months ago, the game's Content Director <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-content-director-isnt-100-sure-game-launch-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that delays could still happen.</p>



<p>Today, though, Chris Roberts has reiterated that Squadron 42 is on the right path toward the Beta milestone and the eventual launch at some point next year. According to Roberts, the game will take <strong>over forty hours</strong> to complete. The game designer also teased that the content quality is something he's proud of, from writing and performance capture to characters, environments, ships, lighting, sound, cinematics, and design.</p>



<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-launch-2027-2028-squadron-42-top-gun-star-awrs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his previous statement</a> about hoping to attract a GTA 6-like attention, Roberts has now said that Cloud Imperium Games isn't planning a long marketing campaign. Because of this decision, fans should expect to learn more about the game relatively close to its actual debut compared to most triple-A games.</p>



<p>The plot of Squaron 42 will see the player character in the role of a rookie pilot joining the celebrated 42nd Squadron, a naval combat unit deployed aboard the massive capital ship UEES Stanton, assigned to the 5th Fleet, 87th Battlegroup in the Odin system, during the Events of Vega II in 2945. The story is framed as a military war narrative centered on the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy, where the player is thrown into a hazardous campaign to combat a sinister pirate threat and the alien Vanduul.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games recruited <strong>major Hollywood talents</strong>, including <strong>Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Gillian Anderson, Mark Hamill, Mark Strong, Liam Cunningham, John Rhys-Davies, Henry Cavill, and Ben Mendelsohn</strong>, to play the role of key non-player characters in the game. Cloud Imperium used new 4D technology to create digital replicas of these actors (as well as player characters and other NPCs) thanks to a unique partnership with the Hollywood VFX company <a href="https://www.clearanglestudios.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clear Angle Studios</a>.</p>



<p>In the 'Letter From The Chairman', Roberts also boasted that Star Citizen received many big updates this year, driving record engagement with the game up to <strong>64 million hours</strong> (last year, CIG registered 48 million hours of playtime) played in 2025. Looking ahead, the Dynamic Server Meshing technology will evolve to reconfigure in real-time, aiming to support thousands of players in a single shared instance; a next-generation planetary tech will debut, offering significantly higher graphical fidelity, denser biomes, and natural ecosystems; a new AI population management system will create more complex and appropriate NPC interactions; and significant improvements are also coming to systems like Inventory, Insurance, and Cross-Patch Persistence.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent PlayStation Network (PSN) hacking incident involving a journalist has revealed a major security flaw that could put many users in trouble. </p>



<p>A lot of PlayStation users have been hacked at some point; some users manage to get their account back, whereas unfortunate others have to leave behind all of their years’ worth of progress for a new account. Interestingly, some users are hacked again when trying to recover their accounts, and someone has now discovered a flaw that could be the cause. </p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-network-accounts-can-be-hacked-with-just-an-invoice-number-and-your-username">PlayStation Network Accounts Can be Hacked With Just an Invoice Number and Your Username </h2>



<p>A journalist at the French publication <a href="https://www.numerama.com/cyberguerre/2147695-je-me-suis-fait-pirater-mon-compte-playstation-et-jai-decouvert-un-enorme-probleme-de-securite-chez-sony.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Numerama</a> (translated by Google) has discovered a major security flaw with PlayStation Network. The report dives into an incident in which the journalist’s account was hacked despite 2FA protection. The user’s account login ID (email address) was changed, and he was charged €9.99 as the hacker had changed the username. The journalist was able to recover their account by getting support over the phone, but what’s interesting is the information they needed to retrieve it. </p>



<p>The report reveals that after spending some time on the call, all the information they needed to share was their PSN username and a transaction number from an old invoice; the year didn’t matter. With that, the journalist recovered their account; however, it was hacked again within an hour. This time, the user was unable to reach PSN support on the phone and decided to contact the hacker themselves by messaging their old PSN account from a new one. </p>



<p>The hacker was strangely cooperative and revealed that they had hacked the journalist’s PSN account “using a transaction number you posted on a page.” Turns out he had posted one of his bills in an old article, which the hacker could use to get access to the PSN account. The hacker also claimed to have “coded an app” to access Sony’s servers; however, that claim hasn’t been verified, as the promised video hasn’t been shared yet. </p>



<p>The journalist got on another call with PlayStation Network support, expressed his concerns about his account being hacked, and was then asked questions such as his date of birth, original email address, and original username. At the moment, their request is on hold, with the account seemingly suspended and a 5-10 day waiting period for a response.</p>
