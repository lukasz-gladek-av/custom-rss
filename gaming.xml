            <p>
Football Manager developer Sports Interactive has announced a four-year licensing partnership with The Premier League.
</p>
<p>
It means, for the first time ever, Football Manager players will be able to take their team to the top of English football, with all 20 clubs fully licensed including official logos, kits, and player photos.
</p>
<p>
The deal will begin with the 2024/25 season, due later this year.

<p>
"Since Football Manager's inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we're delighted to announce today that at last we are", said Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson.
</p>
<p>
"The partnership isn't just about the huge in-game benefits it'll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we're enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.
</p>
<p>
"We are very grateful to the Premier League and their other partners in our space for enabling us to be an officially licensed product of the world's most commercially successful football league."
</p>
<p>
Premier League chief commercial officer Will Brass added: "Football Manager has been a big part of the sporting landscape for decades, and is loved and enjoyed by millions of fans around the world. We are thrilled that the Premier League will now feature even more prominently in the game, helping to deliver a deeper, more authentic experience for anybody who takes on the challenge of managing a Premier League club."
</p>
<p>
Football Manager first released in 2005, after its previous iteration as Championship Manager that began in 1992. It's surprising, therefore, it's taken so long for The Premier League to be officially licensed.
</p>
<p>
"What should be a transitional year for Football Manager feels like a quietly revolutionary one, thanks to a handful of little changes with big impacts," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-2024-review">Eurogamer's Football Manager 2024 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-nintendo-direct-this-week-journalist-claims-said-to-air-later-this-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There won't be a Nintendo Direct broadcast this week, a known Brazilian Journalist has claimed.</p>
<p>Despite rumors claiming otherwise, Nintendo won't be airing a new Direct episode later this week. Luckily for Nintendo fans, however, there will be a new Nintendo Direct later this month.<br>
At least, that's what known Brazilian journalist @phluttilippe <a href="https://x.com/phluttilippe/status/1800044165394497990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> on X earlier today. Although the journalist has claimed that the Direct will take place by the end of the month, the exact date for the broadcast isn't certain at this point. "There is no Nintendo Direct this week", the journalist wrote on X (Google translated). "End of the month, and as far as I know, the exact date isn't even certain yet."</p>
<p>Last month, Nintendo President Furukawa confirmed that there will be a Direct broadcast this month. During this event, Nintendo won't be talking about the Switch 2. "We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation", Furukawa said last month.</p>
<p>While this isn't a confirmation that there indeed won't be a Direct this week, the journalist has correctly revealed Nintendo-related details before official announcements in the past. Also, @phluttilippe was among the first to say that the Switch successor is slated for a release in March 2025, instead of this year. Of course, Nintendo has yet to officially unveil the Switch successor, but Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Furukawa recently confirmed that the Switch 2 will be announced before April 2025</a> (before the end of Nintendo's current fiscal year, which runs through March 2025).</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Nintendo's plans for this month. Stay tuned.</p>

In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-2-dog-tags-aiming-mgs2-1851474122"><em>MGS2</em></a></span> you can watch a cup of ice melt in real-time, and in the original <em>MGS3</em> you could win a fight against an aging sniper, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-metal-gear-boss-battle-solid-3-1849527921">The End</a></span>, by simply waiting seven real-world days for him to die of old age. As absurd as these features may sometimes seem, they always add to the depth and immersion of the world. The upgraded damage system of <em>MGS Delta</em> feels like a logical next step for the series, and many see it as a truly Kojima-level choice.</p><p>As for how far the new damage system will go, Konami hasn’t given details on what to expect beyond what’s explained in the short blurb on the website. My best guess is that all damage taken by Snake will be able to be healed (this is a video game after all) but will leave a lasting scar, eventually creating a tapestry of mistakes or close calls with death unique to you. Maybe death will leave an exceptionally deep scar on Snake to remind you of when and why you failed. In any case, it’s a fascinating tease of what’s to come in <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/industry-veterans-announce-copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-and-the-first-from-new-studio-triple-espresso.896787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=copa-city-a-football-tycoon-title-from-new-studio-triple-espresso<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Triple Espresso, a brand new game development studio consisting of industry veterans, has announced its first title: <em>Copa City</em>. This game takes football management in a new direction, having you control everything about the city hosting the biggest clubs and matches in the world. </p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> combines the strategic elements of a tycoon simulator with the electric themes of football to create something that feels altogether new and interesting, much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-football-manager-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Football Manager</a></em> did when the very first entry was released. Just to be clear, this is soccer for you US folks, meaning you’ll be looking after all the hosting requirements and city management that come with major Premier League games and much from the same sport. </p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Triple Espresso</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><em>Copa City</em> is currently slated for a 2025 release window and is being developed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. During the campaign, you’ll manage real-world cities and six fully licensed football clubs playing in them. The clubs include Arsenal FC, FC Bayern Munchen, and CR Flamengo, so definitely some of the bigger names out there. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Your overarching goal with every match is to help the city gear up for the event and even get excited about it. This includes organizing how roadblocks must be set up, advertising, where fans can sit, and more. It reminds me a lot of the final match Leicester had to play in the Premier League in the 2015/16 season. </p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true">The team was going to win the league regardless of the outcome, but more people watched it and were excited about it and the ensuring victory parade that occurred after than I’ve ever seen before. Everyone was talking about it, but the amount of management that must have gone into organizing every aspect of the match and everything that followed must have been monumental. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">I believe that’s the goal of <em>Copa City</em>: to put you in the shoes of the people working to facilitate that excitement in the best ways possible. You have all the responsibilities that come with keeping people and businesses in the city safe without all the team management, but you’re also rooting for one particular outcome so you can put on a fantastic show. </p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">The game is being developed by veterans from across the industry who have worked on titles such as <em>Watch Dogs</em>, <em>Dying Light 2</em>, and <em>Pure Farming 2018</em>, as well as football experts who have a wealth of knowledge to make the experience feel great for fans of football and strategy games alike. </p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false"><em><a href="https://copacity.club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copa City</a></em> is entering a space that the <em>Football Manager</em> and, to a degree, <em>EA Sports FC</em> have owned for over a decade. It’ll be interesting to see if it resonates with fans and can make a dent where fans love stats and want more management options at their fingertips. </p>

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been following along with the development of <em>Stalker 2</em>, you’ll be well aware of the turmoil the studio has had to endure. With GSC Game World having to flee to Prague to escape the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the future of the long-awaited horror FPS remained uncertain at one point.</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">We know it had to be delayed for fairly obvious reasons, pushing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-september-5-2024/">release date back to September 5</a>. Now, the latest trailer has been released, and it’s really whetting my appetite for <em>Heart of Chornobyl</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце Чорнобиля — Трейлер «Час Можливостей»" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6HH5kKLAlw?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">The gloomy backdrop of the Exclusion Zone has never looked prettier than in the “Time of Opportunities” teaser the developer put out yesterday. While many of us strongly suspect <em>Stalker 2</em> is going to be quite something, I now cannot wait for it to finally arrive.</p> <h2 id="h-heart-and-soul" data-injectable="false">Heart and soul</h2> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say I was ignorant of the game until now. Though I admit, I haven’t really played any of the other entries in the series, aside from a brief stint of the first game. But that doesn’t mean it hasn’t intrigued me, largely because it’s been fifteen years since GSC released the last installment, <em>Call of Pripyat</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">At any rate, the new trailer really shows off what’s almost certainly going to be a pretty solid horror FPS. I know I’m not alone in saying that it gives me mad <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016800/Chernobylite_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chernobylite</a></em> vibes, which I have played and did enjoy.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false">It has, indeed, been a long and worrisome road for the development team, but whatever tribulations have come their way, they’ve remained steadfast in their completion of <em>Stalker 2</em>. I truly hope it pays off for them, because it looks fantastic. Look, just go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlist the game on Steam</a> already.</p>

<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With Yinlin’s release in <em>Wuthering Waves, </em>came her signature weapon, Stringmaster, a 5-Star Rectifier with a lot of power behind it. If you’re curious about pulling Stringmaster without getting Yinlin, or if you’re wondering if you should even pull the weapon at all, then I’ve got all that you need to know right here.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-worth-rolling-for-stringmaster-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Is it worth rolling for Stringmaster in <em>Wuthering Waves?</em></h2> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">The short and sweet answer is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>. Stringmaster is an insanely powerful 5-Star Rectifier that completely dwarfs its standard counterpart, Cosmic Ripples, in all aspects except for raw ATK%. It makes up for its lack of ATK% main stat with a CRIT RATE main stat instead, and that makes it absurdly universal for any characters that use Rectifiers for damage. To put that statement into a reasonable perspective,<strong> </strong>Stringmaster is <strong>Encore’s BiS (Best in Slot) </strong>weapon as of Yinlin’s release, and it’s not even close.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">As a stat stick, Stringmaster is already a pretty insane weapon, coming with a CRIT RATE stat that scales higher than any other CRIT RATE weapon in the game. However, Stringmaster’s passive ability also provides a significant damage boost to any character that makes use of their Resonance Skill as a primary aspect for dishing out damage. This, again, is why characters like Encore want Stringmaster so badly.</p>

There’s also an equally high chance that his new theoretical Rectifier will be just as strong or stronger than Stringmaster. However, looking at Stringmaster as a whole, its high innate CRIT RATE always gives it a potent niche for characters to abuse. Even if it’s knocked down a peg or two, this weapon will never be outright useless in my opinion. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Even if Stringmaster is eventually outclassed by another 5-Star Rectifier, it will likely remain the second-best choice for a long time for most DPS-focused Rectifier characters. Stringmaster’s mixture of universal useful stats and powerful passive ability that all characters can make use of make it a very safe pick for players looking to pick up an additional 5-Star Rectifier for their arsenals.</p>
 <p data-characters="640" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="false">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, thanks to the weapon banner being a guaranteed pick of your choice, weapons actually have a slightly higher value than characters from an account overview standpoint in terms of account progression. The reason is that 4-Star weapons, in general, are far weaker than practically any 5-Star weapon you can obtain. This intrinsically boosts the value of pulling Stringmaster from Yinlin’s banner, as the more 5-Star weapons you have on your account, the better off your characters will be, especially since you can freely swap around weapons and gear during <em>Wuthering Wave’s </em>endgame content, Tower of Adversity.</p>

		<p>Football Manager 2025 will have the official license for the Premier League for the first time, as the Premier League and Sports Interactive have penned a four-year licensing partnership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Premier League Licence coming to Football Manager" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rircYvbkhk0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the 2024/25 season, Football Manager will have all 20 Premier League clubs included with fully licensed logos, kits and player photos for the real sporting figures throughout.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, “Since Football Manager’s inception, we have always wanted to work with the Premier League, and we’re delighted to announce today that at last we are.”</p>
<p>This will add a further layer of authenticity to the game, though it already has numerous leagues, teams and competitions licensed – in England, for example, the Premier League is the cherry on the top of having the EFL and National League structures in <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-2024-licences">FM24</a>, and there’s several of the major European leagues and the UEFA club competitions already featured as well.</p>

<p>Jacobson continued:</p>
<p>“The partnership isn’t just about the huge in-game benefits it’ll give our fans, but also the opportunities it provides us to help with the incredible things that the Premier League and their clubs do off the pitch. That includes community and charitable work, two things we’re enormously passionate about, as well as the ability to work with some of their existing partners.”</p>
<p>More details on how the Premier League will be integrated into Football Manager will be revealed later this year, as and when Sports Interactive start to talk about this year’s entry.</p>
<p>However, we do know that this year’s game is going to be a massive shift for Sports Interactive. The studio confirmed last year that they would be switching game engines to Unity, which will allow for a whole new UI, better optimised graphics per platform – from mobile to console and PC – and a completely overhauled matchday experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">FM24</a> was the first time that you were able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/30/football-manager-2024-will-support-football-manager-23-saves/">import a previous year’s save</a> and continue on with the new enhancements and systems, and we expect that this will also be possible with FM25. It’s also been a few years since Sports Interactive announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/23/womens-football-is-coming-to-football-manager-not-for-2022/">their intention to bring women’s football into Football Manager</a> with a number of specific and bespoke touches to try to accurately simulate the women’s game and the different challenges it can present when compared to the men’s game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-premier-league-licensing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>developer Sports Interactive has announced that it's secured a four-year licensing deal with the Premier League, the biggest league in English football.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the football (if you're expecting me to call it "soccer", you're out of luck) management sim will include all 20 Premier League clubs starting from the 2024/25 season.</p>
<p>Those clubs will come complete with their official logos, player lineups, and kits, and you'll also see authentic player photos for each player, bringing you that much closer to your dream of being a Premier League manager.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/football-manager-premier-league-deal-menu.jpg?itok=HPr8PJQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/football-manager-premier-league-deal-menu.jpg?itok=INUTjCh9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Premier League is officially coming to&nbsp;<em>Football Manager </em>for the first time.</figcaption></figure><p>While individual teams such as Brighton &amp; Hove Albion or Manchester City have featured as licenses in&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>games, they were usually included as part of other leagues or tournaments.</p>
<p>This deal marks the first time the full Premier League has been available in a&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>game, and given that many of the series' players likely hail from the UK, this is a pretty big deal.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson says it's always been his studio's dream to work with the Premier League, and he's "delighted" that the deal has finally come to pass.</p>
<p>Premier League CCO Will Brass, for his part, says&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>represents a "big part of the sporting landscape", and that the inclusion of the Premier League in the game will help to "deliver a deeper, more authentic experience".</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a football management sim series that's been running since 1992 in one form or another.</p>
<p>The series debuted as&nbsp;<em>Championship Manager</em>, but became&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>after the controversial release of 2003's&nbsp;<em>Championship Manager 4</em>, which saw developer Sports Interactive switch to Sega for future series installments (as well as the name change).</p>
<p><em>Championship Manager&nbsp;</em>continued in various forms for a number of years, but no new games have been released in that franchise for a while, leaving&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>at the top of its rather lonely league table.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-preview-and-qa-wide-linear-soulslite-with-20-hours-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>, the next game from New Zealand developer Aurora44 (the same studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ashen-not-dark-but-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashen</a>), finally got its release date announcement during yesterday's Xbox Game Showcase: the game is slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on July 18.</p>
<p>With only a month and a week left before the release date, we were able to get our hands on a demo of the game that goes live today on Steam Next Fest. Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn definitely shares quite a few similarities with the studio's previous work, being a Souls-lite action RPG with adventure elements.</p>
<p>However, the setting is certainly unique. This is a fantasy world where magic and the gods are very much real; in fact, the so-called Gods of the Great Below assault the living world with their armies of undead. This is when the demo and, indeed, the whole game begins.</p>
<p>Protagonist Nor Vanek (played by Olive Gray) is an orphan adopted into the Coalition Army, the defensive force that fights desperately against the invasion of the Gods. She was trained as a Sapper from a young age under the tutelage of Baz, a grizzled war veteran who is essentially her adoptive father. At the very beginning of the game, Baz (played by Elias Toufexis of Deus Ex fame) goes with a couple of squad members on a nearly suicidal mission to try and bomb the gate of the dead once and for all. Nor is initially left behind but quickly joins the group when she learns of their arduous task. A big creature eventually ambushes the party and, in the hectic fight, Nor does something to the gate that actually makes things worse for everyone.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/14_Game_Screen_Combat_Traveller_Boss-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, shortly afterward, she gains a companion in Enki, a fox-like creature who turns out to be a minor god himself. Enki (played by Alistair Petrie) warns Nor of the dire situation the whole world is in and offers his help in defeating the other gods. Enki's powers include the ability to curse enemies, for instance to fill the priming gauge with successful melee attacks to trigger an instant takedown of an unarmored enemy, and the Witherings, powerful attacks that consume the Withering gauge, which gets filled by defeating enemies). Enki (who's not nearly as chatty as Forspoken's Cuff, in case you were worried) can also help with rift-based magic traversal that allows Nor to reach otherwise inaccessible paths.</p>
<p>This is often where you'll find secondary content, such as Enki's feathers, which can be collected to augment the companion's power level, or even hamlets that need to be freed from the enemy's yoke. In this case, you can head directly to the enemy leader - once defeated, all the other enemies will disappear, restoring the original population to unlock a reward, a secondary quest, and the ability to play the mini-game called Sebo.</p>
<p>Speaking of combat, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is a relatively fast-paced soulslite that feels fun but not overly complex to play. As suggested by the title, there's a fairly strong emphasis on firearms. With your gamepad's right trigger, you can use black power charges (recharged by landing successful melee attacks) to deal damage and stop certain enemy attacks. These can be woven into melee combo chains. Players can also equip up to two secondary firearms to be aimed and reloaded with their own ammunition. There's even a Gears of War-like active reload system that rewards a properly timed reload with increased damage on the next shot. Grenades are also available when you need to deal area of effect damage.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FLINTLOCK_Gameplay_SCREENSHOT_UHD_003-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, much of the game still involves melee attacks, blocks, and parries. Holding the left shoulder button enters a blocking stance, but only pressing the block button right after being hit will parry the attack, allowing players to execute a melee counter-attack. There's also a double dodge for when you really need to get out of the way of an unblockable attack. Each combat action builds Reputation, which is the game's primary currency.</p>
<p>In an intriguing twist, you can either 'bank it' right away or grow up your Reputation multiplier; do note that being hit automatically resets the multiplier and banks the Reputation. Of course, if you are defeated, the Reputation is lost and you'll have one chance to get it back, just like in a proper Soulslike game. You'll respawn at the nearest Lodestone, the equivalent of a bonfire in a Souls game. You can rest here (which respawns enemies, of course), as well as check your inventory and skills. Players must spend Reputation to unlock new skills in the three available trees (Powder, which increases ranged damage; Magic, which augments magic damage; and Steel, which bolsters melee damage).</p>
<p>Visually, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn features some of New Zealand's native plants and trees. The developers said some of the game's fauna is a tribute to the Moa bird. Moreover, the Three Peaks area is heavily inspired by New Zealand's South Island regions. The landscape of this region is modeled after the Southern Alps. The game (powered by Unreal Engine 4) looks good without being spectacular. On PC, it already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (with a slider to tweak the sharpness) and Frame Generation, as well as Intel XeSS. AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution is strangely missing from this build, although XeSS is available cross-vendor, so that wouldn't be too much of an issue. However, there's quite a bit of stuttering that I certainly hope will be fixed or at least lessened before the full launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn PC Preview 4K Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_YU-9QS-mN8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn feels like a competent and fun soulslite that is, however, unlikely to stand out from the crowd for its quality. Still, the budget pricing ($40, with a 10% discount currently available ahead of launch) and the day-one availability on Game Pass make it an enticing title for anyone interested in the genre and setting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173133/an-extremely-goofy-movie-tiktok-maxley-ship-beret-girl<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="yG2wxz"><em>One of the best parts of the human experience is having a </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22929389/best-anime-crushes"><em>big ol’ crush</em></a><em> — the pitter-patter of your heartbeat, the swell of euphoria when you see the object of your affections, the desire to just squeal with joy! At Polygon, though, we’re very flexible about how we interpret “crush.” Brief-yet-intense infatuations </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2019/11/6/20944180/69-biggest-movies-tv-games-crushes-decade"><em>don’t necessarily have to be on real people</em></a><em> (or even on people!), or even romantic. Since I have many many (many) crushes, I’ve decided to share the energy of writing their names over and over again in sparkly gel pen in a journal.</em></p>

<p id="sVZj4q">The 2000 animated Disney direct-to-video comedy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/28/18261900/best-disney-sequels-movies-animation"><em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em></a> is back in the zeitgeist at the moment. There’s been a sudden wave of fan-created <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shibah_art/video/7371104206431784198">animatics</a> of Goofy’s son <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/photo/7369081209130896656">Max and his rival</a>, the skateboarding frat boy Bradley Uppercrust III, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/video/7370868918186937616">flooding</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@d00dlesp00dle/video/7367711589648157968">TikTok</a>. Their relationship even clocked in at No. 6 on last week’s <a href="https://fandom.tumblr.com/post/752293738864361472/movies">Tumblr Fandometric ranking for movies</a>, with the tag full of <a href="https://silkoodles.tumblr.com/post/752056220985311232/from-this-gif-set-i-just-love-when-a-decades-old">romantic fan art</a>. Most of the resurgence is focused on the “Maxley” ship between Max and Bradley, and it’s clear what’s driving that: There’s an enduring appeal in an enemies-to-lovers pairing. And some of these edits also toss in some queer longing to really drive up the drama. </p>
<p id="bCqNux">But personally, when I think of <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em>, the first thing that comes to mind is Beret Girl. </p>
<div id="YwhFJR"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K8u8Y1j1zf8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="IUdOhJ">Goofy’s son Max and his pals first meet the mysterious, never named beret-clad gal when she performs a slam poem at some hip café. But that isn’t her most awesome moment. After Bradley gets aggressive with Max at her show, she swoops in to put Bradley in his place, getting the entire café to aggressively snap at him until he and his cronies leave. She’s striking and creative and has a killer sense of fashion, with her commitment to the all-black look and that sultry purple eyeliner. </p>
<p id="SlX84n">Since Beret Girl isn’t credited with an actual name, many <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dawn.kirkland/video/7293214379510680874">Disney fans</a> have decided her name is Mocha Chino, since Bradley calls her “little Miss Mochaccino” to dismiss her. But that does make for a pretty sick name, so we’re reclaiming it from Bradley! </p>
<p id="0symRn">When I first watched this movie as a kid in the early 2000s, it gave me completely unrealistic expectations for how cool college would be. Namely that there would be artsy spoken-word poetry events in underground cafés, campus librarians would be into disco, and everyone would be <em>really</em> invested in skateboarding. (Maybe this was true in the year 2000, but it wasn’t true a decade later.) But Beret Girl gave me <em>the</em> most unrealistic expectation: that there would be beautiful, rhyming black-clad girls around to chew out all the douchey frat boys.</p>

<p id="LAq3pM">Rewatching <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie</em> today is a fun nostalgia trip, and the current wave of TikToks and Tumblr art has reminded me that there definitely is a lot of homoerotic tension going on with Max and Bradley. I love that people are rewatching or discovering the film, and finding joy in giving Bradley and Max’s antagonistic relationship a flirtatious and romantic edge. </p>
<p id="IqbLuH">But personally, I’m still out here replaying Beret Girl’s two minutes of screen time over and over and over again. Suddenly, I’m back in third grade, watching <em>An Extremely Goofy Movie </em>in class, because we had a substitute teacher without a lesson plan. And this super cool, confident, artsy girl takes center stage, commanding a room with her presence. She makes an impression! I latched on to how cool she was at age 8, and I never fully let go, even if that kinda evolved from wanting to hang out with her to wanting to be her to wanting to hold her hand and have her defend me from Bradley Uppercrust III. </p>
<p id="t6iuon">Once again, I am doomed to love a background character this week. Maybe next time I’ll find a worthy crush in a main character. Hopefully you’re having a better time of it than I am. Let me know who you’re crushing on!</p>

<p>The dates for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Beta may have been leaked thanks to a GAME UK store listing card. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1800153990354837582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store listing card</a>, the Black Ops 6 closed pre-order Beta will run from August 28 – September 3. In the United States, that happens to fall during the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>



<p>The beta also follows the Call of Duty NEXT event that’s also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-call-of-duty-next-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for August 28</a>. That event will showcase the game in full, including multiplayer and zombies. Both of those modes are seeing major new changes compared to Modern Warfare 2 and 3, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-omnidirectional-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">omnidirectional sliding, diving, and sprinting</a>.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-won-t-carry-forward-to-black-ops-6">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-wont-carry-forward-to-black-ops-6/">Modern Warfare 2 and 3 Content Won’t Carry Forward To Black Ops 6</a></h6>



<p>If last year’s Modern Warfare 3 Beta is any indication, this year’s should also give players a look into the game’s multiplayer with access to limited modes, maps, and more.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision and Microsoft about the potential beta dates. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is the Starfield Creation Kit Free? – Answered]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-creation-kit-free-answered/</link>

<p>One of the most significant announcements for Starfield fans, second only to the reveal of Shattered Space, was the shadow drop for the Starfield Creation Kit. It’s the tool necessary to create unique mods, like additional ship modules, quests, and creatures. It’ll enhance the gameplay and significantly improve Starfield’s longevity. But is the Starfield Creation Kit free?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-download-the-starfield-creation-kit-for-free">Can You Download the Starfield Creation Kit for Free?</h2>



<p>It’s relatively easy to confuse the Starfield Creation Club with the Creation Kit. The former is a paid mod service with creations approved by Bethesda and sold for top dollar. The latter, however, is a free-to-use toolset that allows savvy users to create game modifications to enhance Starfield’s gameplay tenfold. It’s one of the most requested features we’ve all been waiting for, and it’s finally here!</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2722710/Starfield_Creation_Kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Starfield Creation Kit on Steam</a> and share your game modifications with other users. There are options. You can share them via Starfield Creation Club, attempt to partner with Bethesda to release a paid mod with their approval, or use the tried-and-true method of launching a mod on Nexus. Your prospective fans will prefer the latter.</p>







<h2 id="h-are-starfield-mods-free">Are Starfield Mods Free?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are two varieties of game mods available for Starfield: unofficial user-made mods, typically found on Nexus, or the Bethesda-approved variety, found in the Creation Club. The latter costs money. You can buy Starfield Creation Credits to purchase these mods for:</p>



<ul>
<li>500 Creation Credits – $4.99</li>



<li>1000 Creation Credits – $9.99</li>



<li>2700 Creation Credits – $24.99</li>



<li>5500 Creation Credits – $49.99</li>
</ul>



<p>Alternatively, if you’d rather not pay for mods, which is a stance most will likely take, you can visit Nexus to download user-made mods entirely free. Some mod authors charge for their work, but they usually host them separately from Nexus, like on Discord or Patreon, and they’re upfront about the cost.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you’re a fan of RPGs, then you’ll want to keep an eye out for the Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred release date, too! While we patiently await the slew of new games launching this year, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft touched on the future of Gears, insisting “this isn’t the end of other ongoing stories in the Gears series.”</p><p>“The team is content with the stories told in Gears 4 and Gears 5 and is by no means abandoning them, but the collective passion for such an iconic origin story was simply too great to ignore,” Microsoft said. ”The story of E-Day and the origins of Marcus and Dom are such powerful, pivotal events that The Coalition couldn’t wait to tell it.”</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Gears 5 follow.</em></p><p>2019’s Gears 5 ends on something of a cliffhanger, with Kait telling Marcus Fenix she’s off to hunt down Queen Reyna. Beforehand, the player, aka Kait, decides to save either JD Fenix or Del, leaving Reyna to kill the other.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day, however, is set 14 years before the events of Gears of War 1, and tells the story of Emergence Day (the day the Locust burst out from under the earth to attack Sera).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Gears of War: E-Day Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p>In the Xbox Wire post, The Coalition creative director Matt Searcy and brand director Nicole Fawcette discussed the decision to make a prequel next, rather than the perhaps expected Gears 6. “We’re super proud about Gears 4 and Gears 5 and the stories that were told,” Fawcette said. “We’re not retreating from that storyline in any way. But in [this] moment, we had an opportunity to write our next step, and this one just felt too good to miss.”</p><p>In a follow-up interview with IGN, Searcy expanded on the decision. “For us, there is a story here for our studio of how we found our way to E-Day that was about reflection,” Searcy explained. “And part of it is just the energy that rolls up about, this was the story we wanted to tell at this time. So it wasn't really about picking between these things, it was just a snowball of the stuff that was on the table and this is the one we wanted to do right now.</p><p>“We love those characters. It's really nice to have a franchise where we can tell stories in different places. For us, this is just the one we wanted to work on now, this is the one that felt right.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The decision to go with a prequel was a topic of discussion when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-ign-live-interview-on-the-health-of-xbox-handhelds-and-more">IGN interviewed Xbox boss Phil Spencer at IGN Live</a>. Spencer said doing a prequel instead of Gears 6 is “a nice opportunity for that team to establish their Gears.”</p><p>“Following on Gears 5 just because of the numerical thing, I think it would just… this was an opportunity for them to take it back to an origin story that has a lot of real depth to it in terms of Emergence Day and tell that story through The Coalition as it is today,” Spencer said. “I thought, what a great opportunity. I was excited.”</p><p>The question, of course, is with Gears of War: E-Day in active development at The Coalition, it may be some time before Microsoft continues the overarching Gears storyline with a potential Gears 6. Some fans have suggested another team be handed the responsibility of continuing the story in partnership with The Coalition, but Microsoft has yet to indicate a willingness to do so.</p><p>Gears of War: E-Day is currently without a release window.

In already released promotional material for the game, we can see Rook as a Human. According to tweets from Bioware’s Mike Gamble, who is leading the next Mass Effect at the studio, you can also have your Rook be an Elf, Dwarf, or Qunari.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of course</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1799933097271771365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of course</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1799939933395923427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Another snippet of info from Gamble is confirmation that companion armor can be changed out, which is an important feature for fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Yes</p>— Michael Gamble (@GambleMike) <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1799932740768600438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>BioWare’s Dragon Age: The Veilguard reveal leans heavily on the cast of seven companions who join Rook on their adventure. Indeed Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s first trailer, shown off during Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase, introduces all seven companions. Here's the list, per publisher EA:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Bellara, a creative and romantic Veil Jumper obsessed with uncovering ancient secrets.</li><li>Davrin, a bold and charming Grey Warden who has made a name for himself as a monster hunter.</li><li>Emmrich, a necromancer of Nevarra's Mourn Watch who comes complete with a skeletal assistant, Manfred.</li><li>Harding, the dwarven scout, returns to the fray as a companion with her big heart, a positive outlook, and a ready bow – as well as unexpected magical powers.</li><li>Lucanis, a poised &amp; pragmatic assassin who descends from the bloodline of the House of Crows, a criminal organization renowned throughout Thedas.</li><li>Neve, a cynic fighting for a better future, both as a private detective and a member of Tevinter's rebellious Shadow Dragons.</li><li>Taash, a dragon hunter allied with the Lords of Fortune who lives for adventure and doesn't mind taking risks.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>BioWare previously confirmed that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be centered around these companions, prompting the name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay"><u>In an exclusive interview with IGN</u></a>, BioWare general manager Gary McKay revealed some more details on what to expect from The Veilguard, as well as explaining some of the logic behind the name change.</p><p>“One thing that’s important to remind fans is that every Dragon Age game is a new and different experience and this game, more so than ever, is about you and your companions – a group that you must rally to fight by your side,” McKay told IGN at the time. “...“In the end, it was most important for us to have a title that was authentic to the companions that are the heart of this adventure we’ve created."</p><p>The Veilguard has a fall 2024 release window, with a gameplay reveal set for June 11.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Offbrand Game's first title is the sequel to 2017's platform fighter Rivals of Aether</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Content studio Offbrand has branched out into games, having launched its publishing division Offbrand Games.</p>
<p>Announced at <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ludwig-announces-new-video-game-publisher-offbrand-games-ign-live-2024">IGN Live</a>, content creator Ludwig Ahgren shared that he was partnering with Jason "Thor" Hall, founder of independent studio Pirate Software.</p>
<p>Offbrand Games' first title is the sequel to Aether Studio's fighting platformer Rivals of Aether, which initially launched in 2017.</p>
<p>"I've seen many other creators wanting to create publishing houses, but what always gets me is seeing indie studios getting crushed by these publishers," said Hall.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to happen anymore. So I'm excited to do this and lead Offbrand Games in a direction where that doesn't happen."</p>
<p>Ahgren added: "The dream is for developers to focus on making the best game possible with all the time and resources, then I can hopefully show as many people as possible what the cool game they made is and have people play it."</p>
<p>Offbrand was founded in 2022 by Ahgren and Mogul Moves president Nick Allen.</p>
<p>"From the beginning, our goal was to deepen creator ties to game developers and create mutually beneficial partnerships for all involved," Allen wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rnickallen_big-day-of-announcements-at-offbrand-as-we-ugcPost-7205023119013519360-CtPb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android">LinkedIn</a>. "Over a year in the making, we're bringing that vision to life."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/10/cod-black-ops-6-is-always-online-even-for-campaign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In the tiniest of small print tucked away on a support page for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Activision has revealed that their latest COD will require an active internet connection to play any and all game modes, including the single player campaign.</p>
<p>Per Activision’s support page, this is for texture streaming, in an effort to keep install sizes down:</p>


<blockquote><p>To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</i> will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Smaller game installs might sound great, but… how small will it make the game? Well, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cross-gen-bundle/9p5hv0hvztsk">the Xbox store page</a> for Black Ops 6 puts it at a still eye-watering 309.85GB – a figure that is certainly subject to change.</p>
<p>It’s certainly a… unique reason for a game to be always online, though we have seen this technology used in the past. Microsoft Flight Simulator used streaming in of world assets to keep the initial game install size manageable with basic assets and then dynamically bring in regional terrain, landmarks and building types. These can also be loaded in in advance by users, and the dynamic cache size managed in the settings.</p>
<p>In recent years, Call of Duty has ballooned in size as more and more components are brought into the melting pot of game content. Campaign, multiplayer, Zombies and the standalone Warzone can all draw upon a shared pool of assets, and there’s also core assets shared between Black Ops Cold War, Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3. However, users have had control over installing and uninstalling additional data that each mode uses, potentially saving tens of GB from the total install size.</p>

<p>However, it’s still complete and utter bobbins that Black Ops 6 will require an online connection and cannot have a fallback mode for offline play. We’ll see if Activision can provide clarity on what happens here, as an internet outage could stop you from enjoying the game’s campaign. Will there be a provision for those with large enough storage to download the full package? It also means that, as with other online-only games, Black Ops 6’s campaign will now be beholden to Activision and Microsoft keeping the content servers online.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming out for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One and PC on 25th October, with a day one launch into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-new-biome-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have revealed what's coming as part of the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 update.</p>
<p>It looks like this update, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-release-date">set to arrive in August</a> alongside the game's console release, is going to be a very big one indeed, so even seasoned&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>players should have something new to look forward to.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4177730768830262249">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the 1.0 update is set to bring a new biome, the conclusion to the game's ongoing story arc, and a player-versus-player system, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-new-stuff-pvp.jpg?itok=E5kY9VD0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-new-stuff-pvp.jpg?itok=y6LT6P-U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to challenge your fellow&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>players to glorious combat? You'll soon be able to do just that.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you can look forward to a new world generation system that will not only let you customize your world's parameters, but also allow you to share world seeds with other players.</p>
<p>This being the full&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>experience, you can also expect the conclusion of the game's main story arc in the 1.0 release, as well as a new endgame biome called The Passage, which will be "full of hazardous flora and otherworldly fauna".</p>
<p>If you're looking to settle some grievances old-school-style in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, you'll also be pleased to know that a PvP system is being introduced in 1.0. You'll be able to toggle whether you want your world to be PvP-enabled or not.</p>
<p>New combat styles, Mage and Warlock, are also coming. The Mage style has you slinging spells from a distance, while the Warlock style is all about summoning minions and getting them to do your bidding.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't everything that's coming in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0. You can also look forward to new bosses, new equipment, new enemies, and plenty more, as well as tons of bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>To put it simply, it sounds like even if you feel like you've gotten everything that you possibly can from&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, this update could well make you change your mind.</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on August 27th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009534" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, Xbox, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/core-keeper-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. You can take a look at our very own Robert's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/core-keeper-is-promising-top-down-take-on-terraria">preview of the game</a> from way back in its Early Access days if you want a nostalgic trip down memory lane.</p>

It does not, usually, have anything to do with an internet connection.</p><p>The claim appears to be that they intend to stream textures across your internet in order to reduce the game’s already enormous install size on your hard drive. <em>CodBlops 6</em> is reported to take up almost 310 GB on an Xbox, which is already ludicrous—and this, it seems, is <em>without</em> its high-res textures.</p><p>Over a decade ago, various publishers—most especially Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft at the time—experimented with demanding always-on internet connections to be able to play a large range of single-player games. It was widely condemned, clearly put in place as some sort of anti-piracy measure, but utterly useless since pirated versions of the games would have the online checks removed. In other words, it was a feature that only achieved making official versions of games less functional than illegitimate downloads. The only people it negatively affected were those with unreliable internet connections.<br></p><p>The same is true today. <em>Call of Duty</em> has been pulling this  on PC players for a few years worth of releases now, despite PC HDDs and SSDs likely being <em>far </em>more vast than those on consoles. (The PC I’m writing this on has a total storage space across multiple drives of over 18 terabytes. My Xbox Series S has one terabyte.) This becomes even more starkly strange when you learn that the PC install size for <em>Blops 6</em> is 149 GB (or as low as 78 GB if you already have <em>COD HQ </em>and <em>Warzone</em> installed from previous games). But this year marks the first time the same online demands are being hoisted&nbsp;on console owners.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Activision to ask them how much install space is being saved by this scheme, and indeed for more details on how an internet connection is going to support the same streaming speeds for high-resolution textures that can be achieved between components inside the same machine. We’ve also asked how this might affect those with slow or unreliable connections (as is the case for the vast majority of the developing world, as well as rural areas of developed nations), and whether they will as a consequence not be able to play, or experience terrible texture pop-in.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-launch-date-trailer-will-premiere-june-12-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ManaGame/status/1800090583861690566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, the official Visions of Mana account announced that a launch date trailer is finally coming June 12, 2024.</p>



<p>According to today’s post, the trailer will premiere at 11:45 BST / 03:45 PDT. The YouTube premiere feature results in leaks now and then, but Square Enix only has some plot details in its description. </p>



<p>The trailer description doesn’t reveal anything new. It simply reiterates that “Val, the protagonist, and his childhood friend Hinna, the newly appointed Alm of Fire, set off on a journey to the Mana Tree.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Previously, Square Enix announced during the latest Xbox Developer Direct that Visions of Mana will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch in Summer 2024</a>. The new trailer for Visions of Mana will finally give fans a concrete date.</p>



<p>Many hoped that Visions of Mana was coming to Game Pass at launch, partly due to the Xbox site itself. Unfortunately, Square Enix revealed last January that Visions of Mana <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-not-releasing-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t coming to Game Pass</a>. A Microsoft spokesperson explained there are also no plans to do so.</p>



<p>Visions of Mana will mark the first mainline entry in over a decade, and centers on a festival in Tianeea, the Fire Village.</p>



<p>Square Enix first announced Visions of Mana during The Game Awards 2023. It will be available on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, including both current and last-gen consoles. </p>

Team Parabellum was acknowledged by Bungie as the Worlds First winners of the raid, as the group spent 19 hours exploring the high-level PvE event, cracked several tough puzzles, and eventually faced off against the Witness. Fittingly, this is the longest that it has taken a raid to be cleared, narrowly beating the infamous record set by Forsaken's raid, The Last Wish.</p><p>That victory also opened up one more mission in The Final Shape, Excision, allowing players from all over the world to band together to put the Witness down for good.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799413686727008747" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We have received reports that a fireteam has successfully completed the Salvation's Edge Raid and prevented the Witness's Final Shape.<br>Please stand by as we verify.<br>The Witness is retreating, but the battle isn't over yet... <a href="https://t.co/d5z3UkMGVn" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/d5z3UkMGVn</a></p>  — Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799413686727008747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Salvation's Edge proved to be an especially difficult and complex raid. In the rush to get the coveted Worlds First win, several teams streaming the raid began to mute their mics or took their stream offline entirely so that other teams couldn't copy their methods for clearing parts of the activity. Destiny legend Datto resorted to streaming just his face as the game went onto an audience of tens of thousands--and several fans complained about how these measures took some of the thrill out of watching teams complete what is arguably the most important raid in Destiny's history.</p><p>Fortunately, the unlocked Excision mission didn't disappoint, as this was open to all players following Team Parabellum's successful completion of Salvation's Edge. Excision, which plays like the climatic last stand of Avengers: Endgame, is a massive throwdown involving 12 players, the Vanguard, coalition forces, and even the Witch Queen herself, Savathun, in a last-ditch effort to take down the Witness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4316429-destiny2-2024_06_08-15_27_31.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316429" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4316429-destiny2-2024_06_08-15_27_31.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316429"></a><figcaption>All hands on deck.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4316429-destiny2-2024_06_08-15_27_31.png"></figure><p>Once that fight was over, players were treated to the true conclusion to The Final Shape and the last 10 years of Destiny, as well as a few subtle hints at where the franchise will head next now that the Witness is out of the picture.</p><p>Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape has been well received</a> since it launched last week, with the game's community commending the expansion for delivering a worthy finale after a decade of storytelling, expansions, and foreshadowing.</p><p>The rest of the year will see Bungie focus on Episodes, a trilogy of post-launch content that will unfold over the next year. <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1799426502766796903" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bungie also plans to provide further details</a> on the next year of Destiny 2 in a livestream, kicking off at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET today.</p>

<p data-characters="255" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">All 20 of England’s Premier League clubs are officially coming to <em>Football Manager</em>, with Sports Interactive announcing a multi-year agreement with the world’s most popular league to bring the clubs, logos, kits, and player photos to the game. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Starting with the 2024/25 season, the entire league will be officially represented in the game, meaning you no longer have to download logo packs to get their badges and kits added to your database. The move means that the top six divisions in the English football pyramid will be officially in the game, from the top flight all the way down to the Vanarama National League North and South. </p> <figure data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Official Premier League Licence coming to Football Manager" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rircYvbkhk0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">In the official blog post, Sports Interactive described the Premier League as “the pinnacle of domestic football,” stating that it’s “defined by iconic on-pitch events and memories spanning more than three decades,” with a manager behind each memorable moment, much like “every great <em>Football Manager</em> story.”</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true">“Whether you’re attempting to mastermind the futures of Liverpool or Arsenal, chase European football with Crystal Palace, or maximize Ipswich Town’s return to the big time, you’ll be immersed in English top-flight action like never before.”</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">The studio says that further information on the integration of the Premier League in <em>Football Manager</em> will come later in the year, suggesting that there’s more to this partnership than officially licensed clubs. </p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">As a long-time fan of the series, I am delighted to see this partnership, especially as my beloved Manchester United will no longer be called the horrific “Man UFC.” This happened in 2021 when United took legal action against Sports Interactive over complaints that the game infringed their trademark by using the club’s name without a license.</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="false">Of course, if you’ve been playing the game, you’ll have seen licensed Premier League teams in there already, after Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Manchester City agreed deals with the company. In the past, we’ve had to download logo packs created by fans of <em>Football Manager</em> and essentially mod the game to get our favorite Premier League teams in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>will require an internet connection at all times, even if you're just playing the game's single-player campaign, Activision has revealed.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official support page</a> for the game (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1799908841175281856" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Wario64</a>), Activision says that in order to "deliver the highest-quality visuals" for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, the game uses texture streaming, which is effectively a system by which textures are downloaded and streamed as required rather than loaded all at once.</p>
<p>As you've probably already spotted, however, texture streaming requires a constant internet connection, and so even if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s campaign mode or you're playing local multiplayer, you're going to need a stable online connection in order to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online-motorbike.jpg?itok=Ak_IKIC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online-motorbike.jpg?itok=Hp00um9s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't have a stable internet connection? Get outta here, says&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, needing an internet connection to play online with other players is understandable, but needing one for the campaign does feel a little off, even for the reason given.</p>
<p>Activision does, however, point out that you won't need an Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus subscription to play&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>'s campaign. You will need a subscription if you're playing multiplayer, though (unless you're on PC, of course).</p>
<p>On the same support page, Activision also clarifies its position on split-screen play in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Essentially, it'll be available on current-gen consoles but won't be on PS4 or Xbox One in order to "ensure performance integrity".</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>is the next game in both the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series and the&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>sub-series. As we <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">learned during yesterday's Xbox showcase</a>, it'll launch on October 25th across PC and consoles.</p>

<p>It'll be the first&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">available on Xbox Game Pass</a> on the day of its release, although depending on your Game Pass subscription, you may or may not be able to access certain elements of the game.</p>
<p>In essence, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can enjoy all of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>on their PC or console, as can Game Pass PC subscribers. Game Pass Console subscribers will only get access to the campaign, and Game Pass Core subscribers won't be able to access&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>via their subscriptions.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>launches on October 25th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cross-gen-bundle/9p5hv0hvztsk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

  <p id="2pU5cQ">Whether you’re out in the backyard grillin’ brats, at the local park flippin’ burgers, or floatin’ on a pontoon boat with a lovely vintage from Michigan’s wine country, there’s nothing quite like a good yard game. So who wants to play another round of bags? I mean... I do. That sounds great, actually.</p>
<p id="DCcg0m">But when I’m done playing bags, and before we wander off to wherever Dale saw that one dilapidated old Frisbee golf course, I’d like to try some new yard games. So I asked around the Polygon Slack for recommendations. Here’s what came back.</p>
<h2 id="unPX41"><strong>Ladderball</strong></h2>
<p id="ubsfox">Want to enjoy an easy tossing game with your friends and family that <em>doesn’t</em> require good aim? I got you. Ladderball is a simple and silly tossing game, but rather than individual balls or bean bags, it’s two balls connected with about six inches of rope between them. As such, when you toss the ball, it cartwheels through the air in a semi-unpredictable way (at least that’s what happens when I throw it, because I am terrible at throwing things in the direction I want to throw them).</p>
<p id="Wi7wcQ">To play the game, you set up the vertical ladders several feet apart, then split into two teams. My family usually plays one-on-one for fast games that allow plenty of time for snacks between rounds. One person from each team stands by one ladder as the teams alternate tossing their three balls at the other ladder, aiming for the highest rung. The string between the balls often wraps around one rung, but the game gets fun when you realize how easy it is to knock your pieces (or your opponent’s pieces) off the rungs. When that round is over, switch to the other ladder.</p>
<p id="G2PaqE">The top rung is worth three points, the middle is worth two, and the bottom is worth one. Most people play ladderball by seeing who can get to 10 points fastest. In addition to family-friendly fun, I also love this game because the balls are relatively soft, so it’s easy to play barefoot by the pool without worrying about getting lobbed. It’s also drunk-people-friendly, if that’s your thing. —<em>Zoë Hannah</em></p>

<p id="fWIycU">Kubb’s nickname, “Viking chess,” doubles as an elevator pitch. The lawn game — in which players stand on opposing sides of a rectangle, hurling batons at wooden pylons — mixes the strategy (if not quite the depth) of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games">heady board game peers</a> with the Scandinavian pleasure of smashing hard things together. As with many great yard games, the rules are tedious to explain, yet easy to grok by simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZisjpAlarhM">watching folks play</a>.</p>
<p id="3nh84L">With that in mind, think of kicking off a match of kubb like starting a dance party: The toughest part is getting the first person to join in. But once a couple of people start playing, expect friends and neighbors to ask for their turn to toss one stick at another one. As these newcomers munch on snacks and sink into the game, they’ll discover tactics, like where to position skulls on the field. Or whether to gamble on long shots or take easier short-distance targets. Matches can last minutes or hours, with power shifting within a few tosses of the baton.</p>
<p id="EX0DlA">There’s one other detail that helps kubb earn its Viking chess shorthand. It can be played entirely with one hand, perfect for those adults who enjoy a game best when carrying some mead. —<em>Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="78mVJ2">While the history of some beloved yard games goes back hundreds if not thousands of years, there’s one that sprang to life much more recently — circa 1989, in fact. I’m not talking about pickleball. In fact, I’m never talking about pickleball. Instead, I’m talking about Spikeball, also known as Roundnet.</p>
<p id="zkdYZR">Jeff Knurek is credited with creating Roundnet in 1989. In it, players gather near a round, trampoline-style net and spike a ball back and forth between two teams. The game is usually played 2v2 or 3v3. Either way, the action is fast and furious. Could you play the game seated with beer in hand? Sure, but it’s a lot more fun to tear it up barefoot on the beach and get a little silly as you’re able.</p>
<p id="a9s0y3">The entrepreneurs at Spikeball ran with the idea in the 2000s, leading to a successful appearance in 2015 on <em>Shark Tank</em>. (That’s when Daymond John got all excited and asked for 50% of the company. The deal ultimately fell apart.) Regardless, the marketing boost indirectly helped spur on interest in a professional circuit, and this summer you’ll likely see a few games played <a href="https://spikeball.com/pages/espn">on ESPN</a>. —<em>Charlie Hall</em></p>

</p>
<p id="448jJB">Wham-O, the same brand that first marketed the Hula-Hoop, cracked off another winner in <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1976/12/06/here-comes-tracball-direct-from-the-people-that-gave-us-hula-hoops">1976</a> with Trac-Ball, my personal favorite backyard game. The thing is... it’s not really a game. Technically it’s just a toy, but through trial and error I’ve turned it into a game — a game that I’m going to type out the rules of for the very first time today.</p>
<p id="7YOGe2">Trac-Ball is loosely based on jai alai, a sport where players use scoop-like cesta to hurl balls at speeds approaching 200 miles per hour on an indoor court. Trac-Ball uses similar biomechanics, but the wicker cesta is replaced with a light plastic racket with a toothed track inside. The ball is also much lighter and hollow. Get the arm motion just right and you can create an absolutely amazing amount of rotation on that little ball, lofting and curving its flight as you see fit.</p>
<p id="BafST2">My version of semi-organized Trac-Ball is a lot like Great Catch, a game that should be familiar to anyone who has ever played youth baseball. Basically, two players line up across from each other and try to make each other look as cool as possible catching the ball. Maybe you’re lofting the ball over your opponent’s head <em>just far enough away</em> that they can barely reach it before it hits the ground. Or maybe you’re curving it to such a degree that they must run headlong to the right or left to intercept it before it passes them. Or maybe you’re chucking it right at their chest, forcing them to post up and intercept the missile like a laser blast aimed at a Jedi. Matches go to 15, like a short game of volleyball, but with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140585/challengers-post-credits-scene-rules-of-tennis">tennis-like scoring</a>. That keeps the tension on until the very final few throws.</p>
<p id="R074ur">The only trick is that scoring is all based on the honor system. It’s up to you and your opponent to call out a bad toss and score it accordingly, or to note when you missed a catch that you should have had — no matter how graceful you thought you looked while attempting it. —<em>CH</em></p>

<p>As someone who plays Diablo 4 nearly daily, I’m always down for more content.

<p>With Xbox’s recent stance on launching its titles elsewhere, like on PlayStation 5, many fans hoped to see additional upcoming titles coming to Sony’s console. More specifically, they want Avowed on PS5. So, is it happening?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-avowed-releasing-on-playstation-5">Is Avowed Releasing on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Avowed isn’t coming to PS5—at least not initially. That could change in the future, as we saw titles such as Grounded and Sea of Thieves launch post-release on PlayStation 5, and they did exceptionally well with the console’s community. Plus, we know that Doom: The Dark Ages, an upcoming first-person shooter from the long-running franchise, is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PS5 simultaneously</a>. It leaves room for other exciting titles!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-avowed-release-on-xbox-game-pass">Will Avowed Release on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>I know that if you play on PlayStation 5, you’re likely upset at the news that Avowed isn’t coming to your favorite system. However, you’re in luck if you play video games on a PC or know someone with an Xbox Series X|S. Avowed launches on Xbox Game Pass simultaneously with the full release, meaning you can enjoy the upcoming RPG for a few bucks per month!</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing quite like owning your game. Perhaps one day, Obsidian’s RPG will come to PlayStation consoles!</p>



<hr>



<p>While we wait for Avowed, there are plenty of upcoming RPGs, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-war-within-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/supercell-theres-no-reason-why-there-arent-more-mobile-games-at-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Studio tells us how Ken Jeong in a chicken suit helped secure a rare trailer slot for latest hit Squad Busters</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Supercell believes there's room for more mobile games to be highlighted during events like Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>The Finnish developer was the only company to have a mobile-only game featured during this year's showcase on Friday, with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzwh4N3qfcY&amp;t=6332s">star-studded live-action trailer</a> for Squad Busters promoting its most recent hit.</p>
<p>However, the studio's marketing boss Rob Lowe tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> that the organisers of Summer Game Fest were reluctant to include the game at first.</p>
<p>"It wasn't easy," he says. "Geoff [Keighley, founder and host] was like, 'We don't really do that.' They'd done a bit on Genshin Impact but that's on console as well. They hadn't really done much with mobile-only games, they were about reticent [about it]."</p>
<p>Lowe adds that Supercell's request was aided by a video by actor and comedian Ken Jeong, dressed as the chicken from the studio's mobile game Hay Day (as he appears in the Squad Busters trailers), talking to the camera about Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>"I think that played into Geoff's ego quite nicely, so he was like, 'Alright, we'll put you in.' We still paid for the privilege obviously."</p>
<p>Given that mobile accounts for around half of the global games market's revenues, Lowe asserts that it's important for mobile-only games to be part of the same discussions as console and PC titles, which tend to be the focus of events like Summer Game Fest and the various Not-E3 showcases happening over the past few days.</p>
<p>"We see ourselves as a company that want to take similar track to what Nintendo does in console gaming, but in mobile gaming," said Lowe. "The way we make our games, the way we market our games... it's something that's very dear to me. It just so happens that a phone is a console that everyone has in their pocket.</p>
<p>"There's no reason why it should not be able to have some of the greatest games showcased alongside games that you happen to play on a PC and console – and you'll probably soon be able to play all those on a smartphone anyway with all the streaming services that Netflix and Xbox are working on."</p>
<p>Released on May 29, Squad Busters is a multiplayer action game that gathers characters from all of Supercell's previous titles, including Hay Day, Clash of Clans. It has already been downloaded more than 30 million times and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/squad-busters-generates-11m-at-launch">generated $1.1 million at launch</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have a full interview with Supercell later in the week.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-release-date-leaked-by-obsidian-following-xbox-showcase.896676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-release-date-leaked-obsidian<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian has accidentally leaked the&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>release date, and the studio's latest RPG, which is set in the&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>universe, is heading to PC and Xbox in November.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/avowed-story-trailer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> released following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">Xbox showcase yesterday</a>, Obsidian accidentally let slip that&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>will be launching on November 12th, information that wasn't revealed during the aforementioned presentation.</p>
<p>That information was quickly scrubbed from the post, but not before X (formerly Twitter) user HazzadorGamin <a href="https://x.com/HazzadorGamin/status/1799950020038504727" rel="noopener" target="_blank">managed to grab a snapshot</a> of the original paragraph in all its release date-containing glory.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-release-date-leaked-combat.jpg?itok=38n43LBD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-release-date-leaked-combat.jpg?itok=3f7DHVEi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>is coming in November, if Obsidian itself is to be believed.</figcaption></figure><p>In the original wording, Obsidian says that since its RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-2024-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">shown during January's Xbox presentation</a>, the studio has been "busy with&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>getting it ready for release on November 12th, 2024".</p>
<p>However, the article has now been updated to simply read "we've been busy with&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>", with all mention of the release date having been excised.</p>
<p>If this release date is legitimate and no delays are planned, it's a little odd that Microsoft and Xbox didn't decide to announce it during yesterday's showcase, when a story trailer for&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>was shown.</p>
<p>Given that the release date was scrubbed, it's clear Obsidian and Microsoft aren't ready to announce it yet, but I suppose it won't be long before we learn this info officially, even if it is strange that it was omitted from yesterday's trailer.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, it's a first-person fantasy RPG developed by&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity&nbsp;</em>studio Obsidian, and it takes place in the world of&nbsp;<em>Eora</em>, just like&nbsp;<em>Pillars&nbsp;</em>does.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avowed-revealed">in 2020</a>, the game will feature a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/watch-more-avowed-gameplay-as-obsidian-shares-more-details">range of combat options</a>, including melee weaponry, pistols, and magic, and will also offer several companions to the player, each with their own individual combat specialities.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/avowed-story-companion-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed yesterday</a>,&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>'s story will have you investigating the Dreamscourge, a "mysterious plague of the soul" that transforms victims into fungal husks.</p>
<p>You'll have to track the Dreamscourge to its source, all while navigating tensions between the locals and the empire of Aedyr, from which you hail.</p>
<p><em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed/9nhrdqvfpq34" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> this year. No official release date has yet been given, but it looks like we can expect the game to arrive on November 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p id="Ll2jUX">These “Alone in the Dark” missions are fairly straightforward. The first step of finding the Ghost can be marked on your HUD to make it much easier to track. Follow the marker until you see <strong>Near Objective </strong>pop up on the left of your screen. Once you get to the Ghost’s location, you’ll need to look around for the <strong>orange glow </strong>of the injured Ghost.</p>

<p id="vI636L">Once you find it, you’ll be tasked with <strong>opening Overthrow chests</strong> in the closest region to where you found the Ghost. Overthrow is the Pale Heart’s equivalent of public events, so head to the location indicated, then find and complete Overthrow events.</p>
<p id="gGkbJE">Each time you complete an event, <strong>a chest will spawn.</strong> Opening a chest adds a percentage of progress to the meter; the higher the level the more progress you gain. I started an Overthrow from near the beginning of Level 1 and had all the progress I needed before finishing Level 3.</p>

<p id="YVpVWD">There are a handful of different boss encounters here, but they all work relatively similarly. Enter the boss arena, break crystals or blights to draw out the boss, and then deal damage to the boss. Once it loses a third of its health, it will gain a shield and you’ll need to repeat the first step to break it.</p>

<p id="xmrQre">Once the work of unlocking a Paranormal Activity location by completing the corresponding “Alone in the Dark” quest is done, the event itself is very simple. Bear in mind, that you can only complete whichever Paranormal Activity is currently active on your map.</p>

<p id="YCirkQ">To begin, highlight the event on your map and follow the indicator to the location. There you’ll find a glowing blue orb in a circle that you can commune with. Interact with it and you’ll get the <strong>Aura of Balance </strong>for two minutes.</p>
<p id="5w594F">You might have spotted some strange blue and orange cubes around the Pale Heart, but you’ll need to wait until they are active before you can interact with them. This is where the Paranormal Activity event comes in.</p>
<p id="4p7QCO">The goal here is to link two cubes, the Light one (with blue circles on it) and the Dark one (with orange triangles on it). You do this by <strong>shooting each cube with the appropriate damage type. </strong>Shoot the blue cube with a Light weapon, and the orange cube with a Dark weapon.</p>
<p id="Bs0s8X">You’ll first need to find somewhere you can stand where you can see both cubes at the same time. This is mostly very simple, but there are a couple of tricky ones.</p>
<hr id="fzt7YB">

<p id="6rXVWd">Here are all 11 Paranormal Activity locations, with screenshots of the cubes and descriptions of how to find them.</p>
<p id="xIwP5m">The order in which these appear seems to be different for each person, so I’ve put them in order from west to east on the map. You might need to hop back and forth through this list to find the ones you need; if useful, the top of this guide contains a drop-down table of contents to help you navigate each location easier.</p>

<p>I was hoping to see a handful of announcements during the Xbox Games Showcase, and one of those was the Avowed release date. Unfortunately, it didn’t happen. But there’s still good news for fans of the upcoming RPG. So, without further ado, do we know the Avowed release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-avowed-coming-out">When is Avowed Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, we do know the Avowed release date. The upcoming RPG launches on PC and Xbox Series X|S on <strong>November 12, 2024</strong>, with a day-one release on Game Pass. However, the studio quickly scrubbed the leak, so the date may change in the coming months.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t glean this information from the recent story trailer, which was awesome in its own right. Apparently, the studio didn’t mean to announce the game’s release date, but it was leaked following the show. Of course, we did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report on the leak</a>!</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>I have to say, with a release date in mind and the overall improved gameplay we saw during the Xbox Games Showcase trailer, I’m even more excited for Obsidian Entertainment’s next game. It looks phenomenal, and I don’t know about you, but I could use a new story-driven RPG in my life while we wait for The Elder Scrolls VI!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-do-we-know-about-the-avowed-gameplay">What Do We Know About the Avowed Gameplay?</h2>



<p>We’ve seen quite a bit of the Avowed gameplay to date. The first instance, last year, truly did not impress anyone. The combat looked clunky and awkward, and it gave many fans pause. But this year, Obsidian Entertainment came with the fire during the Xbox Games Showcase. They’ve revamped the gameplay, and it shows!</p>



<p>In Avowed, you’ll take up arms and fight fantasy creatures your way. Like a traditional fighter, you can wield a sword and shield, mix and match dual swords, utilize spells and firearms to ensure you remain a safe distance from enemies, and so much more. Then, of course, companions help you in a pinch.</p>



<p>All the while, you’ll find yourself exploring fantastical landscapes full of mystery and wonder. It’s an alien world that begs for an adventurer!</p>

<p>One of the most thrilling reveals from the Xbox Games Showcase—and there were many—was Doom: The Dark Ages. It launches sometime in 2025, and features everyone’s favorite Doom Guy but sent back in time to medieval ages. But more importantly, is Doom: The Dark Ages on PS5?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-doom-the-dark-ages-on-ps5">Can You Play Doom: The Dark Ages on PS5?</h2>



<p>Alongside PC and Xbox Series X|S, Phil Spencer confirms Doom: The Dark Ages will launch simultaneously on PlayStation 5. Their goal, specifically id Software, is to ensure the first-person shooter franchise remains available to all players, no matter their system.</p>



<p>On the topic, Spencer said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>DOOM is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms… It’s a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. When I was in a meeting with Marty a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms. Simple as that.”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s becoming less necessary to own a specific console to play your favorite titles. This decision will likely have repercussions on the industry, but it’s still early days.</p>







<h2 id="h-doom-games-in-chronological-order">Doom Games in Chronological Order</h2>



<p>In case you want to catch up on the franchise before the upcoming release of Doom: The Dark Ages, here’s a rundown of the mainline entries in chronological order:</p>



<ul>
<li>Doom (1993)</li>



<li>Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994)</li>



<li>Final Doom (1996)</li>



<li>Doom 64 (1997)</li>



<li>Doom 3 (2004)</li>



<li>Doom (2016)</li>



<li>Doom: Eternal (2020)</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re not accustomed to the old-school graphics of the original titles, there’s nothing wrong with starting your Doom adventure in 2016’s reboot!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/grit-and-valor-1949-is-strategy-gamers-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take the positional tactics of&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach, </em>the weapon triangle system of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fire-emblem-engage-review"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>, and some roguelite elements for good measure, and you'll find that the concoction brewed from this unlikely combination makes for an absolute banger -- that game is&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949.</em></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of stumbling upon&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949&nbsp;</em>by happenstance during The Mix in LA, and as a lover of all things strategy and tactics, I am hooked.</p>

<p>The concept for&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949&nbsp;</em>is simple enough, but its complexity soon becomes apparent as you fight through alternate history Europe -- in a world where World War II never ended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fights take place on charming, diorama-like battlefields and your squad of mechs are dropped into position. One of these mechs is technically your base that must be protected as you fight waves of enemies, dropping every 30 seconds or so.</p>
<p>It's up to you to stop these waves of enemy soldiers and mechs, and I soon got addicted to the strategic element of positioning my units to properly counter the attacks.</p>

<p>There's a weapon triangle of sorts, akin to&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem</em>. Your units have certain damage types -- like one that spews fire -- and that counters enemies using explosives. Explosive units counter ballistic-using mechs, so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The layer of strategy deepens when you throw in pilot abilities. Pilots operate these mechs, and each operator comes with their own ability. You can mix and match the pilot and mech, so many combinations are possible and adds so much more depth.</p>
<p>Optional objectives in maps grant a permanent currency that can be used for upgrades that permeate throughout your runs, so failure does not mean total defeat. You can go back to base, upgrade your metal hulks and their abilities, and go at it again.</p>

<p>Outside of that, you'll unlock temporary upgrades exclusive to your current run, so after each victory, you're granted a reward that should aid in your liberation of&nbsp;Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll fight across Europe in&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949</em>, so there are individual zones with their own unique identity. Scandinavia, for instance, introduces elevation, so now players will have to fight for a height advantage on top of tackling waves of enemy units.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything about&nbsp;<em>Grit and Valor - 1949</em>&nbsp;is hitting the right notes. TechRaptor Editor-in-Chief Andrew Otton says this has potential to be big among <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/strategy?page=0,4">strategy</a> and tactics gamers, and as I fall into that demographic -- I wholeheartedly agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox chief Phil Spencer has confirmed that more Xbox games will be available on other platforms in the future.</p>



<p>It’s been a wild past few months for Xbox, with rumors of its first-party games coming to other platforms. First, rumors started to swirl that one, then two, and eventually, all of Xbox’s first-party games would be coming to other platforms. After weeks of rumors seemingly increasing the scope of this change in strategy, Xbox finally addressed the rumors in a business podcast. After confirming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-announces-four-xbox-games-coming-to-other-consoles-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four games would jump ship to other platforms</a>, Phil Spencer said this was “not a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy.” But just a few months later, that strategy has seemingly been flipped on its head.</p>



<p>During a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIpMhthwnto&amp;ab_channel=IGN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First interview</a>, Spencer again addressed the neverending rumors, but with a completely different answer from the first time. “You are going to see more of our games on more platforms, and we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we’re building, and we see that from players, and the players love to be able to play,” Spencer said.</p>



<p>The answer was a complete 180 from the one from a few months back, and while company plans always change, Xbox’s strategy is still unclear in the grand scheme of things. Apparently, all of these decisions are part of Xbox’s “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Latitude</a>,” which, as far as the most recent rumors go, consists of games being “considered” for rival platforms. So, basically, Project Latitude doesn’t mean much to anyone until the green light has been given on said games, including the players and the developers behind the games.</p>



<div><p>This is where we’re at with the confusion around Xbox and the rumors surrounding it. It’s quite blatantly obvious that some people at Xbox are divided, too, and have resorted to feeding (often inaccurate or incomplete) information to journalists and content creators to stir the pot. It’s clear that Xbox has at least one unhappy bunny in the know of these decisions, and Xbox leadership needs to get a firm grip on what it wants to do.</p><p>Where this lands for Xbox is anyone’s guess. Personally, I don’t really care. But this first-party to other platforms saga needs to end with direct answers. What games will be available on other platforms? When will they be coming? And how much will they cost?</p><p>Fin.</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-ign-live-interview-on-the-health-of-xbox-handhelds-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Hot on the heels of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, CEO Phil Spencer sat down with IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey at IGN Live 2024 to run through what some have called the best video game showcase in years.</p><p>The reveal included fresh looks at upcoming big hitters in Xbox’s now enormous arsenal of franchises following its $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Xbox mainstays Gears of War, Fable, and Perfect Dark were joined by the likes of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Diablo... all these huge series got their time to shine. It was a blistering showcase focused squarely on the games, and based on initial feedback online, the games looked good.</p><p>But Microsoft's showcase has hit the headlines during one of the most troubling times for Xbox in recent memory. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">Microsoft announced 1,900 staff would lose their jobs across its gaming business</a>, and then came <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the shock closure of Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a> as part of devastating cuts at Bethesda. Is any studio, regardless of critical or commercial acclaim, safe?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft faces <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore">difficult questions about the future of Xbox consoles</a>, which have seen sales plummet year-on-year, as well as an apparent struggle to grow subscription service Game Pass. Microsoft is bringing even more of its games to rival platforms with the announcement that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Doom: The Dark Ages will launch on PlayStation 5</a> alongside Xbox Series X and S and PC. When it comes to Xbox, the times certainly are changing.</p><p>During our interview, Spencer discussed all this and more. Read on for the complete IGN Live interview with Phil Spencer.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I think you just had the best showcase you've ever had. I said it before you got here.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Thank you, Ryan.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> It really was fantastic. Now I know you plan these things months and months in advance. For anybody that doesn't know, planning for this starts like the beginning of the year. So I'm curious, at what point do you, with this one this year, do you get a feeling that, oh, this one's looking pretty good?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Honestly, until our fans, the customers, you guys give us the feedback… Aaron Greenberg and I were talking about this two weeks ago. The thing that probably hit me the most was obviously just the passion of the teams of putting their amazing work on stage and seeing so many teams do great work. But it was, I'd say two months ago, when I just looked at the scale of the franchises, how much work the teams were doing to show up in the way they did and the partners that we had in the show. I was in awe of the show.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> There's a couple games I want to ask you about specifically before we'll talk about some other stuff too. For me, of all the great stuff from today, stole the show for me was something I wasn't expecting to see today again, which was Perfect Dark.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I knew you were going to say that! </p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Perfect Dark, a first-person spy espionage, some parkour, a little Mirror's Edge in there, which I love. </p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> All playable, all in-game.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And that game's been cooking for a long time.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It has. Our partners at Crystal [Dynamics] have been doing amazing work there.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> So what has it been like for you to follow the very long trajectory of that game from, that started with Darrell Gallagher starting a studio [The Initiative].</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Just down the street.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And now we're finally here. So how has it been getting to this point with Perfect Dark?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> In parallel, building a studio while you're building a game, and something that Perfect Dark back to N64 and obviously us with PDZ on 360, like there's just such anticipation for that game, and I really appreciate everybody's patience because we've been talking about this for a long time. And my team can verify this - when I saw it, I said, this is the one that Ryan's going to love. Because we know his love for spy and I said, this is the one. I’m just so proud of the team and it really just came together so well.</p><p>A cool little story: Darrell had our other studio heads down at the studio just yesterday and walked through that same section in-game to show them, this is a game being played. And I love seeing our community of creators coming together that way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> The one more thing, which we were all hoping for and got was a new Gears of War game, but it wasn't Gear 6!</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It was not!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You have a visibility into everything, but I'm curious, when you're in a meeting with, maybe it's Matt Booty, maybe it's Alan Hartman, but The Coalition folks, but when you learn they've gone down the E-Day road, the prequel road rather than Gears 6, what was your reaction when you found out that that was going to be the next direction for Gears of War?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Well you know this, we've had some changes in leadership at the studio. Rod [Fergusson], who was there, is now leading Diablo for us. So I actually thought - a Diablo game I'm playing a ton of - I thought it was a nice opportunity for that team to establish their Gears. Following on Gears 5 just because of the numerical thing, I think it would just… this was an opportunity for them to take it back to an origin story that has a lot of real depth to it in terms of Emergence Day and tell that story through The Coalition as it is today. I thought, what a great opportunity. I was excited.</p><p>And then you probably saw, I know you heard it, the Mad World tune, for those of us who remember the 360 commercial, how iconic was that? So when they went back and sourced that and brought that through the piece, I think it just showed that they stayed true to what Gears is, but tell a new story, a new arc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Now you're wearing a very cool Xbox Pride shirt today, but a year ago at the Xbox Showcase, you freaked out people like me by wearing a Hexen shirt, which is a game that I have very near and dear to my heart. You had just acquired Hexen. You own that as a part of many other things. But then today I see the reveal for Doom: The Dark Ages, and I go, wait a second…</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> How awesome was that?</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> … are you secretly making a Hexen game in the Doom universe? I know you and I share the love for this.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah. No, I would like to say I'm actually smart enough to predict anything like that. I wasn't. But definitely if you look at Doom: The Dark Ages, and thanks to Marty [Stratton] and the team they let me introduce that. I was going through all my old-school stories, for those as old as me who remember it's Doom 1 on a floppy. My only PC that could run it was my PC at Microsoft. So I would sneak in at night, put it in so I could play. So the opportunity to stand there and get to announce a Doom, and then Doom: The Dark Ages, which definitely has some Hexen in it, and I just thought, Hugo [Martin] and the team, fantastic work. I'm so proud.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Now I can't help but bring up something that's been a topic of conversation a lot recently, which is that Doom: The Dark Ages is also going to ship on PS5, something that you've done with some other games. So from a business level, can you walk me through… you paid $7.5 billion to acquire Bethesda / ZeniMax. So what's the calculus? What's the process there for deciding, okay, new Doom, let's keep it multi-platform as it has been rather than just put it on Xbox? So what's the thought process there?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Well, on Doom, it's definitely one of those franchises that has a history on so many devices. I think they have Doom running on a lawnmower somewhere. It's a franchise that I think everybody deserves to play. And to be honest, I was in a meeting with Marty and the team a couple of years ago and I asked Marty what he wanted to do and he said he wanted to ship it on all platforms. I said, let's go do that. It was as simple as that.</p><p>Now I want to bring it back though, because I get a lot of questions about, hey, if I'm an Xbox owner, what does it mean? And what I want to say - and I thought it showed up so well in the show today - you saw an amazing collection of games that are coming to Xbox. They're going into Game Pass day one, and Game Pass showed up so well. If you buy the game on our console, you get to play it on PC. So the cross-entitlement stuff is all there.</p><p>And we're focused on future hardware with forward compatibility. Our commitment to our Xbox customers is you're going to get the opportunity to buy or subscribe to the game. We're going to support the game on other screens, and you are going to see more of our games on more platforms. And we just see that as a benefit to the franchises that we're building. And we see that from players and the players love to be able to play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You haven’t really commented publicly much in the last couple months, so I wanted to ask you about the studio closures and Tango Gameworks and some of the thoughts behind the decision-making there. I mean, you had a critical darling in Hi-Fi Rush. You had folks like Aaron Greenberg saying it checked all these boxes for us and did all the right things here. So walk me through the decision of why really Tango specifically, not to disrespect the other studios that were closed, but that was the one that really seemed to kind of stick in the community's craw a bit. I'm hoping here that you can take the opportunity to address that closure and some of the recent changes in Xbox.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah, the closure of any team is hard, obviously on the individuals there, hard on the team. And I try to spend all of my focus, as you said, I haven't been talking publicly about this, because right now is a time for us to focus on the team and the individuals. It's obviously a decision that's very hard on them and I want to make sure through severance and other things that we're doing the right thing for the individuals on the team. It's not about my PR, it's not about Xbox PR, it's about those teams.</p><p>In the end, I've said over and over, I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow. And that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make. We will continue to go forward, we will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox and build the best business that we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> On the Activision Blizzard saga…</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> You call it a saga?</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Well, just from covering it and watching it it felt like it put five years on my life to somebody that covers Xbox. I can't imagine how it was for you. But as that came to a close and you started integrating Activision Blizzard King into Xbox Studios, has that changed the way that you think about running the business at all? Because the organization just got quite a bit larger almost overnight in a sense.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> No. I mean we're still, and I hope we showed this today, we're going to be about building great games for people to play, about giving them choice on Xbox to go play. We've got a broader library of games. The thing I'm starting to see, which I really love, is the organic collaboration between our teams that are coming out and trying to build that community of creators that, I mean, you and I will go back to the time of Xbox where we basically had four games: Fable, Forza, Gears, Halo. And we would just literally, every four years I would have to come to E3 and I'd somehow try to make those four games seem different every year for the community.</p><p>And now what we have in gaming is just an amazing collection of teams and franchises that are doing great work. I feel an added responsibility as somebody who loves this industry for the franchises that show up on our stage. But I still think in the end it's about putting amazing games out. I'm really proud of the work that Ninja Theory did with Hellblade and the response to that. And we have an amazing internal team now that's focused on us doing a bunch of Unreal games as an example. And then you see things like South of Midnight, which might've been my game of the show, I thought it looked so good, you got Perfect Dark, you have Gears.</p><p>So for us, as the organization gets bigger, I think it's just more important that we can take bets together and try to do innovative, creative things, and that will continue to drive us.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I'm really proud of the work that Ninja Theory did with Hellblade and the response to that.</p></div><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Phil, you and I in the past have talked a lot about the past of Xbox because there's a lot of great memories. But the present, as we saw today on the Xbox Game Showcase is great. The future looks super promising here, and the Xbox business has changed dramatically.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It has.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And so when you make an almost $70 billion acquisition, do you start hearing from your bosses more? Or are they still staying out of your way and letting you run the business? Because that's not an insignificant amount of money to spend on growing the business.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> It's definitely not an insignificant amount of money! No. The support we get from the company, and my boss is the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella. Hey, Satya. We are given a ton of leeway to go and run and grow our business. But I'll say the thing that we challenge ourselves to do is to try to do new things. </p><p>If I go back eight years ago, we said, hey, we're going to go ship all of our games on PC and console, and if you buy one on one, you get it on the other. And I got some reaction from people of, this is the worst decision ever. This is going to be the end of Xbox. We announced Game Pass and we started doing Game Pass, and I know some people looked at that and said, oh, you're going to teach people that games are free and you're going to undermine the value in games.</p><p>And what I can say sitting here today from our decisions on cloud, on Game Pass, on console, right now we have more Xbox console users than we've ever had in the history of Xbox. And even when I look at things like the impact of Game Pass, because I watch that and I love Game Pass, how it showed up in the show today I think was fantastic. But we also want people to be able to buy games. So I go back and I look and I say, okay, over the last five years, what's happened to game sales on our platform? We're up double digits every year over the last five years on game sales, on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Doing a $70 billion acquisition will push us to try to do more. It'll push us on cloud, it'll push us to go find customers in new places, continue to think about access to amazing games, enabling creators to do great work. But I actually think for the team, that's just a self-motivation that the team has and it's fun to be a part of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Black Ops 6 day one Game Pass.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Some people said I wouldn't do that.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Most people in this room have probably been used to spending 60, 70 bucks on it every year. Now if they're already subscribing to Game Pass they’re good to go.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> But it's a choice. We didn't say to anybody, you have to subscribe to play. If you want to buy Black Ops, great. It's great for us, it's great for the developer. If you want to subscribe, it's also great. I want to give you the choice on how you play your games and who you play with and not try to do slimy platform things to force you to do what I want you to do. Give the players choice and what they want to do and who they play with.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/gettyimages-1259162567-1717983863325.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Phil Spencer: Photo by Loren Elliott/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> So the Activision Blizzard thing, we watched it play out in courtrooms.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> With my tie on!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I'm curious, what was the biggest unexpected challenge for you and the team at Xbox during the course of that?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> For the management team like Sarah Bond, Lori Wright, Linda Norman, who's our lead lawyer at Xbox, we all had our same job of running Xbox and doing the things that we needed to go do. Matt Booty. But then we actually added this second job in the time of having to work through regulatory.</p><p>It's my fault as the head of the business, I didn't really internalize that in the beginning of what a drain that would be on the team. And I think we saw that. I think we saw it in our execution on a couple things that we were doing multiple things at that time that we hadn't planned for. And I'll say it's really nice to be post the acquisition working with those amazing teams. I mean, how they showed up in our show today… fantastic. I just thought it was great. I mean, we had World of Warcraft in an Xbox show. It's just crazy.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Was there ever a point in the process, because it really, between the CMA and the FTC and all these places, was there ever a point where you thought, oh, this might not happen, this might get rejected?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Well, we always have to plan for all contingencies. We consider everything. You have to in running the business. But we felt like we were on the side of right, meaning we weren't doing this so we could pull Call of Duty from PlayStation players. It was never in our plan. I mean, I think my whole inbox leaked on the internet, so if anybody wanted to find that that was the plan, you would find it somewhere and it wasn't there.</p><p>So we believed we were in the right on getting this deal done, so we stayed convicted. But there were dark days, like when the CMA came out and said, no, this isn't going to go through. And the drag on the teams, the teams at Activision, Blizzard and King, they're dealing with this uncertainty. So it's so nice to have it behind us, and now we can just focus on building great games together.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We love that we have so many PC players, more than we've ever had. Our console's doing so well.</p></div><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> On that topic, we talk about all these huge changes to not just the industry, but again, specifically your business, the Xbox business over the last five or so years. What is today as we sit here now, what's the thesis statement? What's the modus operandi for Xbox today, and how has it changed over the last five years?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah, I see some of the feedback that our messaging from some people that maybe our messaging hasn't been consistent, and I always hear the feedback and I take it. Feedback is great. I will say from early on, we would say, when everybody plays, we all win. How do we get in a place where everybody can play video games? And we've made different progress on PC. Now PC is a huge business for us. We love that we have so many PC players, more than we've ever had. Our console's doing so well.</p><p>But I think if you sit back and you try to frame this industry through the lens of the tradition of who sold a console today, and that's the only solution to making gaming better, I think Xbox is doing something different than that. We love our consoles, we love our PC players, but really it's about creators and players and amazing games coming to them.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> It has, admittedly, for all of us, creators, players, it has been a weird generation because it started weird in this pandemic. And I'm curious, would you do anything differently in this Xbox Series generation if you could go back and tell yourself?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I'm not really a regrets guy. There's a hundred decisions I made that, yeah, in hindsight, maybe I would make it different with all the data. But you got to just bet. You got to bet on yourself and bet on the teams, have a vision of what you're trying to do. When you get punched in the face, you get back up and you try to go do things. So I'm not really one who looks back and say, I wish I would've done this or that. If you're in a position like this, with the team that we have, you just have to believe and you have to keep pushing forward and take the feedback from amazing customers that talk to us every day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Has the calculus changed? You spoke to Game Pass and how much of the value proposition has increased after today even. But has the calculus changed on how much Game Pass subscriptions are valued at Microsoft versus direct sales? Because when Game Pass started, it was, wow, this sounds really cool, and you've pledged to put every first-party release in there. And at the beginning there weren't a lot of those, but now you're almost like you had a whole show full of them. So what is that metric for success? How does Game Pass influence the success of the business?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> The thing I look at every morning is how many people played on our platforms and how long did they play? If they played through the subscription or they paid for their games, or they're playing a free-to-play game, honestly, that's not the most important thing.</p><p>So Game Pass, I love it. The thing I really love about Game Pass in our show today, a game like Mixtape. Nathan Vella [co-head of Annapurna Interactive] and I can have a conversation and say, with a team that's been in Game Pass before, when you think about the studio behind it, they had great success, now we're going to do a second game. Or Winter Burrow, another just awesome game that we can go invest in.</p><p>And Game Pass gives us an ability... you can go invest in Call of Dutys and Diablos all day, and we love that, but you also get to invest in new things that come out, and we just think that's a really important part of the equation.</p><p>Game Pass is up double digits. PC is growing really well, cloud's growing really well. But if somebody decides they want to buy their games and build their library, peace. There’s no, we need to turn everybody into this or that. We just want people to play.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Events</h3></div></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I want to talk about Fallout for a second. So you guys are currently having an awesome pop culture moment. But I can't help think about that a year or two ago I was sitting with Todd Howard with a camera rolling, and I asked him, well Fallout 5, you want to do that yourself? Or maybe now there's all these Xbox studios, you could maybe have some help with it. And he said, no, that's mine. I’m going to direct that.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Todd likes his things!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> But Fallout, I would argue, is Xbox's biggest cultural moment in quite a while.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Outside of gaming, yeah.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> And so after the TV show blows up and there'll be a season two, and I'm sure it'll probably keep going past that, do you talk to Todd about like, you can't stop The Elder Scroll 6 and say go do Fallout 5, but you have all these studios. Do you have a conversation about, well, how can we do a big new Fallout while the iron's really hot here with the TV show?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> Yeah. I'll just say that Todd's recognized the success of the television show on his own. He doesn't need me to kind of go and… It is amazing to see how gaming is now playing such a role all up in pop culture. As an old comic nerd, I go back 10 years and it seemed like every Hollywood thing came from the comics. And now you see video games, and this art form that we've loved for so long, whether it's the Mario Movie, Last of Us, Fallout show, you see our creatives in our industry being recognized for the worlds and storytelling that they can go do.</p><p>For us specifically, Fallout's been amazing. And yeah, Todd's looking at the plans on what he's doing. I'm not going to get into it, but I'll say Todd has recognized the success on his own and is thinking through what that means.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I guess while we're on the subject, have you seen The Elder Scroll 6 lately? I know you get to take a look at a lot of stuff.</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I'll refrain from comment!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> I think we all know what you mean by that! Well ask Todd to, you know… We're waiting here, pal!</p><p>There's one other thing I wanted to ask you about that I thought we actually might hear something about from you - I mean, you had a great show, I'm not complaining - but I thought, well, there's something that's been rumored, that's been talked about. And that is an Xbox handheld. You've been building the business around this mantra of, go where the players are, whether it's on PC…</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> So we should have handheld? I think we should have a handheld, too!</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You want to say anything about that?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> No, I don't want to say anything! You'll have to have Sarah Bond on, our president of Xbox, who is awesome. But the future for us in hardware is pretty awesome. And the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about it.</p><p>Today was about the games. We showed some of our gen nine console Series S, Series X, the work that we're doing. But we will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring 'em to you.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> Hypothetically, if Microsoft did an Xbox gaming handheld PC device, would it be a Steam Deck-like dedicated piece of hardware that I can play offline, or would it be something I would need a wifi connection to stream things from?</p><p><strong>Phil Spencer:</strong> I’ll put it this way: I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go - fantastic - my Steam Deck. I think being able to play games locally is really important.</p><p><strong>Ryan McCaffrey:</strong> You can read between the lines on that as you will!</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-single-player-campaign-requires-a-constant-internet-connection-even-on-console<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Black Ops 6’s single-player campaign requires a constant internet connection in a first for the Call of Duty series on console.</p><p>Following the shooter’s reveal during Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase and subsequent Call of Duty Direct, fans noticed that an <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision support page</a> warned that all game modes, including campaign, need a continuous internet connection to play.</p><p>Why? According to Activision’s support page: “To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes.” An Activision spokesperson subsequently verified the explanation to IGN. Here’s the statement in full:</p><p>“To deliver the highest-quality visuals while also reducing the game’s overall storage space on your hard drive, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will use texture streaming across all game modes. This means you’ll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign. If you’re on a console, Campaign can be played without a premium subscription service such as Game Pass Core or PlayStation Plus.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While PC gamers have had to maintain a constant internet connection to play Call of Duty campaigns for some years now, Black Ops 6 marks the first time on console.</p><p>Microsoft has signaled that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb">Black Ops 6 will weigh in at an eye-watering 309.85 GB on Xbox Series X and S</a>, although there are questions over exactly how that will be distributed within the COD HQ game launcher, which houses all the current Call of Duty games as well as battle royale Warzone. IGN has asked Activision for clarification.</p><p>The note about texture streaming in Activision’s explanation is also nothing new for Call of Duty, but in this case appears to reference the ability to stream from the cloud in order to keep the game’s install size down, rather than locally from an SSD. Perhaps Black Ops 6’s, or COD HQ’s enormous 309.85 GB install footprint will be mitigated somewhat through the use of this tech. On PC, Activision has said Black Ops 6 requires an SSD with 149 GB of available space at launch (78 GB if COD HQ and Warzone are already installed).</p><p>Meanwhile, Activision has confirmed that Modern Warfare 2 and 3 content will not carry forward into Black Ops 6.
