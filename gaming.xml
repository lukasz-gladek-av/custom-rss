<p>In Forever Skies, players return to Earth as a scientist to discover what caused the loss of humanity’s home and what has changed. Earth has suffered an ecological disaster that forced humans to build massive towers to escape the problems of the surface, but that was not enough leading to an exodus from the planet. As the scientist you will pick through the ruins to find lost technology and repurpose it, as well as find ways to create food, and survive against Earth’s new inhabitants. Players will be living on airship that can be upgraded and customised, acting as the base of operations for the scientist.</p>
<p>You can get Forever Skies on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/">Steam in Early Access</a> now, and the game can be pre-ordered on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-pl/concept/10004499/">PlayStation store.</a></p>

		<p>Developer Twirlbound and Saber Interactive have confirmed a release date for the lighthearted action adventure The Knightling, with the date set as August 25th. The Knightling will be available for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch. The game’s story puts players in the shoes of The Knightling, a knight in training, whose mentor Sir Lionstone has disappeared.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ukI149d4r9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Knightling, players will be tasked with exploring the land of Clessia to find Sir Lionstone, armed with a magical shield to face all dangers. Clessia is a land filled with monsters and bandits that will do what they can to stop you, as well as a load of puzzles that will uncover long lost secrets of the world. All of this will hopefully lead you to find Sir Lionstone, and restore some order to the world.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/the-knightling-is-set-to-be-a-fantastical-shield-bearing-indie-hit/">The Knightling is set to be a fantastical shield-bearing indie hit</a></h2>
<p>In our The Knightling preview, Dom said, <em>“I love the look of The Knightling. It’s clear, it’s characterful and there’s just something adorable about the Knightling’s big eyes and the chunky world. The audio definitely helps with the atmosphere too, from the mumbled words everyone utters to the ebbs and peaks of the orchestral soundtrack. It creates a fantastical world with an economy of design that’s refreshing, but it’s nonetheless utterly beguiling, despite the simplicity. I am massively excited to play more of The Knightling – it’s light-hearted, action packed, and full of character, and a change in pace to the glossy Unreal Engine 5 open worlds elsewhere. This gorgeous landscape is also yours to explore, with&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">a demo available on Steam right now</a>.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/a-grand-unified-theory-of-suits-and-suits-la/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>If you are remaking <em>Suits</em>, as <em>Suits LA </em>is attempting to do to increasingly poor results each week, the first question to answer is: which <em>Suits </em>are you remaking?&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of its run, <em>Suits </em>was many shows. That variety and capacity for reinvention helped it become an unexpectedly beloved streaming hit, but also contributed to an unevenness that likely kept it from becoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/07/suits-usa-network-season-three-review.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>a respected TV classic</u></a>. It was a romantic melodrama that never wanted its audience to fear for a second that its central couples would not end up together. It was a slightly grating buddy comedy, where every character was fluent in the movie and TV references from the bro canon. At its worst <em>Suits </em>was like being locked in a fraternity common room during pledge week. It was a silly law drama where corporate and criminal law work much like science and engineering in <em>Star Trek</em>: there was no legal position so dire where a problem could not be solved by a blue folder passed across a table followed by a character saying something like, “Does this mean what I think it does?”</p><p>At its peak, though, <em>Suits </em>was a show about ethics versus ambition, decency versus duty. These tensions were initially embodied by its main character, legal super-mind and fraudulent Harvard grad Mike Ross, and the mentors and foils that surrounded him at his high-powered corporate litigation firm. A poor college flameout who wanted to do good by serving the law, Mike’s idealism was juxtaposed with his mentor Harvey Specter’s ruthless devotion to victory and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZm7NIrmk5s&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">material reward</a>. Mike’s emotional streak was contrasted with Harvey’s mentor and Mike’s boss, Jessica Pearson, who always had to take a more detached view as the head of the firm. Finally, Mike’s poverty and lack of status was contrasted with his sometimes nemesis Louis Litt, whose fawning credentialism and vast insecurity drove his toxic ambition.&nbsp;</p><p>More interesting than those conflicts, however, was one the show never fully reckoned with. Before anything else, <em>Suits </em>was a show about loyalty. And loyalty, <em>Suits </em>demonstrated across nine seasons, is where corruption often begins.</p><p>It’s there from the start: Mike Ross’s life was derailed in part because he gave his loyalty to a bad friend. When Harvey invests in Mike despite the fact Mike never got a law degree, he becomes deeply loyal and attached to Mike, and that increasingly compromises not just him but everyone around him. Forced to choose between exposing Mike or protecting Harvey and the law firm they all work for, slowly every member of the cast becomes party to Mike and Harvey’s lie. By the middle of the show’s run, there were times when you could easily have made the case that everyone involved should be barred from practicing law and maybe half of them should go to jail, and yet <em>Suits </em>was always there making their mutual corruption look high-minded. Character are constantly pledging some version of, “If anyone wants to get to you, they’ll have to go through me, and I’m not backing down from a fight.” Which sounds awesome until you remember that everyone is basically guilty of even worse than what they’re being accused of, and ultimately they want to keep their really nice jobs and their growing personal fortunes.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Harvey Specter and Mike Ross in the first episode of Suits</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a while, <em>Suits </em>presents Mike as someone who is trying to use the law to do good, in contrast to Harvey’s combativeness on behalf of rich and frequently evil clients. But Patrick J. Adams plays Mike with a nasty, childish streak that never quite meshes with his appeals to morality and justice. At time the mask comes off completely, like when he meets a nurses’ union rep at his grandmother’s care facility. To explain why she’s threatening a strike, she shows Mike all the off-the-book extra care nurses give patients like Mike’s grandma… and Mike uses that info to get the nurses in legal jeopardy for breaking care protocols, forcing the union to accept the contract the hospital chain was offering. Unsurprisingly, some members of the audience <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/17grsks/i_really_hated_that_head_nurse/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>were on Mike and Harvey’s side here</u></a>, illustrating the degree to which <em>Suits </em>places its audience on the side of the rich and powerful.</p><p>What makes Mike tolerable as a character is that <em>Harvey</em> loves him, and via Harvey the show treats Mike as a difficult little brother and not a toxic autodidact. That judgment counts for a lot because as the show goes on, despite its original design, <em>Harvey </em>emerged as its moral center.</p><p>The world of <em>Suits </em>is mostly filled with lousy people serving lousy causes, and those people are the ones with the money that give you access to lives of comfort, luxury and excitement. Harvey is an unapologetic sell-out, but what’s compelling about him is watching him negotiate the terms of that sale. It includes his talent and energy as a legal mercenary, but it does not include his integrity or that of the people around him. When the latter move into conflict with the interests of a case or a client, Harvey turns on a dime. And in that framing, Harvey becomes relatable as the kind of boss, coworker, or person that many of us wish we had in our lives, or were ourselves. Someone who places the best parts of his character off-limits from work, from the judgment of others, and from his own ambition. It’s a seductive fantasy: that you can prosper in a fallen world working in service to the devil and yet keep him from your own shoulders.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Real Suitors see this and get excited.</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is not really a tenable moral position and this eventually doomed <em>Suits </em>to a stale formula of meaningless wars of office politics waged between the wealthy retainers of the growing oligarchy. Ultimately the contradiction was resolved with Mike’s exit from the show to go to Seattle to start a very different law practice than he and Harvey worked at. When it was time for <em>Suits </em>to end its run, Harvey and his intrepid secretary-turned-wife Donna left New York to join Mike and his wife, Rachel. They were all going to become wealthy Atticus Finches, just out of frame.</p><p>The show was well into anticlimax by that point, but before it tied everything up in marriage knots, it had produced at least one tremendous season of television and a few great ones. It managed that by asking what integrity meant in a setting where friendships, political alliances, professional obligations, and career goals were constantly reconfiguring themselves and exerting tension in new and interesting directions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Suits LA</em>, after three episodes, is struggling mightily to recapture any of this. In many ways it feels like a continuation of where the show left off in its struggling final season, with a new cast going through the motions of <em>Suits </em>plotlines without any of the history or relationships stakes that made them interesting.</p>

However, you must first repair the vessel, which requires a shipwright, which is a time-honored career that’s fallen out of grace in modern-day Hawaii. However, <strong>if you follow along with the main story, you’ll meet Clark, a buff old man who claims he can repair any ship on the sea</strong>.</p><p>But the Goromaru is a big ship, and Clark is old. He can’t handle the job solo, which means hiring Julie. You’ll have to acquire $10,000 to pay for the parts and labor to upgrade your ship. But hey, if you played <em>Infinite Wealth</em>, then you probably know how to make money fast in <em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, don’t you? Well, if not, then let’s get to it.</p><h3 id="h3916906"><a id=""></a>Expand your Aloha Links network</h3><figure id="" data-id="54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-recommend-id="image://54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main menu of the Aloha Links social media app in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The main menu of the Aloha Links social media app in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-recommend-id="image://54bd2da86e817a87f01e53332138db3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main menu of the Aloha Links social media app in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shortly after learning how to fix your ship, you’ll set out in search of a crew.

These Substories, or the game’s version of side quests, offer branching, short-lived side stories that expand the universe, provide you a fun little excursion, and earn you some cash and, on occasion, helpful items.</p><p>There are just over 30 Substories in the game, and you’ll find the majority right here in Honolulu. They’re also an excellent way to give yourself a little break from the sprawling main story!</p><h3 id="h3916908"><a id=""></a>Hunt bounties</h3><figure id="" data-id="ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-recommend-id="image://ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ‘Target Apprehended’ screen for a Police Bounty in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A ‘Target Apprehended’ screen for a Police Bounty in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-recommend-id="image://ab51ce4157ea115b9bec22f9410bdb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ‘Target Apprehended’ screen for a Police Bounty in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most lucrative ways to earn cash in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is by tracking and beating bounties. Once you reach Honolulu, you’ll gain access to the Police Bounties—a long and growing list of ne’er-do-wells. You’ll find them on your mini-map, marked with a handcuffs icon. </p><p>A few of these bounties fly solo, though they still pose a threat. But it’s when you stumble upon a large group of enemies, like the Anti-Social Smokers, that really test your capabilities. It’s worth it for that cold, hard cash, though!</p><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those games were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/UmCLtRhifgg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D and level based</a></span>. <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is, as the name implies, in 3D and is much bigger, featuring randomly generated cartoon towns overrun with deadly zombies. You start with a single pistol and survive as long as you can while racking up cash. When you die, you return to a hub, have the chance to spend your money to buy permeant upgrades, and then return to the fray. </p><p>It’s a simple formula found in plenty of other roguelike games, and <em>Zombieville USA 3D</em> doesn’t really shake any of this up in a major way. Instead, the small team behind it have focused entirely on making a really, really good version of this kind of game with slick visuals and satisfying action. A big reason the combat feels so good is because of excellent feedback via energetic animations. Everything you do, from walking and running to shooting and hacking or smashing enemies to bits looks great thanks to a slick art style and snappy animations that have a nice bounce to them.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1hybgzc/comment/m6g1zxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the game’s lead developer on Reddit</a></span>, who has mostly worked as a VFX artist and animator, the idea is that these “juicy” and “extra” visuals will help <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> stand out among all the other games on Steam. And, in my case at least, it worked. When I was scrolling through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-sale-deep-discounts-doom-undertale-spring-sale-pc-1851769776">Steam’s Spring Sale</a></span>, I randomly spotted this game in the “Under $10” section and its art and animation immediately made me click to see more. A few hours later I had played a ton of <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> on both my PC and my Steam Deck.</p><p>On Steam Deck I recommend knocking the visual settings down to medium and locking the FPS to 60 to get more battery life and a very stable experience. Once I did that,<em> Zombieville 3D USA </em>played perfectly on Valve’s portable PC. On my desktop PC, though,&nbsp;<em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> looks even better with raytracing and high-resolution options.</p><p>Regardless of how you play it, <em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is a fantastic little indie zombie shooter that even supports online co-op. It demonstrates that a successful game doesn’t have to be massive or completely reinvent the wheel. Sometimes, all you have to do is perfectly nail a simple gameplay loop and make sure your game looks cool as heck and you’ll end up with something special that catches people’s eyes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801520/Zombieville_USA_3D/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Zombieville 3D USA</em> is currently available on Steam for $8</a></span>.

He’s also a no-nonsense activist known to give a rousing speech or two when the going gets tough. Unlike Sephiroth, he gets right to the heart of what he’s trying to say, doesn’t bloviate about why bad things are actually good, and speaks to real issues with the kinda gusto you need to change the world.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/19/wreckfest-2-early-access-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> was a game that, for some reason, sailed past me like a detached tyre flying in slow motion in a spectacular crash in an action movie. I loved the idea, the crash-happy ethos behind it, but despite owning it on multiple platforms, I only ever dipped a toe in for one or two races. Thankfully time has given me another chance to experience this crash-happy racer with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As it heads into Steam Early Access, Wreckfest 2 is a fairly limited package to start with. In a faint echo of the initial early access release of the first game, there’s four tracks – two race tracks, one oval and demolition derby arena, and a greybox test arena with big ramps and funky flippers – four cars, and support for both solo play and online multiplayer with up to 24 drivers. There’s no career, and just those core modes, but that’s more than enough to give a feel for what Wreckfest 2 offers…. which is more Wreckfest.</p>


<p>Dropping into a quick race is just plain old fun, once you get over that innate desire to actually win. With 24 cars crammed onto these circuits, bobbling and bouncing over bumps in the dirt tracks, the inherently loose suspension of the muscle cars imitations doing little to really help you in an off-road setting, contact is inevitable. Heck, it’s encouraged. Smash into the side, rear-end or T-bone another car and the game will pin a few points on your race suit as a reward.</p>


<p>You might think that’s a great way to get ahead – just use the other cars to help you brake! – but it’s a delicate balance. If another driver keeps their foot in as you nudge their rear corner, turning them off the racing line and forcing you to go with them. Not ideal. There’s plenty times in a race where a car will end up sideways, with an angry traffic jam of competitors all pushing them along, and the chaos is engineered with the way tracks loop back around and cross over themselves, with two-way traffic adding high speed peril. It’s easy to come off worse in contact, or just as disadvantages, that it makes it all the sweeter when you do manage to tap a rival just so and spin them out without losing momentum yourself.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you have the destruction derby mode, where the whole point is to crash into other cars, racking up points for high speed collisions and dealing damage to other cars with the aim of getting the final blow to empty their health bar. Every crash is a double-edged sword, though. Sure, you’ll dish out damage, but you’ll take it yourself, quickly wrecking your vehicle, slowing you down and making you vulnerable. Once you’re wiped out, you’ll spawn again with a fresh car and get to rampage some more until time runs out.</p>
<p>They’re the two bread and butter modes of Wreckfest, and they’re just as good here. Bugbear has built this within their new ROMU engine that enhances the demolition physics and dynamic simulation.</p>

		</div>

<p>There’s a point of comparison from original to sequel with the inclusion of the Savolax Sandpit track. More than a decade on from its first creation, Bugbear has been able to increase the fidelity a bunch, reprofiling the trackside quarry cliffs, putting far more trees in the densely wooded sidings, giving it a much hazier tone on a cloudy day, and with much better looking dust that’s kicked up as you race. It’s a nice uplift alongside the new Scrapyard track, which raced through a dusty scrapyard that’s filled with heaps of cars.</p>
<p>And then there’s the destruction, which just ups the nuance of what’s wrought upon the cars in the game. There’s still a leaning toward deformation before parts come off, and car suspensions are necessarily incredibly tough, just so that the cars keep on working after one or two prangs, but it really doesn’t take too much before the engine has been compressed to just be an office fan, while doors and bonnets flap about in the wind.</p>
<p>At this point in time, fans of the original are probably best served by actually continuing to play the original, but if you know that Wreckfest 2 will be a part of your racing game future and want to get in at the earliest possible point to see it develop, then the Steam Early Access release might just be for you. It is distinctly limited right now, little more than a demo or technical test, but there’s plenty for fans to look forward to in the months ahead.</p>

"For this, we sincerely apologize."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission"><u>the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</u></a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission.

Torii gates are found close to religious shrines all over Japan to indicate a boundary separating the human world and the sacred. The one-legged Torii gate has significant meaning of its own, however, as one can famously be found at the Sannō Shrine in Nagasaki, located 900 metres from the hypocenter of the World War 2 atomic bomb which killed upwards of 60,000 people.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Ubisoft is launching Assassin’s Creed Shadows with a degree of controversy not only in Japan, but with some western fans concerned about its depiction of the country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.webtv.sangiin.go.jp/webtv/detail.php?sid=8374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assassin’s Creed Shadows question was asked by Japanese politician and member of the House of Councillors of Japan, Hiroyuki Kada</a>. Kada, who will campaign for re-election this summer, said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I fear that allowing players to attack and destroy real-world locations in the game without permission could encourage similar behavior in real life.

Our colleagues at IGN Japan helped us understand the situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What needs to be understood here is that Japan has seen record numbers of overseas visitors in the wake of the country reopening its borders after the pandemic and the lure of the weak yen. In this government budget meeting the politician Hiroyuki Kada twinned his complaints against Shadows with the controversial subject of what he called “over tourism” and an attendant perceived rise in vandalism and graffiti in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His argument is that if players are able to deface a temple or harm individuals with a katana in the game, they may be inspired to do it in real life when they visit Japan, similar to the age-old argument that Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto inspire copycat violence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded that if such actions were taken in real life, he would oppose them, but the “if” is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. His comments were aimed at theoretical real-life copycat actions rather than at the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The shrine being defaced in Shadows gameplay videos online is Itatehyozu Shrine in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, which is within Kada’s constituency. He said that he has consulted with representatives of the shrine who say that Ubisoft did not seek their permission to show the shrine and use its name in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Masaki Ogushi (Vice Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry) responded that government agencies will work together to handle matters “if the shrine seeks consultation,”, that again is a big if, and anyway, in a work of artistic expression Ubisoft would probably be clear legally to use the shrine anyway under the Constitution of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responses from both ministers were vague at best and seem unlikely to result in any particular action, especially as Ubisoft appears to have addressed these concerns proactively with a day-one patch – showing they may be more sensitive to the feelings of Japanese citizens than Kada gave them credit for.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">News of this day-one patch emerged in Japan this morning, but has yet to be confirmed by Ubisoft’s western operation. According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-will-make-certain-shrine-objects-indestructible-and-eliminate-civilian-npc-bloodshed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Ubisoft has revealed changes that will be implemented in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-global-release-times-confirmed">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows as soon as it releases on March 20</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the site, the day-one patch will make tables and shelving located in in-game shrines indestructible and will reduce non-essential depictions of bloodshed taking place in shrines and temples. In addition, when attacking unarmed NPCs, there will no longer be depictions of blood. IGN has asked Ubisoft about this day-one patch, and whether it is specific to Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Irrespective of the game’s success or otherwise in Japan, there is enormous pressure on Assassin's Creed Shadows to do well for Ubisoft globally after a number of delays and the sales failure of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director Johan Pilestedt has slammed the current spate of video games industry layoffs as "unnecessarily brutal" and said that companies needed to learn lessons to avoid the same painful cycle of "death and rebirth" in future. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking today at GDC 2025, in a session attended by Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, Pilestedt put the blame for layoffs on the decisions made by company bosses that they should chase industry trends such as yet more battle royales, just because a big few have become successful. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Pilestedt continued, the video game industry needed to take more risks and simply make a wider variety of games to cater to the medium's ever-growing audience. That such widespread layoffs were happening despite more people playing games overall was "ridiculous", Pilestedt commented.
</p>
<p>
"The games industry is caught in a vicious circle of death and rebirth," he said. "Every so often we lay off thousands of people suddenly, and then nobody understands why, and I think it's just because we converge.
</p>
<p>
"We will always go through the cycles of death and rebirth, but now that cycle is unnecessarily brutal because we don't diversify enough. We need to make more types of games because people are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous.
</p>
<blockquote>"People are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous."</blockquote>
<p>
"If everybody stopped making battle royales and made [different] games we wouldn't be in this position."
</p>
<p>
While the majority of video game workers losing jobs were those on development teams, the people calling the shots on which projects were getting greenlit were the ones deciding to "play it safe" by following trends, Pilestedt continued.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of publishers - I'm sorry, my dear publisher friends - try to play it safe by taking safe bets," Pilestedt said. "But one thing that I can guarantee is that those safe bets are a death sentence for the studios that try to make it.
</p>
<p>
"We are in the business of taking risks, and if you don't take risks, we're never gonna be able to achieve success. Few people believed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> would amount to anything,  and yet here we are."
</p>
<p>
Earlier in the same talk, Pilestedt shared his thoughts on game design, and said that "experiences need to be spiky" in order to stand out. 
</p>
<p>
"Game design is about experiences," Pilestedt noted. "If you balance out all the chaos, you make an uninteresting game. Balance is the polishing of an experience... but if you smoothen that out too much, it will just be bland."
</p>
<p>
Too many games were trying to please too many people, in other words, or make something too similar to something else that has come before. 
</p>
<p>
"You can't overtake if you stay in the same lane," Pilestedt continued, "making a game 10 percent better than something [that already exists].

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/crosswind-is-an-upcoming-f2p-pirate-survival-mmo-in-development-for-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Crosswind Crew has announced an eponymous free-to-play pirate survival MMO game in development for PC. Just like you'd expect, Crosswind is set in the year '17XX', right in the middle of the Golden Age of Piracy. It is in this setting that players will take the role of a freelance captain who has just been betrayed and is stranded after a job gone wrong. The game starts as a relatively familiar tale of survival and revenge but eventually expands into a larger conflict with empires, pirate clans, and even mysterious dark forces. Driven by real-life characters and supernatural forces alike, the story unfolds in an epic battle against an unspoken ancient evil.</p>
<p>The game reportedly offers a comprehensive survival experience. Players will explore vibrant, diverse biomes to gather resources and then unleash creativity in building and crafting, turning their initial shelter into a fully functioning outpost. It's also possible to recruit and expand the crew to speed up harvesting and production. The combat features a vast arsenal of melee weapons and firearms, allowing players to&nbsp;parry and dodge enemy attacks and use a variety of strikes to succeed.</p>
<p>Of course, being a game about the Golden Age of Piracy, the adventures in Crosswind take place on land as well as on sea. From their ship, players may bombard coastal forts from afar, close in, and engage the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. There are various ships, such as nimble cutters, versatile frigates, huge galleons, and more. Singing sea shanties and boarding enemy ships are both available, too. The MMO features include playing with friends, engaging in faction rivalries as well as endgame PvE and PvP activities, including challenging boss fights. Players may trade, raid, and build their own pirate empire.</p>

<p>If you've been intrigued by the description and trailer, the developers are running a playtest right now, featuring the first story arc worth 30-40 hours of gameplay, three biomes, three new playable ships and one merchant ship, ground and naval combat, and an early prototype for the Tortuga social hub.

Remember how it felt in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> when you discovered a <a href="https://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Wooden+Shield">shield</a> and learned that it existed purely to shame and humiliate returning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> players who are over-reliant on blocking? Do you remember reading those awful, judging, fourth-wall-besmirching words, “Shields are nice, but not if they engender passivity”? Well, The Knightling is the opposite of that feeling. It’s a bouncy, breezy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> platformer in which you are a novice chevalier equipped with a circular, gear-toothed shield he uses for absolutely everything. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can slide down hills on it! You can hurl it like Captain America! Like hurling his shield, I mean, not like hurling Captain America. You can use it as a parachute! You can even parry and block with it, though that feels like copping out. Not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-brew-barons-is-a-sumptuous-ghibli-inspired-flight-sim-thats-also-a-brewing-sim-for-some-reason">The Brew Barons</a> have I witnessed such commitment to a bit. If you’re similarly enthused, you’ll be delighted to hear that developers Twirlbound and publisher Saber Interactive have just slapped a release date on the thing - 28th August. Here’s a trailer.

The story here is that you’re searching for your mentor, a famous knight called Sir Lionstone, who’s gone AWOL while a-questing in the realm of Clesseia. That’s his shield you’re doing doughnuts with. It’s made of Callyrium, which sounds like a Ratchet &amp; Clank version of Vibranium. Is the shield upgradeable in the manner of most video game weapons? I’m not sure, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">the Steam page</a> does mention upgrades of some kind.
</p>
<p>
The trailer announcement accompanies an updated demo. It expands the previous demo’s Outskirt area to include ”the seldom-visited, secluded woods in the far corner of the realm known as the Cornered Bosk.” Somebody should get FromSoftware boss Hidetaka Miyazaki to play that demo and ask him if he still thinks shields “engender passivity”. Let’s see you surf through a meadow on an effing Moonlight Greatsword, Miyazaki. Let’s see you turn a Kirkhammer into a glider.

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> first launched in 2014, one of its biggest selling points was Cyrodiil: the MMORPG's large scale, open-world PvP zone where hundreds of players across the game's three factions could lay siege to each other's territory. Cyrodiil was even a major positive note in GameSpot's original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-online-review/1900-6415741/">Elder Scrolls Online review</a>, with reviewer Kevin VanOrd calling developer ZeniMax Online's MMO "at its best when the PvP action heats up" and its massive battles "good fun."</p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to shortly after ESO's post-launch honeymoon period, and the cracks in Cyrodiil quickly began to show. The huge number of players, and the complexity of the underlying game as a whole, led to major server performance problems that the mode still struggles with today despite numerous attempts by ZeniMax Online to fix the situation. Playing Cyrodiil in 2025 means contending with poor frame rates and extremely laggy battles, ultimately making the PvP sieges unplayable for many--a sad state of affairs for what was once a key back-of-the-box feature. But that may be about to change thanks to Cyrodiil Champions, a new experimental test mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461898-esocyrodiilfactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461898-esocyrodiilfactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461898"></a><figcaption>ESO's three-faction Cyrodiil PvP battles were a major selling point at launch in 2014.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461898-esocyrodiilfactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyrodiil Champions is an ambitious open test on ESO's live PC servers running March 24-31 that ZeniMax Online is hoping will definitively identify the core problem behind the mode's frustrating performance. This test campaign will keep all the large-scale siege battles Cyrodiil is known for but massively simplify class abilities and disable nearly everything else (passive abilities, armor types, stats, and more) in order to (hopefully) prove a point--that it is the sheer complexity of each player's stats and abilities interacting with one another that is resulting in server-breaking performance issues, rather than poorly written code or bad server infrastructure.</p><p dir="ltr">"The number one goal for this test is to prove once and for all some of the performance debates we've been having internally," ESO game director Rich Lambert said in an interview with GameSpot. "We win either way, right? We win if it goes off and it does exactly what we want and players love it. We win if it fails, because then we can go back to the drawing board and say, 'Yep, it's not that. So what is the actual problem?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Lambert said the team is constantly getting feedback about Cyrodiil, and it is one of the biggest complaints ZeniMax Online hears about ESO. For eight years, ESO has been on a yearly chapter release cycle (ESO's version of expansions) that have added a large new zone alongside new story content and usually one larger feature, like NPC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/massive-the-elder-scrolls-online-blackwood-update-adds-companions-new-chapter/1100-6492525/">companions</a> or ESO's card game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-legacy-of-the-bretons-is-a-return-to-the-franchises-storytelling-roots/1100-6499996/">Tales of Tribute</a>. In a blog from December 2024, studio director Matt Firor announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">ESO would not receive a new chapter in 2025</a>, with the team instead moving to a seasonal model consisting of smaller updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor said the team wanted to experiment more moving forward and outlined a number of ideas it has on how to improve ESO in the year ahead. He specifically called out the need to "seriously" address Cyrodiil performance and said the team had set an "ambitious" goal to see it return to the hundreds of concurrent players the mode supported shortly after launch in 2014.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461899-esogoldroad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461899" data-ratio="0.56239412761152" data-width="1771" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461899-esogoldroad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461899"></a><figcaption>ESO's latest Chapter, Gold Road, released in June 2024.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461899-esogoldroad.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyrodiil Champions is the solution ZeniMax Online has come up with, despite it still being in its early stages and far from a fully fleshed out feature. Lambert said the team decided on this route back in October, with the goal of putting together a test version quickly to prove the concept.</p><p dir="ltr">For Lambert's part, he likens the ambition behind the Cyrodiil Champions test to that of the game's 2016 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-update-finally-lets-you-freel/1100-6444231/">One Tamriel update</a>, which dramatically transformed ESO by removing faction-restricted zones and made it so all of the game's quests and enemies would scale alongside players.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to change," Lambert said. "We want to move forward. We want to spice things up. In my brain, Cyrodiil Champions is on the same level of crazy as One Tamriel was when we did that way back in the day, and that completely changed our game for the better. I think that's what Cyrodiil Champions could be, and we want to do more of that stuff going forward as well."</p><p dir="ltr">The test will dramatically alter class abilities while in Cyrodiil. Whereas many abilities can normally do damage and heal, or damage and crowd-control targets, or hit a large number of targets at once, that won't be the case in Cyrodiil Champions. An ability, like the Templar's Javelin, that usually does damage and knocks down opponents will instead just do the knockdown, or abilities that normally heal and deal damage will now do one or the other. Some abilities may deal damage to a reduced number of targets. It's all being done in the name of server performance, and pinpointing what, precisely, is causing Cyrodiil's performance woes.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead combat and PvP designer Brian Wheeler said doing a "hard separation" of PvE and PvP abilities is something the team has discussed for a long time, and that by removing extra layers from each ability, the team can finally hone in on Cyrodiil's performance issues. He said he knows it's a dramatic shift for the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Engineering efforts have kind of gone as far as they can possibly go," Wheeler said. "At this point, it's on design. It's on us to look at abilities and go, 'Does this really need to do all the crap that it's doing?'"</p><p dir="ltr">Even if the test is a success on a technical level, Lambert said continuing to expand and build out Cyrodiil Champions isn't a sure bet. It all depends on how players respond as to what will come next.</p><p dir="ltr">"The internal playtests have been really, really positive," Lambert said. "Time-to-kill has gone up, so you're not getting two-or-three-shotted. There are builds, the really persnickety builds on live, the really tanky guys that you just can't do any damage to, a lot of that stuff is gone. It's just a really cool, welcoming, easy-to-pick-up game mode now. Which is really cool. Again, it's not a fully fleshed out feature, so there's going to be some warts and what not in there but we knew that going in. We chose to do that so we could get it out quick, and not spend two years and then find out, 'Oh, well that was actually not going to solve anything.' We are making a conscious effort on what we are focused on and why we are doing it, and hopefully players will like it as much as we have in our playtests."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461900-eso10yearanniversary.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461900" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461900-eso10yearanniversary.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461900"></a><figcaption>ESO celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2024.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4461900-eso10yearanniversary.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Should the test not go as expected, Wheeler said it will still give the team further direction on how to solve the problem of Cyrodiil, something he said he's been "clamoring for" for a decade. And whatever comes next, whether it's additional Cyrodiil Champions tests that continue to bring the feature to full-realization or something else entirely, Wheeler said ZeniMax Online will always look to keep what fans love about Cyrodiil intact.</p><p dir="ltr">"We know that Cyrodiil is a unique experience that doesn't really exist in other MMOs," Wheeler said.

But now, cryptic posts on social media hint that the publication may make a return.</p><p>On Bluesky, the <em>Game Informer</em> account, which had not posted since July of last year, returned to life with a short video featuring the publication’s farewell message. At the bottom of the screen, code appears with the words “Continue” as though it were an arcade game asking if you wanted to put in more quarters to keep playing.

Additionally, former staff members posted videos of a “continue” screen with a copy of <em>Game Informer</em> in the background, with the animation moving the cursor onto “yes.” Taken together, the teasers suggest <em>Game Informer</em> is coming back with its former staff returning to lead the publication.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to GameStop and former staff at <em>Game Informer</em> to confirm the news. In an email, Shea said that he can’t comment at this time but encouraged checking out the social media posts of his former colleagues. With the continued shrinking of digital media putting thousands of journalists out of work, especially in video games, it’s incredibly rare that something good happens. While we don’t quite know what form this announcement will take on March 25th, I think we can tentatively say, <em>Game Informer</em>’s getting the band back together.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been a billion years since I played a proper new Front Mission game, and I'm depressed to learn that Square Enix cancelled one in 2022. Titled Front Mission 2089: Borderscape and developed by BlackJack Studio, it was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/04/front-mission-2089-borderscape-announced-for-ios-android">announced</a> for release on iOS and Android but, who knows, might have clanked and rumbled onto PC, the place all good mobile games go when they die. Alas, Square Enix shut the project down a few months after reveal. Now, they're suing BlackJack for releasing a new game that allegedly makes use of leftover parts from the Front Mission contract.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/542570/square-enix-front-mission-mecharashi-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, BlackJack Studio released a game called Metal Storm, or Mecharashi, in October 2024. Square Enix claim that BlackJack (known in the lawsuit as HK Ten Tree) developed it "using materials created pursuant" to their old Front Mission licensing agreement for Borderscape. 
</p>
<p>
Mecharashi was only ever released in China and Japan, but does have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3446920/Mecharashi/">an English language Steam page</a>, which describes it as a "mecha-themed tactical turn-based game" that uses "a Front Mission-style combat system, where you can assemble mechas however you want, equip a wide selection of weapons, and choose your favorite pilots to engage in battle." The trailer certainly looks rather Front Missionary. Square Enix have sent a bunch of DMCA takedowns to get the game yanked from storefronts. It's back on Steam as of this writing thanks to a counter-claim.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix's lawsuit has been filed in both a US and a Japanese court, and includes side-by-side comparisons of Mecharashi and the unreleased Front Mission 2089: Borderscape - 11 pages of them. Find some examples below. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/1(8).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Polygon / Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The Final Fantasy publishers argue that the game can't be released in its current state because it makes use of "game mechanics, visual designs, and other protected content" from the abandoned Front Mission collaboration. They want BlackJack to both remove said infringing material and cough up $150,000 per infringement. 
</p>
<p>
Being neither alleged infringer nor self-described infringed-upon, I will conclude only by saying that I think those mech designs are quite nice. Softer-looking and warmer of hue than I remember Front Mission being, though that's me harkening back to the PS1 era when the science of video game anti-aliasing was in its infancy. It reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-brigade">Phantom Brigade</a>. Ah, I hope we get another tactical mech game soon, once the lawyers have had their fun.

<p>After the skin briefly appeared during the Marvel Rivals early access tests, the beloved Spider-Man Spider-Punk suit is arriving to the store on March 20th. The skin has received a tune-up featuring some rocking new audio effects, meaning you’ll want headphones on to fully appreciate it.</p>



<h2 id="h-spider-punk-2099-arrives-in-marvel-rivals">Spider-Punk 2099 Arrives in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals confirmed today that Spider-Man’s Spider-Punk 2099 suit will make its official debut on March 20th at 2:00 UTC. The skin was one of a few that were playable during the early access tests for the game, such as the President Loki skin just recently officially released. The Spider-Punk character first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic series in 2015, and a version of them appeared in the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse film.</p>



<p>The Spider-Punk 2099 suit will, naturally, be sold as a bundle that will include a suit-specific emote and MVP screen. The bundle will likely include a spray and a player card as well. It will hit the store at the same time as another skin that originally debuted during the closed tests: Iron Man’s Steam Power suit.
