            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/football-heroes-league-has-been-revealed-and-released-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During Future Games Show LATAM, Run Games announced and shadow dropped a new free to play multiplayer football game called Football Heroes League. It seems to be inspired by Rocket League but with actual football instead of cars. We have essentially come full circle and can dub this Rocket League with people.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Heroes League - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHC8edyMwhw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Football Heroes League, you can compete in 2v2, 3v3, or 5v5 matches to score the most goals and win. There is also a training mode to get to grips with the controls, and an instant replay system will be added soon. Players can currently choose from a roster of five heroes, with more to be added during the game’s early access phase. The five heroes available at the moment are Kenzo, Beckers, Leo, Frostine, and Bun-E, and each of them has a special ability. Kenzo has jet boots to give him super speed, Beckers has mag boots to control the ball direction so she can in theory bend it like Beckham, Leo has the strength to get passed opponents, Frostine is able to freeze opponents, and Bun-E commands BunBots that can be used to assist in defence and attack. I bet VAR wouldn’t be able to cope with all of these shenanigans.</p>
<p>If you do want to give Football Heroes League a go, you can download it for free now on PC at the following links:</p>

Dell, for instance, <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/microsoft-corporation-xbox-series-x-1tb-white/apd/ad180049/gaming-gaming-accessories/" rel="sponsored">is still offering</a> the digital-only<strong> Xbox Series X (1TB)</strong> for $449.99, saving you $100 on the new MSRP. The smaller, 512GB <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> is also available at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S-512GB-SSD-All-Digital-Gaming-Console-Robot-White%2F11213159055%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> for just $273.99 ($106 off), while the 1TB model is going for $347 ($83 off) at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Series-S-1TB-White%2F9606813888" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>.</p><p>In case you need a refresher, the Series X is more powerful and capable than the smaller Xbox Series S. The Series X offers support for native 4K resolution, for example, while the smaller Series S is primarily designed for 1440p gaming. Microsoft’s higher-end console also offers 1TB of storage, double the base Series S, along with faster performance thanks to an expanded 12 teraflops of GPU performance.</p><div><p>Both the disc-less Xbox Series X and Series S lack an optical drive, meaning they’re limited to playing digital titles.

		<p>Developer Killasoft has revealed The Shadow Syndicate which has been described as a stealth action game set in 1930’s Brooklyn. You can check out the reveal trailer below from Future Games Show LATAM, with the footage giving a look at some gameplay and the noir kind of feel that you would expect from a detective game set in the 1930s.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Shadow Syndicate - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcxW7qOesd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Shadow Syndicate’s description says,<em> “The Shadow Syndicate is a narrative-driven stealth-action game set in a stylized 1930s Brooklyn. Step into the shoes of Sam Marlowe, a retired soldier turned private detective, as he unravels a city-wide conspiracy involving secret societies, occult forces, and a creeping darkness threatening to consume it all. Sneak, fight, and investigate through a rich cinematic experience blending noir storytelling with supernatural abilities and fast-paced action. Use your cursed Sacrifice Ring to unleash powerful skills—at a cost. Explore a living open city between missions, filled with colorful characters, mini-games, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.”</em></p>
<p>The gameplay will consist of investigating areas for clues, solving puzzles in your notebook, interrogating characters for information, and getting into gunfights. The combat will feature bullet time as well as supernatural abilities that will let Sam stun enemies, teleport, or instantly kill enemies. However, using these abilities builds up a deadly curse that will have consequences for Sam. Outside of the main story you take on side quests or you can go around Brooklyn to go bowling, play darts, or play blackjack.</p>

<p>A release date for The Shadow Syndicate is yet to be confirmed but it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

It's quite unlike anything else in the long-running series, and even if it falters more often than usual, it's still essential for anyone who's previously called Kamurocho home.”</p><p>This isn’t the only premium edition discounted for Gaming Week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 02/05/2025:</strong> According to <a href="https://it.ign.com/chrono-trigger/217954/news/square-enix-potrebbe-essere-al-lavoro-su-un-remake-di-chrono-trigger-si-attende-lufficialita">IGN Italy</a>, Yuji Horii's words about a Chrono Trigger Remake were, "<em>I understand there is also a remake in development</em>."</p>
<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>
<p>Dragon Quest series creator and Chrono Trigger writer Yuji Horii seems to have accidentally confirmed that a Chrono Trigger Remake is on the way at a panel during Napoli Comicon.</p>
<p>Spotted by<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chrono-trigger-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-yuji-horii/"> Insider-Gaming</a>, users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> who were at the panel heard Horii, through a translator, confirm the existence of a Chrono Trigger Remake. He only realized his mistake after the panel host asked to confirm what he had just said. When his translator put the follow-up question to Horii, he covered his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>The next thing his translator reportedly said was, "<em>You have heard nothing</em>." Earlier this year, on March 11, 2025, Square Enix celebrated the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a>, though the celebrations were not limited to a single day. At the time, Square confirmed that the celebrations would include "<em>various projects</em>," and now it seems we know what at least one of those projects is.</p>
<p>Now that Horii's comments are beginning to spread, it'll be interesting to see if Square Enix is quick to respond with an official confirmation, or if they'll stick to the marketing plan they have, and wait to announce the remake when they had originally planned.</p>
<p>The surprise of the remake might be gone, but the excitement fans have for it certainly isn't. Chrono Trigger is regarded as one of the best and most influential games in video game history, and is one of the few games of its time that has yet to get a proper remake. If anything, it's reassuring to know that Square Enix was well aware of the fact that Chrono Trigger is deserving of the same treatment that Dragon Quest III got, if that is the kind of remake they're making, of course.</p>

The Switch 2 Dock has two USB-A ports, so you <em>should </em>be able to use Hori's wheels to play Mario Kart World. Wired and Bluetooth Switch controllers are supposed to work just fine on Switch 2, and this should especially be true when dealing with officially licensed accessories like Hori's Mario Kart wheels.</p><p>We have reached out to Hori to confirm Switch 2 compatibility and will update this story if we hear back.

Beyond the larger size and more premium feel, the biggest additional perk is the inclusion of removable paddles. The paddles, along with the ZR and ZL trigger placement, allow you to play Mario Kart and other racing games without needing to alter your hand position to press buttons.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel/dp/B07YMFYRVQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel\/dp\/B07YMFYRVQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel/dp/B07YMFYRVQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Hori Mario Kart Racing Wheel Pro Mini</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel/dp/B07YMFYRVQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel\/dp\/B07YMFYRVQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Racing-Wheel/dp/B07YMFYRVQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$54.52 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Pro Mini's color scheme is based on the shades of red and blue found on Mario's iconic outfit.

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">The Shadow Syndicate</a> is a new game from indie developer KillaSoft, announced during the Future Game Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam. Playing as a grizzled husky detective, you'll solve the mystery and supernatural conspiracy at the heart of its 1930s Brooklyn setting.</p>
<p>A narrative-driven game, The Shadow Syndicate, will have you paying attention to clues, talking to the other animals in Brooklyn, and breaking a few skulls through third-person shooting, with the help of a good amount of bullet-time action when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>You'll play as retired soldier turned private detective Sam Marlowe, discovering what turns out to be a city-wide supernatural conspiracy with secret societies, occult powers, and some mysterious darkness that threatens to consume Brooklyn.</p>
<p>But you're not just bringing a gun to a magic fight, as your Sacrifice Ring lets you use a slew of powerful abilities. However, it should come as no surprise that using something called the 'Sacrifice Ring' comes at a cost. Each power will strengthen you, but they all come with a deadly curse that will loom over you with each ability gained.</p>
<p>There were several games shown off during the Future Games Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam, but The Shadow Syndicate was both one of the most interesting games shown and one of the few brand-new announcements. Hopefully, we will hear more about it soon.</p>
<p>The Shadow Syndicate is currently set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.</p>

It’s possible to miss the kill-shot any lower than the chest, unfortunately. But with the right attachments, missing becomes less likely, and that one-hitter-quitter we all love is more likely as your skill level with the gun increases!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Stock</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Monolithic Suppressor</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Gain-Twist Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Lightweight Bipod</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Heavy Stock</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: 108MM Overpressured</li></ul><p>While not completely necessary for a sniper rifle build, <strong>Gunfighter does allow you a little more wiggle room to stabilize your stats on the HDR</strong>. If you feel you need a touch better handling, a smidgen more firepower, or a doll’s hair more range, Gunfighter will allow you to equip three additional attachments, bringing the total from five to eight.</p><h2 id="h3894"><a id="loadou"></a>Best HDR-based class loadout</h2><figure id="" data-id="b088510fdd602aee13c9d779907f843b" data-recommend-id="image://b088510fdd602aee13c9d779907f843b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk loadout for an HDR build in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The perk loadout for an HDR build in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b088510fdd602aee13c9d779907f843b" data-recommend-id="image://b088510fdd602aee13c9d779907f843b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk loadout for an HDR build in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you can opt for any perks that you feel most comfortable using, these are what I recommend when running the HDR:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost (Avoid detection via Radar Pings, UAVs, and Proximity Alarms)</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Forward Intel (Increases the size of your minimap, displaying directional pings for enemies)</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Vigilance (Display a notification when you appear on an enemy minimap)</li><li><strong>Wild Card</strong>: Tactical Expert</li><li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Impact</li><li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Concussion</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li></ul><p>Alternatively, in place of Tactical Expert, which allows you to spawn with an additional Tactical, <strong>I do occasionally recommend taking Overkill</strong>. It’s useful when you’re running a sniper class, allowing you to swap out your secondary pistol for an additional primary weapon. In this case, I recommend a submachine gun for its high-rate-of-fire and close-quarters capabilities. You never know when someone’s going to sneak up on you!</p><hr><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Season 3 is available now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Deadlock--the MOBA that Valve famously did not acknowledge after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-valves-rumored-moba-shooter-deadlock-leaks-online-showing-off-steampunk-action/1100-6523639/">months of leaked footage</a>, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/">confirm its existence last summer</a>--has been slowly inviting more and more players to its ongoing closed alpha test. However, it now seems as if there's an even more hidden alpha test, with even more limited invitations, after a streamer accidentally spilled the beans.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Deathy was livestreaming Deadlock on his YouTube channel, when he seems to have booted up the wrong version of the game. Instead of the alpha test viewers were used to, instead the game loaded up additional characters--a roster of 40 available characters as opposed to the standard alpha's 30 playable heroes--as well as updated designs for some of those 30 heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the characters not found in the usual alpha test include a bellhop-themed character named Doorman, a reference to Mary Shelley's famous monster called Frank, and a character named Punkgoat whose art is a repeat of existing character Shiv. Deathy did end the stream and delete the archive when he realized his error, but screenshots still managed to hit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1kckaic/slight_oversight_from_the_deathy_tierlist/" rel="nofollow ">official Deadlock subreddit</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadlock is a 6v6 multiplayer shooter and MOBA--"multiplayer online battle arena"--game developed by Valve. The official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> says that the game is "in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay" and that "access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters."</p>

A PS5 with a disc drive is $500. A PS5 Pro is $700. If Sony matched Microsoft’s changes in the U.S., the cheapest PS5 would all of the sudden cost $550 with the PS5 Pro up to as much as $800. Maybe Sony will use this opportunity to undercut Microsoft, or maybe, having already dominated this console generation, it will have less incentive to eat the cost of some of the tariffs. It’s unclear when current PS5 inventory will be depleted, forcing its hand one way or the other, if Trump doesn’t back down.</p><p>The best deal on a PS5 at the moment <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-astro-bot-bundle-model-group-slim&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-astro-bot-bundle-model-group-slim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is the <em>Astro Bot </em>bundle</a></span> which includes the $60 GOTY winner and a disc-less slim model for just $400 (there’s also a $450 version if you want a disc drive). Not bad for a box that will let you play <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> when it hits in May 2026 and will likely last you well into the PlayStation 6 console generation rumored to begin as early as 2027. </p><p>Anyone waiting to pull the trigger on a PS5 Pro also might want to reconsider. While the upgrade <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">arguably isn’t worth the premium price tag for many</a></span>, upcoming releases like <em>Death Stranding 2</em> and<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>will likely be able to take full advantage of the higher performance power.

They pay full price for hardware designs that still have some kinks in them and access to lackluster launch games.

Long gone are the days of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sonycorp-ps3/sony-rolling-out-new-cheaper-playstation-3-idUSTRE57H54820090818/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sonycorp-ps3/sony-rolling-out-new-cheaper-playstation-3-idUSTRE57H54820090818/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS3 getting a slim edition that also costs less</a></span>, or Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-makes-99-gamecube-official/1100-6075701/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-makes-99-gamecube-official/1100-6075701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marking down GameCubes to just $100 each</a></span>. </p><p>Instead, the Switch 2 is likely to be the latest new console to only get more expensive as time goes on, unless “market conditions” materially change sometime soon. Pre-orders for $500 bundles that include <em>Mario Kart World</em> might look like a steal if the company is forced to raise prices in the fall, should Trump let the current pause on Vietnam tariffs expire <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">as it’s currently scheduled to</a></span>. At the very least, the Switch 2 will probably never be <em>less</em> expensive than it is now. After all, we went eight years without the original Switch ever dropping its $300 launch price. </p><p>So if you <em>were</em> planning to grab a new PS5 in the next year you might not want to wait. Whether you’re finally upgrading from a PS4 or hopping into the ecosystem for the first time, the deals are probably only going to get much worse from here on out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Korean publisher and developer NCSOFT announced that it has made what it calls "a strategic equity investment" in the independent Texas-based studio Empty Vessel, which is currently working on an immersive shooter called DEFECT.</p>
<p>DEFECT is a multiplayer, cyberpunk-style squad shooter that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/immersive-shooter-defect-announced-by-emptyvessel/">first revealed in August 2024</a> and will be the debut project from Empty Vessel. The studio is composed of developers who've worked on series such as DOOM, Quake, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted, so there's a lot of talent within the studio.</p>
<p>There's been no word regarding when DEFECT will be ready to release, but this investment is meant to help the game get over the finish line, so we might be close to hearing about a release date. According to Emanuel Palalic, the game director on DEFECT, it's also about providing Empty Vessel with a better environment to make DEFECT.</p>
<p>"<em>We started working on Defect with a simple belief, that great games come from focused, passionate teams who are empowered to take creative risks,</em>" Palalic said in a press release. "<em>That’s why we’re excited to partner with NCSOFT. From the start, they’ve understood our goal, not just to build a game, but to build a better environment for the developers behind it. NCSOFT’s support and expertise will help us take Defect and Empty Vessel to the next level.</em>"</p>
<p>According to a press release for the investment, this is just the beginning of what will be a long-term partnership, which could also include NCSOFT acquiring the publishing rights for DEFECT.</p>
<p>On NCSOFT's side, co-chief executive officer&nbsp;<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Byung-moo Park</span> said "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Empty Vessel is a AAA development studio established by game art and sound experts with successful experience and fandom in the global major genre of shooting games. We will continue to invest in securing new global IPs and building a genre-specific cluster pipeline.</em>"</span></p>
<p>When DEFECT was first announced, the trailer quickly garnered attention, with nearly two million views at the time of writing. Empty Vessel has been quiet since, so it'll be interesting to see how players react when we get a proper look at gameplay.</p>

That’s a lot of good, great, and downright incredible video games to squeeze into just five months. And guess what? There are more (possibly) good games coming out later this year, including: <em>Doom The Dark Ages, Duck Detective: The Secret Salami, Roadcraft, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, Elden Ring: Nightreign, Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Dune Awakening, FBC Firebreak, THPS 3+4, MGS Delta: Snake Eater, Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, Marathon, </em>and <em>Ghost of Yotei.</em></p><p>There was already no way any one person was going to be able to play all of these games in 2025.

And to drop<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-reactions-grand-theft-auto-ps6-1851778822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-reactions-grand-theft-auto-ps6-1851778822"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span> into this already busy year seems wild. </p><p>Sure, 2026 could end up being an equally bonkers year for games, but at least now publishers, developers, and gamers have a month to target. <em>GTA 6</em> is coming out in May 2026. Assuming it doesn’t get delayed again.</p><p> I imagine a lot of publishers will be trying to get their games out in the next 11 months to avoid <em>GTA 6</em>'s shadow. And if that’s the case, 2025 could get even busier before the year wraps up. So, needless to say, as someone who loves video games and doesn’t have enough time to play them all, I’m happy to wait for <em>GTA 6 </em>while I play all the awesome games we already got (and are getting) this year. Let Rockstar take their time, avoid crunch, and ship the game they want to ship. In the meantime, you can find something excellent to play. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As anyone who's played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> will tell you (your mileage may vary), it's got some of the best lore since FromSoftware went all enigmatic about a king/dragon/wizard with a big hat on the back of a spell scroll. Amid all that squirting, it brought us mysteriously missing cats, dodgy politicians, golden age Hollywood heroes, enterprising toilet entrepreneurs, long lost Atlantean civilisations, and more. So it's big hoorahs all round as developer FuturLab confirms there'll be plenty more where that came from in its upcoming PowerWash Simulator 2.
</p>
<p>
FuturLab has been talking lore in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/510704592041804306">first of its PowerWash Simulator 2 developer blogs</a>, confirming its sequel picks up several years after the events of the first game. In this brave new, post-volcano world, the Ancient Statue activated toward the end of the first game has continued to beam its enormous laser day and night, much to the annoyance of Caldera County's local residents. They're not especially happy it's become a paranormal hotspot either.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, our beloved Powerwasher protagonist's life goes on. "Obviously it was great to be involved in preventing an apocalyptic volcanic eruption by washing down the Sea Temple of an ancient civilisation, but saving the world doesn't always pay the bills," FuturLab writer Mark explains. "So they've continued to get their head down to save up for a swanky new Home Base, which they've just moved into as the new game commences."

<p>
But new HQs don't come cheap, and the Powerwasher will need to hit the road again and complete more hose-based jobs if he's going to earn enough to re-purchase the equipment he had to sell. New jobs, of course, means new lore and players will find a Caldera County map and pinboard back at base - which serves as a hub in FuturLab's sequel - that'll slowly be adorned with newspaper snippets as Career mode continues. "This will fill in some [lore] gaps and help players stay invested in the story in a frictionless way," Mark revealed.
</p>
<p>
"[In PowerWash Simulator 1, the lore's] biggest weakness – that it wasn't needed at all, made no requirements of the player and made no difference to the core gaming experience whatsoever - turned out to be its biggest strength. It meant that we could go a bit wild with it. By the end of the career mode there was a synergy between the two, with the narrative helping to inform the latter levels. It's unlikely the game would've finished with the cleaning of a UFO and Atlantis without a story to justify it, although the latter was always the intended endpoint."
</p>
<p>
"For PowerWash Simulator 2," Mark continued, "we've taken the same approach. The primary consideration when choosing jobs is always game mechanics – would these be interesting and satisfying washing experiences? Then we got started with a story and let it leak in and inform some of the levels." And if you want to know more about these levels, FuturLab says it'll have more to say in its next developer blog - although previous showings have at least revealed players'll be squirting the mucky bits off a parade float, tram, and teapot house in the sequel.
</p>
<p>
"It's been a real joy and privilege to write for PowerWash Simulator 2," Mark concluded in FuturLab's post, "and we hope the lore hungry among you enjoy where we've gone with it."
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">possibly Switch 2</a> later this year. Those looking for something to hose in the meantime can always return to the first game, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/have-another-peek-at-powerwash-simulator-2-then-hose-down-an-ice-cream-parlour-in-the-original">recently added Muckingham's Dessert Parlour</a> as new stage to cleanse in a free update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/get-a-10-minute-look-at-elden-ring-nightreigns-systems/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bandai Namco has released 10 minutes of footage for Elden Ring Nightreign, with this video’s aim being to give an overview of the game’s systems and characters. It goes over the world of Limveld, the characters you can choose from, and the new systems players will have to get to grips with that were not present in Elden Ring.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2uYT8BQefA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s Limveld is not going to be a simple place to traverse. It is filled with powerful enemies, bases filled with soldiers, and random events that can change everything. Players can explore together in groups of three or choose to split up and cover more ground alone to learn the secrets of the land. There are dungeons filled with gear and treasure, while bases can hold information that will reveal more to you about the world. Do not expect the world to be static while you explore though. Every expedition sees the layout of Limveld change, with the landscape subject to change at a moment’s notice due to meteor strikes, lava eruptions, and the appearance of forests. At night, the play area gets smaller and smaller until you are cornered in to a small space where very powerful enemies stir. These battles are unavoidable so you need to spend the day maximising your exploration to level up and get the best gear.</p>
<p>In Elden Ring you could customise your character in a number of ways, but in Nightreign you choose from one of six heroes to play as. Raider is for those of you who like to wield big and powerful weapons, while Ironeye is an archer who can hit from range. Wylder is a character that is adept at all skills but master of none, perfect for those who don’t want to get locked into a specific way of play but it will take some time to master the skills he possesses. Guardian is a tank character that is able to withstand all kinds of attacks, including the most dangerous. Recluse wields cursed magic to attack her enemies, and Duchess is a character adept at dodging and striking quickly. Each character has their own story and their true identities will slowly be revealed as memory fragments are uncovered, which in turn will lead to new objectives to tackle.</p>
<p>When not out in the field fighting enemies, players can find some respite at the Roundtable Hold. The Roundtable Hold is where players can equip relics, with these having various effects on players from increasing stats to changing the impact of skills. You can also buy different items at the Roundtable Hold from a Jar mechant. There is also an area where new costumes can be unlocked using the game currency to change the appearance of your character.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on 30th May.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paradox Could Be About to Reveal Europa Universalis V]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/paradox-could-be-about-to-reveal-europa-universalis-v.1179870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox Interactive has confirmed that it will reveal a brand new grand strategy game, codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar</em>, next week, describing it as a "new era for grand strategy", and there's reason to believe it might be&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis V</em>.</p>

<p>The first trailer for<em> Project Caesar</em>, which probably won't be the game's final name,&nbsp;is apparently set to debut on the official <em>Europa Universalis&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel (and not anywhere else, at time of writing) next week.</p>

<p>Right now, details about&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>are fairly thin on the ground. The slogan for the game appears to be "Be Ambitious", which could either refer to the game itself or to Paradox's approach in creating it, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperator-rome-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=GajlzsvD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperator-rome-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=v7WDz5ij 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox has past form in the Roman grand strategy area thanks to&nbsp;<em>Imperator: Rome</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If <em>Project Caesar </em>somehow<em>&nbsp;</em>isn't <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, but a new Ancient Rome-set game entirely, it won't be Paradox's first effort in this area. Its last,&nbsp;<em>Imperator: Rome</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/imperator-rome-release-announced-by-paradox" rel="nofollow">released in 2019</a>, although it hasn't exactly proven popular with a lot of Paradox fans.</p>

<p>At the very least, the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>(well, the announcement for the announcement, anyway) is accompanied by hashtags like #GrandStrategy and #StrategyGaming, so it's a pretty safe bet as to what genre&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>will fit into.</p>

<p>If it's not <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, I'd at least imagine it'll be a similar prospect to Paradox's other grand strategy games; imagine <i>Hearts of Iron IV</i>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/victoria-3-sales-cross-500k-despite-mixed-fan-reaction" rel="nofollow"><em>Victoria III</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>&nbsp;with a decidedly more Roman bent and you're probably most of the way there.</p>

<p>Still, we'll have to wait until next Thursday, which is when the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>will arrive, to find out. You can, if you like, check out the announcement-of-the-announcement here, although there's not much to go on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/victoria-3-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=zJR1I3y1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/victoria-3-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=rdCKi9A2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>will likely take its place in Paradox's grand strategy pantheon alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em>Victoria</em>&nbsp;<em>III</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a strange couple of years for Paradox. The studio likely needs&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>to be an uncontroversial hit; with the console versions of the much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-versions-not-before-summer" rel="nofollow">still absent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">not due until October</a>, things are looking a little dire for Paradox.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll discover what&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>is on Thursday, May 8th, when the debut trailer will be released at 12pm Eastern on the official&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/660233/gta-6-trailer-rewatch-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">delay of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> into next year</a> is a big deal. The game is the follow-up to arguably the biggest entertainment release of all time, one that originally debuted well over a decade ago. Even if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655394/gta-5-most-watched-twitch-game-gta-vi"><em>GTAV</em> is still going strong</a>, now spanning multiple console generations and with a surprisingly enduring online component, the hype for its sequel has been steadily building since 2013. Adding to the sheer amount of time is the mystery — we still know very little about what <em>GTAVI</em> actually is. So it’s a good time to revisit what we do know; namely, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">the single trailer released in 2023</a>.</p><p>Our first glimpse of the game runs almost entirely on vibes. Instead of gameplay or story, it covers a feeling, which is to say the feeling of Florida. <em>GTAVI</em> takes place in Leonida, Rockstar’s take on the Sunshine State, and the trailer is filled with those purple-pink skies, airboats plowing through the everglades, late-night streets races, a whole lot of pool parties, and of course alligators getting into mischief. Much of it is captured on a TikTok-like social network. There’s a slight introduction to the Bonnie and Clyde–style lead characters, including a woman named Lucia and her unnamed counterpart, but it’s not really clear what they’re up to (aside from the obvious crime).</p><p>And that’s it really. Even the official press release didn’t detail much more, saying simply that the game “heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series yet.” Anything else we know about the game (which isn’t much) comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/19/23360773/gta-6-leak-confirmed-hack-rockstar-games">a massive leak back in 2022</a>.</p><p>Even still, the trailer does a remarkable job of setting up what players are actually in for. Because really, <em>GTA</em> is a vibe. The series has never had the best action or driving or shooting. Instead, what has turned into a behemoth following <em>GTAIII</em> is the huge, expansive worlds it lets players explore. Even as open world games from other developers have continued to impress — whether it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> in Japan</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary">Nintendo expanding Hyrule</a> — there’s still nothing quite like Rockstar’s realistic rendition of Americana. And the initial <em>GTAVI</em> trailer promises just that, only bigger, and with an absurd Florida twist.</p><p>Rockstar is one of the few developers that can not only make a game of this scale, but also afford to take its time like this. <em>GTAV</em> is a cash cow, and in between the studio has also filled that time up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4">a new <em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a>. When announcing today’s delay, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">Rockstar explained that </a>“the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.” The hype for <em>GTAVI </em>has hit such a degree that it <em>has</em> to be right at launch — and when we’ve already waited 12 years, what’s one more?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While these goodies are immediately beneficial, <strong>you should leave them alone as your patience will be rewarded later on.</strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>After entering the third act of the game, you’ll unlock the ability to fly around with Esquie. Fly to a floating island near the Spring Meadows area called The Fountain and you’ll find Blanche.<strong> If you’ve spared Jar, as well as the other Nevrons that provided quests throughout the game, Blanche will reward you with 100x Colour of Lumina</strong>.</p><p>However, <strong>if you’ve killed any of those Nevrons, Blanche will attack you</strong>. It’s a very high level fight as it’s considered an end-game quest. You’ll want to be at least level 80 if you intend to take him on. Defeating Blanche will earn you 10x Colour of Lumina and 2x Grandiose Chroma Catalyst.</p><figure id="" data-id="af357c1ee207fa7b337824f65fee5e9c" data-recommend-id="image://af357c1ee207fa7b337824f65fee5e9c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune chats with a Nevron." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lune chats with a Nevron." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af357c1ee207fa7b337824f65fee5e9c" data-recommend-id="image://af357c1ee207fa7b337824f65fee5e9c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune chats with a Nevron." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So you can either choose to attack Jar to get some short-term games, but waiting till much later on will net you an even greater reward. I mean, 100x Colour of Lumina is sure worth it. Having a substantial number of these can really bolster up the amount of LP each of your characters have. A paltry number of 3x Colour of Lumina from <strong>killing Jar doesn’t really have any benefits at the beginning of the game when you don’t have many skills anyway</strong>. Sometimes it pays to not be a jerk! Jar didn’t do anything wrong.</p><p>Or if you <em>really </em>want to be a dick, after getting the 100x Colour of Lumina from Blanche, you can go back to the Spring Meadows to kill Jar and claim those extra rewards.</p><hr><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
