That game’s ending moved the franchise forward about 40 seconds and seemingly set up the next main entry in the award-winning sci-fi shooter series.

(Source 2 is Valve’s main engine, and the company has a history of leaving behind bits of code and data from other games in updates as all of its projects use the same engine and tools.) </p><p>As explained in the video, we know that Valve and the<em> Half-Life: Alyx </em>team started pre-production on a different game during the development of that VR title. </p><p>In 2021, dataminers discovered its codename was <em>HLX</em>. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-new-shooter-deadlock-neon-prime-moba-pc-1851493739&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-new-shooter-deadlock-neon-prime-moba-pc-1851493739"><em>Deadlock</em>, a different recently leaked Valve game</a></span>, was long thought by some to be <em>HLX</em> or what the project had evolved into. Others maintained that <em>Deadlock </em>(<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/T7KuuJO_lqw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/T7KuuJO_lqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which was known internally as <em>Citadel</em></a></span>) was separate from <em>HLX</em>. It was hard to say, as data mining is tricky when you don’t know how many projects a studio is working on or the status of each game.  But now that we know what <em>Deadlock </em>is, and that it’s not a <em>Half-Life </em>game, it’s become easier to start piecing together <em>HLX </em>using datamined code. </p><h2 id="h1351"><a id=""></a>White Sands aka <em>HLX</em> might be <em>Half-Life 3</em></h2><p>“<em>HLX </em>seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR<em> Half-Life</em> game, something that seems too good to be true, and something that I wanted to be very sure of before going live with any of this information,” explained McVicker in his new video. <br></p><p>According to strings of code found in Valve’s <em>DOTA2</em>, the character in <em>HLX </em>(which is believed to be<em> Project White Sands</em>) wears an HEV Suit, goes “offworld” at some point during the game, and encounters things like “storks,” “pentatanks,” “feral man hacks,” “Xenogorillas, Xen Jellyfish, and Xen Swoopers.” (Xen is the dimension you visit at the end of the original <em>Half-Life.</em>) It’s believed that some of these enemies or creatures were planned for <em>Alyx </em>but got cut and have instead made their way into <em>HLX </em>aka White Sands.</p><p>Toward the end of the video, in a section clearly labeled “speculation,” McVicker asks himself if this leaked game is <em>Half-Life 3</em>. And after a pause, he says: Yes. </p><p> “I think this is a non-VR <em>Half-Life</em> game [in which] you play a HEV Suit-wearing character in development at Valve Software that has been in development since <em>Half-Life: Alyx.” </em></p><p>Of course, until Valve confirms any of this, we won’t know for sure. It’s always possible—and this has happened before—that the project won’t be finished and won’t ever see the light of day. We just have to wait. But if devs at Valve have been working on <em>HLX </em>aka White Sands for about three-to-four years so far, we might not have to wait too long before the next <em>Half-Life </em>game—<em>whatever </em>that ends up being—is officially revealed. </p><p><em>&nbsp; .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-console-wars-card-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new physical card game, ‘The Console Wars, ‘ has <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xboxera/console-wars-the-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">just launched on Kickstarter</a> and takes some funny jabs at the entire gaming industry.</p>



<p>The new game has been launched on Kickstarter by Xboxera, who say the game is a “satirical, parody-filled spin on the gaming industry”. Its reveal trailer featured none other than actor and game developer Abubaker Salim, who narrated what The Console Wars is. You can watch the reveal trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="#SecretProject reveal livestream" width="1200" height="900" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/720TrCCr4tw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<div><p>The press release reads,</p><p>“In order to win the Console Wars,&nbsp;<strong>content is king</strong>, and intellectual property ownership of the best games is&nbsp;<em>everything.</em></p></div>



<p>In order to emerge victorious, players will need to battle for ownership of&nbsp;<strong>4 full sets of IP</strong>&nbsp;across multiple genres, from action-packed first-person shooters, iconic platformers and deep, complex RPGs.</p>



<p>Throughout play, you’ll try to amass as many fans as you can – without them, you have no momentum, and arguably no platform at all – so keeping fans is&nbsp;<em>critical</em>&nbsp;to holding on to your precious gaming franchises.</p>



<p>Will you emerge victorious? Can you survive the relentless ups and downs of the video game industry? Find out if you have what it takes to truly win the Console Wars by backing us on&nbsp;Kickstarter&nbsp;today!”</p>



<p>The creator of The Console Wars, Jon Clarke, Co-founder of XboxEra said,&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Console Wars” is something the entire industry knows about, and actively dislikes. So what if we took all that toxicity; all that online hate – and turned it into something positive and fun? Something where we could all collectively point and laugh at how ridiculous the very concept of ‘console warring’ is? That’s how Console Wars The Card Game came to be.</em></p>



<p><em>Inspired by many of the card games I already play, I wanted to make something even more strategic, vicious and hilarious. As I’ve witnessed with the playtesting over the last year, I truly believe that’s what Console Wars The Card Game is!”</em></p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/xboxera/console-wars-the-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">back The Console Wars on Kickstarter here</a>.</p>

The page hinted at a console with a “7-inch or 8-inch display,” an HDMI port, and dual fans — things the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">original Legion Go</a> lacks — before it was apparently removed.</p><p>You can still find the FAQ on The Internet Archive, where I found snapshots as far back as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504094510/https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/legiongo/">May 4th, 2024</a>, and as recently as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240804194607/https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/legiongo/">yesterday</a>. In addition to those details, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/the-lenovo-legion-go-pc-gaming-handheld-is-getting-a-smaller-s-model-and-we-now-have-more-details"><em>Windows Central </em>suggests</a> that the console will be named the Lenovo Legion Go “S,” not “Lite,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165835/what-will-the-lenovo-legion-go-lite-look-like">as has been rumored</a> until now. </p><p>The current version of the Legion Go features an 8.8-inch screen and a single fan and outputs video over USB-C. The FAQ only mentions dual fans, which led <em>Windows Central</em> to speculate that the slip represents an overall refresh for the system. Lenovo hasn’t announced these details, however, so do take this all with a grain of salt.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213086/plastic-apple-watch-se-3rd-generation-colors-kid-friendly"><h2>The plastic Apple Watch SE could be for kids, and that’s actually exciting</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/4/24213268/openai-chatgpt-text-watermark-cheat-detection-tool"><h2>OpenAI won’t watermark ChatGPT text because its users could get caught</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs"><h2>Intel is laying off over 15,000 employees and will stop ‘non-essential work’</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/3/24212291/game-informer-video-game-industry-mourns"><h2>The video game industry is mourning the loss of Game Informer</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212078/google-gemini-olympics-ad-backlash"><h2>Google pulls Gemini AI ad from Olympics after backlash</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-cute-throwback-rpg-super-dungeon-muncher-the-dungeon-is-being-eaten-by-a-monster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>What is it with monstrous eating mechanics in games of late? Last week it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/post-soviet-horror-trinket-kletka-is-an-endless-descent-in-an-elevator-that-wants-to-eat-you">carnivorous post-Soviet elevators</a>, now it’s retro fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> that devour themselves. In Super Dungeon Muncher, you are a teeny-tiny hero navigating a corridor-shaped map full of fireball traps and crumbling platforms, spinning coins and patrolling critters. That’s the “Super Dungeon” part. The “Muncher” part refers to the corpulent red monster guzzling the whole level in your wake.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Much like our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-6">The Maw</a>, the Muncher is a creature that operates according to its own understanding of time and physics. You and all the creatures within each dungeon map are locked to a grid and take turns to move, as in, say, Shiren The Wanderer. The Muncher, however, exists in real time, reaching gluttonous hands out to grasp the map’s edges and drag everything into its gullet. It’s sort of like rewinding a video of a printer, except that printers have better table manners.</p>
<p>In addition to staying ahead of the Muncher's gnashing molars, you’ll need to perform such traditional RPG duties as buying new weapons and kit from swiftly-masticated shopkeepers, finding keys for locks, and destroying or circumventing obstacles such as trees or cracked blocks. Speed is of the essence, but it looks like you can also delay or even deter your ravenous nemesis by feeding it less tasty things like toilets.</p>
<p>Super Dungeon Muncher is out today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3095800/SUPER_Dungeon_Muncher/">Steam</a> and eventually <a href="https://itch.io/profile/n-nexy">Itch.io</a> and Google Play.

After dozens of hours of dealing with ugly fused weapons and broken gear, you finally get the sword of legend. But it’s still far from perfect. While it can’t break, it can lose its power and have to recharge. The Master Sword from the game’s opening prologue doesn’t have that same weakness, though, and players have spent months trying to find a way to get that version instead. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196394" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That Master Sword is called MsgNotFound and players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-master-sword-glitch-1850474567&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-master-sword-glitch-1850474567">previoulsy found a way to bring it out of the confines</a></span> of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s prologue by breaking the game with glitches shortly after it launched. Nintendo patched that method out months later, however, and diehard fans have been trying to get it back ever since.

It’s not an easy process and it requires deploying dozens of glitches, but the end result is a Master Sword that you can swing as many times as you want without it ever losing its power. </p><p>The video is by El Duende 05 and is broken into seven parts that go through each step and glitch performed in detail. The road to recovering MsgNotFound was a group effort though, with special credit to user NghtmaR3 among others whose new SLD (Save Load Dupe) exploit is the step that breaks the seal Nintendo tried to put around all of these shenanigans. The whole thing feels like one of those old History Channel documentaries of archeologists trying to recreate the building of the pyramids. </p><p>Like I said, the current method is very long, requires an intricate stacking of game-logic-defying bugs, and is easy to mess up. Doing so will either force you to start over early on in the process or potentially nuke your end-game save, since one of the key things going on here is transporting the MsgNotFound Master Sword from one file to another. One phase revolves around stacking auto saves. Another has you fall through the bottom of the world. It’s almost like players are time traveling into the past and ripping the item out of its reality and taking it back with them between separate files. It’s one of the wildest things I’ve ever seen people try to pull off in a game. </p><figure id="" data-id="e28247aace73be8599de51852a3c6f3f" data-recommend-id="image://e28247aace73be8599de51852a3c6f3f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Link falls through the world.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s how El Duende 05 describes the final steps in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> glitch jargon: “Transfer both a shield and weapon to prologue to unlock those inventories 2) Place a portacull shield in position near Ganon 3) Set up LSW next to the map origin 4) Cull Link while lifting an object 5) Navigate between dimensions with no abilities to arrive at Ganon in the prologue 6) Send the sword back to your future self.” Or you can reference the entire written guide <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTa1hBai4UdGbmxf8n_M0fVK_2fMKcFzbJ_pSXGTDT8/edit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTa1hBai4UdGbmxf8n_M0fVK_2fMKcFzbJ_pSXGTDT8/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>.<br></p><p>This complex method works for 1.2.1, the current version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> which Nintendo graciously hasn’t patched since last August. Some players simply never updated their game and got the MsgNotFound Master Sword using the old method. Others are waiting for a more streamlined version of the latest method to be discovered before giving it a go themselves.  El Duende 05 said they expect one will be found soon enough. Hopefully, that happens before Nintendo decides to drop a new update out of the blue. We all deserve an unbreakable Master Sword in our lives. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA has just released a new deep-dive video for FC 25’s Ultimate Team game mode, detailing features such as Rush in Ultimate Team, FC IQ, expanded Evolutions community requests, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Ultimate Team Deep Dive" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcGJ4fe0iNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-5v5-rush-nbsp">5v5 Rush&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>The developers first reveal the details about EA FC 25’s new game mode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-details-new-game-mode-coming-to-ea-fc-25-rush/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rush</a>, and how it will work in Ultimate Team. Players can join this 5v5 game mode either with 3 of their friends or through matchmaking. </li>



<li>Each team will have an AI goalkeeper, and players can choose one player from their Ultimate Team club to control them for the entirety of the match.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Winning matches earns you points, which can be used to acquire Ultimate Team rewards each week. </li>



<li>Additionally, there will be Rush events throughout the season, allowing players to fetch more rewards and use various types of players.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-fc-iq-revamps-ultimate-team-tactics">FC IQ Revamps Ultimate Team Tactics</h2>



<ul>
<li>Through the improvements made towards Tactics, players have more control over how their team behaves on and off the ball in EA FC 25. Manager Items will now include Tactical Presets, so if a player wishes to apply Pep Guardiola’s tactics to their team, they can emulate that even better.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Additionally, players have more ways to apply their strategies with the addition of Player Roles, which replace Work Rates. Players can boost these roles through special items released throughout the year.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-25-ultimate-team-evolutions-nbsp">EA FC 25 Ultimate Team Evolutions&nbsp;</h2>



<ul>
<li>Many restrictions have been lifted from Evolutions so that players can use their favourite players more often. </li>



<li>Evolution cards have received cosmetic enhancements, too; players can now add backgrounds, borders, sounds and animations to their EA FC 25 Evolutions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>One of the community’s most requested features has arrived for EA FC 25’s Ultimate Team. There is now a storage space for the Untradeable Duplicates, which players can access through Squad Building Challenges.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Contracts have been removed for Players and Managers so they can keep playing for the club.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Rivals have also received some revamps. A new point system allows players to progress even when drawing their matches. Also, Relegations are back, as the total number of checkpoints for each division is being reduced.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Live Friendlies will no longer matchmake according to your Rivals rank. Instead, it will use the form as a factor to matchmake.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lastly, there’s a new Ultimate Team stadium for players to customise.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

Previously, they worked at both Naughty Dog and Sony Santa Monica before going to Striking Distance Studios to work on The Callisto Protocol and Unknown Worlds for the next <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-subnautica-game-is-not-a-live-service-title-dev-says/1100-6520935/" data-ref-id="1100-6520935">Subnautica game</a>.</p><p>After the launch of God of War Ragnarok on PS4 and PS5 back in 2022, producer Cory Barlog said that the studio was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-studio-has-multiple-projects-in-the-works/1100-6509199/" data-ref-id="1100-6509199">working on many different projects</a>.

		<p>Nintendo has released a new video for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, showing off the world and gameplay of the first mainline series game to feature a playable Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is coming out for Nintendo Switch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-lets-you-actually-play-as-zelda-this-september/">26th September 2024</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Traversing Hyrule Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>With a focus on exploring this latest iteration of Hyrule and how Zelda can get around with her new summoning abilities, the video takes us to the searing heat of Gerudo Desert, and the village of Gerudo tribe, and the Jabul Waters, which plays host to both the Sea Zora and River Zora, who don’t always get along. Kakariko Village is at the base of Eldin Volcano, but this has been transformed by the weird rifts that kicked this adventure into gear, and you’ll have to figure out how to reach the home of the Gorons. And finally, the Faron Wetlands are all kinds of leafy and play home to the Deku.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom will throw plenty of side quests your way, such as tryiing to held an elderly man cheer up his wife with a flying plant, save someone from being trapped up a wall, gathering up Cuccos, and dealing with a… a Tornado Ghost?</p>
<p>You’ll be able to zip around the world using Waypoints as fast travel nodes on the map, but Zelda will also be able to ride a horse and hop up and over obstacles. All you need is to learn the Carrot echo and you’ll be able to summon a horse wherever you are.</p>

<p>Smoothies take the cooking of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom and blend them into something a bit lighter, as you can combine gathered items to make smoothie combos. Electro Apple mixed with Floral Nectar, for example. You can also use outfits and accessories to enhance Zelda’s abilities, like Zora flippers improving her swimming.</p>
<p>Another ability was also revealed, in addition to the Echo summoning. For larger obstacles, Tri will help you with the power of Bind. This latches any object to Zelda’s movement, from a huge boulder to a half-buried chest, and even to summoned echoes, if you want to have an impromptu spiky shield. You can also reverse bond to map Zelda’s movement to other creatures and objects, switching back and forth.</p>
<p>Echoes of Wiszom borrows the visual style of the Link’s Awakening remake, which was a real highlight from a few years ago, which was already rather delightful, but will make for a real change in the series by having Zelda be the main playable character, using magical abilities and her wits, as opposed to combat in order to get ahead.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/two-new-fairy-tail-games-take-on-deckbuilding-and-volleyball-soon.944997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-new-fairy-tail-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kodansha Creators' Lab has announced two brand new&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>games in collaboration with series creator Hiro Mashima, and they're both landing in the next month or two.</p>
<p>According to a press release, the collaboration between the two began when Mashima "said he wanted to have a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>game made". Presumably, he's not counting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fairy-tail">RPG created by&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>developer Gust</a>.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a deckbuilding roguelite that will feature five playable characters from the manga, each of whom will have their own special abilities. It'll tell an original story and will revolve around exploring dungeons, building synergies, and taking advantage of your characters' unique strengths.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=b2ArHRao 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairy-tail-dungeons-combat.jpg?itok=tn0CrtG4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is a new roguelite heading your way later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on PC via Steam on August 26th,&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>is developed by ginolabo, the team behind&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/soulvars-review-biblical-demon-antivirus"><em>Soulvars</em></a>&nbsp;(which is also a deckbuilding RPG, so this appointment makes a lot of sense).</p>
<p>The second project to come from Mashima and the Kodansha Creators' Lab is&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail: Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a rather unique-looking pixel art proposition that marries beach volleyball with fighting game mechanics.</p>
<p>You'll be playing volleyball as (and against) teams of&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters, and each time you score a point, your magical abilities will become more powerful, granting you access to more spells with greater power.</p>
<p><em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>will support up to four players, and you'll be able to play either in local multiplayer or via Steam Remote Play.</p>

<p>This one's taking a little longer to cook; it'll launch on September 16th.&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc&nbsp;</em>is being developed by tiny cactus studio, whose work you may know from&nbsp;<em>Super Glitter Rush&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dimension Tripper Neptune: Top Nep</em>.</p>
<p>To commemorate the announcement of&nbsp;<em>Beach Volleyball Havoc</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em>-themed art contest is also being held, so if you fancy drawing&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>characters in beach attire, you can <a href="https://daysneo.com/award/fairytailbeachvolleyball.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the contest and its rules out here</a> (although it's in Japanese, it looks like it's open to anyone).</p>
<p><em>Fairy Tail: Dungeons&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305500/FAIRY_TAIL_DUNGEONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a> on August 26th, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116680/FAIRY_TAIL_Beach_Volleyball_Havoc/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Beach Volleyball Havoc</a>&nbsp;</em>follows not long after on September 16th.</p>

            <p>Forthcoming action-RPG Phantom Blade Zero developer S-Game says that as it believes in "making our game accessible to everyone", it has not "ruled out any platforms".</p>
<p>Confirmation came via the studio itself, which took to social media to clarify its stance after several media outlets reported an unnamed developer <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/">said</a> "nobody needs Xbox".</p>

<p>S-Game has distanced itself from the comments, saying they do not represent "S-Game's values or culture".</p>

<p>"We want to clarify that these claimed statements do not represent S-Game’s values or culture, as we believe in making our game accessible to everyone and have not ruled out any platforms for Phantom Blade Zero.</p>

<p>That's according to the game's director, Soulframe, who recently opened up about its world design.</p>
<p>"It's just like the old Souls games," Soulframe said at the time. "You move around and explore in a seamless map, it's just not a huge open-world map. But every region is connected together seamlessly."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>One, if not the most popular, mini-game seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be revamped for the third and final part of the trilogy, according to the game's director.</p>
<p>As reported on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/neo_aoshi/status/1819841781204156672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1819841781204156672%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@neo_aoshi</a>, during a panel at the Otacon anime convention with producers and voice actors from the game, director Naoki Hamaguchi talked about the Queen's Blood mini-game, revealing that he has received many requests from fans regarding a real-life version of the card game. While he couldn't confirm one would be coming, he did reveal that a revamped version of the mini-game will be included in the third and final entry in the series.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy series is no stranger to card mini-games like Triple Triad from the eighth entry in the series and Tetra Master from the ninth entry in the series, so the inclusion of Queen's Blood in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was extremely welcome, although it wasn't possible to challenge the vast majority of NPCs like it was possible in Final Fantasy VIII. Hopefully, the revamped version of the mini-game will allow players to play more games against a bigger number of opponents than Rebirth.</p>
<p>The wealth of mini-games is only one of the things that defines the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth experience. You can learn more about the second entry in the series, currently available exclusively on PlayStation 5, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-channel-from-hell-intro-video-reveals-upcoming-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1820475850942210368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios teased the intro video for its brand-new YouTube channel, “Larian: Channel From Hell.”</p>



<p>This anticipated YouTube channel now has an introductory video featuring host Aoife Wilson. It breaks down the content coming to Larian: Channel From Hell, as the studio expands its social presence.</p>



<p>Larian: Channel From Hell will include “regular streams and shows, featuring our development team, to patch explainers, unboxing videos and updates on what we’re currently up to.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Larian: Channel From Hell!" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOVdwbRhHYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The intro video elaborates that fans can also expect “behind the scenes footage” and documentary-style content. </p>



<p>Wilson also teases that Swen Vincke, founder and CEO of Larian Studios, will also make cameo appearances from time to time. </p>



<p>Vincke often interacts directly with fans. In March 2024, they also made it very clear that Larian is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not planning any Baldur’s Gate 3 DLC</a> or a sequel. Though fans are disappointed, many praised the open communication.</p>



<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1820480224766963996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Vincke also teased Larian Studio’s new YouTube channel. They mentioned some of the glimpses seen in the intro video. That includes “loads and loads of fun” from smashing ice sculptures to “game celebrities catching fire.”</p>



<p>Although Larian Studios is working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new games</a>, moving beyond Baldur’s Gate 3, fans still await its major Patch 7 update. Larian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-been-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently delayed</a> the closed beta for Patch 7, originally expected in late July 2024. </p>

<p>In the "about" section of their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glaucolonghi/">LinkedIn profile</a>, a developer supervising character development said they were "thrilled to be back" at Santa Monica after a brief departure to work at Striking Distance and Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"Santa Monica Studios presented the opportunity of coming back as character supervisor, looking after the entire Character Development pipeline, on their new IP, so here I am, thrilled to be back, working again with the crew and pushing characters in video games together," the developer said.</p>
<p>As you no doubt expect, the dev stopped short of revealing what, exactly, the IP is or even what kind of characters they were developing</p>
<p>The studio's debut game was PS2 racer Kinetica in 2001, but since the first God of War in 2005 Sony Santa Monica's worked solely on that series (besides assisting development on other projects). A brand new franchise, then, is an intriguing prospect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-launches-new-official-figurine-collection-with-aloy-varl-kratos-atreus-and-jin-sakai">Sony recently revealed a new range of figurines called "The Shapes Collection"</a> that includes characters from God of War Ragnarök, Horizon Forbidden West, and Ghost of Tsushima.</p>
<p>Developed in partnership with toy company Spin Master, Sony says the "highly detailed figures deliver the interactive storytelling element of these titles in an all-new way, extending the gaming experience from digital to physical".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might be a brand-new adventure, but the upcoming game brings back some well-known areas for fans to explore. A new trailer for the Switch exclusive shows off familiar spots like Gerudo Desert, Kakariko Village, and Hyrule Castle.</p><p dir="ltr">Focused on exploring Hyrule, the new Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom video highlights some of the major regions in the game. Gerudo Desert is "prone to frequent sandstorms," for instance, though there is an oasis where the princess can get some rest by creating a bed echo. There's also Kakariko Village within the Eldin Volcano area, a town that dates back to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on SNES.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DolGuwvAnfg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One intriguing plot point touched on in the new trailer is a conflict happening in Jabul Waters between the Sea Zora and River Zora tribes. Both groups seem friendly to Zelda, but not each other. Meanwhile, Deku scrubs can be found in the Faron Wetlands.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo noted that traversing the map in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be made easier in two major ways. First off, waypoints are littered across the land, allowing for fast-travel by warping. Then, the princess can call horses by creating a carrot echo to ride across Hyrule. The steads can even trample over enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Zelda won't just have horses to help her, either. The Bind ability seems integral to her adventure, letting the princess move massive objects while she runs around. This can also be used to pull treasures out of the ground or even reposition foes (maybe off of cliffs). Additionally, there's a reverse bond for Zelda to be transported by moving objects.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, there are smoothie shops across Hyrule. Zelda can blend together different ingredients to create scrumptious drinks for her own benefit, such as replenishing hearts with a Mixed Milk Smoothie.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-starring-zelda-launches-september-26/1100-6524358/" data-ref-id="1100-6524358">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was announced</a> not even two months ago at a Nintendo Direct. It will be the first mainline game in the franchise with Zelda as the protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-features-a-playable-link-according-to-esrb-rating/1100-6524962/" data-ref-id="1100-6524962">though an ESRB rating has mentioned Link is playable</a>.
