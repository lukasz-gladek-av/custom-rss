Speaking with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/dune-prophecy-showrunner-alison-schapker-interview-2024-12&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dune-prophecy-showrunner-alison-schapker-interview-2024-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Business Insider</em></a></span>, she explained how <em>Sisterhood of Dune</em> focused primarily on the time period in which a young Valya Harkonnen comes into control of the sisterhood, while she wanted to show the ripple effect of her decisions in shaping the Sisterhood into the Bene Gesserit.</p><p>“We also wanted to have room to create a rich television series, and see an older Valya, played by Emily Watson, a little more in control — where she took the sisterhood, and then how she was tested as part of a larger exploration of how it went from the Sisterhood to the Bene Gesserit. We wanted to look at the organization over time.”</p><p>The season finale of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> airs this Sunday, and follows a bombshell episode in which we find out that Sister Francesca (Tabu), mother of Emperor Javicco Corrino’s son Constantine (Josh Heuston), had been unwittingly reinserted into their lives to use her powerful influence to return the Bene Gesserit to a position of power within The Imperium. All that is left is to see who survives for the second season once the Spice has settled. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s not good, it’s pretty obnoxious, and it’s <em>wildly</em> derivative, but more than anything else—despite the actual enormous scale—it feels <em>small</em>.</p><p>Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson is extraordinarily good at doing what he does, no matter how little you may think of what that is. After years of battling against Indian music channel T-Series, Donaldson’s YouTube channel is now not only the most subscribed on the service, but ahead by over 50 million people. It’s  at 337 million subscribers—a number that’s higher than the current population of the United States. His mastery has never been delivering unmissable entertainment, but rather working the algorithm like a savant. The result is an extraordinary combination of ruthless cynicism and widely appealing, unchallenging...stuff. It might be Donaldson and his small group of friends visiting the world’s most expensive hotels, or challenging 100 people to stand inside a red circle, or giving away cars to strangers, but its faux-crude editing disguises meticulous craftmanship that maximizes “engagement.”</p><p>Which is all to say, you can hate him, his videos, his revolting commercialism, the way he tricks children into thinking the solution to large-scale environmental crises is to engage in performative nothingness, his stupid side-parting, whatever—none of it changes the fact that he’s very, very good at it.</p><figure id="" data-id="f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-recommend-id="image://f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2328" data-height="1310" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shot of the players on their podiums from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A shot of the players on their podiums from above." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-recommend-id="image://f2d355cb3fd20a7cf5facaca8c13e29a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2328" data-height="1310" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A shot of the players on their podiums from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which is what makes <em>Beast Games</em>’ peculiar flatness so bizarre. The formula matches that in a lot of his recent videos, which—ever since the astonishing success of his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0e3GPea1Tyg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">permission-free rip-off of <em>Squid Game</em></a></span>—have frequently featured competitive events: “Every Country On Earth Fights For $250,000,” “Survive 100 Days In A Nuclear Bunker, Win $500,000,” “100 Kids Vs 100 Adults For $500,000.” Each is astonishingly brief given the scale and time they take to film, those three running 18, 15, and 17 minutes respectively. It’s merciless, exhausting viewing, designed to capture its audience for the whole run, commercials not interrupting viewing but breathlessly crammed into the relentless footage, like a tennis ball machine rapid-firing images into your face.</p><p><em>Beast Games</em>, on the other hand, feels like a reality TV competition. Not a <em>good</em> reality TV competition. Not something visually beautiful and exquisitely edited, like <em>Survivor</em>, or something that demands the audience get invested in solving a central mystery, like <em>The Mole</em>, but just some events occurring one after another, while Donaldson endlessly shouts about how much money they’re giving away. It looks so oddly cheap, despite the ludicrous expense, like something filmed on a studio’s back lot.</p><p>Oh, and it so blatantly lifts from <em>Squid Game</em> as to just be <em>weird</em>. Sure, the comparison is unavoidable since Netflix remade the Korean drama as a U.S.-made reality show (albeit without murdering its contestants), but why on Earth did Amazon dress up the anonymous stage crew in hooded suits with emblem-blazoned face masks? Why deliberately force that association? Let alone have contestants sleep in rows and rows of bunk beds, all wearing costumes with their number written on their chests and backs. But cheap-looking versions. It’s like trolling, but where <em>Beast Games</em> is the victim of its own troll.</p><figure id="" data-id="4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-recommend-id="image://4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2345" data-height="1319" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The city built for the show." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The city built for the show." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-recommend-id="image://4b555b2eb92127784b161f93b998e09e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2345" data-height="1319" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The city built for the show." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like a lot of 2000s game shows in the wake of <em>The Weakest Link</em>, <em>Beast Games</em> relies heavily on forcing people or groups of people into making selfish decisions, here in order to proceed from the starting 1,000, as the numbers are whittled down. And, to be fair, these are often interesting dilemmas. In the first episode, the 1,000 players are stood on 1,000 podiums in a vast studio, and some CG trickery gives the impression there are vast drops between them (it turns out there <em>are</em> big drops between them, as eliminated players fall through trapdoors in their podium that presumably drop them into sponge pits—and there’s no getting away from how incredible it was to watch that happen to a hundred people, falling a split-second after the last). Donaldson then brings out “bribes,” his trademark briefcases filled with $10,000, and if anyone chooses to eliminate themselves from the game in exchange for the sums, their entire row is eliminated too.</p><p>This same formula is then beaten half to death over the first two episodes that were released today, although, again, it can be compelling. Primarily because you get to scream at your TV, “It’s IRRESPONSIBLE not to just take the money!” and then talk among yourselves about how a guaranteed $100,000 now is the correct, perhaps even moral choice, over a one-in-a-thousand chance at $5 million after multiple, unpredictable events, which you already know are more likely to see you eliminated based on someone else’s actions rather than your own failings.</p><p>However, by the second episode’s cliffhanger you will witness gobsmacking stupidity in a vastly larger version of the above. “How can I betray these people I’ve grown to love like family over the last three hours for a paltry life-changing amount of money?” these ridiculous people ponder, when the alternative is...carrying on playing in an attempt to beat them to winning the money so they won’t.</p><p>There are other oddities, like the moment you see a massive Feastables banner in the “city” they built for the event, as if $100,000,000 wasn’t enough money that Donaldson didn’t demand product placement. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lunchly-lunchable-mold-ksi-rosanna-pansino-1851677305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mr-beast-lunchly-lunchable-mold-ksi-rosanna-pansino-1851677305">Lunchables are entirely absent</a></span>.) Or indeed the existence of that “city,” a smattering of buildings and some pretend sidewalks and lawns where the contestants spent an entirely unexplained and un-shown 24 hours between the two episodes. (The first episode ends with a 24-hour timer on a massive screen, and the second begins with it ticking to 0. Huh?)</p><figure id="" data-id="d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-recommend-id="image://d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2031" data-height="1143" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donaldson and friend presenting from the top of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Donaldson and friend presenting from the top of a tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-recommend-id="image://d1ebd7224e1d6afa305df6a282f8c32c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2031" data-height="1143" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Donaldson and friend presenting from the top of a tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But among all these <em>Squid Game</em> antics and mock-ethical dilemmas, there’s something that’s entirely missing: any sense of this being MrBeast.</p><p>Donaldson isn’t one of life’s great TV presenters, but he’s not incompetent, either. He says his lines (albeit in a whiplash-inducing combination of live and ADR), and while it’s fair to level him with the observation that he reacts like a bemused scientist on an alien planet whenever he directly interacts with the contestants, so do most TV game show hosts. But the result of this is that he feels like most other game show hosts, not MrBeast.</p><p>Also on the team are his usual YouTube cohorts including Karl Jacobs, Nolan Hansen, Tareq Salameh, and Chandler Hallow. Ava Kris Tyson is notably absent, having been in the middle of what proved to be a series of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxrn5k22p4o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxrn5k22p4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">false accusations</a></span> during filming, and is seemingly no longer a part of the crew. But, again, their roles on YouTube are to run around screaming and being childlike, which is deeply irritating to adults, and an absolute joy to children. Here, they seem to be intended to offer commentary on the scene, but each gets perhaps two lines over the two episodes. Karl, for whom I have a deep hatred due to hearing his unacceptable laugh so bloody often from my son’s tablet, delivers the best line throughout (as contestants fall through their podiums he notes, “The fall’s only scary for the first two minutes.”), but is otherwise mute.</p><p>The editing feels like TV. The camera work feels like TV. The presentation, the events, the obligatory confessionals with individual players, all just TV. TV presented by low-scale personalities, with low-scale production. And this should have been something else! It should have been that god-awful energy of YouTube!</p><figure id="" data-id="fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-recommend-id="image://fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2334" data-height="1313" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players trying to build towers out of foam blocks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The players trying to build towers out of foam blocks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon Prime / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-recommend-id="image://fbc429187df23889362d34ca0318a3b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2334" data-height="1313" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The players trying to build towers out of foam blocks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It might seem an odd complaint, that the show didn’t feel irritating enough, but if it’s <em>not</em> what MrBeast delivers, then what’s it all for? It’s certainly going to pull in an audience because of the name, but I’m not convinced it’ll keep it. Not least with the show being released weekly now, which is not how kids watch <em>anything</em>.</p><p>It’s notable that alongside the launch of the show, the MrBeast YouTube channel also uploaded a 24-minute video that shows his lo-fi means of reducing the number of players from 2,000 to the 1,000 that start the show. It’s designed to be a gateway, the YouTube video literally ending as the Prime show begins, imploring its audience to jump over and enjoy the first episode for free. And, like a thousand internet outlets are unashamedly also promoting today when “reporting” on the program, you’re supposed to pick up that 30-day free trial to carry on.</p><p>I think that’ll work at first, but I also think that silly, scrappy YouTube video was far more entertaining for the intended audience than the blandly tidied up and flattened Amazon show. (It also doesn’t hide that some people just walked off, fed up, during filming, and shows how easily <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-video-lawsuit-scandal-1851708322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-prime-video-lawsuit-scandal-1851708322">people would have been injured</a></span> during frantic events.)</p><p>And so, <em>Beast Games</em>, despite the number of players, the size of the sets, and the enormous prize, feels so strangely small. It feels minor, unimportant, uneventful.</p><p>I began by observing how good Donaldson is at what he does, no matter how much I, personally, find it deeply problematic. (My son loves him, and believes in his sticking-plaster philanthropy, and I struggle between letting him love a thing and sometimes feeling it’s necessary to say that he’s doing harm.) <em>Beast Games</em> isn’t what Donaldson’s good at, and that’s really strange. The result is something that’s...fine? Small, unimportant, but fine. Just not what it could or should have been, no matter how little I’d have wanted to watch that.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The morning after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher IV</a> was officially revealed at The Game Awards, GameSpot had the chance to sit down with the game director Sebastian Kalemba and executive producer Małgorzata Mitręga. Although the interview was primarily focused on the reveal trailer, we did speak about Gwent, in-game romance, side quests, and the gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer officially revealed that Ciri will be the protagonist for the new Witcher saga. In the video, she hunts a new monster based on Serbian folklore called the Bauk--a spider-like creature that gets in the heads of its victims before killing them. As part of our interview, we also got to hear a little about the inspiration for the new monster and more of what to expect from the much-anticipated sequel.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: How are you both feeling after the reveal?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sebastian Kalemba: </strong>I feel relieved, super excited, and happy. A little bit tired, but that's good, to be very honest, because we just entered production. But I'm super, super, super happy with the reaction we got so far, and we've been preparing for this moment all year and it was a really, really exciting experience. I was visualizing this moment for months and finally it blew up and I'm super happy. The team is excited and the team really deserves this moment. We finally don't have to talk about this project with the codename Polaris. We can call it Witcher IV. We can say it aloud that Ciri is the main protagonist and it's a new saga and it will take place in new regions of the world. These things we can finally reveal, and focus on the production and kick off a new year in the second with great energy.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To speak on Ciri a little bit, was that a hard decision to go with Ciri as the protagonist or was that pretty obvious from the beginning?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>It was an obvious choice, and I remember nine years ago we already made this call. [...] So it wasn't a hard choice. We decided [to] put the spotlight on Ciri because she deserves it. She was running most of her life and this is the moment for her to define herself. This gives us more room to expand the franchise here and there, but also to be able to tell the origin stories so new players will be able to experience this world from a different perspective but in a very appealing way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Małgorzata Mitręga: </strong>This is a new protagonist--a new adventure--and it's the beginning of the saga, right? So this is a fresh start [that pays] a lot of respect to the sentiment to the previous installments.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk about the regions where it takes place or at least one?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM</strong>: We can refer to the trailer, right? It's far north, in an isolated village. The trailer is showing the experience of what you [can expect] for the side content for the game. It won't be one-on-one because it was custom-created for having a consistent story that shows everything we want to show to the world [at this time]. But a lot of that comes from the game itself, and the assets are actually from the game. So it's a pre-render on the custom build, but it's an engine [with assets] from the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418436-3.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418436" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418436-3.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418436"></a><figcaption>The Witcher IV</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418436-3.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about shifting the focus to Ciri, in terms of storytelling?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK:</strong> So let's look at Ciri also through the prism of the trailer because when you look at this, there are no surprises. We specifically wanted to tell the story of a young girl that is not able to confront her destiny, [something Ciri can relate to]. Ciri was running for almost her whole life, and she finally found peace in Kaer Morhen. [...] That's why she's the very first witcher by choice. She decides to become a witcher because [she enjoys it]. It gives us a lot of room to explore some really cool emotional stakes, and some cool tropes to tell some great stories. There are common denominators [between her and Geralt] like the way she fights and the way she behaves, but she's also very passionate, very determined, and very engaged in anything she encounters and this is what we love [about her].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>She's [also] younger [and] more agile. Of course she [can also do more magic than Geralt] so it gives us [more to work with] when it comes to the gameplay. And you can see a glimpse of it in the trailer. We introduced a chain, so there are different tools and there will be more of them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK:</strong> Małgorzata [also] mentioned the spell. Ciri is not a regular human being. She's a source.</p><p dir="ltr">That makes her a special and super-powerful being. What does it mean? It means that you can control or at least sense the magic in the world. So in the trailer, she is simply using [the water as a source] to create a powerful spell.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I haven't read the books in a while, but when she trained at Kaer Morhen, she never actually went through witcher school, and never underwent the Trial of Grasses.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>Yes. We cannot explain what happened [yet], but for those who played the previous game, know she was not mutated back then, [but she has] definitely passed the Trial of Grasses [at this point in the story]. This also gives us a lot of possibilities for her to become a true Witcher and still find how she wants to perform that on her own terms. And the player will be able to grow with her and help her to make those choices.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I imagine balancing gameplay will be an interesting challenge considering how powerful she is canonically.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK:</strong> Yeah, that was one of the things that we solved at the very beginning of pre-production. Yes, she was OP in Wild Hunt and there was a purpose behind this, but here [we want to give] you an opportunity to build her up in your way, with the tools we'll give you and with the stories you will be able to experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418437-4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418437" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418437-4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418437"></a><figcaption>Ciri using a spell in The Witcher IV</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418437-4.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the monster that was shown? I know that's a new monster for the Witcher, but I think it's based on Serbian folklore.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM</strong>: Yeah, it's based on Serbian folklore. It's more than a little bit [inspired actually].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>We pay a lot of attention to everything but [especially] to the monsters. That's at the center of [a monster slayer's world], right? And Ciri is a monster slayer. The Bauk is a very special being. It is a deadly monster that's complex and intelligent. He senses your fears and he's able to play with your mind. He makes you dizzy [and] lost. Then he attacks in a moment when [you're confused]. You can experience it while watching [the initial confrontation in] the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>We wanted to show that the Bauk is a very complex monster and you can experience more creatures like that during the game. We want to introduce new monsters, for sure, but of course, there will be a variety of them. [Monsters are one of the] most important elements of the Witcher world, right? But they're always connected to the region, to the location, to the people around them, to the environment, [and] to the story.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gwent?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>I'll be honest with you, I was impressed by the amount of people that said, "Gwent 2.0." [There's been] so much positively [around] Gwent. And what I can say is, it's a part of this world.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>We love it and it's important. And also we love our community.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>It's very important and we hear you guys. We hear you and don't worry, all right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418438-5.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418438" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418438-5.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4418438"></a><figcaption>Ciri getting ready to swing her sword in The Witcher IV trailer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4418438-5.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>When it comes to romance, what can fans expect? Will there be any in The Witcher IV?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>Absolutely. It's a part of the way we make games. It is a part of human nature. It's a very normal thing. Without that I think we wouldn't be able to tell the very full story.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM:</strong> It's an important part of life.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>SK: </strong>But as always, we want to pay a lot of attention to it and make it super compelling and very meaningful. So it's not just to make a romance for the sake of making a romance. That's not the CDPR way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>CD Projekt Red is known for their side quests. Have you guys thought about how you plan to push side quests even further?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>MM: </strong>Yeah. We are always pushing further with each and every game. We will learn from the previous games and also look at what's happening in the market. You can expect us to. With our ambition, it will be nothing less. But yeah, we are looking forward [to exploring choices and consequences further]. To surprise the player, and to show them you don't really have control of [everything]. You think you're doing something and then it's the other way around. We also want to push how the side content and main content [are connected]. And also with Ciri herself [and how her growth is affected], right? For sure, we will look there to push the boundaries further.</p><p><strong>SK</strong>: Yeah, exactly. We want to make them meaningful, and we want to make sure that the consequences are visible. So you [feel as though] you had an impact either on an NPC or world in general. [These complex decisions are] why our games have long tails, right? Because of these choices and consequences [add a lot of] re-playability. You can experience the game a little bit differently here and there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-true-horror-of-fortnites-skibidi-toilet-crossover-is-finally-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The dreaded and feared Skibidi Toilet has reared its truly ugly head in Fortnite at last. The rumored update officially dropped in the game last night, and so far it's prompting reactions of skepticism, confusion, and delight from the Fortnite community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First off, let's talk about the crossover itself. We first learned about it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-is-seemingly-coming-to-fortnite">earlier this week via leakers</a>, followed up by a confirmation from the official Fortnite X account of a toilet, plunger, and camera emoji in succession and a date: December 18, 2024. The actual update went live last night, and includes a Skibidi Toilet bundle on the item shop (discounted to 2,200 V-bucks at the time this piece was written) consisting of plunger pickaxes, a Plungerhead character skin, and two backpacks: one that goes with the Plungerhead outfit, and another that is the iconic Skibidi Toilet himself. There's also a lego version of the Plungerman skin.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">You know it. Now you can wear it! <br>Skibidi Toilet &amp; Plungerman. Available now in the Shop.<a href="https://t.co/DXMUbYvQLk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/DXMUbYvQLk</a> <a href="https://t.co/P8VUaJorLe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/P8VUaJorLe</a></p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1869534445272740000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's it for the collaboration, though with the recent return of the original map and the Flush Factory, there's already a conveniently toilet-themed location just waiting to be flooded with Skibidi nonsense:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of Skibidi Toilet to Fortnite is being met with some mixed feelings from the community. There are some naysayers who feel that Fortnite has gone too far incorporating the popular meme, suggesting it's juvenile and indicative of a slide into total absurdity for what's deemed worthy of a collaboration:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the vast majority of folks seem to range from mildly amused to chaotically delighted, even the ones who have no idea what Skibidi Toilet is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, the verdict of the Fortnite community seems to be that the Skibidi Toilet addition to Fortnite is a good time, at minimum because the Plungerman skin is pretty cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you, like some members of the Fortnite community, have absolutely no idea what this toilet thing is, here's the quick rundown: Skibidi Toilet is a series of web shorts by Alxey Gerasimov published on YouTube via Gerasimov's channel, DaFuq!?Boom!. And by shorts, we do mean very short - early episodes are only a handful of seconds long, and were created with Garry's Mod using assets from games like Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike. The series features a toilet with a man's head coming out of it set to a mashup of the songs Give It to Me by Timbaland and Dom Dom Yes Yes by Biser King. While early episodes are somewhat nonsensical, as the series progresses a plot emerges about an arms race between the Skibidi Toilets (of which there are many of varying sizes and with different heads popping out) and a race of people with video cameras for heads. The plot progresses from there, more recently centering on a cameraman named Plungerman and involving alien Skibidi Toilets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The whole thing, while absurdist, is far more complex than you might imagine just from seeing the image of the head in the toilet. In fact, it's got enough going on (and is popular enough) that there's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay">reportedly a film and TV adaptation effort underway from Michael Bay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love Fortnite but Skibidi Toilet is still a bit much for you, don't worry. The game gets so many constant collaborations, the toilet-fest will quickly be drowned out by the next big thing, which happens to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-leakers-say-mariah-carey-will-soon-emerge-from-a-giant-block-of-ice-in-the-game">Mariah Carey emerging from a giant block of ice to ring in the holidays</a>.

			<p>This week, those who are interested are being given the opportunity to try out Escape from Tarkov: Arena. The free weekend will be starting on December 20 at 4 AM ET / 1 AM PT / 9 AM GMT and will finish on December 23. This gives you enough time to experiment and have fun in Escape From Tarkov: Arena and see if this is <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-standalone-game-gets-new-teaser/">a game</a> for you. If this is something you want to get stuck into, all you have to do is register on the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and then install the launcher. From there, you'll be good to go and will get to participate in the free weekend.</p>
<p>As an additional gift for participating in the free weekend, players will all receive a unique Snowman T-Shirt, which is rewarded to players who complete the special quest given to them. Regardless of whether you own the game after the free weekend is over, the item will remain in your account permanently, which also includes being in the original Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p>During this event, there will also be a small Twitch Drops campaign, which will allow you to get some free extra rewards by watching streams in the game's category. This includes rewards such as in-game currency and exclusive holiday-themed Oakley SI Gascan White Glasses and the Winter half-mask to wear while battling it out for survival in Tarkov's arenas.</p>
<p>Along with the free weekend, Patch 0.16.0.0 will be released for Escape From Tarkov. When this patch is released, all data on the server will be wiped. This is because the game will then be transferred over to the 2022 Unity engine, along with sound system improvements and a refresh of several locations within the game.</p>
<p>Once this has happened, the Winter Drops Event will take place, and players will be able to get their hands on some more goodies in-game to kit them out and give them the festive spirit.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't any details about the upcoming patch, but it's been confirmed that details regarding the patch and the full schedule for the Winter Drops Event will be announced soon so that you can keep up to date with what's happening in Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Escape from Tarkov: Arena?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/bring-in-holidays-with-first-warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> can now enjoy a song performed in-universe. Games Workshop announced an official Warhammer 40,000 Imperial Hymn in celebration of the holidays, allowing fans to praise the God Emperor of Man during the most wonderful time of the year.</p>

<h2>The Warhammer 40,000 Imperial Hymn Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/s48clzhx/praise-the-emperor-with-the-first-ever-official-imperial-hymn/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Community post</a>, Games Workshop revealed the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Imperial Hymn through a first-of-its-kind music video.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-sister-of-battle.jpg?itok=JDwL8wx_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-sister-of-battle.jpg?itok=IPUA3OH9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, humanity has no time for cheer, hope, or goodwill towards men. This is due to the authoritarian nightmare regime that is the Imperium of Man, demanding absolute loyalty to the eradication its enemies. Heretics, xenos scum, and the forces of Chaos must be given no quarter.</p>

<p>So how else can you celebrate the holidays in the grim darkness of the far future but with a hymn singing the praises of the all-powerful God Emperor of Man?</p>

<p>Given the franchise's rising popularity thanks to the sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> and its mainstream exposure through the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, it would makes sense that Games Workshop would go this extra mile.</p>

<p>In this regard, Games Workshop pulled out all the stops for the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Imperial Hymn music video. The video itself has the song being sung by the Sisters of Battle. The audio plays out among animated vignettes of them on bloody battlefields and kneeling in prayer in gothic cathedrals.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-battle-vignette.jpg?itok=9-zDZriy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-battle-vignette.jpg?itok=HLi2aXM3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The hymn was composed by Jonathan Hartman, whose work has featured on several Warhammer+ shows. The choral singers were hand selected and directed by George Elekov in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p>

<p>For diehard fans, the lyrics are of special note. The hymn isn't sung in English but in the fictional language of the Imperium: High Gothic. This blend of Latin and other languages hasn't been explicitly spoken or seen before in Warhammer 40,000 works. If you're a huge fan of this setting's impeccably vast lore, this is for you.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you are interested in the vignettes in this music video, a limited supply of art prints will be available for purchase in the New Year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-want-to-live-in-the-silo.1065816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/silo-apple-tv-architecture-politics-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am an <em>enormous</em> fan of <em>Silo</em>, having first run into it as a comic (I missed the books, sorry!) and now as a TV series currently screening its second season on Apple. And while I love Rebecca Ferguson and I love Tim Robbins and I love everything the show is trying to say about class and power and the human spirit, I'll admit I am mostly watching it for the silo itself.</p><p>It's a <em>breathtaking </em>exercise in world-building. I want to visit. I want to touch it. I want to live there, in a way I have rarely felt about a fictional space before. Please note I'm not saying I want to live in <em>Silo's</em> fundamentalist autocracy, trapped in a class system that's so entrenched it's physically represented in the design of the structure itself. Nor am I advocating for some kind of future apocalypse that forces our entire species to live underground for centuries at a time, with the air above so toxic it causes almost instantaneous death. I just think the silo itself is cool, and I want to spend some time in it experiencing how it all works.</p><p>Let me tell you something about me that might help you see where I'm coming from here. I'm a freak for a fully-realised fictional space. The Hero's Journey is fine, romantic subplots and epic tales have their place, but if your game/show/comic/book manages to depict what it's like for the average person to live, work and die in its make-believe world, I am IN.</p><p>I'm often into fiction as an escape, so the more comprehensive the escape, the better. Do you know what my favourite scene in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> is? When they auction off the last tube of toothpaste in the universe. <em>Game of Thrones</em>? Any time someone is arguing about the budget. <em>Andor</em>? Seeing the bureaucracy in action.</p><figure><figcaption>The silo's monotonous design and vertical structure serves as a physical representation of its deep-rooted class system</figcaption></figure><p>A fictional world imagined in full is a magical place, allowing me to not just escape the real world and pay it a visit as long as a game or episode lasts, but for it to burrow its way into the depths of my imagination. I've found myself walking to work thinking about the relationship between Gas Town, the Bullet Farm and the Citadel. I've sat on the tram thinking about the daily commute for the civilians trapped inside the SDF-1. I've even been at a doctor's office thinking about all the hilarious and terrifying ways you can die in <em>Raised By Wolves</em>, and that once you were dead, what that would mean for whichever weirdo faction you'd been a part of.</p><p>I think about <em>Silo </em>a <em>lot</em>. As a fictional setting it is--despite, or perhaps because of its intimate focus--a complete world, one with history, politics, a social structure and conflicts between them. The 10,000 people trapped in that place are living full human lives, they're believing in stuff and all (mostly) working towards something. In every shot of Apple's excellent series you can single out any passerby in the background and wonder what their role is, which floor they live on, what that would mean for their family life, what their dreams for the future would be.</p><p>Which means I can imagine myself in there too. I can picture myself getting up in the morning in my surprisingly architectural apartment, showering, getting dressed and making myself a meal in the fully-functional kitchen everybody in the show seems to have. Maybe while turning for the door I'd brush my shoulders against the thick concrete walls, which have lasted many lifetimes and will last many more. I might kiss my wife goodbye, and any kids I was lucky enough to be allowed to have by the government, then head off to sit at a desk all day, crunching numbers and data on a whirring old green-screened computer, doing my part to keep the silo running and everyone, if not happy, then at least in line.</p><figure><figcaption>For a show that's essentially dystopian, the apartments are great. I love the tiles!</figcaption></figure><p>Or maybe I wouldn't! Maybe I'd be toiling away down in mechanical, looked down upon by everyone above me, yet also acutely aware that because I control the lights and air I hold the fate of the entire silo in my hands. I could be in recycling, the wizards of my age, the lucky few standing between the remnants of an advanced society and, if enough toasters and monitors were to break, the stone age.</p><p>Regardless of my job, I can feel the weight of each room's steel doors as they swing open, clearly designed to last centuries, and feel the CLUNK of their industrial-strength latches as they close. I can taste the food, as fresh as it could be given the circumstances, and I wonder if I'd ever get sick of the same meals over and over, or if that wouldn't bother me since I'd never known any other life. I can hear the clack of every beige keyboard, the hum of the screens, the whirring of the ventilation system keeping everyone alive since the air above is almost instantly poisonous.</p><p>Climbing up and down the stairs all day just to get anywhere would annoy me, the me living on this Earth in 2024, but the imagined me inhabiting the silo would probably benefit from all the exercise. And besides, there'd be no point complaining about it anyway, it's not like there's an elevator; these classes of workers need to be kept as physically separate as possible, the place was designed like that on purpose (as we're particularly finding out in the last few episodes!).</p><p>What would I, someone who had never known the outside, think about the outside? Probably whatever I was told! I've never felt the sun, never known the wind, never smelled freshly-cut grass or heard the roar of the ocean. All I've ever known is the concrete walls of the silo, so if something happened that challenged my established view of what was outside its walls, maybe I simply wouldn't believe it. Or maybe it would light a fire inside my imagination, and others, and there'd be revolution.</p><figure><figcaption>The silo is governed by an old, pre-apocalypse text known as "The Pact", which supposedly exists to keep everyone safe (and in line), but it can't account for every eventuality. </figcaption></figure><p>If the time came for that revolution, would I join in? I don't know, man! It's easy as someone watching this on TV to cheer for those wanting to get outside, or to at least affect change inside a silo, but if the silo had been all anyone had known for centuries, would I risk it all? I don't know!</p><p>It's not often I find myself daydreaming about what the <em>entirety </em>of a life must be like inside a fictional universe as much as <em>Silo's</em>, but then there are few fictional universes that have mapped out their structure and design so comprehensively. The silo was built to last, and it has lasted, and every shot and scene of this fantastic TV show revels in a place where 10,000 people live now, but where so many others have lived and died before them as well.</p><p>It's so thorough that it doesn't even feel like a set, so much as something that's been filmed on location. The silo looks like a place I can actually visit and walk through, learn about and explore. A historical attraction from a different timeline. A place I can touch and smell and wander its halls. Like I've said already, I don't want to live there forever, but it seems real enough that I'd at least like to visit.</p><p><em>Silo </em>might be a show about some of the last survivors on Earth, trapped forever inside a concrete bunker that sucks, but as a microcosm of a fully-realised human society--structurally and architecturally, all in the one place--it's a masterpiece.</p><figure><figcaption>We see every level and every class in Silo, from the elite to the workers. We also know they have pretzels and coffee, which is a surprise considering the circumstances. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <em>Oh, looks like Adam Savage did a special on the Silo's construction (for the show, not in-universe) recently, and it shows just how much attention to detail and thought and love went into it!

						<h5>Flint: Treasure of Oblivion</h5><p><span>December 17th, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>While a pirate-themed setting is perfect for video games, titles that allow players to travel on the high seas in search of adventure and treasure are very difficult to come by nowadays. For this reason, <a href="https://wccftech.com/flint-treasure-of-oblivion-to-launch-by-october-24-story-trailer-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flint: Treasure of Oblivion</a> by Savage Level caught the eye of more than a few players with its setting, story, and characters, as well as for its tactical gameplay, which combines a somewhat straightforward turn-based combat system with features lifted from trading card games, with a sprinkle of tabletop RPGs features on top, such as visible die rolls for attacks and defense.</p>
<p>While all of these features could have made for a very engaging experience, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion fails to deliver on most fronts. The foundation of a solid tactical role-playing game is definitely there, but the many issues of the experience prevent the game from being nothing more than an average and, more often than not, frustrating experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241216111120_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The story is definitely one of the best features of the game, if not the very best, mostly thanks to the main character, the legendary Golden Age pirate captain James Flint, who is also featured in a lot of pirate-themed novels, movies, and TV shows, such as Treasure Island by Rober Louis Stevenson. At the beginning of the game, the legendary pirate captain and his first mate, Billy Bones, manage to survive a shipwreck only to end up in a French island fort. A death sentence for their pirate activities is the only thing they have to look forward to. During their stay in the fort's prison, however, the ever-resourceful Captain Flint not only manages to get a whiff of treasure but also to find a way out of prison, fighting against other not-so-well-mannered prisoners and bribing corrupt guards. After making their escape, Captain Flint and Billy Bones will put together their own crew in the town of Saint-Malo and eventually sail on what is an enjoyable yet too predictable pirate adventure.</p>
<p>While the plot of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion may be a little straightforward, it is quite engaging mainly thanks to Captain Flint, who is an amazing protagonist and the perfect embodiment of what a pirate captain should be. Bold, brash, unafraid of taking action, often of the unsavory, violent type, with a quip always on his tongue, seeing the legendary pirate in action is very amusing, as much as his interactions with other characters are. At the very start of the game, for example, while stranded at sea, James Flint attempts to eat his first mate, who is presumed dead and does not stop even when the man wakes up, very well alive.</p>
<p>Enhancing the adventures of pirate captain James Flint and his crew in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is the way the story is presented. Doing away with the voice-acted cutscenes or the silent dialogue boxes seen in countless other games, developer Savage Level went with some gorgeous comic book panels that give the game a very peculiar visual novel feel that suits both the story and setting extremely well. It made the story so enjoyable that it would have made the flawed gameplay almost bearable, if there weren't so many issues that made playing the game both a slog and incredibly frustrating.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241217112241_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the surface, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the gameplay of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion. Its tactical turn-based combat, for example, is solid enough, and the card game mechanics are not a source of particular complication, as they essentially work as a regular skill and equipment system. Top-down exploration and traversal are not at all innovative, but they look functional in the context of this pirate adventure. What really breaks the game is the execution of these mechanics and the systems that power them.</p>
<p>Starting with combat, almost every one of its features and mechanics leaves something to be desired. The interface is too convoluted, requiring way too many clicks to perform the easiest of actions like moving, attacking, using skills, and switching characters. For example, after deciding to attack an enemy, you need to click on the enemy first and then on the dies that appear after the selection has been made. In addition, if, for some reason, you have spent one of the two APs to move and attempt to click on an enemy without selecting the attack option first, you may end up wasting an AP to perform a movement-based ability on the enemy, which can be used to knock down or push the enemy. This can be generally useful - if only the player is not performing these actions by mistake. The battlefields' visual design also makes combat even worse, as the interface does a terrible job of highlighting if it is possible to traverse certain areas.</p>
<p>The combat issues in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion don't stop at the poor interface. Besides the aforementioned traditional AP system, which grants two actions per turn per character, the game features a morale system that influences attack and defense rolls, a skill system, and an equipment system powered by cards. These systems are poorly explained by some very unexhaustive in-game tutorials that only manage to create more confusion. For example, I'm still not sure what truly influences the morale level for both player and enemy or the calculations that go into the die rolls. As a result, combat feels like it's purely dominated by RNG (random number generation).</p>
<p>Animations are also stiff and very basic, and sound effects are barely audible, which contributes to the overall failure to convey the visceral feel of pirates fighting for treasure and often for their own lives. Leveling up characters is just as needlessly convoluted as fighting enemies, as to improve characters' stats, the player must first share the bounty in a dedicated menu, then head over to the stats menu and pick which stat to increase. With so many games handling all of these features in a much better way, I was truly baffled at how Flint: Treasure of Oblivion fumbles so much in this regard.</p>
<p>Exploration and traversal don't fare much better. Besides being as straightforward as they appear, they suffer due to the confusing design of several locations, a map system that doesn't help players get their own bearings that much, and a bad camera that cannot be rotated during exploration. This feels like a major oversight, considering it is possible to do so during combat, although in a very clunky way.</p>
<p>What really makes Flint: Treasure of Oblivion very frustrating to play, however, are the controls. No matter if you're using a controller or keyboard and mouse, you are going to run into issues, and to reduce them, I essentially had to play with both. During exploration, for example, controllers work better, as you can directly control James Flint as if it were any old top-down game. With mouse and keyboard controls, however, the game is controlled as an old-school RPG, meaning that you have to click to get the characters to move towards any given location. The annoying clicking sound is the least of the problems here, as characters sometimes get stuck, and it is not possible to scroll the scene, as characters always need to be on camera.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241216141613_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In battles, on the other hand, using a controller led to one of the most frustrating gaming experiences I had all year. Selecting a hexagon becomes a challenge, as is doing pretty much everything else except speeding up the enemy turn due to a combination of imprecise controls and the poor design of the interface, which is the same no matter which control type the player is using. As such, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard controls during combat, which work reasonably well, even with the poor interface. In the end, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is possibly the only game on PC that has to be played with both a controller and mouse and keyboard for an "optimal" experience that still leaves something to be desired. Console players, on the other hand, won't have the luxury of multiple control options and will suffer from these issues the most.</p>
<p>Amidst all these issues, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion at least runs decently, at the very least. While the available graphics options are limited to a generic graphics setting, resolution, and framerate cap, with no support for any upscaler, the simple and not particularly detailed locations shouldn't be too demanding for most system configurations. On my machine (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at an average of 80 FPS&nbsp; at 4K resolution, high settings in most scenarios, so I expect even dated systems to run the game well at lower resolutions and settings.</p>
<p>Flint: Treasure of Oblivion has the foundation of a solid tactical role-playing game, but the game clearly needed more time in the oven to work out its many issues. As things stand at launch, however, it is only an average, often frustrating experience that is barely salvaged by the short 10-hour-long story, charming protagonist, and comic-book style presentation.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is a game that undoubtedly required way more time in the oven. While its engaging story, captivating presentation, and the charismatic pirate captain James Flint pull players into the adventure early on, the experience is marred by a horrendous interface, clunky controls, poor tutorials, and the subpar execution of several mechanics. As a result, the game is hard to recommend except to the most dedicated tactical role-playing game enthusiasts willing to overlook its many glaring flaws.</p>

In it, cats with both realistic coats and strangely colored fur prance the street, before the game's cat creator is revealed, which allows players to customize their cat's appearance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418370"></a><figcaption>The game allows players to create cats with unnatural fur colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whether players want a realistic-looking calico coat or a dye job that makes their cat look more like a Pokemon, the cat maker appears to provide customization for both cats' physical appearances and their clothes. In fact, the game comes with a whole wardrobe of clothing and accessories for players to put on their digital felines.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also shows off the game's worldbuilder, which appears to allow players to build oddly charming, alien-looking locales to house their furry friends in. Despite how visually odd some players have found the game, a representative for Catly developer SuperAuthenti says it finds the accusations of AI use surprising, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts" rel="nofollow ">claims that generative AI has played no part in the game's development</a>.
