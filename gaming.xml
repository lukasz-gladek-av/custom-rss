			<p>'CyberMP' is an upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 multiplayer mod that's currently in pre-alpha stage.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mode-was-canceled-due-to-the-games-rough-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled the multiplayer mode</a> for the Cyberpunk 2077 following the game;s rather rough launch. Initially started as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-a-smaller-project-thats-just-starting-monetization-will-be-wise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'smaller' project</a> for the action-RPG, CDPR decided to can the mode to focus on the game's main single-player experience. "<em>The priority was that the main experience will run for the people in a really good state. And essentially, the switch of priorities meant that other R&amp;D projects had to go away", </em>CDPR's Philipp Webe said in 2022.</p>
<p>Although the game's official multiplayer mode has been canceled, a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cyber_MP" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> team of modders</a> has been working on an unofficial mod for the game since last year. Over the course of the year, several short videos of the multiplayer mod in action have been shared, and we now have a gameplay video from YouTube channel 'JuiceHead'. You'll find this nine-minute-long new gameplay video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Actually Playing Cyberpunk 2077 Multiplayer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7oKJTufdwzU?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The mod is still in its&nbsp; pre-alpha stage, and no release frames have been provided just yet. The mod will allow Cyberpunk 2077 PC players to play the game with other players, but players won't be able to complete quest cooperatively. Don't expect this unofficial multiplayer mod to be released anytime soon, but we'll update you as soon as we learn more about the mod's progress.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this mod? Will you be playing it? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is available worldwide now for PC and consoles. The game launched rather roughly in late 2020. Although the game did indeed suffer from various issues upon launch, CDPR's VP of PR and Communications has expressed that the game was actually in a better state at launch than it was received. "I actually believe Cyberpunk on launch was way better than it was received, and even the first reviews were positive," CDPR's Platkow-Gilewski said last year. "Then it became a cool thing not to like it. We went from hero to zero really fast. That was the tough moment. We didn't know what was happening. We knew that the game is great, yes we can improve it, yes we need to take time to do it, and we need to rebuild some stuff."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/2k-games-appears-to-be-developing-an-unannounced-remake/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It looks like 2K Games is developing an unannounced remake of one of its franchises. As often happens in these cases, the rumor started when MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-2k-working-on-unannounced-remake" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> on a LinkedIn resume of a 2K Games 3D artist and Motion Capture Animator the following list of games:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Mafia game</li>
<li>New BioShock game</li>
<li>Supermassive Games project codenamed Erebus (and canceled)</li>
<li>Upcoming Unannounced Remake</li>
</ul>
<p>We already knew that Hangar 13 (which recently released Top Spin 2K25) was making a new entry in the Mafia franchise. Studio General Manager Roman Hladík <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mafia-game-is-in-early-development-at-hangar-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as much in August 2022, when the series was celebrating its twentieth anniversary:</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to confirm we've started work on an all-new Mafia project! While it's a few years away and we can't share anything more right now, we're really excited to keep working on this beloved franchise and to entertain our players with new stories.</em></p>
<p>The same goes for BioShock, of course. The new installment in the dystopian first-person shooter franchise was announced in late 2019, and yet Cloud Chamber is still <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ramping up recruitment</a> for the project. The third project is also interesting. Supermassive Games partnered with 2K Games to make The Quarry, which launched in June 2022 to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very positive (9/10) review here on Wccftech</a>. It looks like they were making another game codenamed Erebus; however, it was eventually canceled, which may explain <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-quarry-dark-pictures-dev-supermassive-layoffs-third-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the studio's massive layoffs</a> of a third of its staff a few months ago.</p>
<p>The news of the day is, however, the unannounced remake. Given the publisher's big portfolio, it's really hard to even figure out what it could be. Granted, it's not any one of their sports franchises since remaking an annual sports game wouldn't really make any sense.</p>
<p>That leaves mostly X-COM, Mafia, Civilization, Borderlands, and BioShock. However, Mafia already got <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a remake for the first game</a> and a remaster of the second game. BioShock also received remasters as part of the trilogy collection. Perhaps Gearbox's next Borderlands game (which had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be unveiled at Summer Game Fest 2024 but wasn't there after all) is actually a remake of the first one? That one got a remaster, too.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it's something else to look forward to from 2K Games. We'll keep you apprised on any further rumors and leaks on the project.</p>

			<p>HoYoverse's newest title, Zenless Zone Zero, has <a href="https://x.com/ZZZ_EN/status/1809527720768074217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 50 million downloads globally, and to celebrate the occasion, the developers have prepared an interesting gift.</p>
<p>Zenless Zone Zero was developed by HoYoverse, the studio previously known as miHoYo, and yes, you heard it right, they were the guys responsible for Genshin Impact as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/honkai-star-rail-trails-of-mediocrity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honkai Star Rail</a>. Both games have been very successful, and this third one has managed to hit 50 million downloads across the world just four days after the title's debut, which shows that the game is indeed a success in the community and the studio seems to be turning everything it touches into veritable gold.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zenless Zone Zero witnessed 35.7 million users in pre-registration, hence their active downloads are indeed a reflection of how the studio has managed to maintain the hype of their title. To celebrate the achievement, HoYoverse has announced an interesting reward scheme, which is as follows:</p>
<p><em>Dear Proxies: </em></p>
<p><em>Greetings! Since its release, Zenless Zone Zero has reached 50 million downloads globally.

Of course, to live up to everyone's expectations and truly become a city of miracles, we are aware that there are still lots of improvements to be made. We encourage all Proxies to provide feedback and suggestions via our official channels. </em></p>
<p><em>As a gesture of thanks for everyone's support, we have prepared a small thank-you gift! So, let us say it again — Welcome to New Eridu! </em></p>
<p><em>[City Entry Thank-You Gift]<br>
</em><em>Polychrome ×1,600<br>
</em><em>T</em><em>he thank-you gift will be issued via in-game mail within 24 hours. </em></p>
<p><em>[Eligibility]<br>
</em><em>Proxies who reach Inter-Knot Lv. 1 or above before the release of Version 1.1</em></p>
<p>For those who are unaware of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverses-latest-f2p-game-is-out-july-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, it features fast-paced action combat set in a post-apocalyptic world, with players able to control a team of up to four characters as you take on an adventure to the New Eridu city, which is a victim of a natural disaster called the "Hollows." The title was released on July 4 on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401?af_sub5=sns&amp;pid=CM_Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a>&nbsp;devices.</p>

<p>The qualifying portion of the Rainbow Six Siege category at the Esports World Cup is now closed and all the challengers have entered the line-up. It’s a stacked deck represented by the best Rainbow Six teams the world has to offer, but some expected competitors failed to make the cut. Now that the board is set, players and fans are preparing for the $2 million event, which will unfold between July 31 and August 4.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>It has been a successful sprint so far for the Esports World Cup. In the opening days of the event, we saw the Warzone tournament wrap up, followed by T1’s huge win over TES in the League of Legends category. Now, we’re preparing to watch the Rainbow Six Siege portion of the event unfold, which by numbers alone is one of the most valuable categories in the entire showcase, boasting a $2 million prize pool.</p>



<p>Before Rainbow Six comes around, seven more games will take to the stage, covering everything from Apex Legends to PUBG Mobile. It’s a stacked deck out there, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>Here’s every team that has made it into the Esports World Cup’s Rainbow Six Siege category:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FaZe Clan </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>w7m Esports </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>Team Liquid </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>FURIA </strong>– BR</li>



<li><strong>DarkZero </strong>– NA</li>



<li><strong>Luminosity </strong>– NA</li>



<li><strong>Spacestation </strong>– NA</li>



<li><strong>Team BDS </strong>– EU</li>



<li><strong>Wolves Esports </strong>– EU</li>



<li><strong>Into the Breach </strong>– EU</li>



<li><strong>Team Cruelty </strong>– LATAM</li>



<li><strong>Bleed Esports </strong>– APAC</li>



<li><strong>PSG Talon </strong>– APAC</li>



<li><strong>SCARZ </strong>– APAC</li>



<li><strong>Team Bliss </strong>– Oceania</li>



<li><strong>Geekay </strong>– MENA</li>
</ul>



<p>There were high hopes that C9 Beastcoast would qualify for the Esports World Cup, especially since the squad was on a high since winning the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in May. Unfortunately, the squad couldn’t clinch the qualifiers. </p>



<p>Going forward, the expectation is that the trophy will be lifted by the likes of FaZe Clan or perhaps Team BDS – both of these squads have been on fire of late and there’s plenty of potential there for a huge win at the Esports World Cup.</p>

<p>The second trophy has been lifted at the Esports World Cup, and this time, it was in the League of Legends category. In a dominant finish that saw T1 dominate the final stages of the tournament, history was made as Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok notched yet another accolade onto his belt. With the $400,000 grand prize having been issued to T1, alongside the 1,000 Club Championship points, the League of Legends portion of this prestigious event is now at an end.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-record">Another Record</h2>



<p>Faker led his team to victory once again at the Esports World Cup, storming through the playoffs and effortlessly trampling over Bilibili, Team Liquid, and Top Esports. It was a well-deserved victory, but it came with something of a sour taste as it was subsequently revealed that a record-low number of viewers tuned in to watch the iconic South Korean superstar win yet another trophy. This is likely because of the tournament’s setting and financial backing from Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>It was noted that 1.1 million peak viewers were recorded, but that’s nothing compared to some of the biggest League of Legends tournaments that T1 has competed in of late. Admittedly, Riot Games was a late arrival to the Esports World Cup, and it seems almost like the firm wanted to keep its involvement with the event on the down low.</p>



<p>Last year, T1 secured the top prize at the League of Legends World Championship, which marked Faker’s <strong>fourth </strong>Worlds title. There’s no indication that the world-class competitor will slow down, given that he’s one of the most recognisable forces in the esports world.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout: London Might Actually Be Released Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-might-be-released/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-might-actually-be-released-soon.921153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-might-be-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When Bethesda Game Studios pushed out the Fallout 4 next-gen update a couple of months ago, it did so without the consideration of developing mods, such as Fallout: London. This ambitious, game-sized creation has been in development for several years, and it boasts an entirely new world set in the heart of London, England and a voice cast that features some celebrity personalities. </p>



<p>However, when Fallout 4’s major update was released in April 2024, the team at Fallout: London was forced to indefinitely postpone the mod’s release based on the changes the update brought to certain constructs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-will-it">But Will It?</h2>



<p>It was recently revealed that Fallout: London is too big a mod to be hosted on Nexus, which is the leading mod repository for PC gamers worldwide. Instead, the mod will be available to download from GOG, and that’s the final barrier preventing the release of Fallout: London, it was recently confirmed. The team stressed that they’re simply waiting for ‘the green light’ from GOG once the platform has completed QA tests of the super-sized mod.</p>



<p>Fallout: London is expected to be around 35 GB in size and presets the player with several hours of content, even if shade has been cast against it by veteran fans of the franchise because of how lore-breaking it is. Over the years, some of Fallout: London’s development team have been hired by Bethesda Game Studios to work on official Fallout games, and the team has ebbed and flowed.</p>



<p>Following the most recent delay, it was believed by some (me included) that this mod would never see the light of day. It’s great that the work of the Fallout: London team is finally coming to fruition, but it’s ultimately a fantastical fan-made creation that wouldn’t technically fit in the canonical Fallout universe.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tibia-summer-update-2024/</link>

<p>Tibia is one of those games you’ve probably never heard of – but really should have. It was released way back in 1997, presenting players with a top-down take on the MMORPG genre, with the developer, Cipsoft, having created a world bursting with opportunities for adventure – but it was a very basic world. Over the years, Tibia was refined, but it never lost the charm that made it so popular with thousands of players.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Cipsoft released the Summer Update for Tibia, introducing a string of changes and quality-of-life improvements that were soaked up positively by the community. Even after more than 26 years, Tibia’s creators are still innovating and keeping things fresh.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-lead-the-way">Lead The Way</h2>



<p>Tibia wasn’t the first ever MMORPG to emerge – that credit goes to Neverwinter Nights, which was released in 1991. It <strong>is </strong>a contender for the title of the longest-running (and still active) MMORPG ever, though.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=7952&amp;fbegind=7&amp;fbeginm=6&amp;fbeginy=2024&amp;fendd=7&amp;fendm=7&amp;fendy=2024&amp;flist=11111111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the latest major update</a>, Cipsoft introduced a series of events and tweaks that are designed to make players’ lives a little easier. These improvements included a local ‘quick loot’ mechanic, better pack sorting features, and upgraded UIs. In terms of the more entertaining content, ‘Tibians’ were introduced to The Soulpit, a wave survival arena that can reward players with permanent boosts if they’re able to slay vicious creatures.</p>



<p>Two special events have risen in response to the Summer Update: Sweet Deams and Rise of Podzilla. They’re outlined in the below trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tibia - Summer Update 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1B_svcsK0e8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Elsewhere, Cipsoft has lifted the lid on a new mechanic called The Fragment Workshop, which allows users to ‘maximise the power of (their) gems and optimise (their) character for battle.’</p>



<p>Tibia remains a relatively popular MMORPG with plenty to offer, and updates like this coming a quarter of a century after the game was released are indicative of Cipsoft’s ongoing investment in the game.</p>



<p>The Summer Update is available in Tibia now.</p>

<p>Running 24-hours a day from 30th June to 6th July in Minnesota – and broadcast across the world on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">Games Done Quick's Twitch channel</a> – the in-person event was "filled with delightful moments", including everyone's favourite pup <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-the-moment-peanut-butter-becomes-the-first-dog-speedrunner-in-agdq-2024">Peanut Butter</a> playing Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>"The crowd roared at every successful pitch and bat, did the wave, and sang their hearts out with ball game chants," the SGDQ team said. "Other highlights were a coordinated dance of Herald of Darkness during Alan Wake 2 and a musical performance during the 1991 Western classic Sunset Riders."</p>
<p>Crowds gathered physically and virtually for speedy runs of other games like Elden Ring, Minecraft Dungeons, Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain, Halo 3, Old School Runescape, Evil Zone, and "much, much more".</p>

        <p>"Fight for the truth, awaken your resolve, and enter the tournament for the throne."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sega has dropped a fresh trailer for Atlus' new RPG, Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p>Revealed at a panel at this weekend's Anime Expo 2024, the new teaser gives "viewers an early peek at the turbulent events that kickstart the player’s journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio". You can check it out below:</p>

<p>The video description simply says: "Fight for the truth, awaken your resolve, and enter the tournament for the throne."</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio focuses on a young protagonist drawn into a magical election when the world's king dies. Any person of any social status can become the next king by gaining support of the population, leading to a world-spanning adventure and battle for the throne.</p>
<p>Players will be able to battle in real time with attacks and dodges, which ensures field exploration is dynamic and should make grinding quicker, but turn-based combat remains for traditionalists, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11, 2024</a> on PC via Steam/Windows, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen consoles. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is set to be a "culmination of our RPGs", said director Katsura Hashino, following the studio's work on the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona series. Its release marks the 35th anniversary of Atlus' first game. Hashino explained more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-fantasy-election-adapts-personas-social-gameplay">Metaphor's fantasy setting and election twist on familiar Persona gameplay</a>.</p>

So if you prefer digital games, you can purchase a key from Target that can be redeemed on the Switch eShop.

		<p>Has there ever been a better time to be an RPG fan? Genre aficionados are eating exceptionally well these days, and Metaphor: ReFantazio is nestling on the horizon with the potential to be the next essential purchase for those in the know. Adding to that hype, ATLUS have released an all-new story trailer at the Anime Expo 2024 panel, offering fans an early peek at the turbulent events that kickstart the player’s journey in Metaphor: ReFantazio.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Story Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5IWiqGKcQg?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today’s Anime Expo panel contained exciting new game details. Metaphor: ReFantazio’s Director Katsura Hashino and Character Designer Shigenori Soejima provided the packed hall with details on the game’s setting, characters, monsters and more. For those in the know, one of the reasons that Metaphor ReFantazio is such a big deal is that these are the creators of Persona 3, 4 and 5, arguably three of the most genre-defining RPGs of the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>You can definitely see that lineage in the visual and character design, with a similarly captivating anime-esque strand carryies through in both the animated cutscenes and in the moment to moment gameplay. There’s an interesting mix of real-time and turn-based aspects to the combat, and it all looks thoroughly enthralling at this point, and that’s before we even know how it all comes together.</p>
<p>Early tomorrow morning, ATLUS will also share details from the panel in a special “ATLUS Exclusive” Showcase – Story livestream on the ATLUS West YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@atlus">https://www.youtube.com/@atlus</a>) and Steam. A recording of the actual AX panel will also be available for viewing at a later date on the ATLUS West YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio will launch on October 11, 2024 on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Steam. Physical and digital pre-orders are available now. For more information and for links to pre-order, visit metaphor.atlus.com. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on this one as we get closer to launch!</p>

            <p>2K is working on an unannounced remake.</p>
<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-shupe-45aa09170/">LinkedIn page</a> (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-2k-working-on-unannounced-remake">MP1st</a>) of a motion capture animator who has been working at 2K for the last two and a half years.</p>
<p>Among the games you'd expect to see on the resume of a developer working at 2K Games – 2K25 WWE, NBA 2K25, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">upcoming Mafia game</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-game-lands-far-cry-and-ghost-of-tsushima-writer-as-narrative-lead">highly-anticipated new BioShock game</a>, to name but a few – there are also references to two unannounced games (one is a sports title) and an "unannounced upcoming remake".</p>

<p>Whilst it's not unusual for a studio with such a storied catalogue to be remastering or remaking classic games for current-gen systems, news of an "unannounced remake" has some players incredibly excited, not least BioShock fans.</p>
<p>It's been almost ten years since the BioShock trilogy was remastered, and there's plenty of appetite for a reworking of the first BioShock game, widely regarded as one of the best video games ever made.</p>
<p>But that's not all. 2K is also home to the Sid Meier games and Spec-Ops: The Line, another cult classic admired for its storytelling, so there's several games 2K could have pulled from the vault. Watch this space, eh?</p>
<p>ICYMI, BioShock creator Ken Levine is still not done with follow-up project Judas. But the game is inching closer, evidenced recently by its appearance in trailers and now, a marketing beat where select people such as Game Awards host Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">have now played it for a number of hours</a>.</p>
<p>On the surface, this is a BioShock game in all but name, with gunplay and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And this is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>.</p>

            <p>Manor Lords' publisher has hit back at claims the game is an "interesting case study in the pitfalls of early access", stating that assuming games can continue "endless growth" "causes so much trouble in the games industry".</p>
<p>Responding to a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215487585094094848/">LinkedIn</a> from Hinterland CEO Raphael van Lierop, Tim Bender – who heads up publisher Hooded Horse – responded with a lengthy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tim-hooded-horse_manor-lords-is-a-pretty-interesting-case-study-activity-7215509660999503874-5CO0/">post</a> of their own, suggesting that "if this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like [this]".</p>

<p>"This is exactly the kind of distorted endless growth/burden of expectations/line must go up perspective that causes so much trouble in the games industry," Bender wrote.</p>
<p>"Manor Lords just sold 250,000 copies in the last month – after selling over 2 million copies in its first three weeks – and has a Very Positive review rating of 88 percent with a median playtime of 8 hours 48 minutes per player (very long for any game, especially a recently released one).</p>
<p>"Players are happy, the developer is happy, and we as publisher are thrilled beyond belief."</p>
<p>"And yet here we are – Manor Lords is apparently a 'case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access' because the 'game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches' (one of the patch notes being called 'small' here runs over 3,000 words and over 10 single-spaced pages) leading to 'CCUs have plummeted since launch' (yes, we didn't maintain the 173,000 concurrent player peak) and the apparently dark reality that some people, after enjoying their purchase of a premium, single-player title, might decide to go on and play another game (The horror! The horror!)."</p>
<p>Bender goes on to say that before Manor Lords was released, they "had a chat" with its solo developer, Greg Styczeń.</p>
<p>"I told him that after release, he was going to hear from all sorts of commenters talking about missed opportunities because he failed to grow as fast as they wanted, and judging the game a failure by some kind of expectation they formed. I told him to ignore all that – to focus on his core vision for the game, and to keep in mind that the Early Access road is long and that he should not feel any sense of pressure from the expectations of others – for both his own health and stress levels over the coming years and for preserving the state of calm and peaceful mind that supports his creative vision.</p>
<p>"If this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like [this]," Bender concluded. "Success should not create an ever-raising bar of new growth expectations.</p>
<p>"Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust. And a release should not begin an ever-accelerating treadmill on which devs are forced to run until their mental or physical health breaks down."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-patch-makes-experimental-changes-to-tweak-balance-and-reduce-ale-consumption">A number of "experimental" changes were recently</a> made to Manor Lords to tweak the balance, including reduced ale consumption.</p>
<p>The update fixes a number of commonly reported issues, including "None" people spawning and not working; the game being stuck at the summary screen after a victory; weak archer damage; and overly high ale consumption.</p>
