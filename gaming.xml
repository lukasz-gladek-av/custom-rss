		<p>Some brand new gameplay footage for Ghost of Yotei showing Atsu using the yari, which is a spear, to take on a group of enemies on top of a bridge. This footage seems to come at a later point in the game, as the enemy soldiers are questioning Yari if she is her, which means her legend is already starting to spread through the land.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Yari Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/98KGbwncmwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, the yari gives Atsu a decent advantage from range allowing her to attack enemies without them getting close. The yari can also be used to close the gap too, with footage showing Atsu using the yari to launch a kick at an enemy allowing her to close the gap and strike them down. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. The game takes us from Tsushima to Set the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603.</p>
<p>Atsu’s story is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to be released on October 2nd for PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> isn’t a perfect game by any means, but that didn't stop it from syphoning all of my free time when it launched back in 2022. This was the first time in a while where I truly felt the desire to “catch 'em all”. While Arceus still borrowed a lot from the mainline games, it did enough to make the world of Pokémon feel fresh and alive in ways the franchise previously hadn’t for many players, including myself.</p>
<p>Legends: Arceus isn’t an open-world game, though the zones it offered still did a solid job of making me feel immersed in the environment. Not only would you find Pokémon walking around all over the place, you could sneak up on them and toss a ball without the need for a battle. This could backfire as a Pokémon might be alerted to your presence and lay the smackdown on you. Yeah, you - the trainer. There was a sense of danger and mystery that really couldn’t be found in any previous Pokémon games.</p>
<p>Now, even with all of my love for Legends: Arceus, I’ve been quite nervous to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. This whole city vibe hasn’t really won me over with the gameplay footage we’ve been shown so far, and while I enjoyed Mega Evolutions when they were introduced in Digimo- I mean, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">Pokémon X &amp; Y</a> back in 2013, they're not something I have any gripping nostalgia for either, so I wasn’t fussed either way to see their return. I rather enjoyed the turn-based battling of old that was used in Arceus, too, so was I going to like Legends: Z-A's real-time combat?</p>
<figure><a title="Pokemon Legends ZA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/321ce94c420ac/pokemon-legends-za.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What do you think is running through Totodile's head? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Kindly, Nintendo and Pokémon gave us behind closed doors access to Pokémon Legends: Z-A on Switch 2 at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-2025-pokemon-world-championships-kicks-off-this-week-heres-what-you-can-expect">this year's Pokémon Worlds event</a>, and even though our brief 20-minute demo didn’t show their entire hand, I was able to get a better grasp on this new combat system and I truly think this might be the most fast paced and exciting Pocket Monsters game we’ve seen yet. Now please, Nintendo, let me play more of it soon.</p>
<p>The demo was broken up into two sections. The first part let me loose in a back alley Battle Zone, which tasked me with taking down as many trainers as I could lock eyes with. I hate confrontation, though, so I was thrilled to learn I could surprise and sneak-attack these trainers instead by moving cautiously and targeting their active Pokémon standing by their side. This first strike gives you a little advantage at the start of a battle and this also makes for a nice evolution of the stealth mechanics we saw in Arceus.</p>
<p>It’s this section where I got my first taste of the new combat. You have full control of your trainer during battle, can sprint and dodge at the press of a button, use items (more on that later), and by holding 'ZL' you’ll pull up a list of moves your active Pokémon can use. Each move can be used one after another and have their own cooldown meters.</p>

<p>While you can’t take full control of your own Pokémon’s movement, they will follow you around the battlefield, and dodging and timing your attacks just right will either save or cost your 'mon's HP. You have to make a lot of decisions on the fly as some attacks have longer animations and wind-ups than others, so spamming each attack once it's ready to be used again might not always be the right decision.</p>
<p>The second portion of my demo had me make chase with a Zygarde in doggo form. This section was a little too scripted and stilted for my liking, and it's here where I first noticed a little bit of pop-in in the background details. It's worth mentioning everything I played was buttery smooth otherwise at 60fps. But the design choice to set this game within a concrete jungle hasn't totally won me over yet. I loved the wide open vistas found in Arceus; watching the sun rise, seeing the color of the landscapes change was a delight. I'm worried I'll quickly grow bored of the damp, back street visuals over time, but I've not even scratched the surface of what Legends: Z-A has to offer to know if that's the case. Early on, though, it's nice to see that the game's textures and performance (at least on Switch 2) are a big step up from Legends: Arceus.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that Zygarde I was chasing after! Right, where was it now? I turned a corner and before I knew it, Zygarde had tackled me and dragged me up to the rooftops and picked a fight for me with a wild Absol that had the power to Mega Evolve. Look, we're all fans of <a href="https://i.redd.it/i-was-obsessed-with-this-guy-in-the-mid-late-2000s-v0-tgkaqog730sd1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ee9cc1bec63cff7edc2f8076c62dd1675df7609">"2006" Davey Havok</a>, but that's an Absol, Zygarde --- thanks for that! This part must take place pretty early on in the game, as I only had a Chikorita on my team, but thankfully a neighbouring Lucario joined up with me and taught me how to activate Mega Evolution.</p>

<p>When facing off against a Mega Evolved Pokémon, you’ll have to pick up these Mega Power pellets by dealing damage. With enough Power, a tap of the right stick will transform your active Pokémon into something greater, faster, and all around more powerful, so it’s important to take advantage of this as often as you can.</p>
<p>Even though this Absol battle was framed as a seemingly easy tutorial for Mega Evolution, I got through by the skin of my teeth. Lucario sprinting around with me, I had to make snap decisions offensively while I avoided projectile blasts from Absol and scooped up all of the Mega Power I could. It all felt, well, for a lack of a better word, <em>epic</em>. Sure, maybe if I had used some of those potions I had tucked away in my satchel earlier in the fight, I wouldn’t have had to worry so much, but without them it honestly was a better, fairer fight, and I’m glad I didn’t need to rely on them. There’s also a cooldown timer on items that you have to contend with, so you can’t just douse your Pokémon with multiple potions at once. All of this added up could make for a really fun and engaging multiplayer, but that hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>
<p>While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation. I’ll always have a longing for the turn-based battles that have been prevalent for the last nearly-30 years, but there’s no questioning the fact that this series has needed some reinvention and this new real-time battle system has certainly captured my attention. Pokémon Legends: ZA may not be for everyone, but I think the hardcore fans will be pleased.</p>
<p>Maybe next time we go hands-on with the game we'll get to see that new Dragonite Mega Evolution in action, too.<br></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-legends-z-a%E2%80%99s-battle-system-i-rewired-the-pok%C3%A9mon-part-of-my-brain.1270977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even if you’ve never played a <em>Pokémon</em> game before, you can probably figure out how the type chart works. Fire types are weak to water types, water is weak to grass, and grass is weak to fire. Type matchups are foundational to <em>Pokémon</em> battles, far before you get into the weeds of stats and strats. I’ve had the <em>Pokémon</em> type chart memorized for around 25 years.</p><p>That still didn’t stop me from making a rookie error in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. I panicked and sent out my Weedle against an NPC’s Pidgeotto, which it is very much weak to. It got one-shot, obviously.</p><p>It’s not that I <em>forgot</em> how type matchups worked. But the battle system in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> is very, very different from what I’m used to, at least with <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s the second entry in the <em>Legends</em> spinoff series, which began with 2022’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, and while the <em>Legends</em> games are still RPGs like the main <em>Pokémon</em> games, they mechanically and structurally diverge a bit from the typical <em>Pokémon </em>formula. And <em>Z-A</em> takes it further than <em>Arceus</em> did: it’s the first <em>Pokémon </em>RPG to feature real-time battles instead of turn-based ones.</p><p>In the main series, you choose your actions turn by turn, taking time to think through the options — the right attack to use, whether to switch out for another pokémon, what the opponent might be planning — before locking something in and seeing how it plays out. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, on the other hand, you’re facing your opponent more directly. There’s no waiting for both opponents to lock in their actions for the turn; you just pick your pokémon’s move using one of the face buttons, and the move goes out.</p><p>It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon </em>games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust.</p><p>The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system. In the first part, I tried my hand at the Z-A Royale, which had me battling NPC trainers around Lumiose City at night. In the second, I battled a Rogue Mega Absol, which felt like the <em>Pokémon</em> version of a classic 3D <em>Zelda </em>boss. In the second part of the demo, I started to get the hang of this style of battling, and what was at first a little overwhelming quickly became an alluring kind of challenge: rewiring the <em>Pokémon</em> part of my brain.</p><p>The first big change I had to contend with: since battle in <em>Z-A </em>is in real time, moves are on cooldown timers. You can’t just spam the one super-effective move you have over and over; you have to figure out what else you can do while you wait to use that attack again. Even against very low-level opponents, I found myself relying on status moves like Growl, which lowers the opposing pokémon’s attack stat, as a buffer while my other moves were on cooldown. This had the added bonus of allowing my pokémon to take more hits, buying me some time both for the cooldown and to think.</p><p>Using status moves like this isn’t unusual when playing the core <em>Pokémon </em>games at a high level, but it is <em>very </em>unusual against a run-of-the-mill Bellsprout early in the game. I didn’t have enough time in the demo to really play around with it, but I can see myself carefully selecting each pokémon’s moves to account for the cooldown, like ensuring I have Protect on more of my pokémon to block incoming attacks. In other <em>Pokémon</em> games, I’d absolutely teach my pokémon Protect if I was building a competitive team, but I would almost never do it just to play the main story.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Pokémon Company</cite></p></div><p>It’s not that battles in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>are unforgiving. (I did get smoked by the Pidgeotto, but in my defense, it was also at least 10 levels higher than the pokémon on my team.) But after years and years of approaching every mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game the same way, operating at least a little bit on autopilot and muscle memory in the early game, it’s kind of an exciting challenge to have to look at <em>Pokémon </em>differently.</p><p>The battle against Rogue Mega Absol — a wild, rampaging Absol that can Mega Evolve on its own — was similar to the NPC battles in that way, but far more hands-on. Unlike in battles against other trainers, wild pokémon can damage both your pokémon and your character, so you have to physically dodge and move around the arena while selecting your pokémon’s moves, keeping an eye on everyone’s health, and juggling cooldowns. (Using items like Potions is also on a cooldown.) Landing hits on the Rogue Mega causes it to drop orbs of “Mega Energy,” which you have to run and pick up in order to charge up a gauge to Mega Evolve your own pokémon and deal more damage.</p><p>It’s even more to balance, but I didn’t find it overwhelming, somehow. In this case, I had a Lucario at my disposal, and it had super-effective moves while also resisting Absol’s attacks, which helped. Lucario already knew Protect, too, so I got to take advantage of the strategy I had just developed in the Z-A Royale. And it’s also a familiar style of boss battle in games more generally, even if it’s different for <em>Pokémon</em>. It was more involved and felt more dangerous than the trainer battles, but I felt competent at it relatively quickly (especially compared to the Pidgeotto incident).</p><p>Maybe it’s just a typical learning curve, and I’ll very quickly develop an updated kind of autopilot for the easier parts of <em>Z-A</em>. But I really did like having to think actively about <em>Pokémon </em>in a way that I usually save for competitive play. I hope the game can sustain that for longer than a demo, and that I’ll get to build on the <em>Pokémon </em>knowledge I’ve been amassing for years, rather than just passively flexing it.</p><p><sub><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> will be released for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16th.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, though that doesn’t mean the door is closed to the platform permanently, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Set to be officially revealed at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, Black Ops 7 will launch in November, once again part of the Xbox Game Pass catalog, but Nintendo Switch 2 players will miss out initially.</p>



<p>Though the improved performance of the Switch 2 has opened the door for releases on the platform for the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, Black Ops 7 won’t be joining them in November.</p>



<h2 id="h-unclear-whether-activision-plans-black-ops-7-on-switch-2-in-future">Unclear Whether Activision Plans Black Ops 7 on Switch 2 in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No arrival yet. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> confirms that Black Ops 7 will not arrive on Switch 2 when it launches in November, instead landing on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Crucially, though, the report says it’s “unclear whether Activision plans a future port” to Switch 2 in the future, so it’s not known yet whether the door has been closed entirely for Switch 2. Earlier this year, Activision told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> they were “committed to getting the franchise on Switch.”</p>



<p>Nintendo has not had a Call of Duty game on its platform since the release of Call of Duty: Ghosts on the Wii U in 2013, and, if that barren run is to come to an end with Black Ops 7, players will have to wait a while longer after the release date.</p>

            <p>The PC release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has proven exceptionally popular, with developer Shift Up revealing impressive sales earlier this week in its latest financial report. But it's not only a huge win for the studio and publisher Sony, it's also exemplary of a booming games industry in South Korea seeking global expansion.</p>
<p>As announced by Shift Up, the PC version of Stellar Blade sold a million copies in its first three days on Steam, and now boasts over 3m sales on PC and console combined. Further, its peak concurrent player count on Steam sits at almost 200k - as per Shift Up's latest financial report, that's 2-5x higher than Sony's other flagship triple-A games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, God of War, Spider-Man, to name three), making it the best-ever PC performance for a PS-exclusive IP launch. These are single-player games only, not including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">multiplayer and multi-platform success of Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Following the PS5 success of Stellar Blade as a triple-A IP, Shift Up leveraged its unique strengths in optimisation, user experience, content enhancements, and market specific marketing to continue its success in the PC market - becoming a developer with proven hits across mobile, PC, and console," wrote the studio in its report. And that success is set to continue throughout the rest of the year.</p>

<p>The popularity of Stellar Blade parallels an explosion of Korean culture in general. K-pop bands are global phenomenons; K-dramas and reality shows are all over Netflix; Korean films are winning Oscars; and Sony Pictures Animation's KPop Demon Hunters film is <em>the </em>thing that's dominating everything right now. And it's happening in games, too.</p><p>Just this week alone there's been plenty of news about Korean games. On top of those Stellar Blade sales, there was the announcement of Woochi the Wayfarer from publisher Nexon, a single-player triple-A action game based on Korean mythology that's set for release on PC and consoles. With its basis in Korean culture, it could follow the sort of nationalistic success <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> received in China.</p>

<p>Then, along with those Stellar Blade figures, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-is-releasing-on-ps5-in-the-first-half-of-2026-xbox-version-is-being-considered">Krafton's Sims-like Inzoi heading to PS5</a>, as well as the delay of Pearl Abyss' open-world adventure Crimson Desert that will now be released early next year "due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations", according to the company's latest financial report (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>This all follows the likes of Soulslike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">Lies of P celebrating the release of its DLC</a> earlier this summer; Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination">debating what indie means with its popular Dave the Diver</a> game, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">courting plagiarism concerns with its Destiny-esque shooter The First Descendent</a>; and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">Krafton acquiring Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a> to boost its action game output, while more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-defends-itself-amidst-subnautica-2-fiasco-says-milestone-process-is-being-rigorously-managed">defending itself amid a Subnautica 2 lawsuit fiasco</a>.</p><p>In short, the Korean games industry appears to be thriving. Of course, the country has long had a history with games, but it's previously focused predominantly on mobile games and online games, not to mention its exceptional esports scene. Now, though, we're seeing a shift towards PC and console gaming, and single-player games too. Pearl Abyss following its MMORPG Black Desert with the single-player Crimson Desert is just one example.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> director Choi Ji-won told Eurogamer back at the Game Developer Conference the studio's "primary focus from the concept of this game was to deliver a high quality, premium action game that is single-player," though he admitted he'd be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">open to a Nightreign-esque multiplayer game in future</a>.</p>
<p>"In the future, instead of pegging us into a certain genre, we want the fans to look at us and actually know what sort of unique components that we deliver that they look forward to," he added. "So they see our next work as a sort of projection of our trust and characters that we are building moving forward."</p>
<p>Speaking on the wider industry, Choi Ji-won said: "There are many talented and remarkable developers in Korea, and we are grateful for the opportunity that in, especially the action game [genre], our game perhaps provided a little more motivation to the already talented developers in Korea to craft their own experience in the genre."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Lies of P has challenged the dominance of FromSoftware's Souls games | <span>Image credit: <cite>Neowiz</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Why is it that action games in particular are proving popular? "I think action in general is very intuitive, it's primal," Choi Ji-won suggested. "It's pretty natural that the action genre is big and there are many games actually in it. Also East Asia has a long tradition of action related materials, so because of that I think it comes very naturally."</p><p>Now, the Korean industry is looking to go global. Speaking to Game Informer (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">Game Developer</a>), Round8 Studio CEO Jason Park said there are a "fixed number of people" playing single-player games on console and PC in South Korea, a number that "won't change". That's why Lies of P was made with a global market in mind.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO Kim Hyung-tae said only five percent of Stellar Blade's PS5 sales came from Korea, and console share isn't growing - that's why the PC release was so important. He added that mobile games are designed around monetisation so appeal to an older demographic. "That's continued for the past 20 years, and players have become older, so it's harder to acquire new and younger users," he said.</p>
<p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad echoed these comments to Eurogamer. "The Korean video game market remained flat in 2024 with narrowed growth prospects," he said. "This has led Korean video game companies, who have typically excelled at developing live service MMORPGs at home, to explore new geographies, genres and business models including premium single player games for the global market."</p>
<p>What's more, Ahmad explained, the Korean government has doubled its investment from 2024 into domestic console game development, now allocated 15.5 billion won. "The success of titles such as Stellar Blade and Lies of P show this strategy is delivering results for Shift Up and Neowiz, respectively," he said.</p><p>"While the goal is primarily growth outside of Korea, the industry is also looking to fill gaps at home with titles in genres that can challenge the dominance of long standing MMO, MOBA and shooter games in the country. Korean video game companies have also stepped up investment efforts in global studios and developing markets, with the aim of building a publishing portfolio with global appeal."</p>
<p>Growth in Korea mirrors a similar surge in China, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">success of Black Myth: Wukong has paved the way for other action-RPGs</a>, from Phantom Blade Zero, to Lost Soul Aside, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and Tides of Annihilation. Developers here have similarly moved from mobile to PC and console development, seeking global appeal. Phantom Blade Zero director "Soulframe" Liang described this shift to Eurogamer as akin to the "golden age of PlayStation 1 and 2".</p>
<p>Shift Up will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">follow up the success of Stellar Blade with a sequel</a>, set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">address issues with the lack of story in the first game</a>. Its next original game, currently known as Project Spirit, is in development for a release some time from 2027 onwards. Whether it can match Stellar Blade's success with increased competition from other Korean developers remains to be seen.</p>

Along the way the two brick friends will need to build various structures to help them get across the world, and beat the challenges that will meet them on the path.

            <p>EA have made a tweak to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta's rush, and are keeping tabs on the situation in case it needs more balancing changes. This comes as some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> folks and Battlefield vets have voiced their displeasure with the version of the mode that's debuted in this second weekend of beta action.</p>
<p>The biggest moans are related to size. Namely the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">amount of players on each side</a> in these revamped rush battles and the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-adding-yet-another-tiny-map-battlefield-6-players-are-rightfully-clowning-on-its-definition-of-all-out-warfare/">relatively small maps</a> they're being contested on. As you might imagine, those two elements being a bit titchier in scale than previous Battlefields has also had knock on effects for other aspects of the mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players," the Battlefield Comms account bugled out across the socials this morning.

<p>We'll see how much difference that makes, but the two aspects of the beta's rush matches <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mpv4d9/what_is_this_garbage_called_rush/">drawing the most ire</a> from players who aren't merrily shooting away are the 12 vs 12 squad size limit and the smaller maps, which can't be easily fixed on the fly. The result's an experience that's not quite as expansive and vehicle-friendly in its chaos. At least in terms of the maps, Battlefield 6's devs have moved to reassure folks that larger ones do exist, with lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475">tweeting</a> that folks complaining about the frenetic speed of beta matches will see that "tempo scales accordingly".</p>
<p>This is just a beta, so there's plenty of time for further changes to be made if EA reckon the unhappy voices represent a majority. Insert joke here about them probably being best of not rushing to judgement.</p>

<p>The biggest weekend in the Pokémon calendar is here with the World Championships 2025 taking place in Anaheim, which of course means a closing ceremony that could bring plenty of news. Here are all the details.</p>



<p>Pokémon is set for a big year in the next 12 months with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> edging ever closer and 2026 marking the franchise’s 30th anniversary, which is expected to include the long-awaited release of Generation 10. Could we see some news and hints in Anaheim?</p>



<p>Whatever Pokémon has up its sleeves to showcase at the closing ceremony, you don’t want to miss it, so here’s everything you need to know.</p>

<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony takes place on Sunday, August 17. As the name implies, it brings the event in Anaheim to a close.</strong></p>



<p>Action in Anaheim for the Pokémon World Championships 2025 begins on Friday, marking the start of three days of action from the TCG, VGC, and everything else in between.</p>



<p>The closing ceremony in previous events has featured news about upcoming titles and releases, so it should not be missed by fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What Time is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships Closing Ceremony begins at 7:00 pm PDT, meaning a late night for anyone on the east coast of the United States or elsewhere in the world.</strong></p>



<p>It is expected to begin bang on schedule, though it could be delayed if any of the finals earlier in the day run longer than planned. </p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the start times for the closing ceremony in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">21:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">22:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">03:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><strong>The Closing Ceremony at the Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 will be broadcast live online through multiple platforms, including directly on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>website, on Twitch, and on YouTube.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to watch as the streams are slightly ahead of other platforms, so tune in here if you don’t want to see any spoilers. All the big announcements will also be shared on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>Previous announcements at the Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</strong> <strong>have included details for upcoming releases across games and the physical TCG, as well as news on future World Championship events.</strong></p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony almost always announces the location of the following World Championships, though there will be no such reveal for 2026 as we already know the World Championships are heading to San Francisco next year. That announcement was made in Honolulu last year.</p>



<p>We could see more reveals for the Pokémon TCG, with last year revealing the return of Trainer’s Pokémon to the game, but all eyes will be cast towards Pokémon Legends: Z-A news. After the reveal of Mega Dragonite in the recent Pokémon Presents showcase, could we get another reveal?</p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony could also bring news of upcoming updates to existing live-service titles like Pokémon TCG Pocket, Pokémon Cafe Remix, and Pokémon EX Masters. Crucially, we could see more details of Pokémon Champions, which is set to be the formula used for future VGC events.</p>



<p>Pokémon does like to keep surprises up its sleeve, however, so it’s difficult to predict exactly what will be shown off.</p>

<p>McDonalds has ended part of the Pokémon promotion early in Japan after huge queues outside of its stores and immense food wastage.</p>



<p>Last weekend’s launch of the Pokémon promotion earned criticism from across the world, with scalpers buying up Happy Meals in bulk to receive the exclusive Pokémon cards in the distribution, and many then dumping the meals. </p>



<p>McDonalds sold out of the exclusive Pokémon cards within hours of the promotion starting, despite plans for the event to run for three days, and plans have now been updated for the upcoming week.</p>



<h2 id="h-mcdonalds-places-restrictions-on-happy-meal-purchases">McDonalds Places Restrictions on Happy Meal Purchases</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s over. Image via McDonalds</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a>, McDonalds apologized to customers and store staff, along with announcing restrictions on purchasing Happy Meals that prohibit purchasing more than three per group. If four or more are ordered, “we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order.”</p>



<p>This weekend’s promotion will go ahead, though the big difference is there will not be any Pokémon cards and, instead, toys will be provided, which should result in a decreased demand for those looking for profit.</p>



<p>On the topic of scalpers specifically, McDonalds stated it “does not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for the purpose of resale, or the abandonment or disposal of food.”</p>



<p>This is not a problem unique to McDonalds, however, as the Pokémon hobby has become embroiled with supply problems due to high demand, with widespread videos of people purchasing products in mass to sell at inflated prices.</p>



<p>Pokémon has maximized its printing process to counteract this issue, but there is little evidence of results so far and, with the 30th anniversary of the franchise next year, demand could be higher than ever.</p>



<p>Are scalpers ruining the Pokémon hobby? Should McDonalds refuse to distribute Pokémon cards again? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Three Who'sthis?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Cast your mind back to 2022 and you might remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">Dark Deity</a>, the fantasy turn-based RPG that took more than a little inspiration from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>. Fast forward to the present day and we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a>, the second entry in the series which looks just as tied to the Nintendo touchstone.</p>
<p>This one launched on PC earlier this year, but developer Sword and Axe and publisher Indie.io have announced that it will <em>also</em> be making its way to Switch on <strong>4th September</strong>, and we can't help but feel that it's a good fit.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the Fire Emblem ties are once again strong with this one. Taking place in the fictional, fantasy setting of Verroa, you'll control Gwyn, Riordian and 18 other playable characters on their quest to protect their land from the neighbouring Holy Asverellian Empire.</p>
<p>The action all takes place in a top-down, tactical style, reminiscent of the early Fire Emblem games, with one-on-one turn-based encounters zooming in on the hits in all their pixel art detail. It's a format we've seen many times before, but it doesn't make it any less cool.</p>
<p>This sequel boasts 45 classes for its 20 playable characters, with built-in randomisers and campaign customisers ensuring a decent level of replayability.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's set up and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the Eternal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p>
<p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dark Deity 2 is now available to pre-order on the North American <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dark-deity-2-switch/">Switch eShop</a> (it doesn't appear to be live on the European variant at the time of writing) for <strong>$24.99</strong>. There's even a 20% pre-launch discount available for those who want to save a few bucks.</p>
<p>We had a perfectly good time with its predecessor back in 2022, stating in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dark-deity">our review</a> that "Dark Deity delivers a convincing and essentially satisfying facsimile of GBA Fire Emblem, but perhaps fails to stand on its own two feet". Let's hope the sequel moves things in the right direction, eh?</p>

            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers got its 1.5 Patch this week, bringing multiple quality-of-life improvements to the Soulslike, but also story and boss adjustments which appear to have been made to appease Chinese netizens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869">patch notes</a> list all the details, which include features like faster healing animations and adjustments to invincibility frames when Wuchang stands up. But buried in the margins is the nebulous line: "Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance."</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-1-5-changes-censorship-game-pass-steam-2000617865">Kotaku</a> and pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1955675217680105798">YouTuber Lance McDonald</a>, in practice this means that several key bosses, notably those associated with the Ming dynasty, no longer die after their bloodthirsty battles with Wuchang. Instead, they fall down in exhaustion and remain in the boss arena, occasionally offering up further dialogue if Wuchang speaks with them. In the case of famous general Zhao Yun, who existed during China's Three Kingdoms period hundreds of years before the Ming dynasty and shows up as a surprise NPC and boss, the fight is reframed as a "trial" by his immortal soul designed to test Wuchang.</p>
<p>With this change comes the additional fact that certain enemies associated with the Ming dynasty, such as peasant loyalists and imperial guards, are no longer hostile. This significantly alters the game's fourth region, Worship's Rise in Ruins, which was full of these guys. Suddenly, the vast majority of that level's foes are friendly, making it a cakewalk in comparison to its original stressful form.</p><p>These changes appear to have been made by developer Leenzee Games in response to critical voices from the Chinese internet which have lambasted the game since its release. According to these voices, the game paints the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 AD) in a poor light.</p>
<p>The Ming was the last dynasty led by ethnic Han Chinese, and the following Qing dynasty (1644-1912 AD) was ruled by the Manchu people. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers features a distinct lack of Manchu enemies, and instead several of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses">24 bosses</a> include prominent real-world persons such as Zhu Youjian, the 17th and final ruler of the Ming who was known as the Chongzhen (meaning "auspicious") Emperor. In-game, Zhu Youjian shows up as a mutated draconic version of himself obsessed with immortality and maintaining the Ming dynasty at all cost. As of Patch 1.5, Wuchang can no longer permanently kill Zhu Youjian, and he's reframed as having been corrupted. Upon defeating him, it's hinted that he goes off into seclusion with his consort instead of dying permanently.</p>
<p>Player response to Patch 1.5 on the English-speaking internet has largely been negative, with commentators on one of Wuchang's two Subreddits reacting in surprise to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WuchangFallenFeathers/comments/1mq3zti/wtf_is_that_shxt/">still-alive bosses</a> and pointing out the fact that their post-battle "exhausted" states seem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WuchangFallenFeathers/comments/1mqks1q/this_patch_makes_no_sense/">unfinished</a> (to be fair, the patch notes do state that these animations will be improved).</p>
<p>Amongst Chinese players, reception to Patch 1.5 has been mixed. Chinese-language Steam threads include discussions that Lenzee <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/discussions/0/599660817248455789/">caved to an overly vocal minority</a>, and suggestions that the game should give players the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/discussions/0/664963107066518176/">choice of battling Ming enemies</a> rather than turning them into friendly NPCs.</p><p>Others have stressed that these alterations dilute the plot of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, which is rooted in the Buddhist concept of samsara, or cyclical change - a theme that is demonstrated by both the titular heroine's motivations and the historical backdrop of the falling Ming dynasty. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/discussions/0/664963107066498868/">second response in this thread</a> puts it succinctly, stressing that the plot is about Wuchang letting go of her obsession with resurrecting her sister - a theme that is rendered moot by Zhu Youjian escaping death simply by virtue of being a Chinese emperor.</p>
<p>Personally, as someone who put 90 hours into Wuchang: Fallen Feathers for guides purposes and is half-Chinese (Taiwanese actually, but I won't get into that here), I feel that the original outcry was unjustified and came from a select group of players who subscribe to ideas of Han Chinese supremacy. That said, I'm not surprised that Leenzee made these changes. Entities in Mainland China need to be more beholden to social pressure and patriotism to survive, and Leenzee Games invited scrutiny by featuring real-world figures and literally making the game's Chinese title 明末, which can be translated as "Last days of the Ming". I suspect they had a particular vision in mind, and they've now deemed it necessary to compromise on that vision in order to survive. It's a shame, since the news of these tweaks has covered up the quality-of-life patch improvements that will make the game more enjoyable.</p>
<p>That said, if anyone wants to watch me stomp the immortal Zhao Yun with an fire axe build in only a little over two minutes, check out my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-eternal-glory-zhao-yun">boss guide</a>.</p>

              <p>Last weekend, Japanese McDonald’s outlets’ attempts to include packs of Pokémon cards in Happy Meals ended not only two days early, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">in the complete chaos of miserable children and gross amounts of wasted food</a>. This weekend, the chain is trying again, but this time with toys instead of cards and far more strict rules in place.</p> <p>Originally intended to run August 9 to 11, the Japanese Happy Meal promotion was the annual event of including packs of&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards, which always causes a lot of excitement, but rarely involves the police. This year, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">amidst the ongoing mass hysteria over the cards</a>, things immediately got wildly out of control. Scalpers rushed in to buy dozens of Happy Meals each, removed the cards to resell them, then dumped the food on the street. Just a few hours in to what should have been a three-day promotion, the entire thing had to be abandoned due to card stocks running out and the chaotic scenes in restaurants. <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">McDonald’s quickly issued an apology</a> and said it was all cancelled.</p> <p>However, the company is trying again. This weekend’s promotion features Pokémon toys rather than cards, but seems no less likely to be the target of scalping assholes. Running from today, August 15 to 17, far stricter purchase restrictions have been put in place—so much so that it’ll suck for any family with four kids. Last weekend, the often ignored rules said no more than five Happy Meals could be bought per person. This time it’s no more than three meals per&nbsp;<em>group</em>. “If you order four or more sets,” <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/">says McDonald’s</a> (via machine translation), “we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order.” The same rules apply to deliveries.</p>

 <p>McD’s appears to recognize that this solution isn’t ideal. The statement says,</p> <blockquote><p>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions. We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff.”</p></blockquote> <p>The one consolation is that the toys look like shit. Clearly things are so nuts right now that this might not have too big of an impact, but they look like the worst plastic tat, rather than a desirable plushie or similar.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ハッピーセット ポケモン「おうちリレー」篇" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2_xGYjr1W44?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, it probably doesn’t help that the promotions are being all mysterious about one of the possible toys (surely Charizard) which will only encourage silliness. In a normal world, that sort of super-low-level gamble is a useful way of drawing people in and encouraging repeat purchases in the hope of getting the secret toy, but in the current situation it seems like more trouble than it’s worth!</p> <p>Good luck to all McDonald’s employees in Japan who almost definitely aren’t paid enough to put up with this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Have you all been a bit hot and bothered this week? It’s yet another heatwave in the UK, so sun screen, sun glasses, breezy clothing and hydration have been the order of the week.</p>
<p>But there’s always games, as well. I’ve had two reviews on the go, for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/12/abyssus-review/">Abyssus</a> and Drag x Drive, both of which sadly missed their potential for very different reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/drag-x-drive-review/">Drag x Drive</a> in particular missed a lot of the colourful Nintendo charm that you’d want, though the core wheelchair basketball is enjoyable.</p>

<p>Much more exciting is a trio of games that I played to experience some Gamescom previews before Gamescom, which I will be able to tell you all about next week… during Gamescom.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> was one of my Abyssus buddies, but alongside that co-op rogueliking, he played a bunch of&nbsp;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and a bit of his current gacha game favourites – Girls Frontline 2: Exilium and Zenless Zone Zero – &nbsp;and the “incredible” indie visual novel South Scrimshaw.</p>

<p>It’s also been a bit of Death Stranding for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who joined that with some Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and reviews of Sengoku Dynasty and Peglin for review.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had the cosy indie game Tiny Bookshop on the go for a review, which “is letting me live my dream.” I never knew he wanted to be a travelling book seller, but there we go!</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> thoroughly enjoyed finishing his run through DOOM: The Dark Ages, but has had plenty more on the go. He’s been playing both Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown for review, but much more concerning for his time and finances, he and his son have got into Warhammer 40,000 lately. He’s boosting his understanding of the Grimdark future by playing through Space Marine 2 a few weeks back and has now moved on to the confusingly named Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters – “a terrific XCOM type game which is proving to be great fun!”</p>
<p>Tuffcub played some of the Battlefield 6 beta last weekend “which was fun”, and has been replaying Uncharted 4. “There’s a lot of cut scenes in that game aren’t there? Does seem to drag on playing it now…”</p>
<div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755246850.156659" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755246850.156659">
<p>Having joined me for a touch of Abyssus – “which was briney fun albeit with some toxic banter from the editor… and a lot of Terry turrets” – <strong>Steve</strong> has been struggling with some of the bosses in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and making a start on a Switch 2 game which he’ll tell you about in due course.</p>
</div>

<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> popping off on holiday today, but has preceded this with a busy week of gaming that has included Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, Donkey Kong Bananza, Grounded 2,&nbsp;Is This Seat Taken?, and a spot of Madden too. What will he manage to play while he’s away?</p>
<p>But we’ll leave that question hanging in order to ask another. What have&nbsp;<em>you</em> played?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's has announced fresh restrictions aimed at combating scalpers, as it launches the next wave of its enormously popular Pokémon promotion in Japan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last weekend, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokmon-card-giveaway-ends-early-amid-restaurant-chaos-scalping-and-widespread-food-waste-as-fans-buy-dozens-of-happy-meals-only-to-dump-uneaten-burgers">fast food chain was swamped by scalpers who bought up dozens of Happy Meals just for the exclusive Pokémon cards within them</a>. Photos and videos posted to social media by outraged fans highlighted arguments among patrons over the scalping, and showed examples of huge food wastage, with the Happy Meals dumped by the side of the road or left in the restaurant uneaten. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The incident meant McDonald's ran out of its cards within hours of its three-day promotion going live, forcing the burger brand to apologise to Pokémon fans left empty-handed. And now, McDonald's has gone further — with new rules regarding the availability of Pokémon merchandise in Happy Meals applied from today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We deeply apologize to our customers who regularly use McDonald's restaurants, as well as to our store staff and many others for any inconvenience caused by the Happy Set Pokémon Card Campaign," McDonald's wrote in a new <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released this morning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will continue to release the Pokémon Happy Meals, which include five different toys, as scheduled from Friday, August 15. However, in light of the current situation, we will be implementing the following purchase restrictions for three days until Sunday, August 17th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These restrictions include a maximum purchase of three Happy Meals per group (this was previously higher, and per person). "If you order four or more," McDonald's now says, "we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, during this period, there may be restrictions on use at some stores and during certain hours," the chain continued. "We will not allow purchases from customers who do not follow the above rules and etiquette."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest difference with the coming weekend's promotion, however, is that it no longer features Pokémon cards at all — just Pokémon toys. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/untitled-1-1754903573029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Pokémon fan shows a collection of Happy Meal card packs, while food lies unopened and dumped. Image credit: daihonyaku/daiyamoto69.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On scalping specifically, McDonald's said it "does not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for the purpose of resale, or the abandonment or disposal of food," in a direct response to the activities of some customers last weekend. However, it's unclear how the chain can and will be able to enforce this. Still, what's obvious is the brand has taken note of the social media outrage — and the disappointment among young Pokémon fans and families at not being able to get cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions," McDonald's concluded. "We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pokémon news, last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy">The Pokémon Company replaced the art for its Lugia and Ho-Oh cards</a> which had fallen foul to claims they included fan designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog isn't loved by everyone, but most people can agree that the music in his games is generally top-tier stuff. We expect the soundtrack to the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be stellar, and Sega has released a brand new video that highlights six of the tunes in the game.</p>
<p>The video below, which runs for almost eight minutes, features a mix of six remixed tracks from CrossWorlds put together by Kanon Oguni!. These tracks from the official soundtrack are said to be inspired by courses in the game based on Sonic Unleashed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours">Sonic Colors</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>.</p>

            <p>Floating amid the scrap belts of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a>, some news. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> is now owned by developers Blackbird Interactive, with the studio having bought control of the ship-stripping <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> from publishers Saber Interactive. They're not having a rest after cracking open that bubbly either, writing that "multiple Hardspace projects" are in development.</p>
<p>Blackbird revealed all of this via a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718">Steam post</a>, writing that they've "reached an agreement with Focus Entertainment, our publishing partner, to reacquire full ownership of the Hardspace: Shipbreaker intellectual property". So, as you might expect, doing plenty of Hardspacey things is going to be a big part of the studio's plans going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To that end, they revealed here that "multiple Hardspace projects are already in development". "We're not ready to share any specifics yet, but rest assured we have paid close attention to your feedback and are laser-focused on ensuring this next generation of Hardspace expands on the original game in all the right ways," Blackbird added.</p>
<p>In the run up to releasing these new games, the studio aim to "grow the Hardspace community", urging folks to join the series' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FYEcBqgHa">Discord server</a>, where breaking updates will be launched into your orbit whenever they're ready. You can also <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/">pre-register for the "LYNX Pioneer Program" via Blackbird's website</a>, if you fancy the chance to take part in early playtests and offer feedback on future Hardspace games. There's some other community stuff like contests and the chance to generally chat with devs included in that too.</p>
<p>Also, Hardspace: Shipbreaker itself will be getting a "small update" that'll mainly take care of housekeeping details to indicate the change in ownership, like revamping the privacy policies and splash screens.</p>
<p>Our Liam wrote the following about the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-review-moreish-sci-fi-work-sim-sticks-the-landing">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>What a thrill, to exist on the sidelines. To look longingly out towards the stars and wonder what’s going on beyond your little corner of this expansive universe. To understand a society purely through its waste products. Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a truly marvellous thing to spend time within. I quite like being a background character, it turns out. Being the hero is overrated. If Shipbreaker has taught me anything it’s that the satisfaction of a hard day's work beats saving the universe every single time.</blockquote>
<p>There are also thoughts on it from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-and-the-joy-of-doing-a-boring-spacejob-perfectly">Alice O</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-want-to-like-hardspace-shipbreaker-but-im-very-bad-at-it-and-it-makes-me-sad">Alice B</a>, if you're keen to fill your Alice quota.</p>

<p>With Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater slithering toward release, it’s the perfect time to learn about the differences between the remake and the original Snake Eater 3 title from over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could revive the Metal Gear Solid franchise after a few years of dormancy following the disappointment of the last release, Metal Gear Solid Survive, in 2018.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on all the big differences between the original title and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, we’ve got you covered.</p>

<h3 id="h-no-kojima-amp-shinkawa-involved">No Kojima &amp; Shinkawa Involved</h3>



<p>One of the biggest points to note is that the original creator, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hideo Kojima</a>, and the original artist, Yoji Shinkawa, are not involved in the remake. However, the developer pledged to stay fully faithful to the original content.</p>



<p>While neither of the starring pair is on board, their original work will still shine through. With Kojima not on board, Konami’s internal studio, Konami Digital Entertainment, is developing the game, while Noriaki Okamura, producer of Metal Gear Survive and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, and Yuji Korekado, creative producer of Metal Gear Solid V, are supervising.</p>



<p>Singaporean studio Virtuos also contributed to development.</p>



<h3 id="h-snake-vs-bomberman">Snake vs Bomberman</h3>



<p>While those on PlayStation and PC will be able to play through a remake of Snake vs. Monkey, a crossover with Sony’s Ape Escape that released with the original title, Xbox Series X|S players will have a brand new experience with a crossover with a Konami property, Bomberman.</p>



<p>Snake vs. Bomberman has been created entirely for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game, given that Sony probably wouldn’t want their Ape Escape franchise to feature on the rival platform. </p>



<h3 id="h-trophy-amp-achievement-changes">Trophy &amp; Achievement Changes</h3>



<p>Several changes have been made to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a> for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, marking one of the biggest differences for the game compared to the original. </p>



<p>Some Trophies have been removed entirely, while others have had their rarity changed. Others have been streamlined into a single Trophy or Achievement for achieving 100% of an objective, whereas previously they were broken down into separate objectives.</p>



<p>Minor adjustments include some changes to names and descriptions, though the core task remains the same.</p>



<h3 id="h-updated-graphics">Updated Graphics</h3>



<p>One of the biggest differences in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater compared to the original title is updated graphics, which is a given considering the original game released over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Expect the graphics to be in-line with recent AAA titles, showcasing the beloved game in a new light. While there are these visual changes, the core story remains the same, and no major adjustments have been made on that front.</p>







<p><strong>Given the original title released over two decades ago, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a must-play for anyone who adores the original title.</strong></p>



<p>Bringing the game into the modern generation provides the Metal Gear Solid franchise with an opportunity to attract new players, but those who are well-versed with the franchise will be crucial to the game’s success. If you want to see other Metal Gear Solid games receive a remaster, I’d highly recommend buying.</p>



<p>The good thing about a remake is you know what to expect with the story, so you won’t be disappointed or feel short-handed. Instead, use the game as a trip down memory lane to reminisce about your first experiences playing the original game.</p>

<p>That's one radical highway</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With the release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> drawing ever closer (that's 25th September, speed freaks), Sega is keeping the old hype train rolling along in the right direction with a brand new remix of some of the tunes featured in the upcoming racer, which, we have to say, looks absolutely cracking.</p>
<p>You can check out the video in full above, and honestly, if you've got any nostalgia or love for Sonic in your bones at all, brace for some unexpected emotions.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEGA released the third OST video for <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds,</em> spotlighting a DJ mix that features six remixed tracks from the game. The OST focuses on music inspired by courses including Apotos, Dragon Road, and Market Street based on <em>Sonic Unleashed</em>, Galactic Parade and Sweet Mountain based on <em>Sonic Colors</em>, and Radical Highway based on <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em> will release digitally and physically on September 25, 2025 for Switch 1. The Switch 2 version - which will be available as a paid upgrade path from the Switch 1 version - will release this year, too, they've just not put an official date on it. Oh, and physical versions for Switch 2 won't see the light of day until early 2026.</p>
<p>On that note, while there is a little delay for physical Switch 2 fans, as we reported a little while back, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/sonic-racing-crossworlds-on-switch-2-will-feature-the-full-base-game-on-cartridge">the full game will at least be on the cart itself</a>. Hooray!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Reliable insider billbil-kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 should launch on November 14, echoing the previous rumor shared by TheGhostofHope last month on X. Billbil-kun however added that there won't be a version of the Nintendo Switch 2, and there is no information on whether Activision Blizzard plans a later port of the game for the console.</p>



<p>The question arose within the Call of Duty community because back in February 2023, Microsoft, during its efforts to conclude the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-contract-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a ten-year deal with Nintendo to bring the popular first-person shooter franchise to the Switch platforms. So far, no Call of Duty game has been released on Nintendo consoles. With the release of the Switch 2, it should certainly be easier to bring new titles to the freshly released hardware; after all, Black Ops 7 is also coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it's been established that the Switch 2 is more powerful than Sony's and Microsoft's previous generation consoles. Still, there are clearly some hurdles to be overcome first.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will also be released in physical editions on consoles (PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X) at the price of €79.99. According to billbil-kun, pre-orders will be opened on Wednesday, August 20, right after Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live event. </p>



<p>The game itself is co-developed by Treyarch and Raven Software. The campaign follows the events seen in 2012's Black Ops II. Ten years later, David Mason (voiced once again by Milo Ventimiglia) and his team of agents will pursue "a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else". Of course, there will also be plenty of multiplayer modes, including a round-based cooperative Zombies mode. When it comes to gameplay, the developers promised an evolution of the omnimovement system seen in last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>The launch of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is rapidly approaching, and many questions still linger about whether the game is a remake, so we’ve got the answer.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims of a Nintendo Switch 2 launch</a> later this year, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could spark a rebirth for the fan-favorite Konami franchise after years of dormancy for the series—and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophy list</a> shows big challenges await.</p>



<p>With fans having waited so long for a new Metal Gear Solid release, there may be some confusion about the remake status, but we’re here to clear up any confusion.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a fully fledged remake of 2004’s Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater.</strong></p>



<p>Snake Eater is a fan-favorite for the franchise, as, while it was the fifth Metal Gear Solid game in the series, it was the first chronologically. As such, it is the first remake in the series and was chosen due to its time setting, which is set in 1964 during the Cold War.</p>



<p>The game will stick true to the original story that first played out over two decades ago, with the biggest difference being that neither Hideo Kojima nor original artist Yoji Shinkawa have been involved in the game’s development.</p>



<p>Snake Eater’s remake was first announced in May 2023, representing a shift in approach from Konami after the previous decision to move away from developing and publishing major third-party games. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first title in the franchise to release since 2018’s spin-off title Metal Gear Survive.</p>







<p><strong>There has been no confirmation of any further Metal Gear Solid remakes, but the door is certainly open for them to take place if Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is successful.</strong></p>



<p>The decision to remake Snake Eater first provides Konami with the opportunity to tell the story of the franchise chronologically for the first time, which could mean that remakes for Metal Gear Solid 1 &amp; 2 are next in line. </p>



<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> in 2024, series producer Noriaki Okamura claimed remaking the first Metal Gear Solid would be much harder than Snake Eater, with the same difficulties for the second game. This is due to the fact both titles originally released on the MSX2 and Nintendo Entertainment System, meaning much more would need to be built for the ground up in a remade version.</p>



<p>There has already been a Master Collection for the series, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Volume 2 confirmed to be in the works</a>, but these are not remakes and iinstead bundle several games in the series together.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Rematch Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/15/turtle-beach-rematch-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-rematch-controller-review.1270845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Options are never a bad thing. Over the years, different peripheral manufacturers have made sure that console makers can never rest on their laurels, often besting and improving on the official controller designs by adding extra features or updating the technology within them. The new wireless Turtle Beach Rematch controller focuses more on providing a similar experience to the Switch Pro Controller, while cutting into Nintendo’s fairly steep asking price. In this case, however, it’s not a steep enough price cut for the reduction in quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Rematch Wireless" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gqWyLu0VDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ve loved many of Turtle Beach’s most recent controllers, from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-pro-controller-review/">Stealth Ultra Pro</a> to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/turtle-beach-stealth-pivot-controller-review/">Stealth Pivot</a>. They’re doing things differently and bringing new features to bear that have a real-world use case. The Rematch slightly glows in the dark. Fundamentally, its looks are its best feature, with its green and purple Mario-toting livery very pleasing to the eye, and certainly bright enough to stand out next to all those bland black and grey controllers you’ll find elsewhere. The glow-in-the-dark effect isn’t really bright enough to warrant its inclusion, and it’s not applied to the buttons, which are, surely, the most important thing you’d want to glance at in the dark.</p>


<p>The top shell is made from a great-feeling soft-touch plastic, to lift the experience somewhat, but the lightly-textured purple underside doesn’t carry that through, and you get two, very different, sensations when you’re holding the controller in your hands.</p>


<p>Designed with the original Switch in mind, the Rematch works with both of Nintendo’s consoles, though it lacks the Switch 2’s C button for opening up GameChat. That’s not the biggest problem when it’s accessible via the central menu, but it’s odd to release it at the same time as the Switch 2 without the new console’s full functionality. For all that it feels like an omission, that’s balanced out by an impressive 40 hours of battery life, which makes the Rematch a very easy controller to live with.</p>
<p>The most immediately gratifying aspect of the Rematch are its well-tuned analogue sticks. They feel great in use, with a nice level of tautness, and a quick return to centre. Now, that’s balanced with the disappointing fact that these are not Hall Effect or TMR type sticks, meaning they’re using the old style of stick tech that has a far higher chance of wearing out. When other manufacturers, Gamesir in particular, are putting out similarly priced hardware, with improved analogue sticks, it feels like Turtle Beach are a step behind with the Rematch.</p>
<p>As the Rematch is targeted as an entry-level pro-styled device, it’s little surprise to find the inclusion of two additional grip inputs, the flared, decently-sized buttons sitting easily beneath your middle fingers, and activating reassuringly with a press or even just a squeeze of the grip. They feel great in use, and are a real boon to players looking for an edge in competitive games.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the inputs don’t feel as good. The main face buttons are overly firm, and feel a fraction too high, making them feel slower in use. The digital triggers maintain some of that firmness, but they also make a slightly loose clacking sound that lends a sense of cheapness each time you use them. The shoulder buttons, at least, are fine, and benefit from activation across their entire length, but no interaction with the Rematch makes it feel as if this is a £50 controller.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of alternatives out there. If you own a Switch 2, the official <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/16/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review/">Switch Pro Controller 2</a> is an easy choice, and while it’s more expensive, the overall build, the inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone socket, and the console-level customisation for the grip inputs, are streets ahead of what the Rematch offers. As mentioned before, Gamesir is the current champion of this category, and both the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">Cyclone 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">Super Nova</a> are fantastic. They’re fully featured pro controllers, with Hall Effect Sticks, better-feeling inputs, and a charging stand, and they come in at more or less the same price as the Rematch. The only downside is the need for an additional dongle that the Rematch doesn’t need.</p>

            <p>Elysium Game Studio has released a brand-new gameplay trailer for its third- and first-person action RPG, Neo Berlin 2087. According to the developer's official website, the game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC.</p>

Elias Toufexis, known as the voice of Adam Jensen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>, and as Seraphim in Netflix's Blood of Zeus, announced last year that he'd signed on to play the main character.</p>
