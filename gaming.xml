              <p><span>Huntr/x may be a fictional K-pop group, but Netflix has managed to capture one part of real-world K-pop stardom in its official </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> merchandise: photocards. These little pieces of cardboard usually depict fans’ favorite K-pop idols in anything from professional headshots to candid photos you might find on their camera roll. While Netflix is only now really hitting the merchandise angle hard after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-derpy-artist-kids-all-ages-animation-2000621394"><span>animated musical’s runaway success</span></a><span>, one thing it planned ahead for was that fans might want photocards of their favorite members. I even got one of the lead singer, Rumi, when I saw the film at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>sing-along showings last month</span></a><span>. Now, the film’s soundtrack CD is out, and each disc comes with one random photocard of one of the members sealed inside. And since fans love to collect things, the random photocard inside the album has got people buying multiple copies, reselling, and trading like they’re prized </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards.</span></p> <p><span>Because the photocard is randomized, the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack is basically a blind box. Huntr/x has three members, so there’s a 33 percent pull rate for each card. So it’s entirely possible you could buy three copies of the album and get the same photocard each time, like this TikTok user did:</span></p>   <p><span>That’s how the dice fall sometimes. All these collection crazes are essentially gambling, and while the odds of getting all three Huntr/x photo cards are better than those in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>TCG pull, you can still end up spending a pretty penny on multiple copies of the album trying to complete the set. This has made unboxings a new trend within the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>community, much like you see in most TCG fandoms.&nbsp;</span></p>

         <p><span>Unfortunately, this also means that we’re starting to see resellers </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/226950263213?_skw=kpop+demon+hunters+cd+photocard&amp;itmmeta=01K459CDHAKAXC06RYPMFCKCVQ&amp;hash=item34d74a31ad:g:nEQAAeSw6INos~Fc&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA4FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1e00N5FWhjTc9V9pI53JjABq5WC9KmiL4ZgdVBpZUY8teNZwcWWlaL7vBKUzypUdUm1F1n55tsaNWQlkEr6eMb2qB9PLELWiX%2Beb1wk%2FfK4tvlegg3QrdH%2BDTltwkDUUMFH%2BCXYQ%2BnFikC0lzc5LRm5ETHV%2Bd0sLdohWpqEbMOMKJLOGb9Ttw%2B%2BwlpTWgIxzGq2i3jGzKtQimfQu3U6o8rh24%2Bzp3Guisao6hcJMx0Ioyycy%2BsUEdsaimtBaRcOU5tGmaPnlsjQWEHnBLZ3efAF%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR_TYsamhZg"><span>upcharging for opened copies that have a confirmed photocard</span></a><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During a new interview, Gearbox CEO revealed how Borderlands’ iconic comic-book-inspired art style came to be. </p>



<p>With only 10 days left until Borderlands 4’s release, players have started learning new tidbits of information. Most recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-trophies-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete list of trophies and achievements</a> for the game surfaced online. Now, the developers have revealed how they zeroed in on the game’s beloved art style. </p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-devs-started-working-on-a-new-art-style-right-before-the-alpha-milestone">Borderlands Devs Started Working on a New Art Style Right Before the Alpha Milestone</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford discussed how Borderlands’ art style was developed and the numerous hurdles they had to overcome to achieve it. When development began for the original game in 2005, the devs were working on six different art styles, which varied from safe to over-the-top.</p>



<p>At the start, they felt that “it’s kind of got to be realism or there’s just no market opportunity.” However, it “just wasn’t exactly right for what the look and feel and vibe of what Borderlands was supposed to be – it didn’t match the gameplay.” Adam May, the art director for Borderlands 4 and a character modeler for the original game, revealed that when Fallout 3 was released, the developers realised that they were in the “same visual place” as Bethesda’s title.</p>



<h2 id="h-random-doodles-led-to-the-creation-of-borderlands-beloved-art-style">Random Doodles Led to the Creation of Borderlands’ Beloved Art Style</h2>



<p>At that time, May was sitting next to a concept artist for the original game, Scott Kester, who used to doodle “illustrated graffiti” during their free time. One of the characters created in these doodles eventually evolved into Captain Flynt, marking the birth of the iconic Borderlands art style that players know and love. With the help of Kester and executive producer Brian Martel, May transformed these 2D sketches into 3D game art and then pitched to Pitchford. </p>



<p>It was a sticky time for them as the game was on tight deadlines and was about to reach its alpha milestone. At that time, they pitched the idea of working on a brand new art style for Borderlands, and Pitchford miraculously agreed to give them two weeks to work on it. The CEO immediately regretted the decision, as he felt that the idea these guys were working on would have to be rejected, given the time constraints. </p>



<p>After the two weeks had passed, Pitchford entered the room, afraid of the inevitability, but to his surprise, the art team had worked wonders. As soon as he laid eyes on the new art style, he felt “it’s f—ing right; It’s right”. “It feels right. And it’s like everything we knew about what was wrong was confirmed when we felt it was right.”</p>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-the-drawing-board">Going Back to the Drawing Board</h2>



<p>As soon as the new style was finalized, Pitchford knew it would take considerable effort to get it approved by 2K. Surprisingly, after the bit of back and forth, they agreed, and then most of the stuff had to be redone from scratch. The game was in development for several years at that point, and changing the art style meant leaving almost all the levels and characters behind. Only Trash Coast and one other level remained, and the rest was rebuilt. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Borderlands 4 Have Crossplay? Split-Screen Status Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-borderlands-4-have-crossplay-split-screen-status-explained.1286409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Borderlands franchise has always prided itself on its multiplayer and inclusivity. The games are still wild rides if you play them by yourself, but let’s see if Borderlands 4 maintains its co-op, split-screen, and crossplay focus for the newest sequel.</p>



<p>I think Gearbox is very excited about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>. Not only did Randy Pitchford bring the game’s release date forward (an unheard-of move), but we raved about it on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive preview</a>, and Randy thinks it can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break 100 million units</a>!</p>



<p>If you’re excited about Borderlands 4 and want to know if you can play with friends across different platforms, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-crossplay-in-borderlands-4">Is There Crossplay in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Borderlands 4 team, assemble. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 has complete crossplay functionality across every platform the game is launching on.</strong></p>



<p>You can buy Borderlands 4 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Pretty much every major multi-platform market box is ticked off for this one. It’s great to see the Nintendo Switch 2 getting involved in third-party conversations, and if you are buying Gearbox’s newest title on Switch 2, you can play it with people on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, and vice versa!</p>



<p>As Handsome Jack would say: “Butt Stallion says ‘Hello.” It’s not a relevant quote, but I love it.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-in-split-screen">Can You Play Borderlands 4 In Split-Screen?</h2>



<p><strong>Gearbox has confirmed that Borderlands 4 also has split-screen multiplayer, but it’s more limited compared to general crossplay.</strong></p>



<p>All this information is via the Borderlands 4 <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a>. Under a section discussing the shooter’s co-op options, here’s what it says: “Borderlands 4 supports up to 4-player co-op online across all platforms, as well as <strong>2-player splitscreen couch co-op on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong>.</p>



<p>To reiterate, split-screen gameplay is only available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<p>You’re out of luck if you want to do this on the Nintendo Switch 2 or PC. The FAQ doesn’t explain why this is; the only thing we need to know is that this is the case. End of story. We can lock that answer up in the vault and move on.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-if-borderlands-4-has-cross-progression">Do We Know If Borderlands 4 Has Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p><strong>We unfortunately can’t say for certain if Borderlands 4 has cross-progression.</strong></p>



<p>The FAQ covers a variety of topics in great detail. However, one aspect not covered is cross-progression: The ability to transfer your save file across different platforms. Free-to-play live-service games commonly have cross-progression, but for now, we’ll have to put a question mark next to this one until we get clarification.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Borderlands 4’s crossplay inclusions sell you on the game? Is the franchise the perfect multiplayer title? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Also, tell us which new Vault Hunter you have your eyes on.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Team Cherry has revealed that Hollow Knight: Silksong will cost $20. In addition to the price point, the developer also noted that the sequel will go live at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on September 4, so there's no reason to stay up late September 3.</p><p dir="ltr">The launch price and release times were detailed over the weekend by Team Cherry <a href="https://x.com/teamcherrygames/status/1962330350681735642?s=46&amp;t=KA0eXy1Spm71dnMQdFC23A" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>. Silksong costing $20 could come as a surprise for some, since it's only $5 more than what Hollow Knight retailed for since arriving in 2017. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-is-still-breaking-records-as-silksong-nears/1100-6534386/">hype for the sequel has led to Hollow Knight breaking Steam concurrent-players records</a>--the metroidvania game saw over 71,000 people on September 1. The price has also been a mystery after it wasn't provided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/">alongside Silksong's release date announcement</a> last month.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The wait for Silksong has taken years longer than originally anticipated, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-silksong-take-so-long-its-not-what-you-might-think/1100-6534218/">Team Cherry has stated that's not the result of development problems</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let-me-love-you-crusader-kings-3.1286388/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have a problem: when I started working at Kotaku in February 2016, many of my coworkers were big fans of <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Even though a giant fantasy epic was very much not my kind of game, after listening to Luke and Kirk rave about it, I finally <a href="https://kotaku.com/help-me-finish-the-witcher-3-1791040756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gave it a shot</a> in January 2017. Things didn’t go so well at first, but eventually the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-finally-won-me-over-1791337357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won me over</a> hard. Even if I <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-got-the-worst-ending-in-the-witcher-3-1793040692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whiffed it in the end</a>, <em>The Witcher 3</em> is now one of my favorite games. The problem here is that ever since then, I keep thinking I’ll like games Luke likes, and then making a total ass of myself when I try to play them.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, Defector wrote <a href="https://defector.com/embrace-crusader-kings-iii-and-it-will-take-over-your-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article about <em>Crusader Kings 3</em></a><em>. </em>This got me thinking about <em>CK3</em>, a game I really tried to get into way back when because <a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-iii-the-kotaku-review-1844848772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke</a> made it sound so fun. I <em>really</em> put my back into it. I watched the entirety of a lengthy explainer YouTube playlist Luke sent me. I played the tutorial multiple times. I read a bunch of game guides, and then I played the tutorial a couple more times, and then I watched some more videos, and then I accepted that I would just never figure out the sprawling history roleplaying strategy <em>menus</em> of it all, and I moved on to other things.</p><p>I made a wiseass <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lxncbrjh3c2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky post</a> about Defector’s article, which led to one person sending me a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBm8xzpTp8Sp16E5C9y58nD7DF_B9em_L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends at the Table playthrough</a> that I started watching. Like Luke talking about the game, they made it seem so fun and rife with storytelling possibilities that I redownloaded <em>CK3</em> over the weekend. Maybe I’m ready for the game five years later, I reasoned; maybe I’m smarter or more patient, or my life now as a business guy has given me an aptitude for jargon I previously lacked. Maybe <em>this</em> time could be the time I finally become the kind of person who can play <em>Crusader Kings</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After ignoring the warnings of old saves titled things like “wwwhhhhyyyy” and “oh no” and, intriguingly, “do something about ulster,” I deleted them all and started a new game. I played the short version of the Ireland tutorial, reading slowly and nodding along. Then the tutorial pushed me toward a little war with a neighboring area, which it seemed like I was a shoe-in to win. Instead, I lost massively, watching my tiny guys get slaughtered by some other tiny guys while I stared helplessly at my computer screen trying to understand what had gone wrong.</p><p>Oh well! I deleted that save and started <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lxrpo3a35k2h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>again</em></a>, trying the longer tutorial this time. I read even slower, sometimes aloud, and I hovered over all the tooltips and opened up all the menus and read all their tooltips too. I finally won a little war, taking over the entirety of Munster. Progress! I was playing <em>CK3 </em>like a big boy!</p><p>I’m not totally sure what happened next: for some reason I ended up with a hostage from Dublin, even though my war was against Desmond. The game told me I could declare war against Dublin, so I did that–<em>completely</em> forgetting about the whole hostage thing and pissing off <em>everybody</em>. I lost the shit out of that war, and now I have negative prestige (I am, fittingly, “disgraced”), everyone in and out of my court is furious with me, and I have basically <em>no </em>idea where to go from here. I tried going on a hunt, the only way to get more prestige that I could afford, but the hunt <em>also</em> went to shit, so now I am still “disgraced” but I also have less money.</p><p>I just want what everybody else has with this game: funny stories and interpersonal intrigue and wacky twists on history. But to get to all that I feel like I have to hack a path through a jungle of nitty-gritty bits and <em>so many people </em>and a zillion menus full of information that I feel like I’m constantly too new to the game to understand. Everything in the game connects to everything else, in a way that I understand a tutorial could not possibly encompass, but for me this means that I feel like the tutorial ends way too early. The introduction to the game feels like it’s either telling me how to use WASD to move the camera, or I’m outmatched by a list of chores to tackle and no one to ask for help, which feels way too similar to my everyday life as it is.</p><p>The way through this is probably to just <em>keep playing</em> the game, letting myself actually fail instead of quitting when I feel like I’m in over my head, but <em>CK3</em> feels like one of those games where I barely even understand what I’m clicking enough to keep moving forward. I get myself into situations I can’t understand through my choices and then don’t understand how to rectify things, or I set a little goal for myself and then have no idea how to go about pursuing it. I feel like I understand what’s going on in the YouTube videos I watch or the articles I read, but somehow that never translates into actually being able to play the game on my own.&nbsp;</p><p>What are you supposed to <em>do</em> in this fucking game, and how the hell do you <em>do</em> it? What is the path from where I am, lost and horrified, to the hundreds of hours of <em>CK3 </em>fun that Luke and Defector and so many of my pals rave about? Can those of you who are good at this game even <em>remember</em> a time when you weren’t, when you looked at <em>CK3</em> with the wide-eyed bafflement of a total newcomer like me? I’m playing Friends at the Table’s videos in another tab as I write this, and they’re laughing and plotting and sound like they’re having the time of their lives. How did they <em>get</em> that? How do <em>I </em>get it?</p><p>A friend has offered to watch me play the game, which I am 100% going to take them up on; maybe the only way to become a <em>CK3</em> guy is to have another <em>CK3</em> guy convert you, the way I understand you can do with religions in the game itself and which I badly want to do but cannot figure out how. But if you have any other tips, at this point it isn’t even about trying to impress Luke anymore, I just want to not feel like a total failure.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deftones-back-2-school-white-pony"><h3>Deftones Are Forever</h3></a><p>'Cause back in school we are the leaders of it all'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong"><h3>Why Demonschool Got Delayed, Even Though It’s Nothing Like Silksong</h3></a><p>"It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Asobo Studios recently patched Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 with Sim Update 3 to include NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. The technology allows owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards to achieve even higher frame rates, accelerating performance by 4.2x on average compared to DLSS off.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsrWR1ukPTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In two days, the third-person action/adventure game Hell is Us will also launch with built-in support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Of course, those equipped with older RTX GPUs can still activate DLSS Frame Generation and/or DLSS Super Resolution. Moreover, Hell is Us is among those games that have been initially selected to be upgraded for the NVIDIA RTX Blackwell update on GeForce NOW, which means GeForce NOW Ultimate subscribers will be able to activate NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation even on the cloud. By the way, Hell is Us received a great score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hell-is-us-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Carcasole's review on Wccftech</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment, and will easily remain one of 2025's best games, though it falls short of amazing, and reaching the status of some of its influences. With a rich atmosphere, stunning visuals, deep lore, wonderfully realized characters and a fairly solid combat experience, it's not a game to be missed.</em></p>



<p>On the same day, Thursday, September 4, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is getting its The Order of Giants DLC (on which you may read <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an exclusive interview with the developers from Gamescom 2025</a>). The free update that goes live alongside the DLC will add the long-awaited NVIDIA RTX Hair feature to the game, improving the quality of hair and other hair-related rendering elements for GeForce RTX 50 Series owners.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The following day, Friday, September 5, will mark the launch of Bloober Team's new horror IP Cronos: The New Dawn, which also includes day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-says-ps5-barrier-to-blame-for-slowing-monster-hunter-wilds-sales.1286361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has blamed something he calls the "PS5 barrier" for slowing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales, suggesting that the console and its ancillary purchases are at least partly responsible for the game's underperformance in recent months.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nikkei</a> (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DriftingSpirit</a>; we're using machine translation for the interview), Tsujimoto says that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' "main platform" is the PS5, but that the "barrier" for this platform is "unexpectedly large".</p>

<p>He says that the console costs around 80,000 yen in Japan (which works out at around $540), but that when adding "software and monthly subscriptions", that cost can reach about 100,000 yen (roughly $670). This, Tsujimoto says, is "not an amount that can be easily reached, especially for younger generations".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=VUUTLu7G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom-eating.jpg?itok=wDvpE_4i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' slowing sales are at least partly down to the "PS5 barrier", according to Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Tsujimoto, this situation isn't unique to Japan, but is "similar overseas as well". Relatedly, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us" rel="nofollow">increased prices for the PS5</a> in the US back in August, with all three major models of the console affected by the price hike.</p>

<p>Tsujimoto says that "sales will begin in the future", presumably pointing to discounts for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>on the horizon. He also says the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">successful launch</a> at around 50,000 yen proves the "high level of cost-consciousness among ordinary consumers".</p>

<p>It's telling that Tsujimoto doesn't make reference to any of the other factors that might be causing&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>sales to slow down.</p>

<p>Players have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">complained</a>, for instance, about the game's lackluster PC performance and lack of endgame content, prompting Capcom to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">move its plans for the latter forward</a> to an earlier patch in August and to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow">promise more PC optimizations this winter</a>.</p>




<p>It's entirely possible that word-of-mouth regarding these problems has put some players off buying the game, so perhaps when Capcom addresses these issues, sales might pick up. Of course, discounts in major storefront sales won't hurt, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158419/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> arrives at an interesting time in these early months after the release of Switch 2. There haven't been many AAA-styled heavy-hitters to push this system so far, certainly not in terms of action games, at least. And so, Titanic Scion feels like it should give us a reasonable idea of how the console is positioned to handle this type of experience.</p>
<p>And it's a rough first pass. The console's just out, and this is a big old game with a whole lot going on, so it follows, rather unsurprisingly, that some issues are present, and concessions have had to be made to get it running on Nintendo's machine. It turns out the Switch 2 really isn't a pocket PS5 after all! But we knew that, you and I. It just stings a little when your new console can't play the new thing as nice as some other, not-quite-as-new consoles.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158423/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Does it hurt the experience that it doesn't match the 60fps found on other machines? Yes, it does a bit. I've been switching between this and the PS5 demo the past few days and it's absolutely better playing at 60fps, because of course it is. However, the main takeaway I have from playing that demo is actually that, besides the drop in frames, there's a surprising amount of parity across the board with regard to tech issues and jankiness.</p>
<p>This has been useful, because Titanic Scion, as flashy as it is in its combat and its robot models, and as sweet as its vistas can look as you jet-blast across enemy-strewn deserts and through crumbling city-scapes, doesn't half have a bunch of low-res textures crammed in there. It's a bit janky to look at, on all systems. So it's not your Switch 2's fault on that front.</p>
<p>But let's rewind a little - let's cool the old thruster jets, as they say, and talk about what this game, with its ludicrous moniker, is actually all about. What does it want? For the uninitiated, let me break it down thusly: Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a semi-open world game that sees you blast around large locations in a customisable mech suit. It's like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/armored_core_vi_fires_of_rubicon">Armored Core</a>, especially the most recent one, in how it gives you basic story plot points and loads of side missions of the "go fight" or "go get that thing" variety, then boots you out the door to get busy kicking the life out of stuff.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158429/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything here is, essentially, about the mechs. It's about finding weapons, upgrading, unlocking new skills — which is interesting in this one, so I'll get back to that — and making your big robot-self more powerful. You can play it in co-op online (which I couldn't for this review), and compared to the first game, everything here is bigger, more open, and more interesting. Heck, even the story, which is still fairly threadbare, is better. Which isn't saying much, mind, but progress is progress, comrades.</p>
<p>So, here you are, big robot person, brave and strong. And right at the start of the game you find yourself fighting back on behalf of humanity, a brave merc putting it all on the line against the Sovereign Axiom Empire (the traditional bad guys of the piece), whilst also having matters complicated somewhat by the arrival of...well...aliens who want to kill you.</p>
<p>Now, there <em>is</em> more to the story, but not much, so it's best you experience the rest of that for yourself without my spoiling. I should also point out that, whilst the narrative is no great shakes (and the English voice dub is a disaster, so get the Japanese on immediately), there are some very slick and stylish cutscenes holding it together, not to mention all of the fantastically cool mechs and sexy futuristic character designs there are to salivate over. It also does a good line in OTT pantomime villains who talk waaaay too much before I get to beat the crap out of them with a laser sword and a giant hammer. Which is something I always appreciate.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158430/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no real need to dwell on the narrative aspects here because, really, it's all about the robots. And in this regard, Daemon X Machina is a decent enough time. It can't match the likes of FromSoftware's Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon (now there's a game I want to see on this console), because, quite frankly, not many action games can, but it finds a place for itself, regardless.</p>
<p>Where Titanic Scion excels is in presenting <em>solid</em> mech scraps that are quick and easy to get into, and this time around it presents them in open-world areas that are improved over its predecessor. This makes for a tighter core gameplay loop overall, as the exploration involved, whilst still fairly simple (you can scan areas to highlight most items), does provide enough hidden secrets, bases to run amok in and, most importantly, sweet loot to find, that the game doesn't feel like it's exclusively about making the attack stats go up. Oh, and you also get to ride around in cars, on horses, and on a motorbike that transforms into a gun. Every little helps.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158420/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, I mentioned unlocking new skills earlier, and one of the big shifts in this sequel is that they've attempted, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-a-smart-evolution-for-mech-fans-and-a-good-early-test-for-switch-2">as I spoke about in my preview</a>, to make things a bit more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter</a> this time out. You can chip DNA strands off bad guys, you see, and the bigger and stronger the baddie, the better the DNA will be. Once you've got some of these genetic markers, you can then get busy fusing different strands in order to unlock abilities - at the cost of some fairly hideous mutations to the look of your custom-built avatar. Hey, that's the price of being able to do a turbo kick into a mech enemy's head, mate.</p>
<p>This makes for a situation where you actively <em>want</em> to get into big fights, where usually you might avoid them (especially when you are me), and overall it's a smart addition that melds well with the undeniable depth that's already there in terms of customisation and weapon setups.</p>
<p>With left and right main weapon slots, two side slots, a shoulder and auxiliary slot for weapons, and varying sizes and styles of mech to get to grips with, there's plenty of scope for differing playstyles here at a basic level, and while the first few missions disappoint with lacklustre weapons, give it a few hours and you'll be rocking huge guns called stuff like 'Revenant' that can one-shot those annoying floating testicle things that had been the bane of my existence for a little while.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158421/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With plenty of scope to mix and match, the devs then bring suitably cool weapons to the party, and you can come at the battles presented in a surprising number of ways as a result. I've had a spell rocking a shield and laser sword, mostly because it looks cool to do that when you're a robot, but I also really enjoy dual-wielding machine guns to bother enemies as I circle them, wait for them to get a little tired and then blammo with my long-ranged sniper rifle.</p>
<p>The weapon slots on offer make it a breeze to switch between setups of this nature on-the-fly in battle, and even the CQC — with its hammers and shanks and even grabbing and throwing enemies — holds up, whether you're getting in for punches and timing your dodges to keep the pressure on, or hanging back and hiding and doing all the things that I like to do.</p>
<p>With a decent spread of enemy types and solid combat, this is better than its predecessor already, so if you enjoyed that one, you know you're in for a good time here. However, there are issues. Plenty of them, in fact.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158422/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of performance, even when making peace with the fact that you're looking at 30fps here, I can't help but feel as though I'm experiencing input lag of sorts. It feels mushy and messy at times. On the PS5 version, there's the same feeling; it doesn't feel quite as tight as it should, especially in its dodging, and I think the drop in frame rate on Switch 2 exacerbates this to the point that sometimes I could lose a scrap for reasons other than my own skill failings. Which is not okay.</p>
<p>It makes for a messy feel to the combat — the core of the entire thing — and whilst it's still very playable, and I've completed the roughly 80 hours of tasks it took me to see the end with little real problem, it's disappointing that it's not much slicker. There's also some slowdown as you pass into new areas. Again, this is also noticeable on the PS5, so it's not specifically a Switch 2 thing. Indeed, beyond the frame rate, there's nothing here that I'd worry was the fault of the Switch 2, overly. It's just a game with a lot of rough edges that needs a few patches.</p>
<figure><a title="Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158425/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And so, overall, whilst a bit clunky and messy in places, Daemon X Machina is still a reasonably decent time for folk who enjoy customising mechs with a side-helping of perfectly serviceable exploration for good measure, and especially in handheld, where the low-res textures aren't quite so blown up as they are on a big TV. However, the issues with stuttering, mushy controls, and general weakness of the story are hard to ignore, and go quite some way in knocking the experience down.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a decent mech game with plenty of depth in its weapons setups and lots of cool loot to discover in its large open-world maps. The combat is flexible, it's fast, and it's very often plenty of fun.</p>
<p>However, performance issues — which are also present on other platforms, so don't sweat it too much, Switch 2 owners — make for a janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback. It's just not nearly as polished as it could be in this respect. With stutters loading into new areas and low-res textures a common sight (again, also on other systems), the overall feeling here is of a game that needs a few patches and tweaks to get it where it needs to be.</p></section>

			<p>A new announcement related to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> will be made later this week, but it won't be about new content hitting the game, a CD Projekt Red representative confirmed.</p>



<p>Commenting on speculation made about the announcement on X, CD Projekt Red Senior Community Manager Amelia "Lilayah" confirmed the announcement won't be about a new patch or new DLC. The community manager also reiterated that no Cyberpunk 2077 DLC is in the works, unsurprisingly, so expectations should be kept in check regarding the game getting some new major content in the future.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch.</p>— Amelia "Lilayah" (@Lilayaah) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p>As for what the Cyberpunk 2077 announcement coming on September 4 will be about, no one can say at the moment. This announcement was teased yesterday with an in-lore recruitment ad from the New United States of America, of which Night City is part, revealing a recruitment test for <em>"brave netrunners"</em> willing to join the nation's effort to overcome a mounting cybersecurity threat. Given how Project Orion, the second entry in the series, is still very far from release, could this be a colorful way to announce playtests for an upcoming, smaller project related to the series? Thankfully, the announcement is only a few days away, so it won't take much longer to find out what this is about.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available worldwide on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-louise-o-connor-xbox-chief-of-staff</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-everwild-producer-joins-xbox-as-chief-of-staff.1286319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Former&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has been recruited by Xbox to serve as its new chief of staff, following the cancellation of that game earlier this year.</p>

<p>Back in early July, Rare's <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> and various staff members at the studio were let go as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">wider layoff wave</a> at parent company Microsoft. However, it looks as though O'Connor is one of the Rare staffers who's managed to escape unemployment.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rare-veteran-lands-new-role-at-xbox-game-studios-after-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, O'Connor, who previously served as an artist and animator at Rare before overseeing <i>Everwild&nbsp;</i>as an executive producer, will now occupy the position of Xbox's chief of staff, which means she'll be overseeing the gaming division's various teams and employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-louise-oconnor-xbox.jpg?itok=BVMkROeo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-louise-oconnor-xbox.jpg?itok=VBb227fk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>producer Louise O'Connor has found a new home at Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>O'Connor's career with Rare started with 2001's foul-mouthed platformer&nbsp;<em>Conker's Bad Fur Day</em>, and after that game was released, she went on to work on titles like Xbox 360 launch title&nbsp;<em>Kameo: Elements of Power</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;2006 life sim&nbsp;<em>Viva Pinata</em>.</p>

<p>Her last credit with Rare is a special thanks nod on 2020's side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Battletoads</em>, with which our reviewer Austin was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battletoads-review" rel="nofollow">particularly impressed</a>&nbsp;(the game, that is, not the credit).</p>

<p>O'Connor also isn't the only Rare luminary to jump ship to Xbox in the last twelve months. She follows in the footsteps of former Rare boss Craig Duncan, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-head-retiring" rel="nofollow">took the place of Xbox's Alan Hartman</a> as the head of Xbox Game Studios back in October last year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many Rare staffers weren't as lucky as O'Connor or Duncan, with several employees losing their jobs as part of the aforementioned Microsoft employee cull, including long-time Rare veteran <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-banjo-kazooie-sea-of-thieves-director-leaves-rare-after-35-years-following-everwild-cancellation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gregg Mayles</a> (again, according to VGC).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Rare will announce next (if anything; it may end up going the same way as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>studio The Initiative</a>).

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong developers have confirmed that players accessing the Nintendo Switch version of the game will receive the Switch 2 upgrade for free.</p>



<p>Team Cherry’s highly anticipated title, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is all set to release on September 4, 2025, and the game’s prices have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-confirms-hollow-knight-silksong-price-release-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>. The game’s development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-has-hollow-knight-silksong-been-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in 2018</a>, and today players have received one final reminder from the developers 2 days ahead of its official release. </p>

Nintendo Switch players will receive the game keys directly via email. Switch 2 players will need to redeem the Switch key, download the game, and then download the additional free Hollow Knight: Silksong Upgrade Pack from the eShop to unlock the platform’s enhanced features. </p>



<p>As for Steam/DRM-free: Similar to the previous installment, Steam keys will be delivered via Humble Bundle, and they include the official soundtrack for all players. DRM-free versions will be sent out through the same link, but they “will not be visible until launch.” Surveys will end tomorrow, and players who were not able to make the cut-off will have to mail the developers directly. </p>

                <p>Even more evidence has come to light that suggests the next Nintendo Direct event could take place very soon.

The leaker said fans can expect it during the second week of September. He said it's likely to happen on September 11 or 12. That matches up with a previous report that the event could happen on September 12, which is one day before the 40th anniversary of the release of 1985's original Super Mario Bros.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As for what might be on tap for the next Nintendo Direct, the leaker said <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962217694314287346" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it's possible</a> the Direct could be the venue for the announcement of the rumored Red Dead Redemption II port for Switch 2."Maybe? Depends if Nintendo was able to court Rockstar. RDR2 is Switch 2 bound regardless of announcement/reveal venue," NateTheHate2 said.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on August 19 and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/" data-ref-id="2900-6889">beefy broadcast focused exclusively on Kirby: Air Riders.</a></p><p>Nintendo has held a September Nintendo Direct <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1962493754889101707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">each September for the past eight out of nine years</a>, so it would be a more notable event if Nintendo <em>did not </em>have a Direct on tap for September 2025.</p><p>If the Nintendo Direct is real, it would be the second major platform-holder's broadcast in September, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-playstation-state-of-play-announced-coming-very-soon/1100-6534390/" data-ref-id="1100-6534390">next PlayStation State of Play event lined up for September 3. </a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has asked players to stop sending harsh, non-constructive criticism to developers as it can be demoralising.</p>
<p>Yoshida discussed the topic of dealing with feedback at a panel during PAX West last week. The MMORPG's community is known for being particularly vocal, while Yoshida himself is in frequent dialogue through the Letter from the Producer streams and Fan Fest events.</p>
<p>Yoshida first noted players and developers are "in the same community" due to their love of games. "Whenever there are comments being directed towards us, I try to understand where they're coming from, what they're trying to tell us," he said.</p>

<p>He continued: "Positive feedback is great and it's a great motivator to aim to continue making those players happy.</p>
<p>"We see gamers as allies or friends…I want to continue that mutual understanding."</p>
<p>Yoshida then specifically addressed negative feedback.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasise here, there is a person behind the games," he said. "While I understand some harsh criticism might be necessary sometimes, there's a person behind the games that you enjoy and if you have that harsh criticism, I think we would want to have it be constructive.</p><p>"Some players I know want to express their frustrations, but I think very harsh words will sometimes hurt developers very deeply. I think this applies for any creator in the video game industry. And some of the harsh words that were thrown at some of them, it could potentially demoralise them so much that they don't want to make video games anymore. And in the end we - as in the gamers - would miss out on good work that these people could potentially have made just because people have thrown these very harsh words and non-constructive criticism at those people. It just becomes such a negative environment.</p>
<p>He concluded: "So whenever you are drafting your post before you hit enter you might want to reconsider."</p>

<p>While Yoshida didn't specify any particular experience here, he has previously discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/transphobic-abuse-sent-to-final-fantasy-14s-wuk-lamat-voice-actor-breaks-my-heart-says-naoki-yoshida">transphobic criticism sent to Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer</a> following the release of the Dawntrail expansion.</p>
<p>Really, though, Yoshida's words apply to all game developers. While players are often passionate about their favourite games, sending abuse is never a valid response.</p>

<figure><a title="fc 26 switch 2 port" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ade2224325b10/fc-26-switch-2-port.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, we know that the folks behind big AAA sports game releases — and especially yearly ones where they really have to scrape the barrel and make up new words like 'TruMotion' and things of this nature to keep us interested — like to engage the pre-release hype train. It's part of life, it's part of nature. It keeps the soul warm and the planet spinning.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/ea-sports-fc-26-nintendo-switch-2-performance-powerful-good/">Game Rant</a> a few days ago (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-power-ea-sports-fc/">NintendoEverything</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> dev Andreas Wilsdorf has been rather unexpectedly verbose in his claims on just how nicely his latest football game is running on Nintendo's new machine. To the point that it almost feels a little too good to be true, especially when considering how some of the game's beta and show-floor demo players seem to be finding things.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zmpitr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>During an interview about the game with line producer Wilsdorf and career mode design director Pete O'Donnell, Wilsdorf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In general, the Switch 2 was really exciting. Being on the platform with FC this year, the performance is what really excites us. It is on parity, basically, with what we see on PS5 and Xbox. Again, it's a [handheld] console, but the first time I played with it, I was really impressed. Then, we also saw it working on the simulation and the times it takes to simulate the season and so on, which was very, very close to what we saw in PlayStation and Xbox devkits. That's really impressive."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, of course, this is fantastic news on the face of things, but it doesn't mesh with some of the real-world evidence that we've been presented with elsewhere. Indeed, there has been a beta of the game running on Switch and Switch 2 (we didn't get a code, unfortunately), and players of that version have been reporting in on the game's Reddit forum with their impressions:</p>

<p>As you can see from this particular post, it seems as though the game hasn't been impressing everyone, although it is impossible to 100% confirm that these people are actually playing the Switch 2 version, rather than the Switch 1 beta - there has been some confusion it seems, and elsewhere other early beta players have an entirely different take on the experience:</p>

<p>Felix Sanchez, one of our intrepid video producers, got to go hands-on with the game at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> recently and came away unimpressed after playing in docked mode. "It felt almost exactly like 25 on Switch," he says. "Sure, it ran stable, but it's still running at what seemed like 30fps and the graphics are quite a downgrade compared to other platforms."</p>
<p>After years of disappointing '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_20">Legacy</a>' versions of FIFA on Switch, EA finally delivered an up-to-date, feature-rich game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">EA Sports FC 24</a>, and we were hoping Switch 2's power would open up possibilities for the series that weren't possible on older Nintendo hardware. With just a few weeks to go, and as much as we want to believe it's gonna be as good as Mr Wilsdorf says, the 30fps gameplay (which would be a disaster for many excited FC fans) and the expected excision of crossplay have got us interested to see how it turns out when the oven bell finally dings on September 26th. Or even sooner, if we get a demo.</p>

Pitchford also expressed the desire to bring more Gearbox games to the platform, though he wouldn't elaborate any further than that on this topic.</p>



<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an awesome, awesome machine – I'm so grateful for it. It's less about innovating and more about perfecting, and giving us what we want and what works. I love my Switch, and I kind of wanted a more powerful one with newer games. When I got the briefing and realized, 'oh, it's more than that, Nintendo has invested a lot, not just in the hardware, but in the software, and making it easier than ever to connect with other people. This is getting exciting.</em></p>



<p><em>I love Switch, and I love my Nintendo Switch 2, and I think that without getting in trouble and trying to talk about things that are from the future, we love making games, and we love entertaining people, and we want to be on the platforms where the people that want us to be are. And Nintendo just had the most successful new console launch in the history of video game consoles, and I don't think that's slowing down.</em> <em>I love that platform, and I want to bring more games to it, but it's really not the right time for me to talk about games that are down the road.</em></p>



<p>As far as we know, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-and-brothers-in-arms-games-listed-on-developers-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working</a> on a new Brothers in Arms game and possibly Tiny Tina's Wonderlands 2, a sequel to the 2022 spin-off featuring the titular Tiny Tina as the 'dungeon master'. The completion status of these projects is currently unclear.</p>

              <p>Roborock is celebrating its 11th birthday and instead of just blowing out the candles, the company is going to be giving the gifts to its customers. For a limited time, the entire line of smart robot vacuums is available with massive discounts and the discounts are so good that <strong>most of the models have reached their record low prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Among these, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/">Roborock Q8 Max is our favorite, and it’s currently on sale at $179, down from $599</a>. It’s not the newest model in the series but in<strong> terms of value for money it’s unbeatable</strong>, which is also why it’s the company’s best-selling unit in the world.</p>

<h2>Perfect for Everyday</h2>
<p>The powerful suction, <strong>which is 5500 Pa</strong>, is one of the first things you notice and it gives it the cleaning capability that’s usually reserved for high-end devices. Dust, crumbs, tiny particles and embedded dirt in carpets all disappear just as easily as lighter material resting on hardwood. Supporting this power is <strong>Roborock’s DuoRoller brush system</strong> that’s a smart twin roller design that’s resistant to hair tangling and rolls easily across a range of surfaces. For pet owners, this is peace of mind that the vacuum won’t be choked after a single pass through a hairy patch in the living room.</p>
<p>But a robot vacuum is more than just brute force, because if it doesn’t clean intelligently, performance quickly becomes frustrating: That’s where the Q8 Max differs from bargain-class machines. With Roborock’s PreciSense LiDAR navigation system, <strong>it accurately scans and maps the home</strong>, and builds a detailed layout that allows it to map routes logically. Combined with obstacle detection technology, the Roborock Q8 Max neatly avoids cords, toys, and table legs, so it gets stuck less and has more time actually cleaning.</p>



<p>Another reason this model has been so popular is that it does not just vacuum,<strong> it also mops and it does both in a single pass</strong>. The onboard electronic water tank has thirty levels of flow control so you can adjust the mop output to clean anything from sensitive hardwood to tile. This means beyond a surface touch-up, you get a deeper clean without needing to switch devices or start multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Battery life and independence are also crucial to the experience: The <strong>5200 mAh battery offers up to four hours of runtime from a single charge</strong>, and covers areas as large as 300 square meters in one go. To further simplify upkeep, the automatic dust-emptying dock holds weeks’ worth of debris in its 2.5-liter sealed bag. For most households, that means quite literally <strong>not needing to consider bin emptying for nearly two months</strong> as your robot does the lion’s share of the floor cleaning quietly in the background. Add in Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri compatibility, and it is a home companion that responds to voice commands without demanding attention in return.</p>
<p>That’s why the Q8 Max has been the best-seller for Roborock.</p>
<p>With Roborock celebrating its 11 years of innovation, getting the opportunity to grab the Q8 Max at this all-time low&nbsp; price point makes it a no-brainer.</p>
