<p>We had a great time with Kirby Air Riders, calling it "a cracking sequel that gives solo players much more to dig into with its story campaign, whilst also bringing all-new levels of shiny graphics, bells and whistles to its returning City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Down Racing modes" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">our review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">announced it will soon require facial recognition-based age verification</a> from its players to unlock communication features. Beginning in the first week of December, starting with Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands, and the rest of the world in 2026, this new security feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-experiences-iarc-age-ratings-age-verification-end-of-2025/">is the latest effort from the company to make it a safer platform for children</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>All users can now voluntarily go through the Facial Age Estimation process to secure their access to communication features," </em>it wrote in a new blog post<em>. "During the first week of December, we’ll begin enforcing the age check requirement in select markets including Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. Those requirements will extend to the rest of the world wherever chat is available in early January.</em>"</p>



<p>With this decision, Roblox claims it is "<em>ushering in [a] new safety standard</em>," and says "<em>this innovation supports age-based chat and limits communication between minors and adults</em>."</p>



<p>Following the passing of new legislation in the UK, Discord implemented its own facial recognition age verification for its British users. Facial recognition that was immediately tricked <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">with nothing more than a copy of Death Stranding</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Roblox's verification could fare much better, but while this new measure could do what the company claims it can do, it's by no means a perfect solution. </p>



<p>"<em>As the internet has matured, technological advancements in safety and security have steadily shifted the industry's approach to age assurance. While initial efforts relied on simple self-declared age to manage access to features, the industry has since progressed to behavioral based methods</em>," the blog continues.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Roblox is going further. We’re unlocking chat and age-appropriate experiences for our users by requiring them to complete an age check through Facial Age Estimation or ID verification<sup>1</sup>. Once the age check is complete, users will only be allowed to chat with others in similar age groups, unless they become <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">Trusted Connections</a> with people they know.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>This initiative is designed to provide even more age-appropriate experiences for all users, which we believe will improve interactions for users of all ages on Roblox."</em></p>

            <p>
It's been seven years since the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a>, and in all that time, I've somehow never noticed that the title is a reference to sleepless penury. My mind jumped to the association of moonlight with magic and romance, skimming clean over the less enchanting sense of "moonlighting" as working a second job after dark. Luckily, this knowledge has dawned on me just in time to softly kneecap my enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a>, which launches into early access today, and appears quite a bit different from its predecessor.

<p>
What's the same? Well, it's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/moonlighter-review">a real-time action-RPG about having a second job as a village storekeeper</a>. By day, you stock shelves with potions, etcetera and work the till. By night, you head into the catacombs to replenish your wares. 
</p>
<p>
What's changed? Well, it's now a 3D game with an angled aerial camera, rather than a top-down pixelganza. They've also moved away from the original Zelda or Binding Of Isaac-style dungeon format. Instead of an expanse of rooms that seal you in till you've killed all their monsters, you'll be picking from branching paths as in a roguelike such as Hades.</p><p>The inventory management side has been re-puzzlified with (for example) new items that consume adjacent items, perhaps gaining in strength for every treasure they eat. The shop management stuff is more elaborate, with new modifiers to boost the value of otherwise homely goods.
</p>
<p>Developers Digital Sun and publishers 11-Bit aren't sure how long it'll be in early access. The current version includes three dungeon biomes with their own enemies, around 120 relics, four main weapons, and roughly 100 shop and dungeon perks. The final version will have more environments, bosses, loot, NPCs, quests and story stuff, plus expanded shop systems, events and customisation options. All this plus the customary bugfixes and general improvements.</p>
<p>
Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/">Steam</a>. I enjoyed the first Moonlighter, and I'm uncertain about the new dungeons and visual direction, but the inventory and shop enhancements sound worthwhile on paper. To circle back to my intro, I'm a bit concerned that I can be persuaded to overlook exploitative or precarious working conditions if they're presented to me in fluffy fantasy language. Please do not start referring to staff cuts as Ye Olde Layoffs, publishers.

            <p>
I won't comment on the quality of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, the game, because I've not had the chance to play it, though obviously it's not been received with all that much fanfare. You know what I did quite like? Marathon, the short film, the one that came with the game's reveal from Alberto Mielgo. It felt like a strong promise of a (more-or-less) fresh sci-fi world, the performances were subdued, it felt larger than life. Good stuff! Yet as many things currently are, it's been scrutinised over potential AI use, prompting Mielgo to put out a (understandably aggro) statement.
</p>
<p>
Taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/">Instagram</a>, Mielgo said that he couldn't believe "we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI. HELLO." He went on to note that everything in the film, including "paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders [were] done with [a] huge team - 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time."
</p>
<p>
On the topic of what Mielgo's personal opinion on AI was, he perhaps more sheepishly noted that he has "no idea." To his credit, he followed that up by saying that "AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced." He then sort of ruined that sentiment by finishing with the line, "this text was kindly edited with ChatGPT," a line written so dryly I honestly can't tell if it's a joke or not (I hope so).
</p>
<p>
In seemingly now-deleted comments on the same Instagram post (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">The Game Post</a>), Mielgo responded to someone asking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">Marathon's plagiarism issue</a>, obviously a hot button topic in the world of AI, and his thoughts on the fact that some of these plagiarised assets may have been handed off to the director to make his short film with. He explained, "you know what I hate the most? Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers. Go whistle around."
</p><p>
To be unfair to both Mielgo and Bungie, there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">has been</a> a <a href="https://x.com/ELEMENTJ21/status/1671281580831297536">pattern</a> of <a href="https://x.com/relay314/status/1441825409562120201">plagiarism issues</a> at the studio over the years. A one off is one thing, but this is notably questionable. Anyway, I do think people should stop trying to sniff out AI use because annoyingly the stuff is getting better at making "art", so let's put our focus into just completely snuffing it out, yeah?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-powera-mario-controller-for-switch-is-now-the-cheapest-nintendo-licensed-steal-at-nearly-50-off.1358296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has started offering its early Black Friday deals, and if you’re a Nintendo Switch player, one of the best gaming accessories is currently going for nearly half off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The PowerA wireless controller (Mario Joy Edition) is down to just $27, thanks to a 46% discount that’s live on Amazon right now.</a></p>
<p>The discount is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders. Even better, you don’t need to worry about entering any weird coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. The offer, however, is selling fast, which means it won’t be around for much longer. Grab it while it is still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfortable to Use for Long Gaming Sessions</h2>
<p>This fun red controller has a lot of personality. There’s a Mario graphic on the side, plus colorful buttons that elevate the look while sticking to the overall theme. The ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold, so you can game for hours without ending up with sore palms. You’re getting a familiar button layout with precision analog sticks, a full-size D-pad, and all the essential ABXY and shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>The controller plays nicely with all current models, including the Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and even the latest Switch 2. It runs on AA batteries that offer up to 40 hours of gameplay. You can easily go a couple of weeks without worrying about swapping them out. And since it’s wireless, you can move around freely without a cable getting in the way. Sitting back, standing up, or just passing it around; gaming is going to be convenient.</p>



<p>Just note that it doesn’t support HD rumble, IR camera, or Amiibo NFC scanning, like most other options in this range. If that isn’t a dealbreaker for you, this PowerA wireless controller in Mario Joy is a great option to consider otherwise. It not only looks cool, but offers solid performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5697/">The compatibility is impressive as well, as so is the battery. This deal brings the price down to just $27 after a massive 46% discount.</a></p>
<p>This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the retailer is likely going to push the price back up soon. Act fast before that happens!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last few weeks, you might have noticed something odd. A lot of people seem to think that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is about to be announced. Some folks have dates marked for when we should expect the sequel. There are even some who think <em>Half-Life 3</em> will be announced at the Game Awards. And a lot of people seem to believe that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is real and nearly finished despite, you know, Valve never confirming that. So uh, what’s going on?</p> <p>Since 2021, d<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/?moveToWidget=3458764648489439347&amp;cot=14">ataminers have been finding and documenting many snippets of code</a> left in other Valve projects, like<em> DOTA 2</em>, related to something known internally at Valve as “HLX.” And while Valve hasn’t told us what&nbsp;HLX refers to, fans and dataminers have connected a lot of dots over the last four years or so.</p>

 <p>From what has been found, HLX appears to be a single-player, non-VR FPS featuring a character in an HEV suit who fights aliens and soldiers through various levels while possibly solving physics-based puzzles. Now, that sounds a lot like a new <em>Half-Life</em> game. And most of the community following HLX, as well as multiple reliable leakers, have started to call this datamined project <em>Half-Life 3.</em></p>

 <p>The fact that Valve has been working quietly on what appears to be a new <em>Half-Life</em> game for at least roughly five years, and likely longer than that, has created some hype online. But everything got kicked into high gear last week after Valve announced three new pieces of hardware: <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">The Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Half-Life 3</em> hype explodes</h2> <p>For many fans, already hungry for a new <em>Half-Life</em> game and convinced by dubious Reddit posts and TikToks that it was totally being announced soon, this hardware announcement from <a href="https://youtu.be/t1qwXTXVlXE">Valve was a very big deal.</a> Valve often releases new games with new hardware, like <em>Alyx</em> with the Index and <em>Desk Job</em> with the Steam Deck.</p>

 <p>So, naturally, many started to speculate that Valve’s next game, likely HLX aka <em>Half-Life 3,</em> would be announced soon and launched around the release of the new Steam Machine in 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-steam-machine-is-the-perfect-time-to-launch-half-life-3-2000644102">Heck, even I think that might be possible</a>. But then folks went into overdrive trying to predict the date <em>HLX</em> would be announced.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1oyt88p/summary_of_why_it_will_be_november_2025_and_most/">November 18 became a popular date for many</a>. It would mark the five-year anniversary of <em>Half-Life: Alyx’</em>s announcement, the last <em>Half-Life</em> game, and would give Valve plenty of time to market the sequel before an early 2026 launch. Others believe November 19 is the magical date, as it’s the 27-year anniversary of the original <em>Half-Life.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>People soon noticed that there’s a gap in sales events on Steam <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-sale-dates/#:~:text=November%2010%20%E2%80%93%20November,15%3A%20Sports%20Fest">starting on November 18 and ending on December 8.</a> Some theorized that this was because Valve wanted a clear runway for <em>Half-Life 3</em>‘s reveal, though it seems unlikely that Valve would delay sales for a new game reveal.</p> <h2>More clues, more hype</h2> <p>Then fans noticed Geoff Keighley, the creator and host of the Game Awards and master of video game reveals, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1p02x4w/geoff_keighley_has_one_game_on_his_wishlist/">only had one game on his Steam wishlist</a>. When asked about it, he offered up some eye emojis. This threw people into a frenzy, despite the fact that <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have a Steam page, so it can’t be added to a wishlist yet. Didn’t matter; this was evidence <em>Half-Life 3</em> was going to be announced at Geoff’s annual trailer extravaganza, the Game Awards, in December.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">27 years ago today, Valve released HALF-LIFE, it's first game. <a href="https://t.co/9d13MAyAmB">pic.twitter.com/9d13MAyAmB</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1991101144207085644">The Game Awards tweeted about <em>Half-Life</em> on Wednesday</a>, noting the anniversary of the first game’s release. People freaked. But, as pointed out by<a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV/status/1991160882202546235"> longtime Valve reporter and leaker Tyler McVicker</a>, the Game Awards account tweets this same anniversary every year. (And does it for <em>Half-Life 2,</em> as well.)</p>

 <p>But that didn’t matter either. At this point, people can’t ignore how many insiders, leakers, and reporters are hinting at some big announcement from Valve. Too many “clues” are being found by the community every day this week for fans to stop getting more and more excited. The hype levels are out of control. The hopium is off the charts.</p> <p>But keep in mind that, officially speaking, Valve has not announced that a new <em>Half-Life</em> game is in development. Still, Valve did reportedly have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/820533/valve-secrecy-security-guards-steam-machine-valve-hq-no-hl3">a lot of extra security at their offices</a> while revealing all the new Steam hardware. And the company does seem to have one more thing to announce, as its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/valve/">official Steam page lists two upcoming games</a>, but only shows one, <em>Deadlock</em>. Is the other game <em>Half-Life 3</em>? The internet seems to think so.</p> <p>As a longtime <em>Half-Life</em> fan who has been waiting a long time for <em>Half-Life 3</em>, I’m inclined to believe, though I’d also advise everyone getting excited right now to remember that this could all lead to nothing. Expect nothing and you’ll be pleasantly surprised with whatever we get.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s On-Hold Financial Report Will Be Published Before Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-hold-financial-report-published/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-on-hold-financial-report-will-be-published-before-friday.1358284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has revealed that the H1 FY 2025-26 report that was recently put on hold will be published ‘before the opening of trading on Friday 21st November 2025’. This news comes mere days after Ubisoft delayed the release of the report and put a hold on trading, fuelling widespread speculation.</p>



<p>The leading belief was that Ubisoft was going to uncover something huge, such as an imminent buyout. That has not proven to be the case thus far, but at the very least, we’ll have fresh numbers to examine before Friday.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-to-reveal-performance">Ubisoft to Reveal Performance</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cfo-internal-memo/">a report</a> circulated by Insider Gaming last week, Ubisoft’s Chief Financial Officer explained why a hold had been put on trading:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight.</p>



<p>Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time. To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. </p>



<p>I encourage you all to listen to the conference call – which will be available via the Investor section of our site — just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has now been confirmed that the financial release will drop before trading opens on Friday, which means it’ll probably be published <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Despite trying to remain cool and prevent ‘unnecessary speculation’, Ubisoft sparked just that by this action, which has mostly gone unanswered.</p>







<p>In a recent filing, Ubisoft’s United Kingdom arm stressed that the face of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-people-playing-fewer-games-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games industry is changing</a> as people ‘play fewer games for longer’, which is causing standalone, single releases to ‘struggle to stand out’.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-2018-has-allegedly-been-copied-by-a-2024-indian-animated-movie/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-of-war-2018-has-allegedly-been-copied-by-a-2024-indian-animated-movie.1358281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought a 7-year-old game couldn’t have one of its most iconic action scenes imitated by an animated Indian film, then think again. Accusations have suddenly come to light that Mahavatar Narashimha blatantly copies some of God of War 2018’s most iconic fight scenes.</p>



<p>Santa Monica’s 2018 reboot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-developers-new-ip-was-cancelled-after-investing-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> is a masterpiece. The combat is classic Kratos chaos, and its boss fights and action sequences go up a notch. Who can forget the opening sequence between Kratos and Baldur? Not Mahavatar Narashimha, apparently.</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-and-mahavatar-narashimha-have-something-in-common">God of War And Mahavatar Narashimha Have Something In Common?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes, art imitates art. Credit to Santa Monica</figcaption></figure>



<p>It wouldn’t be a shock if you’ve never heard of Mahavatar Narashimha. The Indian animated movie isn’t well-known outside the country of its origin. Even though it was first debuted at the International Film Festival of India in 2024, it only got a proper theatrical release this year.</p>



<p>It’s been a few months since its July 2025 debut on the silver screen. However, one narrative has suddenly come to the fore: One of Mahavatar Narashimha’s sequences looks like a direct copy of Kratos and Baldur’s first encounter.</p>



<p>X account <a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Thunder</a> has done a side-by-side video, showing the God of War sequence, and the alleged Mahavatar Narashimha imitation. The 19-second clip features Mahavatar Narashimha’s character being sent flying through the air—like Kratos—before crashing and lying face-first on the floor—like Kratos.</p>



<p>The next few seconds are unnervingly identical as each antagonist flies toward the character, misses, and stands up menacingly. Both heroes then rip a tree out of the ground, before being tackled and attacked in (again) frame-by-frame copies of one another.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>You can be the judge on this one. It’s not like this would be the first time something has ever copied something else; it’s just odd. Do you think this is nothing more than a happy coincidence? Or is Mahavatar Narashimha blatantly honoring Santa Monica’s game?

                <p>Veteran RPG developer and Fallout co-creator Tim Cain argues that modern games have forgotten some lessons of history--a point he made in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a>--you can watch the full video below--responding to a viewer's question about whether older titles contain any supposed lost wisdom. Cain's answer--"Yes, there is. Good question." Looking back at his own early years in the industry, he describes an era with only programmers and some artists, but no narrative designers, and far fewer competing priorities. In contrast, he says today's games "try to be everything to everyone."</p><p>In about 13 minutes, Cain explains how he attributes the sharp focus of early games to the era's severe technical limitations and fragmented hardware landscape. "Games were being made for PC, for Apple, for Atari, for Commodore, for a wild assortment of consoles," he recalled, with no shared standards to ease development. Teams were small and multitasking was essential--programmers often acted as artists and sound designers, reverse-engineering undocumented hardware to make their games function.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEF1Ankos0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YEF1Ankos0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"These games were really focused, because they had to be," he explained.</p><p>The first major lesson he believes modern developers should reclaim is the importance of efficiency. With the tiny memory budgets and slow processors of the 1980s, Cain says, "you write efficient code or your game doesn't work on the Atari console." Designers were equally constrained: They couldn't stack crafting systems, puzzles, companion mechanics, and sprawling narratives on top of each other. Instead, they had to choose a single segment of gameplay and perfect it.</p><p>"The idea that you could have a core game loop that was a huge variety of actions just did not exist," Cain added, noting that a game like Gauntlet had to nail its narrow focus on dungeon-clearing because that was the entire experience.</p><p>Cain warns that today's games risk "becoming indulgent" by adding features that "dilute the game" rather than improve it. To illustrate, he compares 1980s game design to a high-end restaurant where a chef prepares a superb dish from a few exceptional ingredients, while modern blockbuster games resemble buffets that prioritize variety over quality. His advice for developers--especially those in small indie teams--is straightforward: simplify.</p><p>"You need to be simple. You need to stay focused, and whatever you do has to be extremely well executed. And then you'll be like that fancy restaurant ... that meal was delicious."</p><p>People in the comments, though, were mixed on this observation. Games like Fallout 4 were brought up, and how that has crafting, companion quests, community building, and is a fan-favorite out of the series. Conversely, one commenter in their early 20s went back to play the original Diablo and found it kept them engaged, with practically none of the "modern tactics" that they were used to.</p>

            <p>
It's been so long since dino-survival sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> was unveiled, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-revealed-with-preposterous-van-diesel-starring-trailer">preposterous Vin Diesel-starring CGI trailer</a> almost feels like a dream. But developer Studio Wildcard remains adamant it's still happening, and it's paving the way for its arrival with a brand-new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> expansion, Ark: Lost Colony, launching on 16th December.
</p>
<p>
Officially, Lost Colony serves as a link between Ark's 2018 expansion Extinction and its 2019 follow-up Genesis, while also laying the groundwork for Ark 2. But it doesn't stop there. Lost Colony <em>also</em> ties into Ark's (still only 50 percent aired) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-the-animated-series-surprise-releases-in-us-and-canada-ahead-of-april-debut-elsewhere">animated TV series</a>, bringing some of the show's star-studded cast over to the game. As such, you can expect to hear the likes of Oscar winner Michelle Yeo, David Tenant, Battlestar Galactic's Katie Sackhoff, and more - all appearing in "cinematic anime sequences" by Japanese studio MAPPA - when Lost Colony comes to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in December.

<p>
Lost Colony is described as Survival Ascended's "first canonical expansion", and deposits player in the snowy wastes of Arat Prime - birthplace of the ARKs - where they'll follow Mei Yin's footsteps through an "intense journey into the heart of darkness". There's talk of "lost" character ability trees to unlock, "cursed" gear tiers and new building systems to craft, plus new creatures to tame - including the Ossidon, a "hulking, engineered apex winter-predator".
</p><p>
Players eager to check out the Ossidon ahead of Lost Colony's December arrival can do so right now, but only by purchasing Ark: Survival Ascended's £29.99/$29.99 USD Lost Colony Expansion Pass. Cough up and the Ossidon can be experienced as "preview gameplay content" on existing maps, as it temporarily roams the cold biomes of Ragnarok, Valguero, and The Center.
</p>
<p>
Lost Colony arrives some six months after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-developer-acknowledges-missing-in-action-sequel">originally announced June launch window</a>, but there's still no indication of when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">repeatedly delayed Ark 2</a> might show up. It was originally announced in 2020 (with that silly Vin Diesel trailer) but didn't feature in the Ark content roadmap released earlier this year, leaving many to speculate it won't arrive until sometime after December 2026. Studio Wildcard is, of course, no stranger to delays; even the second half of the Ark animated television show - originally promised for 2024 - couldn't escape the curse, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-missing-in-action-second-half-of-the-ark-animated-tv-series-has-reappeared-oh-with-a-formal-delay">now due sometime next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-delays-first-half-2025-26-fiscal-results-release-major-announcement-could-be-coming/">Last week, on November 13, approximately fifteen minutes before</a> they were meant to be published, Ubisoft announced it would be delaying the release of its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year. It also announced that it would stop trading ahead of the market's opening the next day, which was a step reportedly taken "<em></em><em>to limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay</em>." Now, it has been confirmed <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2ek0UOt9DZO072eswdJsmx/8585762d888e7a5f75001725aba1ab2b/PR_19_11_2025_EN.pdf">that those delayed results will be public by the market's opening on Friday, November 21, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing can stop people from speculating, necessarily or otherwise, and the big speculation surrounding the delay is the idea that Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">is going the way of EA and becoming a privately owned company</a>. Not owned by the same Consortium that is in the process of owning EA Sports FC, but by Chinese publisher and developer Tencent, with which Ubisoft recently opened a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>The same Vantage Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">that now houses the rights to Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six</a>, the three franchises Ubisoft considers to be its most significant across its portfolio. It's worth noting that there's been no official word that Ubisoft is actively looking to be acquired. </p>



<p>We've seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">reports of the company's shareholders allegedly talking about a buyout</a>, but Ubisoft's only word on the question has been, "<em></em><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em>"</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that the delay could have been for something as small as a copy error in the results that needed fixing, instead of the latest major shift in the layout of the video game industry. Though if it happens, it'll continue the streak of extremely high-scale consolidation we've seen in recent years.</p>

              <p><span>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to be expensive, especially with early Black Friday deals dropping in fast.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you’re after a modest-sized screen that still delivers on both visuals and sound, here’s some good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">The 2025 model of Samsung’s 40-inch Full HD F6000 Smart TV is currently available on Amazon for just $148, thanks to a 25% discount</a>. It normally retails for close $200, so this deal is taking a good chunk off the price, making the upgrade much more affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about entering any weirdly long coupon codes or following some complicated checkout steps to score the discount. Just add the item to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. It’s also important to note that the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, which means it won’t be around for long. If you’ve been looking to treat yourself to a new screen, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Brilliant, Sharp Visuals for All Your Content</h2>
<p>This screen is not exactly big, which makes it ideal for smaller living rooms and even bedrooms. The sleek profile and slim bezels give it a minimal look while also keeping distractions at bay.</p>
<p>It pushes 1080p Full HD resolution for brighter, sharper visuals. Of course, it won’t rival a 4K screen, but it’s still fairly decent for everyday streaming. There’s High Dynamic Range (HDR) that actively expands the contrast between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene for better color accuracy, plus mega contrast, which automatically adjusts brightness and depth in real time. Watching a nature documentary or streaming your new favorite crime thriller, you’re going to enjoy an immersive viewing experience that pulls you in.</p>



<p>The Object Tracking Sound Lite feature helps the TV simulate directional audio to make it feel more dynamic. It’s pretty solid on its own, but you can always add a compatible Samsung soundbar to improve it even further.</p>
<p>The TV is also powered by Samsung’s One UI Tizen platform, which brings all your major streaming apps into one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5695/">You’re going to have instant access to over 2,700 free channels, including 400+ from Samsung TV Plus.</a> New content is also frequently added, so there’s always going to be something new to watch. Best of all, it also lets you cast your phone to the big screen to scroll, watch shows, and even take video calls.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon-2000645455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony%E2%80%99s-budget-headphones-slashed-an-extra-50-off-now-nearly-free-for-black-friday-on-amazon.1358233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wireless headphones solve the tangled cable problem and keep your music private in shared spaces, but dropping $500 on AirPods Max makes zero sense when budget options deliver good daily performance. Most people need reliable Bluetooth audio for commutes and Zoom calls without the premium features that justify four-figure price tags.</p>
<p>Sony’s <strong>WH-CH520 headphones</strong> target practical users who want solid sound quality and marathon battery life without paying for luxury branding. Amazon has dropped<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/"> these already-affordable headphones to $38 for Black Friday, down from their regular $69 price</a>, and creates an all-time low that makes impulse buying almost mandatory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>50-Hour Battery Life</h2>
<p>The<strong> battery life of 50 hours</strong> means you do not face the constant anxiety associated with premium headphones which boast a capacity of between 20 to 30 hours. You can wear these every day on your commute through an entire workweek without thinking about finding power, then charge over the weekend for another five days of use. Road trips and festival weekends can happen sans charging cables or hunting for outlets between sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>lightweight construction keeps pressure off your head</strong> during those extended wearing sessions that heavier headphones turn into endurance tests. Swivel ear cups rotate to lay flat in bags without taking up excessive space and the the folding design collapses the headphones into a compact form for travel. The adjustable headband accommodates various head sizes without the tight clamping force that causes headaches after an hour of wear.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is above expectation for budget-tier headphones</strong> with well-balanced audio that doesn’t artificially pump up the bass at the expense of mids and highs. The Sony app <strong>includes EQ customization to let you tailor frequency</strong> <strong>response</strong> to your taste or simply make up for any differences in your hearing. You can punch up the bass for hip-hop, emphasize vocals for podcasts, or flatten the curve for classical that sounds better reproduced neutrally. DSEE technology upscales compressed streaming audio, restoring detail that lossy formats discard during encoding.</p>



<p>The built-in microphone does its fair share for phone calls and voice commands, though it is not up to the audio quality of dedicated headsets designed primarily for communication. You can answer calls without pulling your phone from your pocket and keep conversations hands-free while walking or working. The microphone picks up your voice clearly in quiet environments, though noisy settings with traffic or crowds overwhelm the basic noise reduction and require you to speak louder.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity maintains solid connections out to 30 feet</strong> in open spaces, serving typical home and office distances without dropouts. Walls and obstacles reduce effective range, but the headphones remain connected through normal room-to-room movement. Pairing is quick and easy through standard Bluetooth menus without any requirement for apps or complicated procedures; these headphones will work with <strong>Android, iOS, Windows, and any other device that supports Bluetooth</strong>.</p>
<p>At $38 for Sony wireless headphones with 50-hour battery life, you’re paying what knockoff brands charge for products that break within months. This 46% discount turns already reasonable headphones into the most cost-effective audio upgrade available this Black Friday.</p>

              <p>If you’ve already finished <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei</em></a>, then crikey, please can I borrow some of your spare time? I’ve yet to finish&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, let alone even start <em>Yōtei</em>, despite a strong urge to slaughter my way through all that cherry blossom. But for those so far ahead, good news arrives November 24! The game is receiving a free update that’s adding a pretty detailed New Game+ option.</p> <p>At first glance, it appears to be a fairly traditional NG+, allowing you to start the game over once you’ve completed it, but this time with all the equipment and skills you picked up on the way. That comes with new difficulty levels that’ll let you boost the challenge to accompany your greater abilities (although c’mon, you know it’s fun to wait a bit before turning those on and just enjoy being ludicrously over-powered for a little while first), and a couple of new Trophies to earn.</p>

 <p>But it’s adding a whole bunch more than that. Weapons and armor sets are being given a new suite of upgrades to unlock, adding a bunch more motivation to play through again, alongside 30 new cosmetics and 10 new charms. It’s also adding a whole new in-world currency called Ghost Flowers, which are used to buy these new bits and bobs from a brand new merchant. There’s also a new feature added for the NG+ that’ll offer “stat tracking” as you replay the challenges. You can see a lot of this new stuff in brief glimpses in the trailer:</p>

  <p>Patch 1.100.000 will also come with a few new features for the main game, with a bunch of new doodads for the photo mode, including shutter speed and a composition grid, as well as more silly filters for…for…what <em>does</em> anyone do with these? There are also to be improvements to accessibility, with directional button remapping and other as-yet unrevealed changes. Plus, we assume, a bunch of bug fixes and the like.</p> <p>The co-op multiplayer mode <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-legends-multiplayer-trailer-release-date-2000618559"><em>Ghost Of Yōtei Legends</em></a> and its supernatural take on the events is still a fair ways off, with the ambiguous release date of “2026,” but when it arrives, it too will be free.</p>

<h2>From champion to advocate</h2>
<p>During her later career, Heineman served as a mentor and advisor to many, never shy about celebrating her past as a game developer during the golden age of the home computer.</p>
<p>Her mentoring skills became doubly important when she publicly came out as transgender in 2003. She became a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in gaming and <a href="https://glaad.org/releases/glaad-national-board-directors-announces-new-members-hannah-hart-rebecca-heineman-and/">served</a> on the board of directors for GLAAD. Earlier this year, she <a href="https://gaymingmag.com/2025/11/gayming-icon-and-lgbtq-games-pioneer-rebecca-heineman-has-died/">received</a> the Gayming Icon Award from Gayming Magazine.</p>
<p>Andrew Borman, who serves as director of digital preservation at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, told Ars Technica that her influence made a personal impact wider than electronic entertainment. “Her legacy goes beyond her groundbreaking work in video games,” he told Ars. “She was a fierce advocate for LGBTQ rights and an inspiration to people around the world, including myself.”</p>

<p>In the Netflix documentary series <em>High Score</em>, Heineman <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81019087">explained</a> her early connection to video games. “It allowed me to be myself,” she said. “It allowed me to play as female.”</p>
<p>“I think her legend grew as she got older, in part because of her openness and approachability,” said journalist Ernie Smith in an interview with Ars. “As the culture of gaming grew into an online culture of people ready to dig into the past, she remained a part of it in a big way, where her war stories helped fill in the lore about gaming’s formative eras.”</p>
<h2>Celebrated to the end</h2>
<p>Heineman was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in October 2025 after experiencing shortness of breath at the PAX game convention. After diagnostic testing, doctors found cancer in her lungs and liver. That same month, she <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer">launched</a> a GoFundMe campaign to help with medical costs. The campaign quickly surpassed its $75,000 goal, raising more than $157,000 from fans, friends, and industry colleagues.</p>

Now, EA's military shooter will seemingly no longer count the bots you kill in a match, but if you get blasted by a bot, that death will still show up in your stats sheet for now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1990889499979632848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 18 X post</a> by the community news source Battlefield Bulletin, the update was deployed to make the game's stats accurate and fair. If you visit your profile page now, you may see a significant drop in your kill-death ratio, possibly suggesting that many of the kills in that stat were merely on bots.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Retired competitive pro player Otto "ottr" Boström <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1990809560110584184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlighted this change on his X account</a>, posting a side-by-side comparison of what appears to be his Battlefield 6 profile page on November 18. In one image, he had 88,838 kills, with a 92.950 average K/D. In the subsequent image, his kills dropped to 24,227, with his K/D falling to 3.814. Boström believes this will "expose a lot of players out there."</p><p>While bot kills seem to mean nothing to your overall kills now, Battlefield YouTuber DannyonPC <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1990891124697727425" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned in Battlefield Bulletin's replies</a> that bot deaths--that is, you getting murked by a bot--still count toward your overall deaths. Battlefield Bulletin noted this, saying that it should be addressed "eventually" as well.</p><p>Battlefield Studios hasn't commented on the change yet, but its communications department did <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take to X on November 19 to post about other adjustments</a> it recently made to the game. This includes increasing the effective hitboxes of defibrillators, bumping the AFK kick timer in Sabotage from 60 seconds to 180 seconds, temporarily disabling bot backfilling in Sabotage, and clarifying Assignment and Challenge descriptions and criteria to make them easier to achieve and obtain.</p><p>All of these fixes appear to be Battlefield Studios' attempts at curbing bot farming. Since its October 10 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the game has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">rampant use of bots as XP cattle</a>. An October 21 update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-bot-xp-farms-are-no-more/1100-6535606/" data-ref-id="1100-6535606">dropped a grenade on these farms</a>, with a hotfix the following day <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-battlefield-6-update-aims-to-shoot-down-bot-filled-matches/1100-6535629/" data-ref-id="1100-6535629">reducing bots from filling matches</a>. Despite the gates limiting them, lead producer David Sirland explained on November 5 that bots play a crucial role: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/without-battlefield-6-bots-youd-be-waiting-a-lot-longer-producer-says/1100-6535956/" data-ref-id="1100-6535956">They help get games going</a>. And with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-new-casual-mode-where-bots-outnumber-players/1100-6535868/" data-ref-id="1100-6535868">a new Casual Breakthrough mode</a> that introduces a more relaxed way to play Battlefield 6, it's safe to assume they aren't going anywhere. They're just becoming a bit redundant.</p><p>Outside of this hush-hush change, Battlefield Studios did release a new patch for the game across consoles and PC on November 18. Dubbed Update 1.1.2.0, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">the patch substantially alters aim-assist</a>, making it "feel smoother and more predictable."</p>

			<p>Hades II presents a tougher challenge than its predecessor. With an increased focus on ranged combat and high enemy density, surviving the trek to Tartarus and the summit requires more than just high damage; it demands superior survivability.</p>



<p>While many players focus on maximizing DPS, one specific Boon is often overlooked, yet provides immense utility for nearly every single build: <strong>Aphrodite's Glamour Gain.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-glamour-gain-is-the-best-defensive-boon-in-hades-ii">Glamour Gain is the Best Defensive Boon in Hades II</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251109193532_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Don't sleep on Aphrodite's Glamour Gain Boon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Aphrodite's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Glamour Gain</strong> is arguably the most valuable defensive tool in Melinoë's arsenal, hands-down. It's often overlooked by players obsessed with big numbers, but its core utility - superior, passive survivability - is critical for clearing the more challenging later regions.</p>



<p>The reasons for its power are simple:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Passive Weak Curse Inflictio</strong><strong>n</strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">:</strong> Glamour Gain automatically inflicts the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Weak</strong> curse on nearby enemies. You don't need to attack, Dash, or Cast; merely being near a foe triggers the effect.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Damage Reduction:</strong> The Weak curse causes afflicted enemies to deal <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">at least 30% less damage</strong>, and this stacks with other damage-reducing effects (like the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Strength Arcana, which also increases your attack power at the cost of Death Defianc</strong><strong>e</strong>).</li>



<li><strong>Magic Restoration:</strong> It gradually restores your <strong>Magic</strong> (starting at 6 points per second) while near enemies, giving you passive regeneration to fuel your Casts and Omega attacks.</li>
</ol>



<p>In Hades II, Melinoë is frequently swarmed by multiple enemies from all sides, especially in difficult areas like Tartarus and Mount Olympus. Since more than one enemy will be near you almost constantly, the effects of Glamour Gain ensure that nearly every hit you take is <strong>reduced considerably.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-comparison-with-other-weak-inducing-boons">Comparison With Other Weak-inducing Boons</h3>



<p>Other Aphrodite Boons can inflict Weak (<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Rapture Ring</strong> with Casts or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Passion Rush</strong> with Rushing), but they require active input. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Glamour Gain</strong> provides its life-saving utility automatically and consistently within Melinoë's effective fighting range, making it far more reliable and ultimately more useful.</p>



<h2 id="h-maxing-out-glamour-gain-s-potential">Maxing Out Glamour Gain’s Potential</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251110005409_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Broken Resolve Boon makes Glamour Gain even more useful</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you secure Glamour Gain, try to get these two essential Aphrodite Boons to maximize its effectiveness. With these additions, you not only reduce incoming damage but also significantly boost your damage against Weak-inflicted foes:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Sweet Surrender:</strong> Weak-afflicted enemies take <strong>+10% more damage</strong> (minimum, scales with rarity). This turns your defensive boon into a potent offensive multiplier.</li>



<li><strong>Broken Resolve:</strong> Weak effects are <strong>more potent</strong>, increasing the base damage reduction beyond 30%. This is pure survivability insurance.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-glamour-gain-as-often-as-possible">How to Get Glamour Gain As Often As Possible</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Equipping the Beautiful Mirror Keepsake increases your chances of obtaining the Glamour Gain Boon during Nights</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Due to roguelike mechanics of Hades II, there is no guaranteed way to be offered Glamour Gain on every run, but you can use the Keepsake system to dramatically increase your chances:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Unlock the Keepsake:</strong> Obtain the <strong>Beautiful Mirror</strong> Keepsake from Aphrodite by giving her Ambrosia to increase Melinoë's affinity with the Goddess.</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Equip Strategically:</strong> While equipping the keepsake at the start of a run guarantees an Aphrodite Boon, I found in my own 67 runs that equipping the Beautiful Mirror for the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">second region</strong> in both the Underworld and Surface paths yields the best chance of Glamour Gain being offered.</li>
</ol>



<blockquote>
<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">If Glamour Gain is not among the choices offered, make sure to save the Boon Rarification chance granted by the Beautiful Mirror </em></strong><strong><em>K</em></strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">eepsake until it does show up. Maximizing this Boon's rarity early is highly valuable.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-glamour-gain-best-weapon-synergies">Glamour Gain Best Weapon Synergies</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Every weapon in Hades II benefits in some capacity from the effects of Glamour Gain</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Glamour Gain synergizes really well with every weapon in Hades II, as the passive <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Weak</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Curse application</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Magic regeneration</strong> are great to have regardless of the weapon's capabilities.</p>



<ul>
<li>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sister Blades,</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Moonstone Axe, </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Black Coat</strong> benefit the most due to he short range of their Attacks. Glamour Gain massively offsets this shortcoming, turning both weapons into really solid choices, especially if you have means to restore HP consistently</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witch's Staff</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Umbral Flames</strong> have slightly better Attack range than the tree weapons above, but they still benefit from Glamour Gain a lot thanks to the constant Magic regeneration, which helps both weapons dish out the best damage they can.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Argent Skull</strong> also benefits a lot from Glamour Gain, no matter the playstyle. Whether you launch your skulls into the enemy or charge into them using the Special, the damage reduction of Weak afflicted enemies considerably reduces the risk associated with this weapon.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-effective-glamour-gain-really-is">How Effective Glamour Gain Really Is?</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="283">We’re now right in the thick of the holiday season. The temperatures dropped, lights are going up on every house, and the sun is going down far too quickly for my liking. If you still have a ton of gifts to pick out for all your loved ones, family, and friends, you might be holding out for Black Friday and Cyber Monday so you can save some cash while you shop. Well, I’m hear to tell you that you don’t actually have to wait any longer. Amazon has pushed a handful of deals live ahead of the big savings event that follows Thanksgiving. Save on products across every category. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5691/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker. It normally goes for $149, so the discount ends up saving you $30. That brings the price down to just $119.</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="283">Delivering bold, high-quality stereo sound, the second-generation Bose SoundLink Flex Bluetooth speaker is the perfect companion for your summer adventures. Whether you’re lounging on the porch soaking up the sun or hosting your next big party, its rich audio will elevate the moment.</p>

<p data-start="325" data-end="614">Compact enough to fit in your hand or slip into a backpack, this speaker also features a rugged nylon utility loop for easy attachment to your gear—making it ideal for hands-free listening during on the go. Maybe even take it on your next hike. Just remember to turn down the volume as you pass by fellow hikers to keep the peace.</p>
<p data-start="616" data-end="750">With a battery life that lasts up to 12 hours, you can enjoy music, podcasts, or audiobooks all day without worrying about recharging.</p>
<p data-start="752" data-end="1146">If you’ve got a second Bose SoundLink Flex or another compatible Bose Bluetooth speaker, you can pair them together. Set them to stereo mode for left and right channels, or switch to party mode for even bigger sound. The latter is perfect for spreading music across multiple rooms or both indoors and outdoors at a party, ensuring the same great soundtrack follows your guests as they move throughout the venue.</p>


<p data-start="1148" data-end="1383" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">PositionIQ technology allows the speaker to adjust sound based on its orientation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Monday, Hypixel announced that it was back from the dead and had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248"><span>acquired the rights to its canceled </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-like game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i></a><span> from Riot. The </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>company canceled the game and shut down the developer back in June, and now the band is getting back together, and fans who had been eagerly anticipating the game can look forward to an Early Access launch in the near future. Hypixel has released a lengthy gameplay trailer showing </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>in motion, and if you were looking for a more fast-paced, action-packed version of </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hytale </span></i><span>looks like it might be just that.</span></p> <p><span>The game has a similar blocky art style that will look familiar to anyone who’s ever taken a trip to the Overworld, but the 16-minute gameplay trailer also features a lot of smooth, stylish combat. </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>lets you whack enemies around, too, but it can feel a bit stiff. Which is fine. The best parts of Mojang’s game are its crafting and building mechanics, which more than make up for its simplistic combat. </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, however, looks like it focuses on the inverse. A lot of what Hypixel shows off here is the player using a whole arsenal of weapons. At first, it’s giving </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls </span></i><span>melee combat, but then the game switches to third person, and you see that you have some additional mobility options that make it look a bit more free-flowing.</span></p>  <p><span>Hypixel says it wanted to release footage of the game in motion as quickly as possible to “break the curse” after disappearing for several months, so this is essentially a proof-of-life reveal while the team prepares for Early Access. There’s no set date yet, but the </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved"><span>blog post announcement</span></a><span> says that it will be revealed “in the coming days.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Yeet A Friend monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Stars, Boosts, Spins, Gems and Pets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yeet A Friend is a popular physics-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-anime-infinity-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience where players are given the rather exciting task of throwing (or rather yeeting) a friend as far away as possible. The main objective of the game is simply to launch your friend the maximum possible distance, with all the upgrades and abilities in the game centred around the same.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Players have to gain strength and energy by clicking and performing other activities, as the strength meter resets with each throw. This means players have to regain strength after every throw, adding further replayability to this already enjoyable game. With multiple worlds to play in and a worldwide leaderboard for the best throws, Yeet A Friend is a game that players can spend hours on without getting bored. Although gaining strength and energy isn’t overly challenging, using some redeem codes can make it even more fun, because who doesn’t like a few free rewards?&nbsp;</p>

Throughout Baki’s pursuit of greatness and his stepping out of his father’s looming shadow, his hero's journey takes him through a gauntlet of increasingly deranged opponents including roided-out brawlers and prehistoric cavemen. All of this is vividly brought to life by Itagaki, who emphasizes and exaggerates human anatomy and the many ways muscles can bend and break. <em>Baki </em>is one of my unapologetic favorites for its ridiculously over-the-top, hype-filled fights, which have been trucking for 35 years now and show no signs of slowing down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xniBk7zAKMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Baki Hanma | Official Trailer | Netflix Anime"></iframe></figure><p>But with every creative comes an editor whose job is to harness, rein in, and cheer on the creator's vivid imagination and keep them from getting lost in the hot pursuit of their ambitions.

</figure><p>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> First off, congratulations on celebrating <em>Baki’s </em>35th anniversary. Looking back, did you or Keisuke Itagaki envision <em>Baki </em>would become a global phenomenon, especially with its recent resurgence thanks to its Netflix anime adaptation?</p><p><strong>Yuki Yokoi:</strong> Because this work features such unique and compelling characters, I always felt it deserved much more attention both in Japan and around the world. Back around 2010, as the editor in charge, I was driven by a sense of frustration that the series hadn’t yet been discovered internationally. So seeing it finally receive the recognition it truly deserves now feels deeply gratifying.</p><p>As for its adaptation into anime, I believe the theme of “strength”— a concept that transcends language and culture—has been successfully conveyed to audiences worldwide through Netflix’s global platform and its simultaneous release in multiple languages.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTMMdMVFRWE?start=16&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Insanity of Grappler Baki and Why You Should Care"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Baki</em> is often described as a celebration of human anatomy—sometimes to absolute surreal, obsessive extremes with relation to musculature. How does <em>Baki </em>balance that anatomical intensity with the emotional and philosophical depth of martial arts?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> When it comes to Itagaki-sensei’s detailed depictions of the human body, he does refer to anatomical and medical texts as well as human body atlases. However, his main reference materials are original scrapbooks he’s created himself, filled with cutouts from bodybuilding magazines that show individual muscle groups of various athletes. He keeps these clippings organized by body part, often focusing on the strengths of Mr. Olympia champions and other top competitors.</p><p>Of course, he also watches a wide range of combat sports footage, including UFC and boxing. It’s true that bodybuilding champions dehydrate themselves and push their bodies to the extreme before stepping on stage, which isn’t necessarily healthy. But Itagaki-sensei’s creative drive comes from his own fascination—a desire to depict scenes where those bodybuilder physiques actually fight and prove their strength in battle.</p><figure><blockquote>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1702630665722953830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 15, 2023</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>The series continues to evolve with new arcs and characters that somehow trump the last arc’s grand spectacle. What’s the secret that keeps <em>Baki </em>going strong after all these years?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I believe the secret behind the series’ constant evolution lies entirely in the appeal of the characters that Itagaki-sensei creates. When he studied under manga master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Koike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kazuo Koike</u></a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Koike?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Gekiga Sonjuku</u></a>, a school that taught the art and methodology of storytelling, he learned the principle “If the character stands out—if it’s truly compelling—the work will sell.” Because of this, Itagaki-sensei often refers to himself as a “character craftsman.”</p><p>The worlds he builds are filled with these kinds of unforgettable characters — people who, the moment they appear, inevitably bring drama with them. As new and equally powerful personalities continue to emerge, the story’s momentum and vitality are constantly renewed.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were there any narrative paths that were considered early in the series that were ultimately avoided to instead be the series fans know today?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I once heard from the very first editor in charge that the initial draft of <em>Grappler Baki </em>actually began with a scene of Baki spending an ordinary day at school. If the series had started that way, perhaps the <em>Baki </em>saga might have taken a very different path.</p><figure><blockquote>— 刃牙35周年プロジェクト【公式】 (@teambaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/teambaki/status/1967845913529102693?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> How did you and Itagaki feel seeing <em>Baki </em>gain traction in the West? Were there any unexpected reactions or cultural interpretations of its characters and tales that stood out to you?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>This may be similar to my earlier answer, but since this series is filled with such distinctive and fascinating characters and revolves around the universal theme of “strength,” which resonates across the world, I strongly believed it would find success once it could finally be delivered to North American audiences in an accessible way. I had confidence that it would become popular once people had the chance to see it.</p><p>That said, since the anime adaptation available on Netflix begins with the second part of <em>Baki The Grappler</em>, I expected that some viewers might feel a bit lost without knowing the first part of the story. However, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that many fans had already found ways to experience the first part through other means.</p><figure><blockquote>— Netflix Japan | ネットフリックス (@NetflixJP) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixJP/status/1963939407855046922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Now that the first part has officially begun publication as an English-language comic, I sincerely hope that North American readers will pick it up as well—not only to fill in the missing parts of the story, but to experience the full scope of the <em>Baki </em>universe from its very beginning.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>With new manga adaptations and special editions of <em>Baki </em>rolling out, what’s the guiding principle behind these expansions? Are they meant to recontextualize the story or simply offer fresh entry points for longtime and newcomer fans alike? Aside from new translations and lettering, will there be any textual changes or addenda to the original manga in these editions, or is the goal more about preservation and presentation?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> It’s the latter meaning. <em>The Grappler Baki</em> published this time by <a href="https://x.com/KodamaTales?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kodama </u></a>represents the beginning of the <em>Baki </em>series, a story arc that has not yet been streamed on Netflix as part of the anime adaptation.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today is the official release day of Keisuke Itagaki's Baki the Grappler by <a href="https://twitter.com/KodamaTales?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">@KodamaTales</a>!!

</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Baki</em>’s Muhammad Ali tribute from Yujiro Hanma was a powerful moment, framing him not just as a fighter but as a symbol of resistance against racial injustice. What inspired that reflection, and how do you and Itagaki see Baki’s role in engaging with political themes?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>Itagaki-sensei himself once competed as a boxing athlete, even being selected to participate in a national sports event for Japan, and his deep passion for the sport heavily influenced his creative vision. The character Yujiro Hanma, born from that admiration for boxing’s greatest stars and Itagaki-sensei’s own ideal of strength, was developed with the intention of showing mutual respect and recognition between Yujiro and real-world fighters — a way to bring the character vividly to life.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CcYYVplX2o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yujiro Hanma Respected Muhammad Ali"></iframe></figure><p>In Japan, manga historically began as something like a casual pastime—something you could finish reading during a single train ride, much like a piece of cheap candy you enjoy in passing. Because of that, Itagaki-sensei often says that manga must remain accessible and easy for anyone to understand.</p><p>Rather than delving into political or social themes, his work has always focused on the universal and timeless theme of “strength”—a quality that everyone, regardless of background or culture, can aspire to and be moved by.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> As a series, <em>Baki </em>has featured <a href="https://x.com/minedo_r/status/1892493589613051990?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>several presidential cameos</u></a> over the years. Is there a decisive favorite for Itagaki? What went into the decision to craft those moments as mainstays chronicling its sprawling stories alongside American presidential administrations?</p><p>The current president of the U.S., Donald Trump, is<a href="https://x.com/DaFeenom/status/1224426904079470593?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> no stranger to manga cameos</u></a> with the likes of the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/donald-trump-death-note-manga-election-2024-2000520605?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Death Note</em> one-shot</u></a>. However, his recent cameo in <em>Baki</em> stirred quite a bit of buzz in the West. Can you share what inspired that inclusion and how it was approached tonally and artistically? Was there fear of blowback from how extreme it might’ve been taken in comparison to other presidential cameos in the series?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> I haven’t really heard Itagaki-sensei mention having a particular “favorite” president character. The depiction of Yujiro Hanma having a personal treaty with the United States was created as a way to express the overwhelming power and larger-than-life presence of his character. As a result, that idea has been carried forward and reinterpreted with each new U.S. president portrayed in the story.</p><p>Each depiction reflects Itagaki-sensei’s imaginative interpretation of how a real-world leader might react if they were to actually encounter someone like Yujiro Hanma. While, of course, it is entirely fictional, Itagaki-sensei is always careful not to portray the real individuals in a disrespectful manner, instead crafting these moments as character-driven episodes meant to entertain and enrich the world of the story.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsK2IhO-gXc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Baki Hanma VS Kengan Ashura OP | Fly High by ATARASHII GAKKO! | Netflix Anime"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>With <em>Kengan Ashura</em> often mentioned in the same breath as <em>Baki</em>,<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baki-hanma-vs-kengan-ashura-review?ref=aftermath.site"><u> culminating in a crossover exhibition for both fandoms in the books</u></a>, what kind of clashes would you love to see between <em>Baki </em>and other popular fighting manga universes?</p><p><strong>YY:</strong> <em>Baki </em>and <em>Kengan Ashura </em>are both Netflix Original anime series, and since <em>Kengan Ashura</em>’s creator, <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=165156&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Yabako Sandrovich</u></a>, is a longtime fan of the <em>Baki </em>series, the collaboration came about quite naturally. The project was also made possible thanks to the close working relationship between editor <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=232520&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Sho Kobayashi</u></a> and myself, which allowed the idea to take shape smoothly.</p><p>If future opportunities arise with works that share a similar tone and creative connection, I would definitely like to pursue more collaborations like that.</p><p>On a personal note, since Itagaki-sensei once worked on the manga adaptation of <em>Garouden</em>—which also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/garouden-the-way-of-the-wolf-review-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"><u>has a Netflix Original adaptation</u></a>—I would love to see a crossover story between those worlds someday. Of course, that’s purely my own wish as a fan.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know?

</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Fans have been clamoring to see <em>Baki </em>in a fighting game—be it <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Tekken</em>, or even <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. If you could choose one fighting game to feature a <em>Baki </em>guest appearance, which would it be and why?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>If I had to choose just one, I would say <em>Tekken</em>, in terms of narrative compatibility. The series shares a core storyline centered around a father–son conflict, which makes it feel thematically aligned with <em>Baki</em>.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> If you had to sum up the spirit of <em>Baki</em>’s future in one word or phrase, what would it be?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>Perhaps the right word would be “expansion.” Itagaki-sensei continues to extend the story vertically by drawing new chapters, while at the same time, we are developing numerous spinoffs that broaden the world horizontally. Various forms of media adaptations are also currently in preparation, allowing fans to experience and enjoy the <em>Baki </em>series through multiple touchpoints.</p><p>In addition, we are planning a range of merchandising initiatives that will let fans engage with the series on a deeper level. Through these efforts, we aim to expand the universe of <em>Baki </em>and create many different ways for audiences to immerse themselves in its world.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>As <em>Baki </em>enters a new era in 2026, what can fans expect in terms of tone, themes, character evolutions, or showcasing of martial arts yet to be featured in the series?</p><p><strong>YY: </strong>&nbsp;The latest series in the original manga saga, Part 6: <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Baki_Rahen?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Baki Rahen</u></em></a>, is currently being serialized. In this installment, the story focuses on new battles and developments among the characters surrounding Baki. Within it, <a href="https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Jack_Hanma?ref=aftermath.site#:~:text=He%20received%20from%20him%20a,him%20even%20more%20mentally%20unstable."><u>Jack Hammer</u></a> has established a new fighting style known as “Goudou” (the Way of Biting). In this way, there is a strong possibility that previously-introduced characters will continue to evolve, developing new techniques and fighting methods in their ongoing pursuit of strength.</p>
