            <p>A new trailer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, showing off its version of the Chao Garden.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not exactly as you remember from the games: it's some sort of mascot café featuring dancing Chao characters and a group of children who ask Tails if he's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a>.</p>
<p>Then things turn bad and soon we see Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog in the middle of Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The trailer offers the best look yet at Shadow (with a gun!), as well as Jim Carrey's two Eggman villains, and Maria Robotnik from Shadow's past.</p>
<p>Despite its real world setting, then, it seems the film will include plenty of elements familiar to fans of the games.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is due out in cinemas on 20th December, just before Christmas. It's fitting the trailer ends with a Christmas scene, in something of a callback to Carrey's performance as The Grinch.</p>

<p>The film will conclude Sega's Year of Shadow, which also included the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p>
<p>Sega also shared with Eurogamer some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-showcases-shadow-the-hedgehog-design-in-never-before-seen-sketches">exclusive design sketches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a> from Sonic Team's Kazuyuki Hoshino.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Chao Garden allowed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2 players to level up cute Chao critters and then race and battle them against one another. It's a much-requested feature in a potential Sonic Adventure 3 game, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka has "no plans" for such a project</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/25/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-spending-the-night-in-lyon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’ve played the last couple of Sniper Elite games, you know pretty much exactly what to expect from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>. In fact, but for featuring Harry Hawker as its protagonist instead of series mainstay Karl Fairburne, this could easily have been branded as Sniper Elite 6. But then that might have put the pressure on to try and seriously advance the series, where Resistance feels like more of a classic standalone expansion pack –&nbsp;not that this is necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance Spotlight -  Out of the Shadows" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ai9hsXpo2ww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We’ve gone hands-on with a second mission from Sniper Elite: Resistance, following up from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">our first go back at Gamescom 2024</a>, and what I said then holds true now. This is sniper stealth-action comfort food, not to mention the WW2 setting and almost pantomime villainy of the Nazis, who just so happen to have another wunderwaffe in development.</p>


<p>Deep in occupied France with Harry linking up with the local French Resistance, this mission dropped us into a heavily guarded city of Lyon at night, looking to follow up on Resistance intel about mysterious cargo passing through the city’s train station. Along the way, you’ll also have to break into the Gestapo HQ at the Hotel Terminus, and try to inspect a cargo haul within its basement. After the castle town infiltration of my first hands-on, this is another urban setting that will equally provide you with a ton of hiding places and an awful lot of potential dangers from guards in high places.</p>
<p>Starting off on a hill overlooking the city, your eye is immediately drawn to the many spotlights and sniper spots –&nbsp;there’s a wild and excessive amount of sniper scope glare that will help you find snipers in the dark. Pulling out a handy set of binoculars, you can spot and mark enemies from all the way across the map, highlighting their positions for whenever you’re able to pull out the sniper rifle and make your tentative progress safer. Those binoculars also have a very capable parabolic microphone built-in, letting you listen in on conversations from a good long distance, potentially revealing clues from the loose lips of patrolling guards, soldiers and Gestapo.</p>


<p>Check the mission map, and there’s a bunch of main and side objectives to take on across the sandbox level. Each level has a high-ranking officer to take out from the Kill List, there’s a side mission to try and check in on a Resistance safe house (which has been found by the Gestapo, the surviving members fleeing to a backup hidey hole elsewhere in the city), and then the main mission objectives. There’s also new propaganda posters that will drop you into a quick side mission, though we didn’t find this, and the returning Axis Invasion mode that you can engage with or completely ignore.</p>
<p>Harry comes with a familiar set of tools –&nbsp;a trusty Welrod, an SMG for moments where you just need to spray and run away, and of course one of the game’s many sniper rifles. Alongside that, there’s a variety of explosives, traps and grenades that you can use in certain situations, such as booby trapping a noise maker or (in what was at least incredibly immoral at the time, and now illegal) a dead body that might draw an enemy near.</p>
<p>You’ll want to scrounge from the map to broaden your selection of gear, and that Resistance safehouse was an absolute treasure trove of different mines, ammunition types (subsonic bullets won’t be as noticeable to enemies), and limited use special weapon like a silenced sniper, though these do still emit enough sound that you need to be aware of nearby enemies being alerted. Then again, it’s not too difficult to get some noise cover for your sniping by sabotaging a diesel generator and timing when you start blasting.</p>

<p>It did take me a few goes to really get into the swing of things with this level, thanks in part to some wayward Welrod shots getting me discovered. It’s easy to get spotted more generally, thanks to plenty of overlooking spots from snipers, including two bridges across the city’s river, and once the alert has been raised, soldiers come rushing to your last known location –&nbsp;thankfully a zipline makes for a very handy escape route. I also noticed some guards walking around with flashlights in addition to the sweeps of searchlights from guard towers.</p>
<p>It all kicked off when getting to the opulent Hotel Terminus, the number of enemies in this area meaning I was spotted almost immediately and the time pressure of our hands-on time coming to a close forcing me to sprint through the building, up the stairs, set a satchel charge on the Gestapo office and then quickly grabbing what I could find in there before figuring out how to get the Hell out of there. Luckily a zipwire got me out into the gardens… but with the area on high alert, I was quickly spotted again and gunned down just as our session came to a close.</p>

<p>I do wonder what the future holds for Sniper Elite after the release of Resistance. We’re at a point where Rebellion’s take on stealth action and sandbox levels has maybe come to its evolutionary conclusion, so that Sniper Elite 6 might have to be a more fundamental reworking of the underlying game engine and gameplay core, pushing the production values higher. Resistance has some dated quirks, like certain waist-height scenery being oddly impossible to vault over, or the way characters slide into position for a melee takedown.</p>
<p>For now, though, Sniper Elite: Resistance will give another batch of good ol’ Sniper Elite action. It’s solid and dependable, and it’s always gruesomely amusing to see the series’ staple X-ray kill cam trigger as you explode someone’s testicles from the other side of the map.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.studiowildrose.jp/post/%E8%A8%B4%E8%A8%9F%E6%8F%90%E8%B5%B7%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%9B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement</a> spotted by news platform <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/director-of-penny-blood-shadow-heartss-spiritual-successor-files-lawsuit-over-unpaid-funding-from-kickstarter-campaign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, Machida simply says that he's suing Judd and Dangen, naming Judd as a "producer" on&nbsp;<em>Penny Blood</em>'s Kickstarter and Dangen as part of the "campaign team".</p>

<p>Presumably, Dangen and Judd were supposed to help Studio Wildrose and Machida out with production costs on&nbsp;<em>Penny Blood</em>, but Machida seems to be alleging that this didn't happen. No further details about the lawsuit are provided in the announcement.</p>

<p>The campaign, which was launched by&nbsp;<em>Wild Arms&nbsp;</em>creator Akifumi Kaneko and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Hearts&nbsp;</em>lead Matsuzo Machida, aimed to get both games funded simultaneously, since the developers believed that it would be more difficult to fund them separately.</p>

<p><em>Penny Blood&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Armed Fantasia</em>'s dual Kickstarter asked for around $700,000 to bring both games to PC, and that goal was met within hours, with the campaign going on to <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/armed-fantasia-penny-blood-campaigns-close-successfully/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make over $2.6 million</a> in total.</p>

<p>Despite this success, we still don't have release dates or specific release windows for either project. Notably, Kaneko and&nbsp;<em>Armed Fantasia&nbsp;</em>don't seem to have anything to do with the lawsuit brought against Dangen and Judd by Machida.</p>

<p>Those allegations led to Judd being dismissed from his position with publishing firm Digital Development Management, as well as leading to his resignation from Japanese gaming festival BitSummit's board of directors.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that Machida's lawsuit isn't the first time Judd and Dangen have been accused of foul play when it comes to indie developers. We'll have to wait and see what, if anything, the lawsuit yields.</p>

Game tracking website <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2127" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long to Beat</a> pegs Cyberpunk 2077's entire main story at around 25 hours and 30 minutes in total, meaning the player spent more time in the opening area than it would take to actually complete the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 opens with a handful of smaller missions before the crux of the story kicks off with The Heist. Per open-world game standards, it also limits players to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Watson">the opening area of Watson</a> during this time, meaning just a fraction of the game's total activities (that award experience points) are available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou overcame this somewhat by using an exploit that allowed them to leave Watson. This doesn't activate the dozens of side quests or other open-world activities available in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City, but does offer better grinding locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Go to Pacifica, Batty's Hotel for, in my experience, the best farming spot," uO__Ou said. "Repeat it over and over and over. Took me 40 hrs but, to be honest, if I did this more efficiently, it can take less than 35 hours. Just don't forget to sleep every hour for an experience boost and to use different weapons for your sanity and for skill progression."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk 2077 uses a similar progression system to the likes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</a>, where players can engage in different activities to level up specific skills which contribute to the overall level. Being stealthy and getting headshots, for example, upgrades the Headhunter skill, while crafting items upgrades the Engineer skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou used these different skills to eventually reach the final Level 50, though it could have almost certainly been reached faster by actually progressing the main story. With developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-rules-out-cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch">CD Projekt Red now done with Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its expansion <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty,</a> and focusing on a sequel codenamed Orion (and upcoming The Witcher games codenamed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">Polaris</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">Sirius</a>), however, fans are having to come up with quirky challenges like these to keep themselves entertained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Practically nothing is known about Orion so far, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-hires-veterans-from-mortal-kombat-diablo-control-and-more">CD Projekt Red is still in the process of creating a North American studio in Boston</a> to develop it. It has been called a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077 though, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-may-have-grander-branching-storylines-based-on-players-starting-life-path">may feature more involved life paths</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">In our 9/10 review of Cyberpunk</a>, IGN said: "Cyberpunk 2077 throws you into a beautiful, dense cityscape and offers a staggering amount of flexibility in how you choose to take it from there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The collection includes stories pulled from the first canonical The Witcher book, with this story explaining how protagonist Geralt of Rivia saved Ciri's father from the wrath of her grandmother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Geralt is invited to a banquet at the Kingdom of Cintra," the synopsis reads. "The Princess has come of age and suitors prepare to present themselves for her hand in marriage. Wary of the Queen’s invitation, Geralt attends the dinner with caution.

Image credit: Dark Horse.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This will sound familiar to fans of The Witcher live action adaptation, as A Question of Price was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/23/netflixs-the-witcher-season-1-review-full-spoilers">adapted in Season 1 Episode 4</a> of the Henry Cavill-starring Netflix series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hardcover comic version, arriving in the same style as previous The Last Wish entries A Grain of Truth, The Lesser Evil, and The Edge of the World (which arrives January 16), releases on July 29 priced $17.99. This leaves just three short stories left to adapt from The Last Wish: Sapkowski's debut story The Witcher; the short story on which the collection was based, also called The Last Wish, and The Voice of Reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latter of these was told as an overarching story to introduce each separate short story, however, so it's unclear if Dark Horse will also adapt this one. There are plenty more short stories to adapt beyond The Last Wish though, namely from subsequent collection The Sword of Destiny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Horse has a line of its own The Witcher stories too, which has released roughly once a year since The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released in 2015. These are all set within the canon of CD Projekt Red's The Witcher world, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-corvo-bianco-comic-is-a-direct-sequel-to-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">some have even continued the story of Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, and other beloved characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The company is apparently working on a handheld PS5 system that would seemingly compete with Nintendo's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and Valve's Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the PS5 portable system is years away from hitting the market--if it does at all. There is still a possibility Sony decides to pull the plug on the handheld. The report states that the PlayStation Portal was originally planned as a similar product to Steam Deck before becoming dependent on streaming via a PS5 console.

                <p>2003's The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run is a beloved classic game that never got a sequel, and now another key detail has come to light that probably won't make fans very happy to hear.</p><p>Lead designer Joe McGinn said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po9aCHS2kfc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Summoning Salt</a> that Radical Entertainment wanted to make a sequel. In fact, McGinn said the studio had the rights for <em>three </em>sequels for no additional licensing fee.</p><p>"Gracie Films offered our publisher a deal to make three sequels, with all Simpsons rights and voice actors, for the preferred price of zero dollars (we wouldn't have to pay anything for the Simpsons license in other words)," McGinn said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/the-simpsons-hit-and-run-dev-says-they-couldve-made-3-sequels-without-paying-a-penny-for-the-license-some-crazy-person-at-the-publisher-we-never-found-out-who-said-no/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=gamesradar&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Given that, anyone might have predicted that Radical would move forward with a sequel--but it wasn't meant to be. "Some crazy person at the publisher [Vivendi Games]--we never found out who--said no," McGinn said.</p><p>No further information was divulged in the interview about this, so we may never know who that person was or why they said no to making a sequel (or two). The game is reported to have sold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WyAUWwoB4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as many as 10 million units over its lifetime</a>, which certainly sounds like enough to justify a sequel. However, there could be countless reasons for why a sequel never materialized.</p><p>Hit &amp; Run is fondly remembered and remains popular to this day, in part thanks to the speedrunning community. "We never imagined it would still be bringing some people happiness 20 years later!" McGinn said.</p><p>After Radical released Hit &amp; Run in 2003, the studio launched licensed titles like CSI: Miami for Ubisoft, Scarface: The World is Yours with Vivendi, and later original games Prototype and Prototype 2 with Activision. Its last project was supporting Bungie on the original Destiny.</p><p>Given the rise in remakes and re-releases of video games in recent times, some are wondering if the 2003 game might be next in line. It's too soon to say, but McGinn previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-run-remake-i-would-love-to-see-it-designer-says/1100-6511958/" data-ref-id="1100-6511958">he would "love" to see that.</a></p><p>Radical and Vivendi Games have both closed up shop, so any remake would seemingly have to come from a different developer and publisher. It's not immediately clear who owns the video game rights to The Simpsons franchise.</p><p>Electronic Arts published 2007's The Simpsons Game based on the film, as well as the mobile title The Simpsons: Tapped Out in 2012 (that game was delisted in October and ends service this coming January). The TV series is still on the air, but no announcements have been made about future video games.</p><p>Hit &amp; Run was the second major Simpsons game from Radical, following 2001's Simpsons: Road Rage, which wasn't nearly as beloved as Hit &amp; Run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-owners-to-get-exclusive-content-in-the-coming-seasons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion will continuously deliver exclusive content to owners throughout the coming season. The news was confirmed by Blizzard Diablo Franchise Manager Rod Fergusson in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/480711/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-new-exclusive-season-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p><em>Because we know that the beginning of a season is sort of a fresh starting point, we wanted to launch the expansion at the same time as the beginning of a season. That’s why we launched at the beginning of season 6, so you could roll a Spiritborn as your new thing. So it can feel like a little bit like this expansion is just a single moment in time, and I just wanted to highlight that that’s not the case. We’re going to continue to develop features that will be, essentially, exclusive to Vessel of Hatred owners. As we continue chapter two, as a Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred owner, you’ll get access to other stuff in chapter two as part of your ownership. So we’re going to continue to have Vessel of Hatred be valuable beyond season 6 as well.</em></p>
<p>This actually began with the launch of Vessel of Hatred. Runewords are, so far, exclusive to owners of the expansion, and more Runewords will be added with Season 7. As we reported last week, Patch 2.1 will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on the Public Test Realm, delivering the long-awaited Armory feature, brand new Witch-like powers, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Diablo IV is currently enjoying a free trial for both the expansion and the main game itself, up to level 25. On this subject, Fergusson explained:</p>
<p><em>We were looking at ways of creating a boost for players to be able to say, Hey, welcome back, Eternal player. Maybe you haven’t played in a while. Let’s get you cleaned up. Let’s give you a shave and haircut here. So you don’t have to do all the 'I got to spend two hours just cleaning up before I can go and play'. In the last 18 months, so much has changed. But if you’re an Eternal player who played the campaign and then stopped, you don’t know. You haven’t felt this 18 months of evolution.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-%E2%80%93-a-familiar-feeling.1044501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Playing Sniper Elite: Resistance brings a familiar feel to long-time players of the franchise. A game that runs parallel to the events of Sniper Elite 5, Resistance once again puts you in France with the goal of disrupting Nazi plans that could change the course of World War II.</p>



<p>I recently spent over an hour playing Sniper Elite: Resistance where I got to go through the game’s third mission, and experience just a taste of what developer Rebellion has in store for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to lie to you. If you’ve played Sniper Elite 4 or 5, you’ve played Sniper Elite: Resistance. The game uses the same engine with gameplay that’s nearly identical to its 2022 predecessor. Rather than play as Karl Fairburne, however, you’re controlling Harry Hawker, who sounds an awful lot like Jason Statham.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-nbsp-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>With it being a connected title, the general environment and feeling is similar to what you get with Sniper Elite 5. And although I only played one region of the game, one thing that’s clear with Resistance is that the designers have done enough to make the environment stand on its own. Finding all of the unique ways to take cover and distract the enemies is what lets the Sniper Elite series pull you in as a player, and the level designers did a good job with what I saw.</p>



<p>You can still play at your own pace, something that goes a long way towards getting more players to enjoy the game. Whether I wanted to go in guns blazing or take it as slow as humanly possible, I’m able to do that. It just all depends on what’s happening around me and what I’m trying to accomplish. There are multiple ways to get to, and complete, an objective that you can replay the mission multiple times and it’ll feel fresh for a few playthroughs.</p>



<p>The kill cam that the Sniper Elite series is known for remains as satisfying as ever. Hitting that perfect shot that has you watch a bullet rip through the face of a Nazi is as gruesome as you’d expect. It’s also enjoyable watching the other soldiers scramble and panic after they see a comrade’s head get blown to pieces right next to them.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the preview build, we couldn’t change the difficulty, meaning we were limited in how we could experience the game from that sense. Luckily, the AI wasn’t too unforgiving, though it did make you work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was nice that when the AI was searching for something (me) after hearing a noise, they wouldn’t play too dumb, so to speak. Plenty of games I’ve played would have the AI stand right on top of you and not notice a thing if you were in cover. In this, there were a couple of times where they would happen to walk right up on me only to spot my cover while I wasn’t moving, leading to me having to fight my way out or die trying.</p>



<p>That said, the AI weren’t savants all of the time. There were times where they would just stand a bit too still or in the same place so long to the point you couldn’t continue without adjusting in a way that didn’t feel natural to what you should or were trying to do.</p>



<p>They can even be too locked in their planned movement. One specific instance involves a Gestapo infantryman always having to sit on a bench, stand up, and then turn and look at the bench before walking around the building to just repeat the sequence. It feels a bit strange in those moments that are more than enough to break immersion.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There was also an instance where it was pretty clear my shot should have hit an enemy in the face only for him to get hit, get up, and just slowly walk away while another bullet just ricochets off his helmet while he <em>continues </em>to walk. Maybe the shot wasn’t as good as I thought it was at the time, but something just felt off with what I believe should’ve happened.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, what I played had me excited about the full story and just how else I’ll be able to take down the Nazi’s in France this time around. However, one thing I kept thinking about after my time with the game was whether there will be enough here with a full game to warrant a purchase by fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a full campaign, the returning invasion mode, and new Propaganda Missions that Rebellion hopes keeps players engaged overall. But as I said at the beginning, if you’ve played either of the last two Sniper Elite titles, this will feel quite familiar, especially when the overall setting remains the same from the last game just with new locations. With Resistance coming less than three full years after Sniper Elite 5 – the gap between 4 and 5 was over five years – Rebellion runs the risk of franchise fatigue if the rest of the game’s story doesn’t hold up.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite: Resistance launches January 30 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>

<p>In the past, we’ve seen CODMAS bring a variety of cosmetics to the game as well as map makeovers, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nuketown-manniquin-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> Holiday will bring. We’ve also seen limited-time modes like Krampus too, so perhaps players can expect something similar for BO6.</p>

However, players soon reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/" data-ref-id="1900-6418060">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, and other games actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-owners-say-some-games-look-worse-after-upgrades/1100-6527847/" data-ref-id="1100-6527847">looked worse on PS5 Pro</a>. Now, Konami and developer Bloober Team have addressed the issues on a new patch for Silent Hill 2.</p><p>Silent Hill 2's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1.06 patch</a> wasn't just created for the PS5 Pro problems. It's also adjusting and fixing a few issues with the PC version on Steam, but the PS5 Pro fixes are the highlight here. Prior to this update, Silent Hill 2 players on PS5 Pro noticed a number of glitches and visual distortions that weren't happening to the game on standard PlayStation 5 consoles.</p><p>Ironically, this is not the first time a Silent Hill 2 update has led to more problems than fixes. Silent Hill 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-patch-improves-steam-deck-performance-fixes-ps5-crashes/1100-6527293/">1.04 patch was intended to improve the game's performance on Steam</a> and cut down on crashes on PS5. Unfortunately, it also introduced a few game-breaking bugs that were meant to be dealt with as of the 1.05 patch. But that's when players noticed the issues with the game's performance on PS5 Pro.</p><p>To the credit of Konami and Bloober Team, the new patches have been released relatively quickly. Hopefully any future issues will also be addressed in a speedy manner. Given the early difficulties that some developers have had with PS5 Pro-enhanced games, it's not shocking that CD Projekt Red decided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-happening-dev-confirms/1100-6527915/" data-ref-id="1100-6527915">not to create a PlayStation 5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077</a> anytime soon.</p><p>The full notes for Silent Hill 2's 1.06 patch are included below.</p><h3>PLAYSTATION 5</h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><ul><li>Fixed a bug regarding trophy counting</li><li>Fixed some graphics glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro</li></ul><h4>GAMEPLAY</h4><ul><li>Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map</li><li>Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck</li><li>Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)</li><li>Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed map marker west of Southvale</li><li>Fixed a bug with Maria’s navigation</li><li>Fixed an issue where some of Maria’s lines would occur multiple times.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug</li><li>Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode</li><li>Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain</li><li>Improved boss animations</li><li>Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay</li><li>Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.</li><li>Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital</li><li>Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the mannequin’s physics</li><li>Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.</li></ul><h3><a title="Platforms > Steam [2,232 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/steam/" rel="nofollow ">STEAM</a></h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused interference between game saves and controller vibration</li><li>Improved mouse sensitivity range and value interval</li><li>Fixed a bug related to mouse input</li><li>Fixed a bug when using a controller</li></ul><h4>GAMEPLAY</h4><ul><li>Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map</li><li>Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck</li><li>Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)</li><li>Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed map marker west of Southvale</li><li>Fixed a bug with Maria’s navigation</li><li>Fixed an issue where some of Maria’s lines would occur multiple times.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug</li><li>Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode</li><li>Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain</li><li>Improved boss animations</li><li>Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay</li><li>Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.</li><li>Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital</li><li>Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the mannequin’s physics</li><li>Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.</li></ul>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a> will receive a major free update in January, alongside its next paid DLC.</p>
<p>Both the new Kingdoms game mode and the Inhuman Bondage DLC will release on PC on 27th January 2025.</p>
<p>Kingdoms is intended to run parallel to the game's main narrative campaign, Confessions. It tasks players with journeying from Inn to Inn across a persistent map to complete quests before time runs out.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, players will need to defend against all-new enemy factions as they complete contracts, upgrade and protect Inns. The first of these three factions will be the "rotting and ravenous beastmen".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-reveals-new-kingdoms-campaign-mode">Kingdoms mode was first revealed back in April</a> this year, but now finally has a release date.</p>
<p>The Inhuman Bondage DLC, meanwhile, will introduce a new mini-region, The Catacombs, along with a new playable hero. In The Catacombs, players will face a "corrosive, oozing threat" beneath the Kingdom. It features new enemies and items, and will be playable in both the Confessions and Kingdoms modes.</p>
<p>The new fan favourite hero, The Abomination, was an original Kickstarter backer-assisted designed character, who comes with a fully-voiced origin story along with unique mechanics and items.</p>
<p>"At Red Hook we love going against the grain," said creative director Chris Bourassa. "When asking ourselves how best to expand Darkest Dungeon 2, we were nonplussed at the conventional wisdom of simply packing in more content. Instead, we pushed ourselves to reimagine the very structure of DDII, and from that thought experiment was born an entirely new game mode: Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Darkest Dungeon 2 is available on PC across Steam and the Epic Games Store, alongside PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X/S. Console versions of the free update and DLC will follow PC.</p>
<p>The game was first released in May 2023, with Red Hook continuing to tweak and update the game since.</p>
<p>"A copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-a-lovecraftian-roadtrip-rpg-of-thrilling-and-suffocating-intricacy">Darkest Dungeon 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-playstation-handheld-reportedly-being-prototyped.1044483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-playstation-handheld-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is reportedly in the early stages of developing a brand new PlayStation handheld intended to challenge Nintendo's current dominance of the market.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a>, which cites the usual "people familiar with its development", Sony is looking to both take on Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">hugely popular Switch</a> and to head off competition from a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">potential Xbox handheld</a> as well.</p>

<p>Much like said Xbox handheld, however, the PlayStation device is likely many years away from release, and Bloomberg's reporters say that Sony "could still decide against bringing it to market", so we're very much still in the early stages of development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=v3T5njU- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=MOWL6QRz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's last true foray into the handheld market was the ill-fated PlayStation Vita.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Bloomberg report, the PlayStation handheld would be designed to play PS5 games on the move, although it's unclear exactly how the device would work in this regard.</p>

<p>It's likely, however, that the handheld - if, indeed, it ever comes to market - won't predominantly use cloud streaming, because that would put it in direct competition with the PlayStation Portal, a handheld device <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">designed to play PS5 games</a> when linked to a console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">or via the cloud</a>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg says that the Portal was originally intended to function as a standalone device, much like Valve's Steam Deck. Presumably, however, that scope got cut down during the device's development.</p>

<p>As it stands, the PlayStation Portal is capable of streaming PS5 games, but it doesn't have any native capability to play them. It's likely the new PlayStation handheld would feature hardware capable of playing PS5 games natively, although it's very unlikely it would support physical media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-portal-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=KNkrAFWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-portal-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=dmyE0aQq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If the new PlayStation handheld ever sees the light of day, it probably won't work similarly to the Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>News that Sony and Microsoft might be considering bringing new handhelds to market comes as anticipation for a new Nintendo Switch console mounts.</p>

<p>Nintendo has promised to share news regarding the Switch's successor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April next year</a>, but the company hasn't specified exactly when we can expect the device to arrive.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview on Twitch</a> with popular&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>streamer and content creator Necrit (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arcane-showrunner-confirms-noxus-ionia-demacia-league-of-legends-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Linke revealed that&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>will be part of a "cinematic universe", so although Jinx and Vi's story may be over, the story of&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s wider world is just beginning.</p>

<p>According to Linke, the next shows to arrive as part of this universe will be based in the nations of Demacia, Noxus, and Ionia, all of which are very important powers in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' world.</p>

Many of the game's most upstanding characters, like Garen, Lux, and Fiora, come from Demacia, but the nation has a dark side as well; it's an isolationist fortress that does not treat its mages well.</p>

<p>Noxus, by contrast, is a brutal nation of military conquest and dog-eat-dog philosophy. Its leader, Jericho Swain, is a sinister general aided in his conquests by a demon, and its ruthless warriors include the likes of Darius, Draven, and the colossal undead Sion.</p>

<p>Finally, Ionia is a magical nation that has tried to maintain its neutrality in the many conflicts between Demacia and Noxus over the years. Its most famous inhabitants include the operatic serial killer Jhin, the martial arts legend Master Yi, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' version of the trickster hero Wukong.</p>

<p>It makes a lot of sense to expand&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s world; the show has proven popular with both&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fans and non-fans alike, and one of its principal characters has even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed" rel="nofollow">found her way into&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>as a new champion</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, all nine episodes of the second season of&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>are currently available to stream on Netflix, which, naturally, is also where you'll find the show's first season if you're yet to catch up on it.</p>

<p>Christopher Judge has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to deny that he was teasing an announcement about God of War.</p>



<p>The God of War actor recently took to TikTok to say that “the next two weeks will be chocked full of announcements and all kinds of good stuff. ” He ended the message by saying “boy,” a phrase that became popular in the recent God of War games. </p>



<p>Whether Judge knew it or not, his tease that there would be announcements “in the next two weeks” coincides perfectly with PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, leading people to believe that an announcement of God of War is on the horizon.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, several rumors circulated that a God of War Trilogy remaster was in the works. Judge’s tease, combined with the rumors, led many fans to conclude that it could be announced during a rumored 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>



<p>However, Judge quickly denied the claims on X. “Absolutely not true! You can’t tease something you know nothing about. I will be making announcements in the near future, I can guarantee none of them will be about OUR beloved God of War. I am awaiting updates just like everyone else,” <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1860887360931569956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Judge got into trouble with PlayStation because of his original statements remains to be seen, with some people suggesting that the tweet was just to keep the impending announcement a surprise.</p>



<p>As for now though, we’ll have to wait and see. Do you think we’ll get a God of War announcement in the coming weeks? Let us know <span>below, and join the official&nbsp;</span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/playstation.4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><span>Insider Gami</span>ng forums</a> discussion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-the-last-of-us-part-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler fares fairly well in The Last of Us Part 1, although it is inferior to both AMD FSR 2 and NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> provided an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro update released for the remake of the first entry in the series, also providing a comparison between the AI-powered upscaler featured in the mid-generation system, AMD FSR 2, and NVIDIA DLSS. For comparison, the PC version was running with similar graphics settings, and sharpening was set at the lowest for both FSR 2 and DLSS, as PSSR seems to not use post-process sharpening.</p>
<p>Compared to AMD FSR 2, the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler shows once again how it delivers a slightly better image in motion, as FSR 2 aliases foliage and fine geometry more. Still, PSSR features some image noise that FSR 2 doesn't, so the two upscalers are pretty much equivalent in The Last of Us Part 1, although FSR 2 delivers a sharper, more stable image than PSSR with the camera at rest.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in other games, NVIDIA DLSS is clearly superior to the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler in the vast majority of scenarios, delivering a basically faultless image quality at rest while looking very smooth in motion, even in Performance mode. PSSR, on the other hand, manages to maintain image detail in motion better than NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how the new Sony upscaler has the potential to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">much better in the future</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 1/Part 2 - PS5 Pro Tech Review + PSSR vs PC DLSS/FSR 2 Face-Off" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coyPienBLGk?start=486&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the features that make the PlayStation 5 Pro a better system than the base model. You can learn more about them in our review.</p>

There’s a reason your PS5 is the size of a small building, and it’s not aesthetic. And sure, in a few years’ time, such tech will likely be small enough to fit into something handheld, but by then the expectations for graphics will be photorealistic 5D liquid-pixels and we’ll be back to exactly where we are now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"To safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed," <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">Microsoft wrote</a>. "These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."</p>
<p>The company implores users to not manually install the update if they own the affected games, which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Origins</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>

It did note there may still be performance issues, however.</p>
<p>Microsoft is currently working on a fix with Ubisoft, promising more information when the companies know more. In the meantime, it has provided the following workaround for users who find a game stops responding to their demands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Task Manager. This can be accomplished by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start button and select Task Manager from the menu.</li>
<li>In the Task Manager window, look for your game in the Processes tab. It might be listed under the name of the game or the game launcher.</li>
<li>Click on the game’s name to highlight it. Then, click the End Task button at the bottom right of the window. This will close the game.</li>

<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently announced it was removing those really rather frustrating (read, incredibly frustrating) forced stealth sections from "almost all quest objectives" in Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>Thanks to an update earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-finally-getting-rid-of-forced-stealth-from-almost-all-quest-objectives">players will now be able to enter combat after getting caught while sneaking</a>, rather than getting ported back to the last checkpoint and being made to start the section again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The enemies of survival shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-best-guns">Stalker 2</a> have a funny habit of showing up right behind you, like a panto villain with an AK-47. Far from being a premeditated ambush by intelligent AI-controlled soldiers, this is just a result of the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gx7ja3/alife_20_in_action/">janky spawns</a>. Those botched encounters are unlike previous games, where roaming bands of factional murderfolk would patrol the radioactive wastes, seemingly according to their own whims. Back in the day, this wandering baddies feature was dubbed "A-life" by developers GSC Game World - basically a jargon word for the simulation of enemies that would lead to "emergent" moments of violence and conflict. It was promised as a feature in Stalker 2 but many players have noticed it seems to be absent. Over the weekend, GSC insisted the simulation is technically present in the sequel. It's just broken.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Often, the game world exists only in the player's field of view," say the developers when asked to define the feature in an <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/faq">official FAQ</a>. "A-Life 2.0 is a simulation system for life in the Zone. Factions and mutants are fighting for living space, migrating, capturing new places, or retreating to safer areas. A-Life is what makes Zone truly alive and unpredictable."</p>
<p>If that is currently present in Stalker 2, it's hard to tell. Right now, it seems enemies spawn in a simple radius around the player, for example, and you'll sometimes even see them pop into the world. If you don't see the enemy themselves as they appear, you will see the white sight marker that abruptly shows you've been instantly spotted by the bad guy who has materialised somewhere behind you. It's not the most intelligent spawning system, but I guess it does keep you on your toes. It also doesn't apply to every kind of enemy encounter - some are scripted, while other bandits and soldiers are tied to particular locations, making those run-ins appear more naturalistic. </p>
<p>Enemies do fight one another when they come into contact as well, but this more often happens after a group of bandidos or pack of blind dogs blinks into existence near an enemy camp simply because you're there. I have come across roaming groups of Stalkers, but again their appearance is sudden, and they're more likely to walk straight into toxic waste and die due to braindead pathing than to get into emergent scrapes with the wildlife. I definitely haven't seen any (non-scripted) instances of factions "capturing new places" or "retreating to safer areas" as the developer's definition suggests. </p><p>After some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gw7djs/so_alife_isnt_really_in_the_game_then/">complained about the A-life system</a> being absent (and pointed out that a mention of the feature was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1guf62t/alife_20_is_no_longer_mentioned_on_the_games/">edited out of the Steam page</a>) the developers have responded on Discord and Reddit to say that the system is really there, but that bugs are preventing it from acting as intended. </p>
<p>"There are several known issues with A-life 2.0 system that we are aware of and are working on fixes/improvements," said the studio's community manager on the Stalker Discord (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/stalker-2-devs-reassure-players-yes-a-life-2-0-is-in-the-game-no-its-not-working-right-and-yes-fixes-are-on-the-way/">PC Gamer</a>). "We know that this system is very important to the Zone having an immersive atmosphere, and we will do our best to fix the known issues."</p>
<p>It doesn't help that "A-life" is (and always has been) a hand-wavey buzzword, even more vaguely defined than Battlefield's "levolution" or Call Of Duty's recent "omnimovement". This leads to confusion and mixed expectations among players about what the feature actually entails. What is also complicating things from a developer perspective, say GSC, is that two different in-game systems are responsible for creating these theoretically organic shootouts. It presumably takes tweaking both to make the world feel inhabited by competing groups who wander around. And for each bug report or complaint they receive, they need to figure out which system is responsible for the unintended behaviour.</p>
<p>"The Combat AI and A-Life 2.0 are different things," one of the developers notes in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1gw7djs/comment/ly8nabt/">a reply to a Reddit complaint</a>. "One is actually a 'brain' for combat scenarios, while the other is an overall and more complicated system that is trying to manage life in the Zone."</p><p>In the meantime, the first patch for the shooter is coming soon, say GSC, who recently posted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2s-first-patch-is-coming-next-week-though-my-favourite-parts-are-still-the-imperfections"> details about the fixes</a> they're planning. A lot of these will address crashes, softlocks, balance adjustments, and other high-priority stuff, they say. But at the bottom of the list is "A-Life system bugfixes", which further suggests the studio considers it significant enough to sort out soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you’re a fan of Warhammer 40k, you know John Blanche. Even if it’s you’re first time hearing his name, you’ll be familiar with his fingerprints on some of the setting’s most defining artwork. He’s responsible for that iconic imagine of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryWarhammer/comments/c7ra8t/the_godemperor_by_john_blanche/">emprah</a> - the one the best shows off the dark irony of a such a wretched figure becoming an idol of worship. While the term ‘grimdark’ originates from 40k’s "in the grim darkness of the far future…" tagline, grimdark as an aesthetic is one Blanche pioneered. There’s even a style of miniature painting - <a href="https://youtu.be/znrCqYFFl9Q">Blanchitsu </a>- named after him.</p>
<p>Basically, even games that don’t use the 40k license owe an incredible amount to Blanche’s work. That’s not to mention his influence on the fantasy setting of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer</a> series either. His piece <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerFantasy/comments/rtgrbg/harry_the_hammer_john_blanche_1983/">Harry The Hammer</a> was the cover for the first edition of Fantasy Battle - recently added to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game as chaos hero Harold Hammerstorm. I could go on, and I might do so in a bit, but here’s the news: Trademark Films are making <a href="https://trademarkfilms.com/films/d121a6f6-231f-481d-86bc-3fe5ee83847f">a documentary</a> on Blanche’s work, starring Napoleon Dynamite actor Jon Heder. It’s called The Grim And The Dark: The Search For John Blanche, and it’s out next Spring. Here’s a trailer:</p>

<p>As per the title, the documentary’s narrative is set up as a hunt for the 46-year veteran of Games Workshop, which seems a little dramatic as far as narratives go: he’s <a href="https://youtu.be/NCOSao1KEQo">not exactly</a> been <a href="https://youtu.be/HnruIB54Zys">elusive since</a> he retired last year. Still, I’ve always quite enjoyed watching something I’m familiar with given an outsider-framing. It’s almost like discovering something for the first time, and I’m sure it’ll be interesting to see which details from Blanche’s long career the filmmakers consider pertinent or interesting to more general audiences.</p><p>What’s doubly exciting is that it seems like the documentary will explore further afield than Warhammer itself. In the trailer, you can see some models and artwork from Trench Crusade - a skirmish miniatures game with work from some ex-GW talent that recently did gangbusters <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1405364378/trench-crusade">on Kickstarter</a>. Even the <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1852841297469415604">Helldivers crew were impressed</a> enough to get hyped<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-once-planned-a-licensed-cosmetic-system-that-basically-let-you-hallucinate-a-different-world"> about a crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Heder himself, according to a website blurb, was introduced to "the world of Grimdark" when out "looking for a gift for his kid". May I suggest <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrenchCrusade/comments/15noh8q/sin_eater/">this Trench Crusade lad</a> with more than a little <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> influence, Jon? As for you, reader, do try and fish a copy of <a href="https://goblinlee.blogspot.com/2019/05/ratspike-john-blanche.html">Ratspike</a> out of the internet if you’re interested in more of Blanche’s work, alongside fellow fantasy luminary Ian Miller.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-waypoint-for-and-why-is-vice-doing-this.1044429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a reader of <em>this </em>website, you're probably familiar with the fate of a similar website, Vice's Waypoint,<a href="https://kotaku.com/rip-to-waypoint-a-good-website-about-video-games-1850385017#:~:text=In%202016%20Vice%20launched%20a,2023%20it%20will%20be%20gone." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> which was shuttered in April 2023 and its incredibly talented staff laid off</a>. You may not be quite as familiar with the fact that, earlier this year, even amid all Vice's very public corporate turmoil,<a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Waypoint quietly came back</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/section/waypoint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go take a look</a>! There's a site there with fresh stories and at least three writers' bylines attached to them. It has, if you turned the lights out and looked only at the brief flash of a silhouette before the room was plunged into inky blackness, the outline of Waypoint, in that there is a website there called Waypoint publishing stories about video games.</p><p>That's about where the similarities with the old Waypoint end, though, because this zombie version has very quickly become an incredibly <em>weird </em>website. Managing Editor Dwayne Jenkins is posting there a <em>lot</em>, quite possibly under duress, and nearly everything they are publishing sits slightly askew, like the frame of each blog is hanging from only one nail in the wall.</p><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/loco-motive-and-games-journalisms-regrettable-relationship-with-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post, published on November 22</a>, is a great example. Bemoaning the state of indie coverage in games media, it is headlined by a game the author hasn't actually played, and later features attempts to call <em>Alan Wake 2</em> and <em>Dishonored</em> "indie". Its heart is in the right place, at least at the point it first set forth onto the page, but the turns it takes once it gets going are just utterly bizarre.</p><p>Waypoint in November 2024 is a collection of so many of these random thoughts, half-formed ideas and incomplete paragraphs. It's post after post of fever dreams, of unsupervised riffing on the medium, an artist's impression of what a video game blog from 2009 looked like, drawn by someone who wasn't there at the time and doesn't understand how they worked.</p><p>I'm not saying any of this to dunk on Jenkins or the site itself. This isn't a <em>bad </em>website, <a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the way a content farm or clickbait hellscape might be</a>. It's a <em>weird </em>website, and I'm just trying to understand the point of it. I honestly can't get a read on why it exists, what it's doing with this rare second chance. Is it there to juice SEO? The blogs they're running won't do numbers in that market. Is it ads? There are LOTS of ads on the page, yeah, but there's no way this website has the readership to make them worth anything more than cents on the dollar. Is it to foster a community? The site has no comments, so I'm going to guess it's a no there as well.</p><p>Why would anybody want to read any of this? It's offering nothing that the original Waypoint did, a site with a genuine sense of community, a coherent tone, and work that was so valued by fans that when Vice shut it down it was almost instantly able to pop right back up again. Nu Waypoint isn't even good at the stuff the very worst websites are offering, like SEO slop and clickbait headlines.</p><p>It's like someone at Vice woke up one day, forgot they had already owned a video games website and closed it down, and thought in a rare moment of lucidity "man, you know what we need, a video games website". So they reopened Waypoint, hired some writers, ordered them to blog at a volume that seems harmful and thought that was that. This new website wouldn't need a vision, or a strategy, or any focus on quality; all it would need to do to succeed would be to shovel some content on the page and hope for the best.</p><p>In reality, the reality you and I and everyone else live in, it's all so obviously broken and clueless and detrimental to everyone involved, from readers to writers. I'm left as clueless watching this unfold as I was at G/O Media, as Jim Spanfeller gleefully broke everything he touched, like a flabbier version of the giant baby in <em>Spirited Away</em>.</p><p>Why are the people in charge always so fucking stupid? How can they be the only people on the planet to see that this isn't working, that it's a bad idea, that this is not what readers want or what writers should be put to work writing? Why is it that the dumbest people in the room are always the ones in charge?</p><p>I don't have an answer. All I can say is that, as always, fuck capitalism, go home,<a href="https://remapradio.com/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and you can support what Waypoint used to stand for at Remap</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Farthest Frontier will now be released in full next year.</p>
<p>Originally, the town-building early access game was slated for its Version 1 release in 2024. But, with this year now only having a scant five and a bit weeks left (yes, really), the team has announced a change to those original plans.</p>

<p>Developer Crate Entertainment said it had decided to postpone Farthest Frontier's full release for a number of reasons. "For starters, we feel that performance is simply not quite where we would like it to be yet," it wrote in a <a href="https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/the-state-of-early-access-update-07/141562">post</a> detailing the delay.</p><p>"We are seeing your grand 3000+ population towns which are no doubt pushing the limits of hardware, but there is still more we could do to squeeze more frames out of the game, and we want to take the time to get it right."</p>
<p>Another reason is Crate Entertainment still has plans to add a few more bits and pieces to Farthest Frontier. This, it said, "bloats the schedule" somewhat.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the team has put its business hat on, and come to the conclusion now is not the best time to release its indie game in full. "With the holidays rapidly approaching, this is the time of year when big publishers are going to drown the market with advertising, eager for your holiday shopping coin. Similarly, February tends to be a month when everyone's wallets have just recovered from the holiday rush, so in come the big AAA releases," it reasoned.</p>
<p>As such, Farthest Frontier will now get its full launch in the spring of next year. You can check out a trailer for this new release window in the video above.</p>

<p>Our Bertie was rather impressed with Farthest Frontier when he gave it a whirl back in 2022.</p>
<p>"Farthest Frontier is not about going from dozens to thousands, from village to sprawling metropolis, and that zooming out you then feel as the person in charge. It's about staying small and staying close to the people you're caring for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/farthest-frontier-understands-the-best-moments-of-city-builders-are-the-beginnings">Eurogamer's Farthest Frontier preview</a>.</p><p>"There's no hurry. It allows you time to let the tranquillity of the game wash over you - the gentle music, the sprawling natural world, the simplicity of surviving. It gives you time to lean in and take an interest in the small lives playing out in front of you, to watch them go about their daily work, to know their names, to check their needs are being met. It's a warm and relaxing place to be."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, billbil-kun, who proved to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that a lot of PlayStation content is being prepared behind the scenes, and some new announcements are coming, although the insider cannot say if an event is indeed coming. Seeing as there's a lot of content being prepared, it is unlikely it is just for this year's upcoming The Game Awards show, so something could indeed be brewing outside of single, separate announcements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">👀<br>
A PlayStation event is really happening soon?</p>
<p>I don't have the answer, but many PlayStation stuff are being prepared behind the scenes,</p>
<p>Some fresh news are coming,<br>
Stay tuned... <a href="https://t.co/IrLUZjgLTl">pic.twitter.com/IrLUZjgLTl</a></p>
<p>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1860979631148396721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been a very long time since the latest proper PlayStation Showcase, as Sony opted to go with usually smaller State of Play presentations for a while. A September showcase to present the PlayStation 5 Pro was long rumored, but it never happened as Sony presented the console without the big presentation many expected to see.</p>
<p>Besides working on games coming in the next year and beyond, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-hard-r-not-fully-open-world-2024-2025/">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Sony seems to be quite active on the hardware front as well, developing not only the PlayStation 6, which will once again be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, but apparently also a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-handheld-in-the-works-to-rival-nintendo-switch/">PlayStation 5 handheld system</a> that will compete directly with the Nintendo Switch. Plans for the release of this system, however, have yet to be finalized, so there's the chance it will never be launched. As the company has somewhat gotten back into the handheld market with the PlayStation Portal after the commercial failure of the PS Vita and Microsoft working on a<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> portable system of its own</a>, it would be surprising for Sony to skip getting fully back into what is becoming more and more a very lucrative space, as highlighted by the many handheld systems that launched on the market after the release of the Steam Deck.</p>

            <p>You may have noticed some recent changes to our commenting system. I want to explain what has been happening.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we swapped our in-house commenting system for a third-party system. As soon as the swap was complete, complaints about poor site performance and usability problems flooded in from readers.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a substantial number of you reported that your mobile devices were crashing when trying to read articles - not good.</p>
<p>We treat this sort of reader interruption with the same level of severity as a site outage, and we have been working behind the scenes with the third-party to understand and fix the problem.</p>
<p>But, sometimes the fix is to go back to what you had. So that's what we've done.</p>
<p>As of today, we are back using our old commenting system. No more infuriating "See more" buttons, no more broken notifications, and most importantly - no more crashing browsers.</p>
<p>You may notice your comments from the last two weeks aren't visible - we'll be restoring those in the coming days.</p>
<p>This, and other communities across Gamer Network sites have some of the most eloquent, funny, and insightful commenters on the internet, and we want you to stick around. That will only happen if our websites offer not just the best journalism in the world, but also provide you with the best reading experience and community tools possible. That is our goal.</p>
<p>I am really sorry about these recent changes impacting your ability to enjoy the site.</p>
<p>I'll be hanging around in the comments thread to chat if anyone has any questions, feedback, or ideas for further improvements we should make to our in-house comments system.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> and Riot Games' utterly brilliant Arcane will be followed by three further series exploring other parts of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> world. 
</p>
<p>
Arcane showrunner Christian Linke has now confirmed the locations in which these new stories will be set as Noxus, home to Arcane's Mel Meldarda, plus Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052">Necrit94</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arcane-showrunner-confirms-noxus-ionia-demacia-league-of-legends-shows/">TheGamer</a>), Linke said these new series would tell fresh stories, but also continue some of the threads already seen in Arcane.
</p>
<p>
"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said.
</p>
<p>
Talented animation studio Fortiche will once again be at the helm for these series, after its award-winning work on Arcane's two seasons, but there's no word yet on when these new series might materialise.
</p>
<p>
Production work on the next show began a year ago, Linke noted, so hopefully we won't have another three year wait to see more.
</p>
<p>Linke had previously mentioned the development of further League of Legends shows when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">confirmed that Arcane would end with its second season</a>.</p>
<p>"Arcane is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and our partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," Linke said in a developer update video earlier this year. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with the second season.</p><p>"But Arcane is just the first of many stories we want to tell in Runeterra. We've been with Riot through Vi and Jinx's entire journey thus far, from becoming in-game champions to characters featured in different cinematics to main characters in a TV show. Their arcs have grown so far beyond our original dreams, and we want to give the same treatment to more champions."</p>
<p>
In related news, a recent League of Legends leak has suggested the game will get a Noxus-themed season next year, as the game gets ready to host Mel herself beginning in early 2025.
</p>
<p>
"Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane season two review</a>. "This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."
