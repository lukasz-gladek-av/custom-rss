		<p>After an interminable wait, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> is finally <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-17th-april/">coming to PS5 this week</a>. Now Sony lovers can rejoice in travelling the globe, exploring beautiful locales, discovering mystical relics, and hitting fascists with a surprisingly varied selection of comedy objects – for my money, an umbrella is the best.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones is, of course, an iconic character. Over the course of three films – yes, there have definitely positively only ever been <em>three </em>films – Indy became the hero of every child of the 1980’s; so much so, that even the character’s shadow became instantly recognisable. Indiana Jones And The Great Circle brilliantly captures all the whip-cracking, snake-fearing, and fedora-wearing excellence of the films, distilling them into an interactive experience that puts the player firmly in the role of the world’s most dashing professor.</p>



<p>I’ve been thoroughly enjoying Indiana Jones And The Great Circle on PS5, and it was whilst clambering the rooftops of Vatican City (before dropping down behind an unsuspecting Blackshirt and knocking him flat out with a handy mandolin) that I got to thinking – has there even been a real-life Indiana Jones? We all get to be Indy digitally now, but has anyone ever done it for real? The adventures, the danger, the thrills and spills?</p>
<p>Fantastically, the answer is yes. But there’s not just one real-life Indy, there are several! Here though, for your eyeball’s enjoyment, are my two absolute favourites.</p>

<p>Born in 1884, in Beloit, Wisconsin, Roy Chapman Andrews was trained by his father to use a shotgun when only nine-years-old. He put that skill to good use, stuffing and selling the animals he shot to pay for college. In adulthood, Andrews became a world-famous explorer, leading dangerous expeditions through China, Tibet, and Mongolia. He lived a life of danger, always on the edge. In one of his many books, he wrote about how he nearly died ten times, “Two were from drowning in a typhoon, one was when our boat was charged by a wounded whale; once my wife and I were nearly eaten by wild dogs, once we were in great danger from fanatical lama priests; two were close calls when I fell over cliffs, once I was nearly caught by a huge python, and twice I might have been killed by bandits.” I don’t know about you, but fanatical lama priests would make a great plot for a fourth Indy film, should they ever make one.</p>
<p>Andrews was a boffin too, just like Indy. He proved that dinosaurs hatched from eggs during an expedition in Mongolia, he discovered that the extinct Gray Whale wasn’t extinct after all, and he wrote a stonking twenty books. Heck, he became so famous that he even featured on the cover of Times Magazine in 1923.</p>
<div id="attachment_458883"><p id="caption-attachment-458883">TIME Magazine Cover Featuring Roy Chapman Andrews (29 Oct 1923)</p></div>
<p>The uncanny similarity to Indy doesn’t end there though, as Andrews wore a fedora and also suffered from ophidiophobia – the fear of snakes. Quite understandable, as in Mongolia Andrew’s tent was invaded at night by a pack of Vipers, forcing him to fight them off with any object he could find – which, as I’ve learned from playing Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, was probably a shovel, a beer bottle, and a wrench.</p>

<p>Then there’s Percy Fawcett, a British Army Officer, who spent two decades exploring the treacherous jungles of South America. Born in 1867, Fawcett was commissioned into the Royal Artillery before finding his way into spying for the British Government. In 1906, to settle a border dispute between Bolivia and Brazil, Fawcett was tasked with mapping an area of unexplored Jungle that separated the two countries. His adventure should have taken him two years to complete, if he even survived, as the jungles were rife with dangerous creatures and even more dangerous and unpleasant human slavers. Yet, despite the challenges, Fawcett wrapped up his expedition in a few months. This proved a turning point for Fawcett, the Amazon became like a drug for him. He returned again and again to the jungle, despite nearly dying on numerous occasions from causes as varied and nasty as starvation, disease, and mutiny. Still, none of that put off Fawcett, as he became dedicated, in a very Indy way, to finding a ‘lost city’. The city of Z.</p>
<p>Where did this idea of a lost city come from? The early conquistadores spoke of towns and villages found dotting the Amazon, yet these had never been uncovered. Fawcett reasoned, why couldn’t there be a large settlement hidden in the Amazon? After all, Hiram Bingham III had recently rediscovered Machu Picchu, a humongous city hidden in the Peruvian Andes for centuries, so why couldn’t there be a mysterious city in the depths of the Amazon too?</p>
<p>Taking a quick break from exploring to fight bravely on the Western Front in the First World War (why not, right? The dude was a spritely 50 years old at the time), Fawcett returned to begin his search of the Amazon. It was in the National Library of Brazil that Fawcett, just like Indy, found a mysterious ancient document, tucked away. Written by a slaver in 1753, the text spoke of a ruined city, an ancient metropolis, rich for the finding. That was all Fawcett needed; he headed out for adventure. His search continued for years, before finally, in 1924, Fawcett and his party disappeared without a trace. No-one knows what happened to Fawcett, did he ever find ‘Z’? Or did he just meet his end at the hands of a naffed off Xavante warrior?</p>
<p>Fascinatingly, Fawcett’s signet ring was found in 1979, but no other traces of the explorer were ever discovered. Still, Fawcett lived his life like Indiana Jones until the very end, yearning for adventure, for the thrill of discovery, to journey deep into the unknown.</p>

<p>So, as you fire up Indiana Jones And The Great Circle on your PS5 this week, as you swing across a pit trap using your trusty whip, as you search dark catacombs with only a candle to light your way, as you solve brain-tickling puzzles in the depths of an ancient temple, spare a thought for Roy Chapman Andrews and Percy Fawcett, who did all that thrilling stuff for real.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that it's raising the prices of the PS5 in certain regions, although the price of the accompanying disc drive accessory is actually going down.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/?sf276959904=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Sony says that because of a "challenging economic environment" which involves "high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates", the PlayStation 5's price will be increasing in Europe, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Happily (or perhaps not if this is the model you're thinking of buying), the PS5 Digital Edition is the only model affected in Europe and the UK, although both models are getting a price increase in Australia and New Zealand, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=Xhcr_JYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-consoles.jpg?itok=hPGVbS8F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 is getting a price hike in some areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the PS5 itself is getting a price hike, the PS5 Disc Drive's RRP will be decreasing in all four of the previously-mentioned areas. These price changes kick in today.</p>

<h3>Europe</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;€499.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;€79.99</li>
</ul><h3>UK</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition: £429.99</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition: no change</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: £69.99</li>
</ul><h3>Australia</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;AUD $749.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;AUD $829.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive:&nbsp;AUD $124.95</li>
</ul><h3>New Zealand</h3>

<ul><li>PS5 Digital Edition:&nbsp;NZD $859.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Standard Edition:&nbsp;NZD $949.95</li>
	<li>PS5 Disc Drive: NZD $139.95</li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect given its price is already pretty high, the PS5 Pro's price isn't going anywhere, at least for now. These price increases are strictly for the base PS5 models (well, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season" rel="nofollow">newer slim models</a>, at any rate).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=FNgXJ0dR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-price-rises-pro.jpg?itok=RcaptrO5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro won't be subject to the new price hikes.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time in the last couple of years that Sony has hiked PS5 prices. Back in October 2023, the company upped the cost of its console's Digital Edition by $50 alongside the announcement of the slimmer redesign.</p>

<p>Sony's PS5 price hikes also come at a time when the price of consoles is a hot topic, largely thanks to two things: the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its $449.99 price tag, and President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs, which appear to be in constant flux at time of writing.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you want to buy a PS5 (and not a PS5 Pro) in the aforementioned regions, the new price hikes go into effect today. Bear that in mind before you go shopping!</p>

            <p>I cannot remember any of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>’s bosses, so it’s perhaps for the best that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach will let us skip right past them – skip right past them like children who think video games are just Instagram montages, and that the power of choice is a Christian rock band. Kojima Productions’ forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> off-Reeder will apparently give you the option to bypass bossfights after your defeat, with information about the character then fed to you in the form of image and text descriptions. In other words, Death Stranding 2 is secretly a hybrid visual novel.</p><!--more-->
<p>I jest, I jest! No visual novel would ever receive this kind of financing. They probably blew through the entire budget of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amarantus">Amarantus</a> on Troy Baker’s eyeshadow. Rest assured that Death Stranding 2 will have traditional real game accoutrements like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-death-stranding-2-trailer-features-a-familiar-bandana-and-a-weapon-to-legally-surpass-metal-gear">shooting and cyberpunk pedalos</a>, but should you miss claiming a boss’s scalp by millimetres you will now have the option of delegating its defeat to the Game Over screen.</p>
<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," explains <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a> on Xitter, translating and summarising comments from game director Hideo Kojima during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, as passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-will-let-you-clear-bosses-without-actually-defeating-them">Eurogamer</a>. The bossfight and any story revelations therein will then be spelled out "like a novel".</p>
<p>What will the Kojima faithful make of all this? As Matt Jones <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pillowfort.bsky.social/post/3lmrgnq4bec26">points out on Bluesky</a>, other developers have proposed to let players skip things and gotten it in the neck from people who regard ‘cheating’ at games as some kind of Nietzschean self-negation.</p>
<p>Back in 2012, for example, BioWare writer Jennifer Hepler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-escape-embracing-skippable-combat">received a torrent of abuse from disgruntled Dragon Age 2 players</a> over a recirculated interview from 2006, in which she argued that some games might benefit from the option to skip the combat. Something tells me that Kojima will be granted more latitude. Myself, I see no harm in letting Death Stranders skip bossfights as long as Death Stranding 2 doubles down on the hiking mechanics and lets me choose from a selection of bootlace knots to modify my stamina and agility. Also I want a pogo stick.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Small Black business come ups are always the move. </p><p>On the other hand, the first episode of “Live,” which aired Thursday evening (April 10), is so irrepressibly awful, I won’t know how to explain it to the aliens when they come. It was so terrible, the only reason I turned it back on after shutting it off after the first 12 minutes is to write this piece intelligently.</p><p>The show is a fusillade of f***kery that manages to do everything, everywhere wrong, all at once. The problems start with celebrity host Yvonne Orji, who is meant to bring her irreverent,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498"> virginal</a></span> humor to the proceedings, but most of her “jokes” land like a fart in church. In contrast, Amuli is happy allowing her contestants to deliver the personality on her “PTB,” limiting her flair to a cute lil’ mic twirl and that shimmy she does when she lands a match.</p><p>Then, there’s the cast of singles, who are all well-dressed and range from decently to preternaturally attractive. A significant aspect of O.G. “PTB’s” charm is that several of its contestants look like they either rolled out of bed to come to the show or their friends should be arrested for allowing them to go on camera dressed as they are. And they <em>damn</em> sure don’t all look like they had modeling contracts at some point.</p><p>There’s also the jocular tone of the whole proceedings — as if no one is <em>really </em>there to find a boo and it’s all for play-play. The several reality TV stars ruin the whole damn thing: The first single guy is a jackwagon named Johnny Bananas who was on MTV’s “The Real World” and who goes out of his way to be the most inauthentic human being next to the guy whose job it is to maintain President Donald Trump’s hair.</p><p>So many other aspects of “Live” just don’t hit. The post-round “confessionals.” The live audience and Orji responding to every <em>single</em> balloon pop. The vibe that everyone is there for exposure — which, in fairness, is a staple of the O.G. “PTB,” where 85 percent of the participants are “entrepreneurs.”</p><p>“Live” is yet another example of an authentically Black product getting in the hands of folks with money who bastardize and gentrify it to a pulp. It’s like what would happen if “Verzuz,” the beloved pandemic-era music competition which featured Black artists in every episode, pitted Taylor Swift against Katy Perry.</p><p>In fact, the racial dynamics on “Live” are cringy out the gate: One of the non-Black women pops on Bananas and says, “My physical type is Black,” to which he, a white boy, responds, “I’m Black from the waist up.” And there’s the blondest woman on the panel “rapping” and gyrating while insisting she grew up in Michigan listening to…Chingy. (So, “Right Thurr” on repeat her whole childhood?) Also, the spirit of Dr. Umar Johnson flowed through me every time a white woman popped on a Black male single.</p><p>We simply don’t have to worry about this shit on Amuli’s “Pop the Balloon.”</p><p>Arguably, the O.G. “Pop The Balloon” isn’t actually good <em>for </em>Black folks in how it lays bare the interminable, tired 50-50, “what-do-you-bring-to-the-table”-head ass conversations — that’s a discussion for a different rant. But there’s something charming about the low budget, somewhat ratchet nature of Amuli’s version: The whole thing looks like its shot on a Samsung Galaxy phone and paid for with a few orders of Zaxby’s, and we love it.</p><p>Fortunately, Amuli will continue her Wednesday YouTube show, hopefully maintaining the stripped-down, all Black vibe with which we fell in love. Because my guess is, with the seemingly universal early disdain for “Pop The Balloon Live,” it’s gonna go the route of the “Good Times” Netflix “remake” very damn soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The rumored portable edition of the PlayStation 6 won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, according to information shared by a known leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking last month on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-3#post-270213490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeoGAF forums</a>, as reported today on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywrgn/kepler_says_the_portable_ps6_is_a_15w_soc_on_3nm/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, known AMD leaker Kepler L2 revealed that the portable edition of the next-generation console by Sony won't be as powerful as the PlayStation 5, as it will be powered by a 15W SoC on 3nm. As the system is said to be able to run PS5 games, it will definitely be interesting to see how the portable system will be able to do so and which compromises will have to be made to achieve this.</p>
<p>Very little is currently known about the PlayStation 6 as of now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-soc-design-complete/">Earlier this year</a>, we heard again from Kepler L2 that the SoC is design complete and entered pre-silicon validation with A0 tapeout scheduled for later this year. While this doesn't tell us much about the console, the usual timeframe from A0 tapeout and release is 2 years, so there's a chance the system will launch in 2027.</p>
<p>The only thing we know for certain about the PlayStation 6 is that it will once again be powered by AMD. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Last year</a>, it was confirmed that Intel also bid to produce the console, but ultimately AMD won due to a dispute at Intel over how much profit the company would make from each chip sold to Sony, which prevented the company from deciding on a price.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie unveiled its new team-based extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/">Marathon</a> over the weekend, giving us our first honest look at the gameplay and a release date to look forward to. However, we did not get any idea about how much it would cost.</p>
<p>We've known for some time now that Marathon will not be a free-to-play title. The current rumor is that it will be priced at the same level Concord was, at $40. After the weekend showcase went live, previews for Marathon from the press who attended a recent in-person event where they got to play the game and speak to members of Marathon's team at Bungie also went live. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's</a> preview seems to shed more light on how Marathon will be priced.</p>
<p>Bungie told GameSpot that Marathon will be a "<em>premium</em>" release. Though they did not provide a specific number or price range, Bungie did confirm that it would not be a "<em>full-priced</em> <em>title.</em>"</p>
<p>That might be clear as mud, but it at least officially confirms what was already rumored: Marathon will not be aiming for that $70 premium price tag that most triple-A games get. This keeps the $40 price point still firmly in the lead as to what the price of the game might actually be.</p>
<p>With that said, there's a good chance it could be even less than $40 because the significant remaining variable is how Sony will approach Marathon after watching Concord fail in such a big way last year. The two games aren't entirely comparable. Concord was made by a studio with nowhere near Bungie's legacy. Concord was entirely a brand-new series, unlike Marathon, which has an existing fan base that would be interested in trying this reboot of the series.</p>
<p>There's also likely a contingent of Bungie die-hard fans who will buy Marathon just to try the latest game from their favorite studio. Those factors alone make it very unlikely that Marathon crashes in the same way Concord did.</p>
<p>Still, it wouldn't be surprising if Sony chose to hedge its bets by making the barrier to entry for Marathon cheaper than it was for Concord. Pricing won't be the only factor in Marathon's success or lack thereof, but it will still play a big role. Hopefully, we'll have a better idea of the price soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marathon-release-date-and-first-gameplay-revealed.1163673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced a release date for its&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot, which will reimagine the original 90s series of single-player FPS games as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p>

<p>As revealed over the weekend, the&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>release date is September 23rd. A closed alpha test is also being held between April 23rd and May 4th, and if you want to get into that, you'll have to sign up to the official&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> (it's free, though, don't worry).</p>

<p>Narrative director Julia Nardin describes&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>as "both a reimagining of and a direct successor to the original games"; you'll "recognize characters, locations and events" from the original&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>games in the new title, but "those events played out slightly differently" than you may remember.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed-aiming.jpg?itok=MuiY29OP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed-aiming.jpg?itok=INwxFRWe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>reboot lands in September.</figcaption></figure><p>Bungie's goal with&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is to inject story into the traditional extraction shooter gameplay template, so "new mysteries and stories" will be available to discover in each season. Some of those moments will happen in-game, and others will "go beyond the game", utilizing the likes of ARGs (alternate reality games) and trailers.</p>

<p>As for the gameplay, well,&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>is an extraction shooter, just as you'd expect. You'll team up with up to two other players, facing off against "AI security forces, otherworldly threats, and rival Runner teams" as you explore a lost colony on the planet of Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You'll choose from a range of Runners, each of whom has "unique abilities, stats, and styles", and you'll further customize them using the loot you find while exploring Tau Ceti IV.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>'s debut gameplay trailer, which gives a pretty good sense of what kind of game you can expect in September, right here.</p>




<p><em>Marathon</em>'s road to release began back in May 2023, when the reboot of the beloved 90s series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-resurrects-marathon-playstation-showcase" rel="nofollow">was first announced</a>. Following that, Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie" rel="nofollow">revealed a little more info about the game</a> before dropping off the radar for "an extended period" to develop&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>further.</p>

<p>In the months between then and now, Bungie seemingly ran into some snags with&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>; the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and" rel="nofollow">suffered</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-layoffs-200-employees" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> as&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>was reportedly internally delayed.</p>

<p>Following that, director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">quietly fired</a> from the project over misconduct allegations last year. He subsequently brought a lawsuit against Sony regarding the dismissal, although Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence" rel="nofollow">has pushed back</a> against the claims he made in that lawsuit.</p>

<p><em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marathon/9PB32DKQKZDQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 23rd.</p>

<p>A new DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 Edition from Limited Run Games could be the best yet. It’s become a running joke over the years to see what DOOM can run on. Now, it literally runs in a box, and only 666 people have the chance to secure this incredible bundle.</p>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM played in Fortnite</a>, on fridges and calculators, and I’m sure someone’s probably got it to work on a pencil at this point. DOOM is considered the father of first-person shooters (shout out to Wolfenstein too), and its impact is still being felt in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s not just old DOOM games either. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> is one of the biggest games of 2025. But if you can’t wait, you might need to fight off Imps, Cacodemons, and people if you want to secure Limited Run Games’ DOOM Will It Run Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-limited-edition-doom-will-it-run-is-very-limited">Limited-Edition DOOM “Will It Run?” is Very Limited</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You get so much cool stuff. Credit to Limited Run Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Limited Run Games is doing a special DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 collection of the two original games lumped together in one physical package. It’s great for collectors and people who want to buy DOOM again for the umpteenth time.</p>



<p>If you want more, the Big Box Edition comes with Cassette Tapes and Trading Cards. But you’re here for the big gun, and the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Will It Run Edition</a> comes inside a giant box in the style of an old-school DOOM door.</p>



<p><strong>It’s $666.66 and is limited to the first 666 people who buy it!</strong></p>



<p>This demonic deal includes the following content:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOOM + DOOM II Game*</li>



<li>Box that Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Two Piece Big Box</li>



<li>Cassette Tape Soundtrack Set with Slipcase
<ul>
<li>Includes Base Soundtrack and full IDFKR Soundtrack&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Floating Cacodemon – on Magnetic Base
<ul>
<li>3’ Cacodemon with 5’ Base</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Handheld Cacodemon – Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Trading Card Pack includes five random cards</li>



<li>Certificate of Authenticity&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>*PC Edition includes Digital Steam Code</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The “Box that Plays DOOM” is easily the best feature. It’s tongue-in-cheek, it’s a remarkable piece of memorabilia in its own right, and it is a must-have for hardened DOOM fans.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Before it made a name for itself in the gaming industry with the Halo series, Bungie's big video game series was Marathon, a grand sci-fi saga that was originally released for Mac. In many ways, Marathon was ahead of its time thanks to its rich lore, groundbreaking gameplay elements, and ideas that would help shape Bungie's work on Halo and Destiny. After decades of dormancy, Marathon returns later this year, this time as a multiplayer-focused extraction shooter that combines Bungie's signature gunplay with a vibrant art direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its launch in September, we've gathered up all the pertinent information on the game and you can read up to see how Marathon is shaping up.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Marathon_be_released_">When will Marathon be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_preorders">Marathon preorders</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_platforms">Marathon platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Marathon_free_to_play_">Is Marathon free-to-play?</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_Alpha">Marathon Alpha</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_storyline">Marathon storyline</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_gameplay">Marathon gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_Runners">Marathon Runners</a><ul><li><a href="#Locus">Locus</a></li><li><a href="#Blackbird">Blackbird</a></li><li><a href="#Glitch">Glitch</a></li><li><a href="#Void">Void</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Marathon_screenshots">Marathon screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#Marathon_is_a_multiplayer_only_game">Marathon is a multiplayer-only game</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Marathon_a_sequel_to_the_original_trilogy_">Is Marathon a sequel to the original trilogy?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Marathon_be_released_">When will Marathon be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144884"></a><figcaption>One of the Runners off Marathon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">Marathon will launch on September 23, 2025</a>. This will be around two years after Bungie first unveiled the game, although it's worth noting that the studio has undergone massive restructuring since then. There were 220 employees laid off in 2024, and former Marathon director Chris Barrett was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly fired for inappropriate behavior</a>, a claim that he is disputing as he is suing both Sony and Bungie.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_preorders">Marathon preorders</h2><p dir="ltr">Physical and digital preorders for Marathon aren't open yet, but we'll update this page as soon the listings go live.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-preorder-bonuses-appear-to-have-leaked-on-steam/1100-6529918/"> Preorder bonuses for Marathon</a> might have already leaked as well, as datamining fans claim that free Marathon-themed skins that players can use to dress up their Guardian in Bungie's Destiny 2 will be an incentive to grab the game.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_platforms">Marathon platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">While Sony acquired Bungie--at a cost of over $3.5 billion--back in 2022, Marathon won't be exclusive to PlayStation. The game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with full cross-play and cross-save support. Bungie also confirmed that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-or-xbox/1100-6530767/"> PC and Xbox players won't need a PSN account</a> to play Marathon.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_Marathon_free_to_play_">Is Marathon free-to-play?</h2><p dir="ltr">Unlike many other games in the live-service space, Marathon will not be free-to-play. Pricing hasn't been revealed yet, and<a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow "> Bungie says</a> that it will not be a "full-priced" title when it launches. It has been rumored that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/"> Marathon will cost $40 when it launches</a>, the same price as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/"> Sony's ill-fated Concord</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_Alpha">Marathon Alpha</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">Marathon's first closed alpha test will begin in April 2025</a>, and if you're interested in trying it out, you can join the official<a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow "> Marathon Discord</a> for the chance to get access to this early cut of the game. There will be several playtesting sessions before the September launch as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_storyline">Marathon storyline</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We're going to be insultingly brief here, but let's just say that Marathon can give Destiny a run for its money when it comes to lore quality and quantity. The original series of games were published exclusively on Apple Macintosh desktops from 1994 through to 1996, and the overarching story involves space exploration, civil war, hostile alien invaders, immortal cyborg super-soldiers, and the concept of using a hollowed-out Martian moon to transport resources between planets.</p><p dir="ltr">The Marathon trilogy storyline is one that has been chronicled and preserved for <em>decades </em>by fans, and while you won't need to know any of it before the new game launches, Bungie says that there will be references to the trilogy that longtime fans will appreciate.</p><p dir="ltr">"A massive ghost ship hangs in low orbit over a lost colony on Tau Ceti IV," the official synopsis reads. "The 30,000 souls who call this place home have disappeared without a trace. Strange signals hint at mysterious artifacts, long-dormant AI, and troves of untold riches. You are a runner, venturing into the unknown in a fight for fame… and infamy. Who among you will write their names across the stars?"</p><p dir="ltr">In the reveal stream, Bungie revealed a few more details. For starters, the game takes place in 2893, and you'll play as a runner; a synthetic human working for one of several factions as you scour the planet for valuable artifacts. "Survive and everything you've scavenged is yours to keep for future runs on Tau Ceti IV or if you're brave enough, a journey to the derelict Marathon ship that hangs above," the updated synopsis reads.</p><p dir="ltr">We also know that Marathon will use seasonal storytelling to flesh out its narrative, with each season lasting three months.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_gameplay">Marathon gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144885"></a><figcaption>A closer look at a Marathon Runner.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Winning in Marathon can also be achieved through several different methods, and Bungie says that it wants to make these elements as accessible as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the ways we're addressing this is by making the core fantasies of survival and extraction fun, clear, and easy to understand," Barrett explained. "We want people to quickly understand fundamentals like healing, or oxygen, or how to organize their gear. After all, if they get those things intuitively there’s much more room for tactical thinking and creativity. You know, it's our job to create the fun and the fantasy, not the busy work and tedium."</p><p dir="ltr">As you'd expect from an entry in this genre, Marathon players can expect to face some stiff resistance when they're out in the field. Teams of three will battle each other and powerful NPCs in the wild, and if you die, you'll lose all of the loot that you acquired from your expedition.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">In his hands-on preview of Marathon</a>, GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain commented on how the gameplay feels excellent, but the experience could leave a lot to be desired.</p><p dir="ltr">"After around eight hours of gameplay where I faced off against developers, content creators, and members of the press, I left Bungie's Bellevue studio keen to play more of its high-stakes PvPvE multiplayer game. And at the same time, I couldn't deny that I had serious concerns about the experience that its compulsive gameplay loop is couched within," Hussain said "Putting it plainly, I'm worried Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue."</p><p dir="ltr">Another feature of Marathon that might be a hard sell is its seasonal model, as while players will be able to amass a sizable arsenal with successful extractions, each new season will reset all Runners back to square one. The seasonal reset will add new zones, weapons, events, and stories, but losing your loot might be a bitter pill to swallow.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Marathon_Runners">Marathon Runners</h2><p dir="ltr">Marathon is a focused PvP game from Bungie--one in which players can play solo or with up to two other players joining them. As a Runner, you'll be venturing out into the wilds of Tau Ceti IV as you compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving zones. You'll be running into some not-so-friendly fire while out in the field, but thanks to the cloning technologies mastered in 2850, you'll be able to shrug off death, as shifting your consciousness between bodies is a part of everyday Runner life. Speaking of Runners, there'll be six distinct classes to choose from, and details on four of them have been revealed. Each Runner is equipped with a Prime and Tactical ability, as well as two Traits to complement specific playstyles.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Locus">Locus</h3><p dir="ltr">The soldiers of Marathon, Locus

dir="ltr" id="Marathon_is_a_multiplayer_only_game">Marathon is a multiplayer-only game</h2><p dir="ltr">While Marathon won't have a single-player mode, Barrett added that the game is being built with the PvP experience as the "foundation" of this game. That means that you can expect a narrative and a "rich, immersive world" according to the game director. "Our design philosophy here is to have players affect the story of the world through their choices and their actions. This approach also lets us shape the overall narrative direction of the game experience while giving players a direct sense of agency and power."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie says that it's creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold across a world full of persistent and evolving zones. That might mean that players cross paths and engage in a firefight against each other for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while fending off hostile AI-controlled enemies. The reveal stream did confirm that players will be able to switch squad autofill off and play as a solo Runner, if you're up to the challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the developer, it's also working on ideas that will see tangible changes across the game world. One such example given is that a crew could discover a hidden artifact that opens a new area of the map for all players to explore, with such discoveries being available during every season of Marathon.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_Marathon_a_sequel_to_the_original_trilogy_">Is Marathon a sequel to the original trilogy?</h2><p dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, Bungie is offering a vague answer to Marathon's place in the established timeline. Game director Christopher Barrett has described the game as being "not a direct sequel to the originals, but something that certainly belongs in the same universe."</p>

<p>According to a new report, Nintendo Switch 2 units manufactured in China will face a 145% US import tariff.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2s-from-china-could-face-145-us-tariff">Nintendo Switch 2s From China Could Face 145% US Tariff</h2>



<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Asia</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywikr/chinamade_nintendo_switch_2_in_line_for_145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zukhov-74</a>) reports that the Nintendo Switch 2 and other game consoles manufactured in China will fall victim to “the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.” They recently reviewed an “internal assessment memo” from a “major Apple and Nintendo supplier,” and things don’t seem bright for Nintendo’s upcoming console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memo states that game consoles manufactured in China will still face the 145% US import tariff for goods made in China. This means the Nintendo Switch 2s from China are “in line for a massive hit.” This could be one reason why the company decided to delay pre-orders, as it wanted to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assess the potential impact</a>” of the tariffs on the US market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that a significant chunk of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles “are made in China” and a “relatively small proportion made in Vietnam.” Hence, it will be hard for the company to manoeuvre through such circumstances. This might also explain why pre-orders for the upcoming console have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed in Canada</a> at the last minute.&nbsp;However, there’s no official word from Nintendo at the moment.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.

Amazon clearly got the memo because a bunch of solid bundles just dropped , including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> and Paldean Fates. If you’ve been telling yourself you’re just buying “a few packs for the kids,” this is your moment to stock up and pretend it’s not for you. I’m not judging. I’m doing the same thing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Catch Surging Sparks, Journey Together and Paldean Fates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to point out the Mass Effect statues in the IGN Store, because apparently my bookshelf wasn’t crowded enough with plastic space heroes. Commander Shepard and crew are up for pre-order, and yes, I already added Jack to my cart because I enjoy chaos. There’s also a Humble Bundle packed with narrative indies that scream “you have emotions, deal with them.” All in all, it’s a good day to make impulsive but justifiable purchases.</p><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls. Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection comes with six packs, a full-art promo, and a display sheet that’s more elaborate than it needs to be — in a good way. It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><p id="mass-effect-merchandise"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mass Effect Merchandise">Mass Effect Merchandise</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218608"><div id="218608" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect Merchandise</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think anyone who's replayed Mass Effect more than once knows exactly why these statues are tempting. I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf. If you're still quoting Garrus unironically, these are for you.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-pa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Pa"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218609"><div id="218609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates is priced a double MSRP, but it's also very hard to come by in 2025. I grabbed it because the baby shiny sub-set is awesome, but if you just want to grab the single cards from this set, it might actually save you money.</p></div><p id="fellow-traveller-publisher-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle">Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218610"><div id="218610" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity One Tree Planted</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle has some of the better narrative indies from the last few years. I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond. It’s a strong lineup if you like character-driven games and don’t mind occasionally being emotionally wrecked by minimalist storytelling.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218611"><div id="218611" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards <em>and</em> a bunch of gear you probably won’t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs. It’s a solid option if you like having a little structure with your chaos.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218612"><div id="218612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I hesitated on this one, then immediately remembered it includes 18 booster packs and a playmat. It’s definitely a big spend, but if you’ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that’s the right way to approach it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218613"><div id="218613" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Shining Fates Pikachu V mostly because I never actually opened it when it first dropped, and now seemed like a good excuse. Four booster packs, a Pikachu promo, and the oversized card that ends up somewhere near your desk — standard stuff, but still a nice throwback if you missed it the first time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <p>Much coverage of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> has compared the Firaxis 4X to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s 2021 release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humankind">Humankind</a>. As our dirty turncoat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> columnist Sin Vega briefly explores in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">her review for Eurogamer</a>, the game's Age structure, which hands you a new culture at intervals in each campaign, is reminiscent of Humankind's Era transitions.</p>
<p>Developers Firaxis have elsewhere observed that the impression of Civ cribbing notes from Humankind is an unfortunate coincidence. According to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/gaming/interview-civilization-7-almost-scrapped-its-iconic-settler-start-but-the-team-couldn-t-let-it-go/ar-AA1pwT01">an interview</a> with executive producer Dennis Shirk last year, the Civ 7 team came up with the concept on their own, pitching it to parent company 2K Games mere days after Amplitude unveiled Humankind. It's also, of course, worth reiterating that as a historical 4X, Humankind takes plenty of cues from older Civilizations. Still, Amplitude co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis was tickled pink when he saw Humankind cited in Civ 7 reviews. "That was probably the best compliment I ever got when I read some of these articles on Civ 7," he told me during an interview about Amplitude's forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a>, adding "I did not see that coming, to be frank."</p> <!--more-->
<p>While they're obviously competitors, and have never done any kind of formal collaboration, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude and Firaxis largely get on and are enthused by each other's work. "Sometimes we have conventions where we meet some programmers, some designers, we chat, and it's always cool, because it's always very good stuff," he told me, when I asked if the two teams had ever gotten together to bandy around features. "But we could see from a while ago that already they were following [our work]. And it was very exciting for us, being much smaller at the time, and still is today. I mean, Firaxis was, in many ways, the reason for me to become a designer, originally. So when these people look at my games, it's very surprising."</p>
<p>Being compared to Civilization can be tricky, of course, in terms of managing the expectations of players and publishers. The 4X is fundamentally a "niche" genre, de Waubert de Genlis argued, and few specimens beside Civ are capable of <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report">shifting millions before launch</a>. Amplitude's games tend to have a "small bump" at first, he said, gathering a healthy following over the coming months.</p>
<p>"Basically Civilization is like 16 or 17 million players on Civ 6, I think," he spelled out. "Then most of our 4Xs are around 2 million-ish, Humankind is at 3.5 million. So it's big, but still far away from the 17 million. And then if you look at the other 4Xs that are not Amplitude or not Civ, the best ones would be... I'd say it depends if you take Paradox as [the same kind of] 4X or not, because they're real time. If you take turn-based 4X, very quickly you go down to the very small numbers. So it is difficult."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude have never felt pressured to out-perform Civilization - even from Humankind publisher Sega, their parent company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sell-off-studio-behind-endless-legend-and-humankind-as-part-of-restructuring-but-it-goes-to-the-original-owners">until November last year</a>. "Sega were not really telling us, you know, we had to be Civilization because, you know, it's a 25 year franchise, or more, maybe 30 year franchise," he said. "And you can't overnight become Civilization."</p>
<p>Whether they originate from Civ or a smaller, feisty Civlike, I'm keen to see more Age or Era-style mechanics in strategy games. Back in 2021, Nate Crowley (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humankind-pc-review">called jumping Eras "possibly Humankind's greatest strength"</a>, allowing the player to switch rails and transform, say, a culture greased by gold into one fuelled by research. "This on-the-fly redefinition of your entire gameplan, and the fact that it's a necessity rather than an option, is a masterstroke," he wrote. "The more I play, the more fundamentally brilliant a mechanic I realise it is, and on this front at least, I don't feel like a dick in saying Humankind blows Civ out of the water."</p>
<p>I'm not sure Civ 7 players are as keen about the implementation of Ages. Here is another chunk from traitorous opportunist Sin's Eurogamer review: "The first two ages close with escalating crises that force you to choose negative modifiers (evil doppelgangers of social policies, which are unlocked with culture instead of science) until the act break. It's a move towards narrative - an unpredictable challenge to make the game - and you - less rote. In practice, they're either irrelevant or deeply irritating."</p>
<p>The broad thinking behind Eras and Ages is to keep breaking players out of their ruts over the course of a mammoth campaign. I think that's a noble aim, even if the execution is muddled. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is trying something similar with the tidefall mechanic, which peels back the ocean at intervals to reveal new navigable areas. You can read more about that in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2-is-everything-i-love-about-2014s-best-4x-but-on-a-map-thats-constantly-changing">Endless Legend 2 hands-on</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare suffered from friction between its Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams, a former developer has claimed. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Dragon Age creator and former lead writer David Gaider has discussed his experiences at the studio prior to his departure in 2016, and said that staff working on the studio's two biggest franchises "didn't get along".
</p>
<p>
This was something Gaider said he experienced personally when he moved across to join the main Mass Effect team as they worked on the ill-fated Anthem, after completing work on the original Mass Effect trilogy.
</p>
<p>
"For a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lmqqa5tm4s2p">Gaider wrote</a>. "Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn't get along.
</p>
<p>
"The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn't really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the [Anthem] team. The team didn't want me there. At all."
</p>
<p>
Gaider says he had been specifically asked by BioWare management to write a science fantasy story for Anthem, after the project had initially been concepted as a "hard sci-fi setting" akin to Aliens. And while Gaider says he was just following orders, his new colleagues were seemingly unaware of why he was writing something they thought was "too Dragon Age".
</p>
<p>
"I kept getting feedback about how it was 'too Dragon Age' and how everything I wrote or planned was 'too Dragon Age'... the implication being that *anything* like Dragon Age was bad," Gaider continued. "And yet this was a team where I was required to accept and act on all feedback, so I ended up iterating CONSTANTLY."
</p>
<p>
"I won't go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn't want to make an RPG. Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I'd need to actually do that."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Gaider departed BioWare after 17 years following a failed attempt to bargain for a creative director position on another project after Anthem, and some "blunter words" on 
the likelihood of him having success outside the company if he did quit.
</p>
<p>
"I had no idea where I was going to go or what I was going to do, but I wanted OUT," Gaider concluded.
</p>
<p>
Since departing BioWare, Gaider has gone on to developer Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical at new outfit Summerfall Studios, which launched to a generally positive response in 2023. The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creators-stray-gods-studio-unveils-demonic-deckbuilder-malys">next project will be a demonic deckbuilder called Malys</a>.
</p>
<p>
BioWare continued work on Anthem for several years, though the project ultimately launched as a critical and commercial failure. The studio subsequently released the well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> in 2021, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which garnered positive reviews but lacklustre sales. 
</p>
<p>
A newly-slimmed down BioWare is now working solely on the next Mass Effect, first announced back in December 2020.

            <p>Cinemas have begun playing a short video ahead of A Minecraft Movie screenings, asking viewers to refrain from hurling their popcorn everywhere, and to be kind and respectful to others.</p>
<p>If you are wondering why this is necessary, it is because a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when Jack Black's character Steve shouts "chicken jockey"</a>, as Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken.</p>
<p>While this trend perhaps started off as a bit of fun, it has quickly become increasingly disruptive, with one absolute idiot even bringing a live chicken into the cinema.</p>

			<p>The STALKER 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultra Plus Graphics mod</a> significantly improves the game's visuals without completely butchering performance, as highlighted by a new comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video put together by MxBenchmarkPC puts the vanilla and modded game running side by side, highlighting the massive visual enhancements brought by improved Lumen GI, Reflections and Ambient Occlusion, increased Lumen draw distance for indirect lighting, improved overall shadow quality and ambient occlusion in vegetation, increased LOD distance for vegetation and geometry and more. While these enhancements obviously impact performance, the drop is not as massive as one might have expected, as the game still manages to run in the 50/60 FPS range at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode on an RTX 5080 without Frame Generation.</p>

<p>STALKER 2 launched late last year on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S after a few delays. The game is a worthy successor to the original in every regard, offering an engaging experience that can be more than challenging at times, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

            <p>A modder for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> has pared back the fighting game to its bare essentials by removing most of its flashy new features, in an effort to "get us back to [Tekken 5] days." The mod is called "Good Ass Tekken" and it basically turns the game into a good-looking remake of older versions. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can see the mod in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jXqt5DSpQg">this video</a> of bad blood inheritor Devil Jin fighting lip-licking Russian slimeball Dragunov. The mod removes the heat bar, the rage state, armoured moves, and tracking attacks. Which is, uh, more or less everything that makes Tekken 8 distinct from its ancestors (and slightly angrier). </p>
<p>Rage, for example, is a glowing red state that you enter on low health, which allows you to bust out a powerful "rage drive" or "rage art" - often a means of regaining some momentum when you're on the ropes. The heat bar is an even newer feature, added in Tekken 8, which lets you chip away at an opponent's health even when they block, among other advantages and uses.</p>
<p>These aggressive fist-augmenting tricks are designed to encourage players to push their opponents (you can read how it works in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>). But not all players seem to be enjoying the resultant pummelings, which can result in quicker fights where one mistake means the match is lost. The mod's maker, "KulaGGin", called the mod's return to classical fighting "how I see real Tekken". The modder also wants to increase the distance players can backdash "for better footsies", make launching attacks reliably unsafe when you whiff, and dial back the ridiculous damage you can currently do with combos. </p>
<p>If you're sold, you can download the mod on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tTMZHRPQvE">Fight Club Discord</a>, as noted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-8-fanmade-mod-is-working-to-remove-some-of-the-games-more-polarizing-elements/">Automaton</a>, who first spotted it. To the unTekkened eye, the above brawl between Devil Jin and Dragunov may simply look like more fighting game co-biffery. But to anyone that's played the latest game's onslaught of flashing body parts, it is noticeably clean. A Tekken for purists. </p>
<p>Me? I like the rage state - it's my "smash glass in case of bear" button. And armour moves (which let you absorb a hit as you attack) grant players at least one panicky option if things are going terribly. I would miss them if they were gone. But I could certainly see a "no frills" mode like this being appealing to more grizzled Tekkenistas.</p>
<p>At least it doesn't make the game more like Tekken 4, a game that was so stressful to develop it reportedly caused the game's director to lose <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-hair-on-the-right-side-of-my-body-fell-out-how-tekken-nearly-broke-its-designer-from-stress">all the hair on the right side of his body</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
US president Donald Trump has effectively backtracked on the tariff exemptions announced last Friday which indicated that some electronics, like PCs, would escape the country's 145 percent levy on Chinese goods.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Trump said that "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'" and that "there was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday" (thanks, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62z54gwd22o">BBC News</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Chinese electrical goods would simply now be placed in "a different tariff bucket", Trump continued, concluding that National Security Tarriff Investigations would be reviewing "the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN".
</p>
<p>
US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told ABC News that a separate "semiconductor tariff" was now planned - exact details of which are yet to be determined. 
</p>
<p>"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels, we need to have these things made in America," Lutnick <a href="https://twitter.com/howardlutnick/status/1911439638062842356">said</a>. "We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us."</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamieson-greer-trade-representative-trump-face-the-nation-transcript-04-13-2025/">CBS News</a>, US trade representative Jamieson Greer confirmed this semiconductor tariff meant Chinese electrical goods had therefore been given something that was "not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it."
</p>
<p>
"It's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring," Greer continued. "They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs."
</p>
<p>There's no detail yet on when this semiconductor tariff may be introduced, or by how much it will impact prices.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pcs-will-be-exempt-from-trumps-tariffs-but-consoles-will-not">the expectation was that PCs would escape Trump's tariffs, even if consoles such as Nintendo's incoming Switch 2 would not</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ahead of the US' so-called 'Liberation Day', <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo had already begun stockpiling Switch 2 consoles in the US, and directed the vast majority of its non-Chinese manufacturing output to the country</a>. Many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> consoles set to be sold in the US will now have been made in Vietnam - a country which also initially had tariffs introduced, only for them to be paused.</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony announced it had raised the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition price</a> in the UK and mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's according to game director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, speaking during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, who said the upcoming sequel will have a feature that allows players to skip boss battles if they prove to be too difficult.</p>

<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a>, who translated, explained on social media.</p>
<p>According to Genki_JPN, if players choose to clear any of Death Stranding 2's bosses this way, they will still receive information about the foe, which will be presented "like a novel" via an image and text descriptions.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set for release on 26th June, and includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">a new character that looks remarkably like Metal Gear Solid's Snake</a>. This was revealed during the game's SXSW 2025 showcase earlier in March.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, Kojima Productions shared several new snippets of footage for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">including a look at the upcoming game's very realistic photo mode and Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion, Dollman</a>. As you would expect from a Kojima game, it all looks suitably bizarre.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this month it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">Death Stranding's live-action movie adaptation had found its writer and director</a> in the form of A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 footage was shared online, providing a better look at how the demanding open-world by CD Projekt Red runs and looks on the next-generation Nintendo system in handheld mode.</p>
<p>The footage, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deck Wizard</a>, shows the game running on the system in Performance Mode, which targets 40 FPS. While there are some visible frame rate drops at times, which are likely to be addressed in the launch version, the game really seems to run great on Nintendo Switch 2 while also sporting great image quality, showing how the Nintendo system is more than capable of delivering a better experience than what can be achieved on Steam Deck.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 First Look Hands-On Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Exx79Ikf6c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch as the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game as well as the Phantom Liberty expansion. The retail version of the game will also be playable without any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-40-fps-docked/">additional download</a>, as both the base game and expansion are included in the 64 GB big cart the game will ship onto.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition launches on June 5th on Nintendo Switch 2 worldwide. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, however, is only available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Verdansk is breathing new life into Call of Duty Warzone, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The internet had declared Activision’s now five year-old battle royale “cooked” before the nostalgia-fueled Verdansk turned things around. Now, the internet has declared Warzone “back.” Didn't Activision nuke Verdansk? It doesn't seem to matter, as lapsed players who fondly remember Warzone as their lockdown game are returning to the map that started it all, and those who stuck with the game through thick and thin over the past five years are saying Warzone is more fun now than it’s been since it exploded onto the scene in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This back-to-basics gameplay experience was a deliberate design decision on the part of developers Raven and Beenox. Pete Actipis, game director on Warzone at Raven, and Etienne Pouliot, creative director at Beenox, both worked on the multi-studio effort to bring Warzone back. In this sweeping interview with IGN, the pair discuss how they went about it, the success of Verdansk’s Casual mode, reveal whether they considered limiting operator skins to mil-sim for a more 2020 feel, and answer the crucial question: is Verdansk here to stay?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I imagine I fit the typical profile, which is someone who played a lot of Warzone during lockdown and was enticed back by the return of Verdansk. Was that the point of all this, to get lapsed Warzone fans back in the game? And now it’s been out for a while, is that what you’re seeing happening?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We hit our fifth year anniversary for Warzone and we wanted to bring back Verdansk for quite some time now. It just felt like the right timing. When we were talking about bringing it back, it wasn't just bringing back the map. It was more than that. Over the last five years we have learned a lot, experimented with a lot. The one thing you can say about Warzone, it's constantly changing for good or for bad. It is something that we just try to keep evolving. And we listen to the players and we take some shots and sometimes they land, sometimes they don't. But when we talked about bringing Verdansk back, it was very important for us to bring back a nostalgic moment in time as best as we could and be respectful of that as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Covid it was just a special time in the world, it was crazy, it was something that we all experienced together individually, but Warzone created this social experience in a way that was pretty new to Call of Duty. So we wanted to pay homage to that as best as we could. We looked at every single component of what made Warzone special back in 2020 and we wanted to really treat it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll let Etienne talk about the map side of it, but at least on the gameplay side, we wanted to make sure that we looked at all the design principles and all the reasons that we added the things that we did back then, and are they still viable? Are those still fun mechanics and loops? And if we were to bring them back, we wanted to make sure we did it with the right intent. And that's why I think it's stuck around so well. Post-launch, right now it's getting great feedback from the community. They seem to really be enjoying it. We're players too, so we wanted to build an experience that we fell in love with back in 2020. So yeah, it's worked out. We're really careful about what we do to the game right now because we hit that sweet spot of that nostalgia bit and people seem to be enjoying it. So we're pretty excited by it as players too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> We know that gaming in general goes pretty fast. Five years of Warzone just went by really, really fast, and we've tried so many things. But each day Verdansk was still in the discussion and in the bucket of ideas of, ‘oh we will need to return to that place someday.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was just not a matter of, 'oh we're going to port that thing toward that new engine or that new Call of Duty.' It was really more like, ‘let's bring the best version of Verdansk.’ So, just to be sure that we remade everything from the ground, the sky, the player visibility, the audio. There is a lot of stuff that we put a lot of energy in. And we see the result right now. We were playing the game and we were like, 'yeah, it feels great.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we were just eager to give it to the player. And the answer is really successful right now. So we are really, really happy. And just like Pete mentioned, I think it's only a beginning and we'll continue to challenge ourselves to see if we need to make some changes, improvements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The online sentiment does look positive right now, and you’ll know that the online sentiment across places like Reddit and social media has certainly not always been positive about Warzone. Is that something that you're seeing in the data? Are you seeing more people returning to play Warzone?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> It has been pretty successful, and I think you can tell in the experience, right? Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it. Like Etienne said, we recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We knew there was going to be a lot of new players or lapsed players, word of mouth of like, 'hey come check out Verdansk.' We added this Casual mode, which is doing really well for us. We wanted players to come in and re-experience it at their pace, or experience it for the first time in a safe way where they don't feel like they're getting sweated out or outplayed. We were very careful with crafting this experience this season, and the data is showing us that it's been really successful and we just hope to keep that momentum going into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, it's really impressive how much Call of Duty touches different players from all different backgrounds. We've seen that during the pandemic and we've seen that today. So it's really a privilege to work on that level of successful franchise. We have that approach of, we want as many players as we can. So having that Casual mode, having more quality of life, having more ways to have a stable, performant game is really important. Down the rest of that chapter and so for the rest of Warzone, how can we be a place to welcome new players and make sure that if you were there back then you will return to what you love?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Casual mode is where I’m playing right now as a lapsed player returning to Warzone. However, I am starting to see the sweats maybe looking at Casual mode and going, ‘we can have some fun here.’ You can tell when you're playing it when someone shouldn't be there, this is too easy for you. Are you seeing that internally?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> The whole spirit of the Casual mode was to give people that were scared about getting into a time commitment or a game commitment or a skill commitment with Warzone, but do it on their terms. The nice thing about this is, this is the first rev of it. It just went live and we're going to look at the data, we're going to evolve it over time to make sure it retains the design principles and spirit that we wanted it to have. So if we see sweats come in there wrecking the whole server, then we will have to come up with plans against that. It's still pretty new right now. I think it's still giving players what they need in it right now, and we'll just keep monitoring and involving it. But it's a fun mode. I can't lie - I enjoy playing it myself and I can play with people that never played Call of Duty before. It's a little less intimidating that way, and I think that's what makes it so appealing for myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And you get the sense of learning the tension of the game. It's not just you get thrown away and after that you go to the Gulag and that's it, it's done. Internally we have a lot of great players, and maybe we call them 'demon players.' It's funny to just have those discussions with them about the game and how they see it, how they approach it. And on my side, me I'm more on the downfall skill player - I was great before and now I'm just getting worse and worse. So I think it's really important to just have those conversations with those great players and see how we can tweak that experience in a way that everyone gets something out of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I'm pretty sure that we have a lot of players who are going to get inside ranked down the road of BR. So I see that as a more broad, different mode to just engaging depending on your skillset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Yeah, I guess when ranked starts, the sweats will probably gravitate towards that and they'll have had their fun. I want to talk to you about Call of Duty lore. I remember reporting on Warzone and how everything became unified and all the different brands became mashed together in a timeline. And I remember in 2021 you blew Verdansk up, and it was publicly said: </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-no-return-new-map"><strong>‘this is never coming back.’</strong></a><strong> And I believed it! So are we just supposed to go, ‘you know what, actually it doesn't really matter, it's about the fun.’ Or have you come up with a story explanation for how we're back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> I don't want to spoil any sort of narrative story bits. And that's not confirming nor denying either way. It's just, what we wanted to do for this moment was take a pause from any sort of timelines or anything like that and just say, 'look, let's just celebrate this moment in time and just have a great time with it.' If and when we introduce a narrative we may or may not figure out if we have to resolve this. But again, I'm not trying to spoil anything or say or mislead in any direction. But this season's launch was just, let's have a fun moment and go back to the nostalgic bits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And I don't know if you've seen some clips around it, but all I can say is that there is stuff in the map that I'm pretty sure that players who know the map will definitely find some bits of information. And after that they can figure it out. But at the same time it's important to acknowledge some of the historical moments of five years of Warzone. So Verdansk is part of that five year celebration.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: A lot of people are wondering, is Verdansk here to stay? Is it like a celebration, one-shot type thing that you're doing, or is this something that players can expect longer term and you iterate on it on that basis?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We brought Verdansk back for a reason. It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it. So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there. So again, no confirmation or anything on the strategy on the maps moving forward, but we love Verdansk. It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve seen players go back to unlock Price’s ghillie suit from Modern Warfare 2 now Verdansk is back. Have you seen this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, I've seen that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: People are asking each other how to get it again, going back to Modern Warfare 2 or even buying it to unlock the ghillie suit.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> It's really interesting how the community is engaging with the game. We have the chance of having all the different operators from Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, and all the different games. It's something that I really love from the game, is that all the different battle passes and Blackcell, I can change every time my loadout and my operator. And sometimes I even use really, really old weapons that maybe are not meta, but I have the feeling that I'm back, I'm there the way I want to play. So I'm pretty sure a lot of people are just using all the different content we gave them across all those years and having fun right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> On launch day I went back and picked an old Ghost costume that looked very similar to the launch trailer versions. I'm like, 'okay, I'm back in it too.' That's part of the fun, picking your operator and the look and trying to relive that moment as you remember it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve been having old debates again about whether to play aggressive or just camp on a rooftop and snipe, or just hide, in the same old places. When you were thinking about bringing back the map, did you consider tweaking it in such a way to encourage certain gameplay types or gameplay styles, or did you want to recreate it as accurately as possible so the same gameplay styles in the same places would happen once again?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> We wanted to recreate those moments, but again, we've learned a lot. So just to give you a quick example: player visibility is really better right now than back then. Maybe people will remember Roze, but there were a lot of dark corners. That was an experience that a lot of people were not attracted by. So we've made slight adjustments like this to make sure it's fun for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And another thing is audio was really, really, really important for us. So just making sure that you understand from each corner where you're in this, where will be the enemy, and how you need to react. So again, just making sure that it's the best Verdansk version we will deliver. That was the goal and I think that we are on the right path to continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis: </strong>We also didn't want change too much because then it wouldn't be what you remembered in Verdansk. The map itself had a lot of that sandbox-y kind of like, 'do I want to play long range and go camp at the top of ATC Tower or the top of Stadium roof with a helicopter?' There was a lot of play potential, a lot of opportunities for close range, long range, you name it; great fighting in the woods areas north of Quarry, or south west of Hills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make that a reality we went back into the core experience and made sure we were able to pay those moments off. So we retuned the circle back the way it worked originally. So we allow these wild swings for these first and last circles so you can get more of these dynamic and crazy experiences where you're, the first part of the match you're playing in a dense area, maybe like Downtown, and then it ends somewhere where there's an opening, and you're like, ‘oh crap, I got to go hit my loadout again, let's go get some money so we can acquire a loadout so I can get more of a mid to long range weapon to be able to handle late game.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also made vehicles more impactful, so we had to remove things like the redeploy drone beacons and all the other fast travel mechanics, to make the rotations a little bit more difficult, which made you think of, ‘how do I want to move with my team and what kind of weapons do I need to carry and what sort of equipment do I carry?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of those things might look like individual things, but they all compound together to really form the experience. And so we were very careful. It was like, ‘what's the experience that we really want to go after when we brought back Verdansk?’ So then that started peeling back the onion of, ‘okay, we have to change this, we should change this and this and this.’ And so all of it together as the sum of the parts of that beat that we were going after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to get some insight into TTK (Time to Kill) and how you approached what you wanted to achieve there for Verdansk coming back. It feels shortened to me, but exactly what happened there, and why did you make the changes you made?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> Comparatively to last year, the Urzikstan year, it is a faster TTK. It's pretty equivalent - I don't know the exact numbers offhand - but the original experience and what we wanted to go back for now was make it more of a casual, friendly kind of, ‘if I'm not good at hitting straight shots, I have an opportunity, I'm not going to get destroyed every gun battle.’ There's also a lot more excitement of like, ‘oh, I have an opportunity to get a kill.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it is not like we're trying to remove skill from the game. There's still a lot of skill involved in this game, but it's approachable, which is the key difference there. And part of this was not only how do weapons handle, but then also how does your movement handle in response to that? Do I feel like I can engage in combat and get a bead on somebody and react to how someone's moving or get away from shots?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So movement and gunplay are very tied to the hip. And this is again the peeling onion approach. We like right now where the TTK sits. We will evaluate as the game progresses and see what our fans think. We're always evolving and we'll react appropriately based on that. But right now it seems like people are enjoying it. I know TTK is... some people either love it or they hate it. It depends on their player type. It's okay to be opinionated. That's cool! We're just trying to do what's best for the community at large.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: My first Verdansk match back I was in the plane and there were four of us getting ready to jump out, and one of the players was a giant Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and the other was this fairy thing. I was like, 'this is not how Warzone was back in lockdown.' Was that on your minds as you were thinking of rekindling the feeling exactly as it was back then, when some of these crazy skins weren't so prevalent in the game? Did you ever think at any point that actually, just for the relaunch, at least at the start, we're going to limit it to mil-sim [military simulation] stuff, or some of the stuff that people remembered? Or was that just never a consideration for you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We talked about everything. We left no stone unturned really. But we wanted to create the best version of Verdansk possible. And part of that is just understanding the reality of where we're at. We're in a Black Ops 6 year. So at the end of the day we still are dealing with differences in loadouts and weaponry and even operators. We tried to pay homage and pay off the spirit of that nostalgic experience as best as possible. But our intent was never to be a facsimile of that old experience. It was supposed to be the best version of Verdansk and Warzone to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that was respecting players’ purchases. As a player, I've invested X amount of time, money, whatever it is, and this is who I like to play with. Okay, we could have restricted weapons and operators, but then it creates this big friction moment for players who are like, 'I just want to play the game. I want to have fun in my mode.' I know some players might have more of a stance on it, like, ‘I want it to be pure mil-sim.’ But the spirit was to make it welcoming for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> I remember sometime with my friend, we were like, 'yeah, today we all buy a different turtle and we wanted to be the four turtles winning a match. It was pretty crazy. So I think just having those possibilities in front of the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mil-sim - one of my friends is really hardcore, he plays only with one attachment. That's his rule. Because he feels that it's cheating. He's like, 'no, it's not a usable case of a weapon. So I will only use one.' And I'm like, ‘okay man, if you want to do it, but I will never go toward that path.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think that just having all those different possibilities so you can engage the way you want. And after that, like Pete just mentioned, I think that it's really important for us to respect all the time and money you spend in the game and making sure it's still worth it for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your friend must be very good at Call of Duty if they can get by with just one attachment.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, it's really incredible how many people I've seen through all the years that they have such a great skill that from my point of view I'm like, ‘hey, are you using something else that I'm not aware of?’ But yeah, you're a true player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: That does lead me on to one of the final questions I wanted to ask. Activision has increased communication around cheating in Warzone and made changes recently, like with crossplay. But are you seeing any improvements now with Verdansk coming back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> To be honest with you, that's not our area of expertise, the whole cheating side. I would defer those questions to the Ricochet team and how that stuff has been working out. Anecdotally, the games have been feeling good. I don't feel like I'm getting cheated on. I think that's even what our streamers are saying. But again, that's not really a data point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And something just to add, it's just that it's always something on top of our mind. So we're just making sure that the right person speaks with the right team and makes sure that we put a lot of effort. Because everything we saw from the community, it's important for us too. So just making sure that yeah, we will put all the energy needed to prevail and making sure the game is at the right condition that we want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have any message to the community about your plans for Warzone in 2025 now that you've gotten to a place where there's positive sentiment? What can players expect?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> First of all, thank you for either coming back or continuing with us on this Warzone journey. We are players too and we strive to make the game as good as possible. The launch of Verdansk, the simplification of our systems and our mechanics and just the flow, is the beginning. We're going to cultivate the game and we're pretty excited for our roadmap moving forward. We've got some great surprises that I'm not going to spoil today in store, but we hear the community and we want feedback. We listen. We take all opinions. We have our own, and we like hearing what the players think and feel. The passion is really important for us because that fuels us. We're excited to continue on with our journey here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, totally. The first thing is just to thank all the players for all the love. And even the bad things. I think it's important to know both sides of the community. We're all passionate, and we have a lot of great ideas that are coming down the path. Warzone has so much room to continue to grow and opportunity in front of us. So I just hope that with all the different players we will get to those moments, and after that they will stick as memories for them for quite a long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-that%E2%80%99s-full-of-surprises.1163544/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the first things that struck me when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> is just how complicated the control scheme can get. There’s button combos and sequences that feel more like what you’d expect of a fighting game than of an action RPG, and the four boss battles we tried demonstrated such a variety of individual game mechanics beyond the typical fare. Heck, there’s some Spider-Man style web-swinging thrown in for one of them!</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn1igh_q0Wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Crimson Desert is an interesting game project in its own right. Originally thought of as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, it’s morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with that oh so familiar “if you can see it, you can go there” sensibility to the huge world that they’ve constructed.</p>


<p>It does, however, feel rather generic in a number of ways. The continent of Pywel is beset by war between two factions, the warmongering Black Bears and the peace-seeking Greymanes. Naturally you’re aligned with the latter faction, playing as their leader, Kliff, whose most immediately distinctive characteristic is having some blue stripes down one side of his face.</p>
<p>The other quite striking characteristic from playing the game’s opening battle sequence should be how full of holes he is, after being resoundingly beaten and stabbed by the Black Bears leader Myudrin. It’s alright, though. He gets better again, and we jumped ahead to sample those four main boss battles.</p>


<p>The Staglord is certainly the most conventional, a big, powerful warlord who leaps and charges to close the gap to you before dishing out hefty sword attacks that will send you flying if they land. It’s a fight where I came out ahead despite feeling that I was constantly losing – and truth be told, I did have to rely on the healthy stocks of restorative Veal Burgers that Pearl Abyss had pre-filled Kilff’s pockets with.</p>
<p>Even here, the complexity of the game’s combat controls was clear to see. There’s naturally light and heavy attacks, parrying and countering, and you need to be aware of your snail-like stamina meter on screen, but anything beyond the basics needs button combos. Pairs of face buttons pressed together pull of things like a sweeping reverse slash, trigger a flurry attack to deal a rapid sequence of blows, and more.</p>
<p>I needed to rely on more of these extended techniques for the other boss battles. Fighting Hexe Marie, a witch who can turn into a murder of crows and summon pot-headed automatons to swarm you, brought plenty of other challenges, and opportunities to master some other techniques. The key to defeating her was really about bringing explosive arrows to the party, helping to blast her minions into chunks of crockery.</p>

<p>What I didn’t quite get a hang of, through the barrage of inputs and combos I needed to learn, was force shoving Kliff up into the air, triggering his Pecision Focus slow-mo ability, and then unleashing a rapid flurry of arrows all together. It looks great in the gameplay tutorials I saw, but I didn’t really manage to pull it off myself.</p>
<p>Not even at the second attempt, when facing the Reed Devil, a very fast and very elusive masked enemy that you fight in the middle of a field of wheat. Once again, I was getting slapped around by a boss, though this time, his weakness was on clear display with a series of protective totems to try and take out.</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed that, where the Staglord came to a timely demise, Hexe-Marie and Reed Devil leant into the kind of comic book defeats that let them slink away to fight another day. There’s some great action in the mini cutscenes that mark the switch between health bars for each boss, the compliments the over-the-top combat abilities nicely, not to mention the flashy particle effects that compliment so many attacks. It’s like you’re fighting with a Catherine Wheel in hand instead of a large sword, as a shower of sparks is unleashed around you.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting boss, albeit the one that we spent the least time with, was against Queen Stoneback Crab. This rock-covered hill of a creature brings in a touch of the Shadow of the Colossus, as you have to clamber up her back as she bucks and rears to try and fling you into the sky –&nbsp;which can easily lead to your death from falling, if you forget or don’t know the button to press to start gliding back down with the Crow’s Wing ability.</p>
<p>You’re searching for a handful of silvery patches to smash and then stab through to release a poisonous affectation that is altering her behaviour, and eventually give you the opening to Spider-Man grapple to her, swing yourself around and come smashing down on a pile of pots at the top of her shell.</p>
<p>We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the United States could increase significantly, according to a supplier.</p>
<p>An internal assessment memo from a major unnamed Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns">Nikkei Asia</a> highlights how game consoles made in China <a href="https://wccftech.com/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-have-reportedly-excluded-pc-smartphone-imports/">are still subject to a 145% tariff </a>in the United States, which means that the Nintendo Switch 2, which is primarily made in China, is in line for a significant price increase over the announced launch price of $449.99. The PlayStation 5 is also primarily made in China, so a price hike in the United States is also expected for Sony's system, which has already seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">a price increase</a> in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>As Nikkei Asia pointed out in today's report, the Nintendo Switch 2 is also being produced in Vietnam.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/"> Last week</a>, we learned that Hosiden Corp shipped quite a few units to the United States last February, more than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. Judging from today's report, however, it seems more and more unlikely that the number of units produced in Vietnam will be enough to prevent the system's price from increasing, given the vast majority of units are still produced in China.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for China, where the console has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely</a>. You can learn more about the system by checking out Nathan's<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/"> hands-on impressions.</a></p>

<p>Schedule 1 players have been warned about malware in some of the game’s most popular mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/certain-schedule-1-mods-confirmed-to-contain-trojan-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, the official Schedule 1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jx6vl8/urgent_psa_malware_found_in_2_popular_schedule_1/?share_id=AvZ_njVPdRrRpo99mWvCM&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has released an “URGENT PSA” for its members, bringing their attention to malware found in popular mods. Players have been advised to uninstall these mods instantly, or they could get in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-mods-that-were-found-with-malware">Schedule 1 Mods That Were Found with Malware</h2>



<p>The first Schedule 1 Mod found with malware is Froggyp1’s “Increased Stack Size Limit.” The subreddit moderator has confirmed that the original creator has sold their account, and the new owner has introduced a version “which is VERIFIED to be a trojan.” The owner has been banned, and their malicious uploads removed; however, players should look through their files to be sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Schedule 1 mod in question is “Backpack Mod Reupload,” and this time, even NexusMods have confirmed that it is malware. After deleting the files and changing their passwords, players can take two suggested actions: First, they can use reputable anti-virus or anti-malware software to search individual files for malware. The other way is to use online virus scanning services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creator of Schedule 1 has provided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a console port update</a> after imitations appeared on PlayStation.
