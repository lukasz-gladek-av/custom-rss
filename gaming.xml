            <p>The maker of cryptic block-seeding puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starseed-pilgrim">Starseed Pilgrim</a> has announced a new game in which you are invited to do the unspeakable and "kill gameplay". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-end-of-gameplay">The End Of Gameplay</a> will be an exploratory 2D platformer according to the tags on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3120040/The_End_of_Gameplay/">Steam page</a> but anyone who has played the work of creator Droqen might predict those labels to prove looser than a toddler's shoelace. Enjoyers of obscure and poetic wanderings in minimalist spaces will probably be happy with the trailer below.</p>

<p>The creator describes it as "like Starseed Pilgrim, but only all the parts that nobody told me they cared about". This is a strong pitch but in what direction I cannot tell. Starseed Pilgrim was a mysterious blockbuilding platformer released back in the hellsands of 2013, in which you had to plant various seeds and discover their effects to go... somewhere? I never quite got it, to be honest. But that's okay, I'm not alone.</p>
<p>"I think of Starseed Pilgrim as a game that is enjoyed, mostly, by indie game devs, and this new game is even more down that rabbithole," said Droqen in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/230980/view/506200344140710456">announcement post on Steam</a>. "You can tell from the title, it is about gameplay, it is something. If you want to kill gameplay too or you just want to bathe in the blood of its ending or you just want to watch in horror, maybe this game of a poem will be for you." </p>
<p>We at RPS regularly and viciously kill the <em>word</em> "gameplay" every time it appears, like a relentless weed in our garden of text (I am strongly restraining myself right now). But that's just a word, the visible tuft of a greater problem. The <em>concept</em> of gameplay remains stubborn, its roots spreading deep under the soil of the games industry like a vast and undefinable mycorrhizal network. It is this which Droqen seeks to destroy. This mission is a dangerous folly. I am interested to see how it goes. </p>
<p>"I wanted to release it to as few people as possible," said the dev about the new game, "but then I did that, and then I showed it to a few more people, and then a few more, and I started yelling <a href="https://bsky.app/search?q=from%3Adroqen.bsky.social+%22kill+gameplay%22">'kill gameplay'</a> on Bluesky. It got away from me..."</p>
<p>Sounds like one for Edwin, our resident ludopoet. It's also described as an anthology, continuing a long-running trend of indie creators shoving their short works into one compact package. Terry Cavanagh did this recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creator-of-dicey-dungeons-vvvvvv-and-super-hexagon-launches-a-big-freeware-collection">Terry's Other Games</a> and long ago Stephen "thecatamites" Gillmurphy released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thecatamites-commercial-collection-50-short-games">50 Short Games</a>. Then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a>, the combined effort of multiple developers. </p>
<p>While Starseed Pilgrim didn't do it for me, it was admired by Adam (RPS in peace) who was at a loss to describe the seed 'em up's appeal in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-starseed-pilgrim">his review</a>. "What to say about a game that would be better passed from hand to hand at bizarre conventions, residing on an unmarked disc with no readme.txt and no explanation?" he said. "I’d gladly forbid people from trying to explain what they’ve experienced to newcomers because the joy is in the discoveries."</p>
<p>The End Of Gameplay will be released on "the full flower moon in May". That's May 12th according to my googling of witchy moon phases. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has added another title to its Switch Online catalogue of games.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-sacred-stones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a> has been added for those of us with the Expansion Pack. It is available via the Game Boy Advance section.</p>

<p>"In a world of dragons and magic, you must always be ready for battle. Take advantage of the terrain and the weapon in your hand, and attack enemies either from afar using magic or up close with your sword. Each weapon has its own strength and weakness, so choose wisely when attacking your opponent, because you don't want to be caught off guard," reads the trailer's official blurb.</p>
<p>"Build the perfect army. Do you want a pegasus rider or a wyvern rider? An assassin or a rogue? Upgrade your troops to different classes, each with their own skills and weapons, and save the land from the forces of darkness!"</p>

These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-classic-game-boy-color-zelda-titles-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-online">games arrived on the service back in 2023</a>, but I am a fan so I am echoing Nintendo and suggesting you give these a go.</p>

			<p>NEXON has shared several updates on their upcoming co-op action RPG Vindictus: Defying Fate. <a href="https://wccftech.com/vindictus-defying-fate-is-a-new-upcoming-action-rpg-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in February 2024, the game is based on the fantasy IP of the popular free-to-play MMORPG. Following last year's Pre-Alpha Test, the developers have now scheduled a PC (Steam) Alpha Test for June. They have also shared the content that will be available for testing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>4 playable characters</li>
<li>Companion system: NPC companions that assist in combat</li>
<li>Combat: Single-player or multiplayer, depending on the content</li>
<li>Story and cutscenes: Includes Alpha Test version NPCs and story-related cutscenes</li>
<li>Growth system: Leveling, weapon crafting, Ability system, and more</li>
<li>Village and inventory system</li>
<li>Select cosmetic items</li>
<li>And more diverse content will also be available during the test</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>NEXON also talked about some of the improvements made to Vindictus: Defying Fate following the Pre-Alpha feedback. Characters will now be able to climb ladders and ride ziplines to reach certain places, as well as use grappling hooks to navigate the environment more quickly. Traps have also been introduced to make the experience more engaging.</p>
<p>Of course, combat remains the core aspect of the game. NEXON has added a so-called Special Action that can only be executed with precise timing. When performed successfully, it either triggers a Perfect Guard, blocking the attack entirely, or a Perfect Dodge, which flows into a powerful counterattack, depending on the character picked.</p>
<p>When a foe is staggered, players can execute a Fatal Action. This works by attacking the enemy, building up a stagger gauge. When that gauge is full, the enemy loses its stance for a brief moment, allowing players the opportunity to perform the Fatal Action and take it down. All the&nbsp;playable characters in the upcoming Alpha Test (Lann, Fiona, Karok, and Delia) will be equipped with a unique Fatal Action that is tailor-made for their combat style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vindictus: Defying Fate - Delia Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bjI40EMe5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just yesterday, NEXON released a new character trailer for Delia. You can watch it embedded right above. Vindictus: Defying Fate doesn't have a release date yet; it will launch on PC as well as consoles, although the console version may come out at a later date.</p>

            <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, has shared his thoughts on the shocking events from this week's episode.</p>
<p><strong>Please note, there will be major spoilers for The Last of Us below. </strong></p>

<figcaption>Eurogamer: The death of consoles is inevitable and I don't know how I feel about it.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipoW24t90fw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During the early hours of Monday morning for those of us here in the UK, the second episode of The Last of Us season two aired. It was a packed showing, with more infected than you can shake a stick at. But, even though the siege of Jackson was surely an suspenseful and emotionally impactful story beat, there is one moment in particular that has grabbed the hearts of viewers and torn them  into a million pieces - Joel's death.</p>
<p>As in The Last of Us Part 2, in the show Joel is killed with a golf club by Abby, a former Firefly seeking revenge for the death of her father.</p>
<p>In the season one finale,  Joel massacred the Fireflies in Salt Lake City in a bid to save Ellie, his surrogate daughter. And now, the time has come for him to face the consequences of those actions. Abby - played in the show by Kaitlyn Dever - arrives in Jackson with a group of fellow former Fireflies to even the score. And she does, beating Joel until finally dealing a killing strike to the neck with a golf club. It's a hard watch.</p>
<p>But, what is it like for Pascal and the rest of The Last of Us' cast and crew? "I'm in active denial," <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-shocker-kaitlyn-dever-bella-ramsey-on-set-exclusive-11717893">Pascal told EW</a>, following the episode's debut.</p>
<p>"I realise this more and more as I get older, I find myself slipping into denial that anything is over. I know that I'm forever bonded to so many members of the experience and just have to see them under different circumstances, but never will under the circumstances of playing Joel on The Last of Us.</p>
<p>"And, no, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it because it makes me sad."</p>
<p>But while it may make the actor sad, Pascal believes the fact that this narrative has affected and pained so many people is a "brilliant achievement of the storytelling".</p>
<p>"I have nothing but respect for the level of investment that people have in a video game or a TV show or movie or book. I experience that myself. I've flung books across the room because its impact is so profound on me and experiencing the story," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-joel-death-last-of-us-1236373640/">Pascal said</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The show has made a few tweaks to The Last of Us Part 2's narrative - for example having Dina on patrol with Joel that day, rather than his brother Tommy. Another change made by the showrunners was to have Bella Ramsey's Ellie drag herself over to Joel's dead body, an image that will stay with me for a long time to come. According to showrunner Craig Mazin, this moment was "in there from the very beginning, draft one". This is because Ellie at this moment also believes she is going to die.</p>
<p>"Ellie's been kicked in the ribs. She's clearly very injured. She has no reason to think she's going to survive," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-joel-dies-pedro-pascal-1236372785/">Mazin told Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"She's not crawling over there just to say goodbye. She's crawling over there so she could be with him in death. That's where she wants to be, and it's when she takes his hand. We've seen her do it before. Bella Ramsey, geez."</p>

			<p>How far will you go to help your family? Would you lend them some money? Help them to build a business to secure their future? Get exiled to a cursed town to turnaround a failing business while slowly dying? If you chose the last option, then you may have to check you have not transformed into Michi, the main character of weird and thoroughly charming Promise Mascot Agency.</p>
<p><iframe title="Promise Mascot Agency | Launch Trailer | Available Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEnZ9rafWng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Promise Mascot Agency is the latest from Kaizen Game Works, taking you to the deprived Japanese town of Kaso Machi, which is far from its heyday due to lack of investment and a corrupt mayor. Michi is sent here after a deal goes wrong and is tasked with restarting his family’s mascot agency which, as it turns out, has zero mascots. All that is available to him is a rundown love hotel and its manager Pinky, a giant finger mascot. Before we go on, you need to know that in this world mascots are not people in costumes, but actual people in their own right. So yes, your sidekick is a giant finger, and she is easily the best supporting character of 2025 so far. Pinky will pick you up when your down, call you out when you’re stupid, and plan the deaths of your enemies with glee. A real ride or die kind of finger, is our Pinky.</p>


<p>Despite all her strengths, Pinky is not a good mascot for events, but she knows where to find some. Kaso Machi is filled with out of work mascots who need jobs, and you need their expertise.</p>


<p>One of the highlights of Promise Mascot Agency is how the agency’s success ties in with the growth of Kaso Machi and helping the mascots realise their own dreams. When you first start out the town barely has any events going on that require a mascot, but as you make money you can reinvest into Kaso Machi to encourage more businesses to open, offering more opportunities for your mascots to work. Mascots won’t just come to you for nothing though. When you recruit a mascot, you’ll put together an offer for them to accept or decline, including providing time off, wage increases, and bonuses.</p>
<p>The core aspect of the game is to run the agency, and a lot of it you can do from the management menu. You will be notified of jobs mascots can take, be told when a mascot is taking time off, and get alerted to when a mascot needs help on a job. Mascots have a lot of dangers to face in their profession from ranging from small doors, to misshapen steps, exploding machines, and the vengeful spirits of the dead. If any of these threats appear, and the mascots cannot deal with them alone, you will be called in to help using Mascot Support Heroes.</p>

<p>Mascot Support Heroes are cards you can collect from around Kaso Machi, some being town residents that you help and others being cards you find while out exploring. Each card has its own stats, but the most important is attack power. The enemies of mascots have life bars and these need to be whittled away using the Mascot Support Heroes cards. It is a very simple minigame and much of the time you will get through with no issue.</p>
<p>Kaso Machi is a great location to explore while driving around in your little truck with Pinky as a guide. Many of the activities are based around collecting things or smashing things, though you can also clean shrines for benefits. Kaso Machi is a mess and there are rubbish bags everywhere, but with a truck upgrade you’ll be able to clean up the rubbish and be rewarded while doing so. Kaso Machi is a strange place though and one of the other things you can destroy are floating sins. These are floating ghostly white trails that you can try to drive into or launch Pinky into them when you get the launcher upgrade. If you want to really anger the mayor (and you do) you can go around destroying all his signs.</p>

<p>The people of Kaso Machi will have tasks for you too and these are usually to collect things for them. Collectathons can go wrong and become repetitive, but Promise Mascot Agency makes it simple as the items are marked on the map as white dots. Some are more accessible than others, but when you unlock the gilder and boat upgrades for your truck you’ll floating through the air or on the waves to reach those collectables.</p>
<p>Promise Mascot Agency’s story is one of family ties, positive reinforcement, and pushing back against the odds as outside dangers close in. It is an over-the-top plot, but it has so much heart and so many memorable characters that you will be rooting for them. Michi and Pinky are a great comedic duo with Michi acting as the serious one to Pinky’s unfiltered thoughts. They are joined by 20 mascots that all have their own stories, motivations, and goals and with your help and support they can reach their real potentials. There’s a lot of heart and the story, the characters, and the setting all tie in together to create a world that is engaging to explore and immerse yourself in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-finally-confirmed-by-bethesda-full-reveal-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Bethesda will finally show off its long-awaited The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake today.
</p>
<p>
Teaser imagery can now be seen on Bethesda's social media channels pointing to today's date, 22nd April, and a time: 4pm UK. (That's 11am Eastern or 8am Pacific if you live across the pond.)
</p>
<p>
Bethesda then links to its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube pages, directing you to watch the game's announcement trailer when it drops. But when will the game itself be available?
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer previously reported</a>, amidst a sea of leaks, Bethesda has been planning to announce and shadow drop the game this week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass.

<p>
Bethesda's Oblivion Remaster has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">one of gaming's worst kept secrets over recent months</a>, with screenshots popping up in the files of developer Virtuos' website this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">references to the game on Bethesda's own site</a> just days ago.

<p>
That's not to mention the years of references to the project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">spotted in Microsoft documents</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">whispered by a former developer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over the long weekend, the leaks continued. Fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3tvxy/oblivion_remake_steamdb_listing_leaked/">spotted a SteamDB listing</a> for the game, while others claimed it had suddenly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3sclu/oblivion_remastered_appearing_on_steam_accounts/">turned up in their Steam accounts</a>. Others noticed that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k4b068/esrb_oblivion_entry_last_updated_50_minutes_ago/">US ratings board listing had suddenly been updated</a> too.
</p>
<p>
The Oblivion Remake is expected to be a new version of Bethesda's classic Elder Scrolls game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by port studio Virtuos.
</p>
<p>
According to an earlier leak by a ex-Virtuos developer, the game will feature newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery and hit reaction systems, as well as a fresh HUD.
</p>
<p>
How will it feel to play? Well, here's <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/">Virtuos design director Nicolas Roginski speaking in March 2024 to 80.lv</a> seemingly about the project, without actually naming what it is.
</p>
<p>
"We are working on a very big, unannounced project," Roginski said. "Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It's challenging, mainly because of players' perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. 
</p>
<p>
"Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won't match the 'feeling' of their memories.
</p>
<p>
"To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the 'feeling of the memory', not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is 'Keep, Improve, Create'."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to "remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed. Tune in at 4pm today to see Jim be disappointed, I guess.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remaster-developer-shares-design-philosophy-recreating-the-feeling-of-the-memory/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remaster-developer-shares-design-philosophy-recreating-the-%E2%80%98feeling-of-the-memory%E2%80%99.1170000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remaster-developer-shares-design-philosophy-recreating-the-feeling-of-the-memory/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frantic few weeks of rumors</a>, the announcement day for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remaster has arrived. Bethesda has <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that a dedicated stream will air today on Twitch and YouTube starting at 11 AM Eastern Time/8 AM Pacific Time/4 PM British Time.</p>
<p>According to rumors, the game should be shadowdropped, meaning that it should also be released right after the stream. Meanwhile, we have uncovered some details about the developer's design philosophy for this project. Bethesda picked Singaporean game developer Virtuos to aid them in this remaster. The studio previously worked on the Nintendo Switch port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-launches-on-nintendo-switch-this-october/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NieR Automata: End of Yorha Edition</a> and on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-spacers-choice-edition-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-this-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition</a>, while also collaborating on major triple-A projects like Hogwarts Legacy, Dead Island 2, Horizon Forbidden West - Complete Edition, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>Last year, game development website 80Lv <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Virtuos specifically about their work on remasters and ports. During the interview, Design Director Nicolas Roginski shared a reply that, in hindsight, cannot have been referencing anything other than the Oblivion Remaster:</p>
<p><em>We are working on a very big, unannounced project. Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It’s challenging, mainly because of players’ perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won’t match the “feeling” of their memories.</em></p>
<p><em>To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the “feeling of the memory”, not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is “Keep, Improve, Create”:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Keep what is core to the original vision and core memories players have of the original game.</em></li>
<li><em>Improve what you need to modernize because standards have evolved.</em></li>
<li><em>Create in the sense of what needs to be removed or added to surprise the player, and set a new standard for the genre, which has evolved over the years</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtuos is also working alongside Konami on another very big project, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. However, the interview was published in March 2024, while MGS Delta: Snake Eater had been announced in May 2023 and was in fact already referenced in the 80Lv article. As such, it's almost guaranteed that Roginski had to have been referring to the Oblivion Remaster.</p>
<p>The idea of recreating the feeling of the memory is definitely the right one, at least on paper. However, executing that concept is undoubtedly harder than simply adopting it. The return of The Elder Scrolls IV is sure to induce a lot of nostalgia in a lot of people, but only a quality product can make it resurface with positive feelings.</p>
<p>We likely won't have to wait long to judge it all first-hand. Are you excited? Let us know in the comments.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-is-reportedly-getting-a-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming later this week for PlayStation 5, but PC users will also be able to access the same content and features. When it comes to new modes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-remastered-gets-horde-assault-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horde Assault</a>, Permadeath Mode, and Speedrun Mode will have to be purchased as part of the $10 Broken Road DLC. However, the tech improvements will be released for free with Update 1.08, and Bend has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1259420/view/520837042930712856" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full details for the patch:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DualSense haptic feedback support</em></li>
<li><em>Accessibility features</em></li>
<li><em>World graphical improvements</em></li>
<li><em>New Atmospheric/Sky simulation using ozone and spectral light simulation: Improves overall color tone and produces more accurate light intensities for the sky and sunlight</em></li>
<li><em>Significantly darker night time</em></li>
<li><em>Improved screen space indirect lighting and ambient occlusion effects</em></li>
<li><em>Double shadowmap resolution when Shadow Quality is set to Highest</em></li>
<li><em>Additional improvements</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Days Gone was very&nbsp;<span>good-looking for an Unreal Engine 4 open-world game launched in 2019 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/days-gone-q-we-were-blown-away-by-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 for PC</a>), but it's been a while, and these enhancements are undoubtedly welcome. Hopefully, alongside the new modes, they'll help shine an even greater light on this entirely underrated game. Unfortunately, Sony has&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-remake-in-the-works-days-gone-2-not-happening-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nixed the pitch for a sequel</a> and</span>&nbsp;also <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> Bend's next project earlier this year. Perhaps, if Days Gone Remastered does well enough, they might reconsider the prospects of a sequel. I, for one, certainly appreciated the original game. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>
<p><em>Days Gone puts Bend Studio once again on the map of all PlayStation gamers after many years of oblivion. While it doesn't deliver any meaningful innovations in terms of open world and gameplay mechanics, it's a fun game that sports gorgeous graphics and a surprisingly great story/cast of characters.</em></p>
<p>Days Gone Remastered will be available on Thursday, April 25.</p>

You’ll also be able to play “mini-matches” or full games against Duolingo’s Oscar character, who serves as your coach through the lessons.</p><p>Duolingo gave me a brief demo of the chess course on a recent video call, and it looks like it could be a lot of fun. The team’s approach was to “make chess as accessible as possible,” Duolingo group product manager Edwin Bodge tells <em>The Verge</em>, and the course will offer lessons for a wide range of skill levels so that people can jump in at whatever level of familiarity they already have for chess.</p><p>Chess joins topics like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253932/duolingo-loog-portable-green-piano-music-lessons">music</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/26/23319398/duolingo-math-app-beta-launch-duocon-2022">math</a> that aren’t language-based but can still be practiced via Duolingo. I asked if the company plans to build courses around other games, and staff software engineer Sammi Siegel says that “while we don’t have any plans to share right now, I think we’re just seeing how this launch goes and then we’ll go from there.”</p><p>The chess course is launching in beta testing on iOS in English, according to Monica Earle, Duolingo’s PR director. Earle estimates that in four to six weeks, more people on iOS will be able to try it, and then it will head to Android and be available in other languages down the line.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fine-i%E2%80%99ll-play-star-wars-xcom.1169868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many of you, I was raised on <em>Star Wars</em>. I was obsessed with the original trilogy, I collected the action figures, and I desperately tried to convince myself that the prequels had any redeeming qualities. Then I became an adult and realized I was categorically Over It. Disney’s bland-as-butterless-toast spin on the galaxy far, far away hasn’t helped matters. I could have happily continued living in a state of <em>Star Wars</em>-free bliss if not for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcxnRaZ6slU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent announcement of tactics game <em>Star Wars Zero Company</em></a>, which unfortunately changes everything.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Zero Company</em> is being developed by the ex-Firaxis devs at Bit Reactor, and it sure does look like a <em>Star</em>-<em>Wars</em>-flavored <em>XCOM</em>. But of course, there are many flavors of <em>XCOM </em>these days; what I, in particular, am looking for is a turn-based tactics game where I can get irrationally attached to all my highly-customizable little guys, and then they can die sudden, grisly, and, most importantly, <em>permanent </em>deaths. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/yes-zero-company-really-is-star-wars-xcom-and-its-got-the-permadeath-to-prove-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer’s preview of <em>Zero Company</em></a> makes it sound like the developers are very much hoping to please permadeath sickos like me:</p><blockquote><p>If anything, <em>Zero Company</em> seems ready to take that idea [of permadeath] even further. Soldiers you create can be customised to the class and appearance you want, but appropriately for <em>Star Wars</em> you can also choose their species. Then the game also has authored characters – the crew seen in the trailer and art – who turn up already armed with personalities, backstories, and roles in the story. But not only will they have a degree of customisation too, they're not exempt from permadeath, and if they are lost in some Outer Rim skirmish, that will actually affect how elements of the story play out.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This, to me, is great news. The last official <em>XCOM </em>game, <em>XCOM: Chimera Squad</em>, focused on a series of authored characters who, thanks to the demands of the plot, could not die permanently. Their preexisting personalities, somewhat paradoxically, also made it harder to imprint on them. The formula works best when you can make characters yours, when their internal battles play out less on the field and more in your imagination.&nbsp;</p><p><em>XCOM 2</em> and its expansion, <em>War of the Chosen</em>, got this right, allowing much more customizable characters to form bonds with each other that affected gameplay and showing them performing various activities in your base. You could even create posters to commemorate big wins – or tragic deaths. Those are the kinds of features that accentuate the drama playing out in your head rather than detract from it. In other words: The Good Stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that <em>Zero Company </em>aims to gently ease players into the genre, and as a result permadeath will be optional. I am mildly concerned, then, that Bit Reactor won’t be able to explore the idea as fully as it might if permadeath was baked into the very bones of the project. But we’ll see; <em>Zero Company</em> isn’t coming out until next year. I imagine trailers and previews and preorder incentives and every other tool in the marketing hype cycle toolbelt will tell us a great deal more before the game actually releases. And in the meantime, maybe Firaxis will <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/xcoms-creator-wants-to-know-where-xcom-3-is-just-as-badly-as-you-do-im-sure-theres-an-audience-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally announce <em>XCOM 3</em></a>. Highly unlikely, but I can dream. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-9/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features plenty of striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is the game's storytelling. Beyond just the cutscenes, the writing in the more than 100 notes in the game's 14 chapters adds excellent context to the story and enhances the experience.</p>
<p>That's why it's worth your time finding every note in each chapter. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 9.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 9</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-8/">Chapter 8</a> was very straightforward, with only four notes to find. Chapter 9 has 12 notes, so you'll have to be a little more diligent.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Feline Intuition</strong> - When you exit the cave at the beginning of the level, Hazel will point out a house in the distance. Once she does, pay attention to the right side of the path, where you'll find a hollowed-out tree that houses the first note of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Cross my heart... -&nbsp;</strong>After the cutscene with Itchy, head into the small town across the bridge and go inside the house with red yarn on its roof. You'll find this note on your left when you walk in the door, on the couch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Dear Santa</strong> - This note is in the same house as the previous note, on a table to the right side of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Please Keep In Mind</strong> - After completing the combat encounter to the left of the house with red yarn on its roof, where you found the previous two notes, you can enter a house at the back of the combat arena. This note is right in the doorway, resting on the countertop on the right side of the hallway.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>You'll be sorry</strong> - This note is in the same house as the previous one, on the table at the end of the hall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Molly Gives A Fright</strong> - After completing the combat arena where you found the house with the previous two notes, there will be a couple of ways to exit the arena. Take the one that leads you past two large bramble vines, and on your left will be plenty of Stigma besides a house with a sun painted on the outside. Directly across the street from the house with the sun, you'll find this note on a picnic table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Mandatory Overtime</strong> - Once you've made it into the Pure Pine Factory, head up the stairs that you'll see directly in front of you and into the office to find this note and a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>She Did It</strong> - You'll be able to grab this note after dealing with the tangle in front of Molly's house. As you walk up to the house, this note will be on the right side of the path on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Why not me? -&nbsp;</strong>Right as you enter Molly's house, you'll find this note on a table in front of the fireplace.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Dear Miss Molly</strong> - You'll find this note in Molly's house on a table to the left of the stairs leading to the second floor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Decision of Transfer</strong> - This is the final note in Molly's house, and it can be found on the second floor on a desk to the right of the fireplace.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Is it True? -&nbsp;</strong>The final note of the chapter can be found inside the large house in Molly's cave. You'll enter the house through a narrow entrance, and find this note on a bed immediately to your right once you're inside.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all 12 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 12. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 69 notes by now. Only 34 more to go.</p>

Many of the most popular school shooting simulators are created by a group known as Active Shooter Studios or A.S.S. </p><p>A.S.S has reportedly created <em>Roblox </em>maps and online games based on mass shootings like those that have happened at Uvalde, Parkland, and Columbine. One of the studio’s most popular maps is “Carbine,” a <em>Roblox </em>recreation of the 1999 Columbine high school massacre which took the lives of a dozen students and one teacher while injuring many more.

The studio, which boasts a Discord server containing over 500 members, has resorted to using private <em>Roblox </em>servers to host their games behind a paywall.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-content">
  
          
      
<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      
  
  
  <div>
      <div><p>The fallout from the current situation in the United States government continues to land on a variety of industries, but the tariffs have had an outsized impact on the tabletop market. <em>Wingspan </em>publisher, Stonemaier Games, is the latest Tabletop publisher to speak out about a very costly situation for their industry.</p>

<p>The latest action comes from Stonemaier Games, the publisher of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wingspan Review - Pleasant From Beak To Tailfeather"><em>Wingspan</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/scythe-review-beauty-grace-and-style" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Scythe Review - Beauty, Grace and Style"><em>Scythe</em></a>, and many others, as they announced that they are going to be part of a lawsuit against the US President over his tariff usage. Jamey Stegmaier, the founder and CEO of Stonemaier Games explains why they are taking this action some in his <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/we-are-suing-the-president/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" We Are Suing the President">announcement post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will not stand idly by while our livelihoods–and the livelihoods of thousands of small business owners and contractors in the US, along with the customers whose pursuit of happiness we hold dear–are treated like pawns in a political game.</p>

<p>Like many tabletop publishers (import code 9504.90.6000*), we started print runs of products before the President took office, and now we face an unprecedented $14.50 tariff tax for every $10 we spent on manufacturing with our trusted long-term partner in China. For Stonemaier Games alone (a US based company in which all 8 employees are US citizens), that amounts to upcoming tariff payments of nearly $1.5 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the comments he explains that the lawsuit will be filed later this week, and features claimants from across a number of industries who have been directly impacted by the tariffs. They are focused on the President unilaterally creating these tariffs. These aren't the only actions that Stonemaier games is taking, as they also are focusing on sales to other regions, storing games in China with hopes the tariffs will go down, direct selling their newest game <em>Vantage</em>, and are in some cases sending restocks of released games and eating the costs, which they can do due to a buffer they have.</p>

<p>With limited to non-existent production capability in the US for various tabletop games, the industry has been hammered by the 145% tariffs. Many of the games you love are manufactured in China due to lower costs, and the fact that very few in the US have the ability to make the products desired.&nbsp;This has caused some companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Greater Than Games Shuts Down in Response to Trade Tariffs">Greater Than Games to shut down</a> due to the tariffs.</p>

They were so on board that they gladly sacrificed suspense for fulfillment.

Travis Scott was high and giving Rhodes a black eye. Cena being chosen to be the face of the company by the insidious Vince McMahon was brought up, as was Rhodes only being in the position he is because of Cena’s absence and Rhodes copying him. Everything was set. All that was left was for Cena and Rhodes to put on the historic WrestleMania matches they’ve been known to do individually. Boy, did they not.</p><p>After uninspired fisticuffs, the match devolved to simply an exchange of finishing moves before concluding in one of the weakest endings in WrestleMania history. After getting his lick back on Travis Scott by hitting the Cactus Jack rapper with a Cross Rhodes, the champion wouldn’t strike Cena with the championship belt. Why? By the look on his face, it appears he didn’t want to win the wrong way. Well, that Captain America nobility bullshit got him kicked in the groin and knocked out, making him the loser of the match. No surprise interference outside of Travis Scott, no ruthless aggression, no sustained back-and-forth fighting. It was the equivalent of the WWE shoving the full-course meal you ordered in your face and telling you to enjoy what you asked for. At a WrestleMania that featured Seth Rollins’ surprise alliance with Paul Heyman; Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair putting on an instant classic triple-threat match; and Jey Uso winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Cena’s title match would be an afterthought if not for the history made. </p><p>Even with all of that disappointment, I’m not ready to give up on the WWE’s grand plan. The most promising sign that the WWE has a worthwhile plan which that terrible WrestleMania 41 main event fits into is Cena’s expressed desire to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruin wrestling</a></span>.” Earlier today on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pat McAfee Show</em></a></span>, Cena broke down part of his post-WrestleMania plan, and it quite honestly sounds like the WWE’s version of DC Comics’ Crisis on Infinite Earths in which the DC timeline was reset, liberated of its burdensome multiverse.</p><p>“I’m going to make wrestling start over. That championship is coming home with me, and I will be the last undisputed WWE champion, period. They’re going to have to make a new title. They’re going to have to start the over again.”</p><p>Retiring a championship is truly next-level heel shit. Beating someone to a bloody pulp, knocking someone off of a bridge, and nailing the boss’s daughter to a cross to sacrifice her are bad. Having the balls to remove a championship is a seismic change that could be a smart move. Cena delivering a WrestleMania match that felt like a formality more than a fight and robbing fans of the type of five-star match that requires you to put your body on the line could totally be Cena’s way of ruining wrestling. Imagine if the rest of his wrestling career is centered on simply removing everything positive that fans expect every year, and then leaving with a title they have memories attached to. That would be a scorched Earth plan I can get behind.</p><p>Another saving grace for the WWE is time. Cena has already committed to wrestling until the end of December, with another 27-37 matches left to go after originally stipulating he’ll wrestle in 30-40 matches in his final year. So far, he’s only wrestled in Premium Live Events. If he’s going to hit that number of matches, it’s safe to assume we’ll be seeing him wrestle on RAW and Smackdown. With the championship already won, the next eight full months can be a collection of dream matches and title defenses. Maybe Cena can finally beat Roman Reigns in a Singles match after failing the previous two times. Maybe the sleeping giant Randy Orton goes back to his Legend Killer ways and begins his own potential retirement tour by ending Cena’s with a loss. </p><p>We’ll almost certainly get a Cena/Rhodes rematch, or we’ll riot. If Cena and WWE’s plans are for the newly 17-time World Champion to ruin wrestling, they’re off to a great start.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>How much will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650556/temu-shein-us-price-increase-tariffs">Trump’s threatened 245 percent tariffs</a> truly impact Chinese goods and the prices we pay in the US? Some Chinese companies aren’t waiting to see. Anbernic, which makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/630797/a-game-boy-for-pirates-titw">excellent and controversial Nintendo Game Boy clones</a>, is already suspending US shipments indefinitely.</p></div><p>“Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States starting today,” <a href="https://anbernic.com/pages/shipping-policy">writes Anbernic.</a> “We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse, which are currently not affected by import duties and can be purchased with confidence.”</p><p>No, Anbernic didn’t set up a brand-new US warehouse in response to tariffs — it’s been an option on its storefront for some time. Generally, Anbernic begins by drop-shipping each new handheld from China directly to buyers’ homes after they’re introduced, then stockpiles additional units in US warehouses for faster ship times. Anbernic lets buyers pick which warehouse they prefer on its checkout page.</p><p>As of last week, Anbernic had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1k1ikq0/is_it_safe_to_order_from_anbernic_at_this_point/#lightbox">already begun suggesting</a> that US buyers pick its US warehouse because “orders shipped to the United States may be subject to high customs duties,” asking customers to “take this potential risk into account when making your purchase decisions.”</p><p>But now, the company is suspending those shipments entirely — similarly to how acclaimed retro game scaler maker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651007/retrotink-us-shipments-suspended-trump-tariffs">RetroTINK suspended shipments not just because of tariffs</a>, but “due to lack of guidance on how tariffs will be collected.” I checked: while you can still add a Anbernic handheld to your US cart from a Chinese warehouse, the company offers plenty of warnings and won’t let you purchase it from there.</p><p>One reason for Anbernic’s popularity is that its retro handhelds are cheap, typically around $70 for the newest models. (Some also do an excellent job emulating the look and feel of classic Nintendo handhelds, as you can see in my videos above and below.) But those low prices are now completely under threat by Trump’s tariffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642601/donald-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-shein-temu">removal of the de minimis exemption for cheap Chinese goods</a>. It’s not clear if or how companies like Anbernic could afford to resume shipments, should those tariffs actually take hold.</p><p>For the time being, Anbernic handhelds are also still available in the US via third-party sellers like Amazon — which I’ve always found surprising given that those ones typically come with Nintendo, Sega and Sony ROMs.</p><div><p><a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/tariffs/"><em>Retro Handhelds</em> has a handy regularly updated page</a> keeping track of handheld tariffs; so far, Anbernic is the only one to suspend US shipments entirely.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo’s new subpoena suggests it may not yet have actually tracked down the Discord user in question, or is hoping to learn the identities of anyone else that was working with them. </p><p>This isn’t the first time the <em>Mario </em>maker has come knocking on the gaming hangout platform’s door.
