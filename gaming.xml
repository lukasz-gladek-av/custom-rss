            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-players-not-owning-digital-games-double/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft’s lawyers started contending with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a class-action lawsuit</a> raised following the shutting down of The Crew, an MMO-based, live-service racing game, taking it offline for one and all. </p>



<p>The lawsuit alleged that Ubisoft had ‘duped’ players into believing they were buying a game with permanent ownership. Ubisoft retorted that they were only ever buying a ‘license to play’ the game. In the latest update in the case, Ubisoft’s legal team has doubled down on that concept, and the plaintiffs have fired back with amendments.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-unfettered-ownership">It’s Not ‘Unfettered Ownership’</h2>



<p>In a document dug up by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR6qVUri3YEl-Rm1i2hUkopLGiFMB0vcfSJN_2XvFyiSWDUJc6EDhA_0kDCXkw_aem_vnLG_QctHg-dUb7i1mTNHA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> (and <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/848030901/The-Crew-lawsuit-Ubisoft-response-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helpfully transcribed</a>), it was revealed that Ubisoft’s tenacious legal team filed to have the case thrown out of the California court. The team claimed – or rather, reiterated – that <em>‘customers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license.’</em></p>



<p>Per the original claim from the plaintiffs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Ubisoft Inc. allegedly misled&nbsp;purchasers of its video&nbsp;game <em>The Crew</em> into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownershiprights in the game, rather than a&nbsp;limited license to access the game.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The recent amendments to the class-action suit saw the claimants leaning on the law surrounding gift certification sales in California. The hope is that they can stress that they were ‘robbed’ of digital currency, as in California, gift cards aren’t allowed to expire – but any in-game credits players had when The Crew was shut down did just that: they disappeared.</p>



<p>In January 2024, Ubisoft’s Director of Subscriptions, Philippe Tremblay, went on record speaking about the transformation of gaming from a physical to a digital world. He suggested that players should <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-not-owning-games-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘get comfortable’ with not owning their games</a> and instead acquiring limited licenses to play them.</p>



<p>Gamers have never forgotten these comments, and even today, folks on social media platforms worldwide will jibe Ubisoft fans with comments about them ‘renting their games.’</p>



<p>With the latest amendments having been made to the class-action lawsuit, Ubisoft has been given a new window in which to respond. We’ll have the latest on this case by April 29, which is the deadline.</p>



<p>Do you think Ubisoft is right, or are you on the side of the plaintiffs in complaining that digital ownership should also be <strong>permanent </strong>ownership? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

As in previous years, it will be a double feature with a presentation dedicated to The Outer Worlds 2 airing immediately afterward.</p>

<p>The Xbox Showcase occurs during the week of Summer Game Fest and begins at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. Like previous years, the event is a digital-only showcase, meaning it's pre-taped instead of being a live event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with the Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Directs the last two years, The Outer Worlds 2 Direct promises to reveal new gameplay and details about the upcoming RPG with an inside look at Obsidian Games and insights from its developers. The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-announcement-trailer-left-us-smiling">announced</a> in 2021, but got its first gameplay reveal during The Game Awards last December.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2</p>

</article><p>The 2024 Xbox Showcase revealed new titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-is-a-prequel-set-14-years-before-the-first-game">Gears of War: E-Day</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/mixtape-is-a-sharp-looking-coming-of-age-story-with-music-from-devo">Mixtape</a>, provided updates and gameplay reveals for long-in-development titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/perfect-dark-gets-first-impressive-gameplay-trailer">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-trailer-revealed-coming-to-game-pass-day-one">State of Decay 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/playground-games-fable-gets-2025-release-window-in-first-gameplay-trailer">Fable</a> (which was recently delayed to 2026), and showcased third-party titles like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/latest-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trailer-shows-all-gameplay">Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-a-fantastical-souls-like-action-rpg-set-during">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a good chance we could see some, if not most, of these titles make another appearance. Other titles that could appear include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QALOtq_13go">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> (which is being published by Xbox Game Studios), the noir action stealth deck-builder <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2024/03/06/sleight-of-hand-is-a-noir-stealth-action-sim-and-deckbuilder">Sleight of Hand</a> (an Xbox console exclusive), or the cozy survival game <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/winter-burrow">Winter Burrow</a>. We’ll have to tune in on June 8 to find out.</p>

<p>What game(s) do you hope to see at the Xbox Showcase? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there-are-so-few-of-us-left%E2%80%99-even-full-time-games-journalists-at-big-websites-are-feeling-it-in-2025.1160022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve (sadly) covered a lot of games media stories that<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> involve writers being laid off</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-gamer-network-eurogamer-gamesindustrybiz-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sites being shuffled around</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes even whole companies shutting down</a>. For Inside Baseball week, I figured it might be a good time to check in with some of the few people left still making a living in video games journalism.</p><p>I spoke with a number of writers and voices who are a) drawing a full-time salary writing or talking about video games, and b) are working at what I’d call a “major” site, the big ones with historical brands that are still in a position to be paying people decent wages. These folks are the lucky few survivors, those in jobs that a decade ago were relatively common but which today–thanks to the aforementioned layoffs and closures, <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to mention other contractions like a growing reliance on freelance and guides</a>– are increasingly scarce.</p><p>I asked a number of questions about their past, present and, perhaps most pressing, their immediate future, with their answers to each below. To protect their identities and jobs their names have been changed, and outlets omitted where requested. By way of introduction, I spoke with:</p><p><strong>Kate</strong>, who moved from various esports sites to a bigger site before landing a full-time job with one of the <em>biggest </em>sites, first on an esports vertical then on the main site itself, where they’ve worked as a culture and games writer.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>, who has been in the games journalism and online/social media business in one way or another for around nine years now, sometimes as a freelancer, other times–like now–as a full-time member of staff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bruce </strong>has been writing about games for over a decade now, originally as a volunteer on a fansite, then as a paid-per-post freelancer before making the jump to one of the biggest games sites, initially as a freelancer then a full-time member of staff.</p><p><strong>Robert </strong>started their career with a personal blog and some freelance work, before moving to a major games site around a decade ago to cover weekends. They later became a full-time writer at the same site.</p><p><strong>Beatrice </strong>has been working full-time for a few years now at a prominent, generalist site that has a video game beat.</p><p><strong>Hank </strong>has worked in video game journalism for around ten years now, originally as a volunteer writer for a tiny site before moving onto paid freelance stuff and, finally, a position as a full-time staffer at a major video games website. I know that’s almost an identical career path to someone else above, but that used to be how people got jobs in this business!&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The parts of the craft I spent my early years at the site trying to hone...all became liabilities under an increasingly broken regime run by dickheads.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>In the time you’ve been working permanently at a site, has your job changed at all?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: Overall, my career at my current site has been pretty stable and changes to my job have been communicated and make sense.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Yes, due to restructuring and layoffs. My job has always been way more nebulous regardless, but even then, yes, that nebulousness has itself changed. That being said, I have made a career of being a jack-of-all-trades kind of employee, trying to diversify my skillset as broadly as possible. That aside, there is a lot of instability with my role in terms of expectations and responsibilities that I have raised concerns regarding to powers that be on numerous occasions.</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: I do more, but mainly because I got more confident and better at writing. I also have ended up doing more because there are fewer people around. And because the people above us in charge demand more content with a smaller staff. I probably work harder these days than ever before.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: My job has gone from trying to think up cool shit and writing stuff that people would read, to navigating increasingly boneheaded and idiotic mandates from the business side made by people with no idea how to make or run a good website. The parts of the craft I spent my early years at the site trying to hone--voice-y headlines, creative packaging, funny images, speed, rigor, and quality--all became liabilities under an increasingly broken regime run by dickheads.&nbsp;</p><p>It did not help that during this time the way digital media functions online fundamentally shifted, and at the exact same moment the industry was facing a sea change the people steering our ship were aiming at icebergs. There was no investment, leadership, or freedom to explore alternate ways of engaging with and monetizing a passionate and loyal readership outside of assaulting their eyeballs and mobile battery life with ever more programmatic spam.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: My responsibilities have not changed thankfully. I’m still required to write a blog every day, although now with the tariff situation, my EIC has mandated that we chase down any and all leads about how this situation is impacting my beat.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: My job has changed, but it’s more in the ways of adding new responsibilities as I’ve gotten more experience and learned new skills.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...over the past few years, I've lost any real sense of pride in my work...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>Do you think the site's objectives or output have changed? And if so, why?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: It feels like the site has become more focused on producing a consistent stream of content over fostering the time to produce more thoughtful and in-depth pieces at a slower pace. Recently, our post quota was raised again. I get that there's an economic aspect to it, and news posts and guides keep the lights on. But over the past few years, I've lost any real sense of pride in my work. I think we're all familiar with the YouTube content creators who turn on a camera and simply talk off the top of their heads and publish it before moving onto the next piece of slop, and it really feels like we're being pushed towards that. Obviously my colleagues are still doing phenomenal work and I have a lot of respect for what they do, and I can only speak from my POV, but I feel like my work is increasingly becoming slop because I gotta meet quota.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Totally, yes. I don’t even need to talk about behind the scenes stuff for that. You can see our current video programming, and look at what we were doing this time not even six months ago to see that this is an EMPHATIC yes. What we are doing now is a combo of plans that were in motion before some recent layoffs, and then those new plans having to adapt to a reduced workforce.</p><p>That being said, I don’t think the actual site–our written, editorial content–has changed at all, thankfully. That department has been (relatively) unharmed in the years I’ve been here, and honestly, has only become more robust seemingly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: Yes. For sure. Where I work, we used to be laser focused on writing cool shit and speaking truth to power while covering the news and publishing reviews. Today, we still do some of that, but not nearly as much. The people in charge want more guides. More deals posts. More evergreen content. And they don't want to scare away advertisers. It's frustrating to be told a headline is too spicy or that a story is too "business-y" simply because it dares to say a corporation sucks or unions are good.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: There is no site objective at this point, and probably hasn't been for years. There are a few people who log on to write each day, a person who edits them, and some rich assholes who try their best to kick sand in the gears. The output that's left is shaped by a combination of incentives, trying to write about what's happening that day, what we think people will want to know about, and increasingly cynical plays to try and grab whoever happens to be scrolling by when a hyperlink pops up on Facebook, Reddit, or Google. All the while trying to avoid getting yelled at by management.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how bad it gets there's a sense that if we can stabilize the numbers--uniques, page views, sessions per visit--then we might be able survive long enough to make it to the other side. Of what? I have no idea. But it's hard to see a world where there aren't at least some number of people keeping a written record of gaming culture.</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: Thankfully no. My site has never been one to prioritize traffic or clicks with its writers. There’s never been an editorial imperative to chase trends. That doesn’t mean we get to ignore trending topics, but it’s more like, how can we make what we’re currently working on fit the moment. It has always been “do the best, informative work to service our readers” in line with our mandate as a more generalist website, and I’m incredibly grateful for that.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: I don’t think that from an editorial standpoint our objectives have changed since I started. We’ve definitely expanded into what we call “commerce,” which includes deals and merch, but that team operates on their own for the most part. We’ve seen a big push into social media as well, but again, it’s more of an expansion rather than a change. DLC rather than a patch!&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Where I work feels like one of the most stable places you could work at in the games industry, and still I think people are worried.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>Games media has been hit with layoffs, site closures and buyouts over the last few years. As one of the few remaining sites to employ people full-time, what's the mood like at your publication right now in terms of its future and headcount?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: We’ve been lucky enough that we haven't been hit with any major layoffs - not 0, but no major sweeps. But the industry is clearly burning down around us, along with the rest of the world, so the mood is definitely grim. Many of us feel like there's a guillotine over us that will, at some point, fall. We don't know when or who will get hit, but it feels inevitable.</p><p>I will say I do feel like my boss, and my boss' boss, fundamentally give a shit and are decent people. I'm disabled, and I know I can take time off as I need and I won't have to hustle to meet quota regardless. But I feel like there's someone above my boss' boss who will not hesitate to cut the team if it'll make a line go up. It's happened to other parts of our network and I don't feel particularly immune.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: I would say that it’s certainly worse having suffered some layoffs, but even if we hadn’t in the last few years, I think we’d still be on pretty tenterhooks being surrounded by it. It’s like something that keeps circling around you and then tightens around your neck when you go through it. Even if it never eventually tightened, that pressure is still there.</p><p>So then to actually be strangled by it a couple times; yeah, everyone I’ve spoken to about it at work says that, like me, they think about it and are concerned by it all the time. More layoffs, site closure, you name it. Vibes are just never really good, which makes it really hard to do the work.</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: It's very bizarre. A small group of people huddled around a fire in a barren, icy wasteland filled with corpses and monsters. The fire is smaller. The thin wooden walls around us are crumbling. But we still have fun and do cool shit. Yet, and I think the others would agree, we know that eventually something is going to happen. Perhaps we will be saved. Perhaps a big monster will break the walls down and end everything. Or maybe the fire will go out and we all will take one last look at each other and drift away into the wasteland around us, spotting old campsites and bodies as we exit. Honestly, I'm just ready for something to happen. Because lingering around in a perpetual state of "Maybe we all die, maybe this keeps going for five more years" as everyone else suffers is getting old. Really fucking old.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: I'm too burnt out to imagine a future outside of our website maybe getting sold, and new management deciding to smartly invest in a few easy growth areas. Or maybe while it crashes the economy the Trump admin will decide to also break up Google and Facebook's duopoly on online advertising, single-handedly reviving the value of having a free website with millions of readers. Or maybe the economy continues to tank and the last vestiges of institutional online games media that had been slowly declining for a decade gets hit by a meteor instead. Like, all of this might feel quaint once we're in the throes of another major recession, and not one where everyone's hanging home playing <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: As strange and guilt inducing as it is to say: we’re good! My website truly does feel like it’s “one of the good ones” where we prioritize good journalism and empower our journalists to do good work they’re passionate about, and that’s been enough for whatever corporate overlords.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: Where I work feels like one of the most stable places you could work at in the games industry, and still I think people are worried. 2025 was supposed to be huge for us with things like <em>GTA 6</em>, <em>Superman</em>, and the Nintendo Switch 2, but now thanks to tariffs and everything else, the video game landscape for 2025 feels a lot less bright. Luckily more and more games workers are unionizing, both on the media side and the development side, which is heartening, because that’s really the only way to protect yourself and your coworkers when you work at a corporate-owned site (or corporate-owned anything, really). Unions are only going to become more important as the games industry shifts towards this relatively bleak future we find ourselves in.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Despite working at a decent company that takes good care of me, every day I live in fear that my bosses will decide what I do does not provide enough value for them to keep me.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Luke</strong>: <strong><em>On a more personal basis, what's your current mood in terms of your job and career? Do you think there's scope to make a career out of games media in the years and decades to come?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Kate</strong>: My mood is pretty bleak. Like I said earlier, I've lost a lot of pride in my work. I feel like I personally peaked in about 2021 and I've been phoning it in throughout COVID and its aftermath. It's hard to get excited about video games when the world is on fire and looking through social media is an endless firehouse of human suffering.</p><p>I intend to stay here for as long as they will have me. I'm the breadwinner -- my partner works, but doesn't make enough to cover our bills alone. I do feel very lucky and blessed to have this job, and I know a lot of people would kill for the opportunity. That almost makes it worse; it feels ungrateful and shitty to be so pessimistic and doomer-ish about a dream job.&nbsp;</p><p>But at the same time, the industry seems to be moving towards mass-produced slop, quickly made YouTube videos, and streamers making guesses on the industry as they play through a game. I have no interest in competing with that.</p><p>I've found my work in the crosshairs because I cover subjects that have become a front in the culture wars. I can't look up reception to my work anymore, as it's a mental health trigger. Sometimes, I have the opportunity to sink time and effort and passion into something like an explainer, only to find a Nazi made a three hour video critiquing it and by extension, me. I'm very lucky in that this vitriol is directed towards my outlet and not me for whatever reason, but it feels like I'm rolling dice and praying I never end up being a person of interest to these people.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a point I considered moving more into the "public" side of the job, but I've strongly pulled back on all of that because I don't want to add to my risk factor of being targeted, harassed, and/or doxxed.</p><p>If and when I lose my job, I intend to leave the industry and look into something more practical like medical transcription. I love games, I love writing about games, but I feel like I don't get much paid time to just... decompress and think about games. I always have to be writing, pitching, producing. It's a tolerable bargain, considering the perks, but I don't know if I'll still be here in a year, five years, etc.</p><p><strong>Frank</strong>: Setting aside myself wrestling with the thought of maybe exiting games media, like everyone contemplates at some point eventually, that feeling ebbing and flowing, if we’re talking about my own personal ability, I am relatively confident that I could, <em>eventually</em>, find my footing. But that comes back to the jack-of-all-trades path I have taken. I can be slot in a lot of different places.</p><p>I also know my opportunities come from an immense space of privilege, too. My skin color, gender, and even name rocks no boats, the waters becoming more turbulent by the day. In addition, I have several support systems that would buy me time to work on carving a path in the industry. That is a <em>rare</em> privilege very few others in games media have, I know. I do not think I would have gotten where I am today without it, to be honest.</p><p>So tl;dr, yes I do, but only really because I have the resources to invest time into that project.</p><p>The whole world is gonna explode too, so I’m not necessarily sure if the industry will even be a thing in “decades to come” lol.</p><p><strong>Bruce</strong>: I hope so. I really do. We need a strong games media. But I'm not dumb. I got eyes. I see what's happening. There are so few of us left, people with full-time jobs in games media, that I know most of those people. That's not good. And things are getting worse. So I'm hopeful that reader-supported sites can keep some of us employed. But as for the rest of us... I have no idea. Scary shit.</p><p><strong>Robert</strong>: There was a point around 2022 where it felt like I was going to hit escape velocity and either land a more mainstream gig covering games for a more stable media business, or would have built enough of a reputation that I would be in pole position for whatever few deckchairs remained on the digital games media Titanic. There are lots of people more talented than I, but many of them have already washed out or don't have the same bandwidth for dumb shit I do.&nbsp;</p><p>I was quickly disabused of that notion after repeated rejections from what had felt like increasingly slam dunks. At this point the only alternative is running a subscription operation that caters to a niche audience, and even those hills feel mostly mined at this point. At the end of the day you have to be really, really good at delivering things people feel like they can't miss and that is way harder, in many ways, than running a high quality publication at scale. I give myself 1-3 years before I'm working in PR or Home Depot. The post office was going to be a fallback but it doesn't seem like that will exist by then either.</p><p><strong>Beatrice</strong>: Despite working at a decent company that takes good care of me, every day I live in fear that my bosses will decide what I do does not provide enough value for them to keep me. I increasingly feel like the polar bear stranded on the thin piece of ice – when my one place eventually leaves me behind, I will have no other place to go. There is no demand for gaming journalists at places that will pay them a living wage, they just do not exist anymore. So if I do lose my job where I am, I’ll have to leave the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think I can become one of those journalists who pivots to having their own paid subscription newsletter. I think the journalists who have done that and can be sustained by that are incredibly lucky, but that avenue is really only available to a very specific kind of journalist, and that success is exceedingly hard to replicate. To that end, I just continue to do the work I do in hopes of looking up in another five years to see that the field has weathered this particularly nasty storm and is in a better place. Until that happens (and there’s a willfully optimistic part of me that hopes it does) I continue to do the work only I can do in hopes that’ll be enough to justify letting me keep my job.</p><p><strong>Hank</strong>: I’m pretty confident in my own career, but I’m lucky. I already work at a major website, and I’m also a straight white man, which is a privilege that I’m very aware of, especially in the games industry, where it’s very hard to be anything other than that. I think I have enough of a foothold now that I should be able to keep this thing going, but it’s hard to recommend that someone graduating college enter this space. The number of jobs are dwindling, and it doesn’t look like there will be more soon. I wish that weren’t the case, and I hope it changes soon, but with the current administration, things are going to get worse before they get better.&nbsp;</p><p>—</p><p>For what it’s worth, much of what’s been said above <a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/youre-solid-gold-ill-see-you-in-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mirrors my own personal experience</a>. During my time at Kotaku (I started in 2006) it was, once upon a time, a reasonably secure and well-paying job that yeah, while encouraging some degree of traffic-baiting bullshit, was also a website that gave me the peace and space to do the kind of work I wanted to do and felt was important to readers. By the time I left in 2023, it may as well have been a different website; intrusive ownership had stripped the site of much of its voice, and dwindling resources meant more and more work was being pushed on an increasingly smaller and inexperienced team.</p><p>The responses here give voice to a vibe that’s been around for a while now: that even for those individuals lucky enough to still be in a stable job, this is an <em>industry </em>in crisis, one where things aren’t just bad for the scores of writers being laid off and cast into the uncertainty of freelance work, or smaller websites being shuffled around owners or shut down altogether. Things are bad for almost <em>everyone</em>, because even those lucky enough to work at the biggest sites, with audiences in the millions and the security of a full-time salary, can see what’s happening around them, and what could soon be happening <em>to </em>them.</p><p>Because the same forces that have closed all the other sites are a rising tide that, as many have said above, could well be coming for them next. The free internet as we’ve known it for the last 20 years is collapsing as the ad market evaporates and corporate media ownership becomes increasingly unhinged in response. As belts tighten and profits dwindle across all media–not just video games–that rising tide could begin claiming more and more sites that even ten years ago would have seemed immortal.</p><p>Is there a way out of this? I dunno, man. I want to end this piece with some kind of optimism, a plan for the future, but as has been said above, even the stuff we’re trying here at Aftermath isn’t a proper solution. Paid media as it exists today is a limited market, and it can’t support everybody out there who is currently writing about video games for a living.&nbsp;</p><p>The problems facing the industry, and the source of everyone’s fears and discomfort here, are wider than any of us can hope to tackle directly. These are systemic issues, born of late stage capitalism, the callousness of an executive class, the destructive greed of Google and Meta. It doesn’t matter how many millions, or even <em>tens </em>of millions of people are reading a website if the means of financially supporting that writing are evaporating.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is a huge bummer to end this on, but then, as you’re reading this it’s still today, not tomorrow. These sites still exist, these writers and voices are still doing great work, and if there’s anything you as an individual person on the internet can do to support them, it’s to enjoy their stuff, give their site your click and share anything you’re into while you’re at it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

            <p>
Behold, your irregular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> funding update is here, with the news Cloud Imperium Games' controversial space sim has now raised over $800m - despite there still being no hint of a version 1.0 release date some 12 years after its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen">original Kickstarter campaign</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Citizen's previous major milestone arrived last May, when <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals">Cloud Imperium's funding tracker</a> - which aggregates money raised from likes of paid alpha access and those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">eye-wateringly expensive ship packs</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">ticked over the $700m mark</a>. That does, of course, mean the game - as far as it can currently be described as such - has raised a further $100m in just 11 months.
</p>
<p>
All this and there's still no sign of a 1.0 release date for Star Citizen, although its paid public alpha continues to evolve with regular updates. The space sim, you might recall, was originally targeting a 2014 launch, but sailed right past that (and just kept going) as Cloud Imperium Games' plans grew ever-more ambitious and the project fell into a vortex of feature creep.

<p>
The closest Cloud Imperium has come to suggesting an end is in sight in recent times came last March when CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">wrote that the "team [was] hard at work, heads down, driving towards the finish line."</a> But while the massively multiplayer, persistent universe portion of Star Citizen is potentially still some significant way off, its story driven, single-player spin-off - known as Squadron 42 - is supposedly much closer on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Cloud Imperium last year said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-spin-off-squadron-42-will-release-in-2026-heres-an-hour-long-gameplay-teaser">targeting a 2026 launch for Squadron 42</a>, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-hires-hefty-hollywood-cast-for-squadron-42">star-studded cast</a> includes the likes of Gary Oldan, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, and Andy Serkis. But given the number of times the project has already slipped back (it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/11-years-later-star-citizen-dev-says-squadron-42-is-feature-complete">described as "feature complete" in 2023</a>), it remains to be seen whether that 2026 release window holds true.

<p>Many expected Marvel Rivals to siphon off a number of players away from Overwatch. Thanks to the latest report from NewZoo on the state of the gaming industry, we now know many jumped ship, and what percentage of the overall market Marvel Rivals its hands on.</p>



<h2 id="h-even-overwatch-classic-did-almost-nothing-to-stop-marvel-rivals">Even Overwatch Classic Did Almost Nothing to Stop Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>According to the latest<a href="https://resources.newzoo.com/hubfs/Free%20Reports/PC%20and%20Console%20Report/2025_Newzoo_The%20PC%20and%20Console%20Gaming%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=3440460-2025%20PC%20%26%20console&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9kVtouoRdXai43NTW21yCjxlIAy1Rm3YMFWNGEsQ6J0AgoSoYZEdaa2ExtnJN1BX5v7OZB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gaming industry report from NewZoo</a>, 45% of the Overwatch 2 players who stopped playing in December 2024 played Marvel Rivals instead. After hitting a very high peak in daily active users when it launched in early access in October 2022, Overwatch 2’s numbers dipped over the next year and a half. After stagnating throughout 2024, the game’s numbers got even lower in December when Marvel Rivals launched. The Overwatch: Classic Event temporarily increased player engagement by 12%, but this was followed by a 26% decline that coincided with the Marvel Rivals launch.</p>



<p>Despite releasing in the last month of 2024 though, Marvel Rivals was one of the most played games of the year. It had the eighth highest share of total playtime on Steam in 2024, and was the third highest among 2024 releases, behind Helldivers 2 and Palworld. Amongst all the most played free-to-play 2024 releases on Steam, PS5, and Xbox, Marvel Rivals is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-hits-40-million-players-within-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the only game</a> that has not shut down or is more than 90% below its peak monthly average users (MAU).</p>



<p>Free-to-play game playtime reportedly grew in 2024, and Marvel Rivals was also a major part of that. Marvel Rivals was the second highest source of growth in free-to-play game playtime (amongst new releases) in 2024, just behind The First Descendant. It’s worth noting though that The First Descendant released several months before Marvel Rivals did, and according to current Steam player numbers, Marvel Rivals currently is drastically outpacing it.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals’ numbers on Steam have been slowly declining since launch, but a surge could occur <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-all-changes-and-updates-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in just a matter of days when Season 2 starts</a>. Will it finish 2025 as one of the most played games of the year?

<p>If you want to play Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle immediately after it finally launches on PlayStation 5, our preload and file size guide has you covered. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launched in December 2024 as an Xbox Series X/S and Windows exclusive. The game received glowing reviews, leading to reports that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Indiana Jones games</a> are in development. </p>



<p>In addition, Microsoft boldly decided to remove console exclusivity and release the game on PlayStation 5. This follows a trend of other titles making the leap, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PlayStation this spring, and rumors suggest that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War and Halo</a> could also be coming. For all the PlayStation users who initially missed out on Indiana Jones &amp; The Great Circle, this guide is for you. </p>

After the previous tournament, Hokutomaru traded his home in the mountains for the bustling metropolis that is South Town—with Terry’s help, that is. Despite having to grapple with the ups and downs that is “life in the city,” the fledgling Shiranui fighter spends a great deal of time wondering how to use his abilities to help those around him. With the latest tournament now close at hand, Hokutomaru decides it’s the perfect opportunity to see how he has grown.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/american-tabletop-awards-2025-winners-announced-showcasing-industry-variety<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The official awards committee of the American Tabletop Awards 2025 announced their winners. These awards are essentially the US' answer to the prestigious Spiel des Jahres, are intended to represent a wide variety of excellent board games across multiple genres and themes.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://americantabletopawards.com/2025-american-tabletop-award-winners/" rel="nofollow">website post</a>, the committee announced the American Tabletop Awards 2025 winners. As always, the winners span four different categories and are decided upon by a committee of US-based board game pundits, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/game-manufacturers-association-opposes-new-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA</a> president Nicole Brady.</p>

<p>The Early Gamers award is for shorter board games aimed at younger players (roughly 12 and under) and tabletop newcomers. The Casual Games award is for games aimed at general audiences of all ages. The Strategy Games award are a step above casual games, requiring a bit more forethought and consideration. Finally, the Complex Games award are games aimed at experienced players.</p>

In simple terms, the game has you assembling a pirate crew on a ship from a bag of tiles at random. Don't like a certain tile you got? Flip it. It's simple, it's cooperative, and it has an appealing art style.</p>

This is a cooperative poker game created by John Cooper and Kory Heath and published by Thames and Kosmos. In a gameplay system similar to the indie videogame craze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Balatro</em></a>, players work together to pull off heists, represented by the strength of different poker hands.</p>

To Japan</em>, designed by Josh Wood and published by AEG. Flavorwise, the game is about planning the perfect trip to Japan. Players get thirteen rounds split between Kyoto and Tokyo. Once it is planned, players undergo the trip, earning points based on their activities.</p>

<p>It's essentially a modern take on <em>Tokaido</em>, another tabletop experience about traveling through Japan. The committee recognized Let's Go! To Japan thanks to its blend of approachability and challenge.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/american-tabletop-awards-2025-fromage-featured-image.jpg?itok=J_QMIeS5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/american-tabletop-awards-2025-fromage-featured-image.jpg?itok=eXVlfhcu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, the American Tabletop Awards 2025 Complex Games winner was <em>Fromage</em>. This board game was designed by Matthew O' Malley and Ben Rosset and was published by Road to Infamy Games. As the name implies, the game is all about becoming the best cheesemaker in the world. It is a complex blend of worker placement and time management courtesy of a rotating game board.</p>

<p>Plus, as the committee remarks, it gives you an excuse to make constant cheese jokes.</p>

But some of that rebalancing ended up leaking out into the full campaign, and overall many players felt the changes made the game’s <em>Souls</em>-inspired combat meat grinder feel way overtuned and unrewarding. Negative user reviews instantly started pouring in on Steam and pushed <em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s rating down into mixed territory. </p><p>“Every boss fight is incredibly longer than it needs to be. Most of the skills do little to no damage,” wrote one player reviewing the game on Steam. “I understand they said they wanted to slow game play down, but I don’t think I will even make it more than 1 week in this league at this point.” Another asked, “how do you have a relatively good first patch then wait 3 months nerf everything and make the campaign a worse experience?” Some fans on the game’s subreddit were similarly apoplectic.<strong> </strong>“I was going to take a day or two off work to play this game,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “But I removed my vacation I had put in. I’d rather just go into work than play this game right now.”</p><p>Grinding Gear rushed into action with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of quick patches</a></span> to try and ameliorate the key pain points, including the new Huntress class being so reliant on a parry mechanic to be effective, as well as more basic complaints around crashes and server disconnects. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A long list of balance changes</a></span> was outlined earlier today to go live across the rest of the week, including making a range of character skills more powerful. “Now that we have a lot of the nerfs out of the way, we can concentrate on buffing things that are not performing well,” the developers wrote. </p><p>In some ways, that sounds like Early Access working exactly as intended, though there are perhaps deeper philosophical issues underlying some of the ongoing community angst around each big new<em> Path of Exile 2 </em>update. Some of that has to do with a clear, overall effort to make a game that’s (somewhat) more approachable to get into than its predecessor, but also decisively more punishing.  Some of it has to do with the fact that people who still love and play the original<em> Path of Exile</em> feel left behind.

Some fans were critical of him for appearing “defensive” early on during the interview. He apologized toward the end of the chat and said he had just gotten up on the wrong side of the bed.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the most widely appreciated games of 2025. It’s a phenomenal medieval RPG with a winding, adventurous story, and it’s packed to the brim with top-tier talent and wonderful, cinematic sequences. That’s what I alluded to in my full review for the game, at least.</p>



<p>I recently had the chance to catch up (again) with Tom McKay at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. We spent a few minutes talking about the success of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is one of the best-selling games of 2025 and will <strong>surely </strong>be up for many awards as the year unravels.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>

<h2 id="h-huge-expectations">‘Huge Expectations’</h2>



<p>I was the first person <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">to interview Tom McKay</a> about Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, which is something I’ll never stop boasting about. I hold the series very close to my heart, having poured hundreds of hours into both games and connecting eternally with the characters, particularly McKay’s Henry of Skalitz.</p>



<p>When I chatted with Tom at the BAFTA Games Awards, I was eager to gauge just how much this game had defied their expectations:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The studio had huge expectations based on the first game, a ton of effort went into the development of the second game, and they took their time – they put everything they had into it.</p>



<p>They were certainly proud of the product and knew that what they had was a good thing, but you can never predict how people will see that. Ultimately, it’s the players who are the most important reviewers of all.</p>



<p>The kind of energy and support and positivity that we’ve had from the fans has been incredible, and I don’t think any of us anticipated that, I certainly didn’t.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The fan base for Kingdom Come has exploded in recent months. It helps that the cast and crew have been immensely supportive of what they’ve produced. The actor behind the iconic Hans Capon, Luke Dale, has taken to streaming the game and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/">become an overnight sensation</a>, racking up thousands of viewers.</p>



<p>I asked McKay how things had changed since we caught up just after KCD2 was announced to the world.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It feels amazing – it’s <strong>like a sort of fever dream</strong>, really.</p>



<p>I think back to the very beginning of the first game, when I flew out the Prague and had what was essentially a final audition and I met the core creative team for the first time. That just feels like a world away, you know? </p>



<p>It is like a fever dream that we’re actually having this conversation about this game. However, in terms of what they’ve achieved and what they’ve made, Warhorse Studios, that doesn’t feel like a fever dream, because they’re so talented and so passionate, so on that level, it feels totally fitting. </p>



<p>In terms of that, I salute all of them. The reason I’m standing here is because of the work they’ve done.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">one hell of a roadmap ahead</a>, with three planned expansions yet to drop this year. Warhorse Studios is also releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode/">Hardcore Mode next week</a>, complete with a new lineup of perks.</p>



<p>There’s plenty of life left yet in KCD2.</p>

<p>In my review for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I noted that most of the game’s wildlife is pretty pointless. All across the world, animals roam free with no real purpose or control, and you can’t <strong>hunt them</strong> like you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>One thing I can’t complain about in the animal stakes is the sheer volume of cute kittens, puppy dogs, baby deer, and other adorable creatures scampering around Feudal Japan. I’ve just learned that (at least) one of those cuddly pets is based on a real cat that belongs to a Ubisoft developer.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perks-of-the-job">Perks of the Job</h2>



<p>When you work as a Production Manager on a game, one thing you’ll surely be able to do is immortalise your feline friend for all to see.</p>



<p>That’s what Nik Pantis did while working on Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Pantis revealed that his stark white kitty, Ghost, is immortalised in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as ‘Bakeneko,’ a one-of-a-kind supernatural yōkai or kaibyō – a <em>ghost cat</em>. </p>



<p>He shared an image of Ghost both in the real world and as the Bakeneko in Assassin’s Creed:</p>











<p>This isn’t the first time a legendary cat has found its way into an Assassin’s Creed game. In 2023’s Assassin’s Creed Mirage, a special cat belonging to a fan of the game surfaced – with a very interesting feature. The cat had a natural representation of the Assassin’s Creed logo across its face.</p>



<p>Sadly, the cat passed away before the game was released, but Ubisoft pulled some strings to immortalise a treasured companion.</p>



<p>I’m off to find me a Bakeneko.</p>

<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>

		<p>Disney Illusion Island will no longer be a Nintendo Switch exclusive, as today it has been announced that the platformer will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th. There will be a physical version released for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with that launching on May 30th in North America and in Europe on June 27th, with pre-orders live now.</p>

<p>When Disney Illusion Island releases for all of these platforms, new free content will be added in the form of Cave Adventuring Scavenger Hunt, which will allow players to unlock permanent upgrades. Disney Illusion Island will support four player co-op allowing the whole cast of characters to be playable at the same time, where players will swim, jump, and run through the different levels. Of course, you can also play the game solo too and you can choose who to play as with those options being Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.</p>
<p>The setting of Disney Illusion Island is the mysterious island of Monoth, which is split into three different biomes. Those areas are the leafy and overgrown Pavonia, the puzzling structures of Gizmopolis and the space styled oceans of Astrono. . All of the cutscenes are fully voiced and brand new characters will be introduced through the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-no-achievements-trophies-xbox-steam-1851775079<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love achievements in video games. I remember playing<em> Call of Duty 2</em> on Xbox 360 and getting my first one and thinking “Oh this is neat!” And over the last 20 years, I’ve grown to enjoy them more and more as they have become a digital  scrapbook documenting my gaming accomplishments across different platforms. Which is why I’m so sad that Nintendo, yet again, has decided not to implement an achievement system.  </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>When <em>Polygon </em>recently asked Nintendo vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen if the Switch 2 would have an Xbox 360-like achievement system, he simply answered: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Nope.”</a></span> It’s not surprising that Nintendo has made this decision as the company has avoided achievements for 20 years now, despite nearly every other video game platform and console implementing them in the meantime. Yet the way Trinen is so flippant in his answer rubs me the wrong way. It’s like Nintendo is too good for achievements or doesn’t seem them as useful. And that’s silly.</p><p>When done well, achievements can add an extra layer of replayability to a game. If you really love a game, it can be fun and challenging to work on getting every achievement. And in doing so, you’ll likely be forced to use weapons you never used before or experiment with mechanics you mostly avoided. A particularly tricky achievement might require some teamwork or planning. And that can be a blast in a game you already adore and now get to spend more time with.</p><p>Another aspect that I love about achievements is, as mentioned, the way they act like digital scrapbooks. Right now I can load up my Xbox achievements and see what I was playing in 2018. What games did I finish? What games did I spend a ton of time in, collecting everything? What games did I barely play? I can see all of that and more via my achievements, which act as an always-updating activity log that I can flip through years later. I can do this on Steam, PlayStation, and even my Android device for games that support Google Play’s achievement system. Meanwhile, Nintendo’s lack of achievements means I have to rely on each console’s limited activity tracking data to sort of piece together what I’ve played and done.</p><figure id="" data-id="32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-recommend-id="image://32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-format="png" data-width="831" data-height="868" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-recommend-id="image://32961b6e6a289329e8ee20b156016c57" data-format="png" data-width="831" data-height="868" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Devs have also been creating and implementing achievements and trophies for about two decades now, so it’s not like you’d be asking them to do much extra work. And I expect Nintendo would add their own fun spin to collecting achievements. Plus, the people who make <em>Super Mario</em>, <em>Pikmin</em>, and <em>Zelda </em>seem like they’d be able to devise some really creative challenges for you to pull off. </p><p> Look, if you don’t like earning achievements or trophies in games, that’s totally fine. I believe all platforms should let people turn that stuff off if they so desire. But for Nintendo to just ignore achievements entirely is strange. They can add a lot without really causing any problems. </p><p>Sadly, the Switch 2 won’t have achievements. Perhaps Nintendo will get around to adding this industry-standard feature in whatever comes after the Switch 2.  I hope so. It would be pretty dang cool. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
