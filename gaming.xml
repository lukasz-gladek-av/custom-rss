			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is hard at work on optimizing the game and making sure that the experience will be as good as possible.</p>
<p>In a new interview with Italian outlet <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/monster-hunter-wilds-intervistata-tgs-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a>, the game producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, designer Kaname Fujioka, and director Yuya Tokuda talked about optimization, saying that, while they cannot provide more details on the matter as of now, they hard at work on it to make sure the whole experience will be optimized in the best possible way. Seeing as there have been considerable improvements in terms of performance in the Tokyo Game Show 2024 build over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom one</a>, there's no doubt the team is already doing great work on this front.</p>
<p>In the new interview, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team also commented on cross-play and cross-save functionality, confirming that cross-play can be disabled at any time, even when searching for available quests, so hunters will have plenty of freedom in matchmaking to tailor the experience. Cross-save, on the other hand, is very difficult to implement in a game like this, but the team feels the issue is alleviated somewhat by the simultaneous release on PC and consoles, giving players the ability to pick their preferred platform and still be able to play with everyone else.</p>
<p>Speaking about online play, the Monster Hunter Wilds team also confirmed that some of the trademark social elements of the series will be back, and better than ever before, in the new entry in the series. When connected to an online lobby, for example, every player inside the lobby will appear in the base camp, so the new open-world setting isn't going to impact this aspect of the series negatively. Additionally, it will be possible to start a quest in different weather conditions thanks to a sort of weather forecast system that will let players choose a weather condition and let the hunter rest until the chosen time.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will also see a major change regarding balancing that will likely lead to more build variety. Offensive skills have been moved to weapons, thus giving players way more freedom with armor pieces. Additionally, the decorations system was changed to allow for a more flexible customization system.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 29th, 2025.</p>

<p>Deletion has been suspended effective from today at 1:08am Pacific time (that's around 4am Eastern), and the suspension counts for every world in the Aether, Crystal, Dynamis, and Primal data centers.</p>

<p>Square Enix says that it will "monitor the situation in the coming days" and announce when auto-demolition will begin again once a decision has been made. We don't know when that will be just yet, though.</p>
<p>When it does happen, the auto-demolition timer will continue from where it left off when it was paused, so you'll have exactly as much time to deletion as you did before the pause happened.</p>
<p>The studio closes by saying it hopes that "recovery is swift" for those affected by Hurricane Helene, and that those affected "will be able to rejoin us in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>soon".</p>

<p>Back in the mid-to-late 2000s, Blizzard started work on a project known as Titan. The game was set to be another MMORPG from the company behind World of Warcraft (WoW), but take place in a completely new and original setting. </p>



<p>There have been a few stories about the game’s development, the problems behind the scenes, and it’s ultimate cancellation. But many of it had been hearsay </p>



<p>Now, thanks to Jason Schreier’s new book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725443/?lens=grand-central-publishing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</a>, we have more of the story as to what happened with the project. Ahead of the book’s October 8th release, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/excerpt/458330/why-blizzard-mmo-titan-was-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon posted details from a section</a> of the book that dives head first into Titan and its development problems.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-survival-game-cancelled-engine/">Blizzard’s Survival Game Was Cancelled Because of Engine Issues</a></h6>



<p>According to the book, Blizzard didn’t want to wait for another game to come and be a “WoW killer”. Instead, the intended to create another MMO to do it themselves but keep players within the same ecosystem. There had been talks of doing something like a World of StarCraft game, but the internal belief was that StarCraft could fit into an MMORPG setting. </p>



<p>The decision was to then try something new.</p>



<h2 id="h-titan-team-started-small-at-blizzard">Titan Team Started Small At Blizzard</h2>



<p>Led by Blizzard vice president Rob Pardo, the team working on Titan started as a “small team of top developers” with an eventual goal to bring in the best developers, artists, and others over to the project. After a couple of years in development, it was being viewed as an “all-star team” being built.</p>



<p>The game was set on an alternate version of Earth in 2070 and was said to be “two games in one.”</p>



<p>“[P]layers [take] control of superhero-like characters who lived normal lives during the day and secretly battled against evil forces at night,” the Polygon story reads from the book. “An early presentation showed the player, as a professional chef, popping a dish into the oven before going off on a secret mission. When they returned, the dish was perfectly cooked and ready to serve.”</p>



<h2 id="h-playtests-had-concerns">Playtests Had Concerns</h2>



<p>As the game started playtesting, the game was “fun in isolation” but finding the core gameplay loop was something that just never found footing. The game’s combat had superhero classes with unique abilities but the continued engagement of players was a struggle to for the Titan team. There were also issues with the technology built specifically for Titan causing issues with the game’s development causing lag when use or problems that caused development to pause altogether.</p>



<p>It also didn’t help that Riot Games was hiring developers from the project over to work on League of Legends, which was in development at the time and released in 2009.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-starcraft-shooter-in-development-at-blizzard/">New StarCraft Shooter In Development At Blizzard</a></h6>



<p>Regarding the design of the game, it was said that things would regularly change or be moved in entirely different directions. There were also issues with a bloated art repository with artists working on something without realizing or being informed that it had already been completed in the past. </p>



<h2 id="h-finger-pointing-from-titan-developers-to-blizzard-leadership">Finger Pointing From Titan Developers To Blizzard Leadership</h2>



<p>As the struggles during development continued, developers on Titan ultimately pointed the blame at Pardo. They stated that he was viewed as an “absentee game director” due to him also overseeing StarCraft 2 and Diablo 3 at the time. It left him little time to lead the brand new IP.</p>



<p>Pardo, according to developers, would come in and out during the project’s development. When he would show up and get involved, it would often lead to months of work being thrown out after he wasn’t around for long periods of time.. The development team became demoralized as Pardo would shoot down ideas for the game without offering reasons or guidance of where the team should go next.</p>



<p>In 2013, it was then announced internally that the game was going to be rebooted before it was cancelled in 2014. </p>



<h2 id="h-a-costly-endeavour-for-blizzard">A Costly Endeavour For Blizzard</h2>



<p>After the cancellation of Titan by Blizzard, Pardo appeared to blame others for the game’s failing rather than taking accountability, according to the book. His actions throughout the development and beyond led to a loss of trust from other management at Blizzard. This had a number of executives and directors demanding Pardo’s removal from a position of leadership. Pardo took a sabbatical from the company after Titan was ended. He never returned as Pardo resigned from Blizzard at the behest of then-CEO Mike Morhaime.</p>



<p>Overall, development of the cancelled Titan project cost Blizzard roughly $80 million. However, rather than lose everything that was done, the company was able to repurpose various elements of the game into what would become Overwatch.</p>

While there's still a lot to be revealed about the game, the creative team behind Ghost Of Yotei wants players to know that this spiritual sequel won't be as repetitive as the original title. </p><p>"One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again," creative director Jason Connell told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>. "We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences."</p><p>Part of those unique experiences will involve the player exercising more control over the choices made by the game's heroine, Atsu. Although the story is set centuries after Ghost of Tsushima, Atsu has assumed the Ghost persona as her own. Players will also get to decide how Atsu fights her battles, with the option of using traditional melee weapons or switching to firearms. </p><p>Nate Fox, the game's other creative director, shared his desire to introduce a greater sense of danger to Ghost of Yotei that was inspired from Sucker Punch's location scouting at Shiretoko National Park.</p><p>"Inside the park, you have to watch a video telling you about the dangers of bears," recalled Fox. "Being in this incredibly beautiful park with jagged cliffs and water, yet all the time being aware there were dangerous bears, was electrifying... We strive to bring that into the video game--that feeling of danger."</p><p>Ghost of Yotei doesn't have a release date, but it will arrive on PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

            <p>I wasn't very well yesterday, and to make myself feel better I took to the internet to see what joys I could find tucked away in some corner or another. What I ended up finding was rather unexpected, but all the same very welcome.</p>
<p>You see, I came across a trailer for The Rocky Horror Video Game, an upcoming release from Bit Bot Media and Metal X Entertainment. And I think it looks kind of great, thanks to retro graphics and 8-bit chiptune renditions of The Rocky Horror Show's soundtrack to boot.</p>
<p>The game is described as a "bonkers classic platformer", which will allow players to relive the "strange journey of Brad and Janet like never before". You can check out the announcement trailer for The Rocky Horror Video Game below.</p>

<p>While the blurb has The Rocky Horror Video Game release date simply listed as "coming soon", according to the trailer itself it is set to arrive this month. So, something for Halloween.</p>
<p>The Rocky Horror Video Game is set to release across PC via Steam (although it doesn't appear to have a Steam page as yet), Playstation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>So, do you think the first thing players will be asked to do when booting up the game is "Jump to the left"? I certainly hope so!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260296/microsoft-xbox-research-developers-outreach<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft wants to hear from game developers who might be skipping Xbox or those already building games using the company’s developer tools. The software maker is expanding its Xbox Research team to include the community of game developers, seeking feedback directly from developers about tools, support, and the overall pain points of the Xbox platform.</p><p>A new program, much like Microsoft’s Xbox Insider one, <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/resources/xbox-research/">is now open</a> to all members of game studios, not just technical employees. “Typically, it takes a lot of people to make and ship a game, including marketing, user research, artists, audio, PMs, community managers, and more,” <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2024/09/how-xbox-research-is-shaping-the-future-of-game-development/">says Deborah Hendersen, PhD</a>, principal user researcher for Xbox. “We want to hear from everyone who works on games or helps support game studios because if we can make your life easier, it makes gaming better.”</p><p>While the program will gather feedback about tools, performance tuning, debugging utilities, and plenty of other aspects of game development, it’s also designed for input from game studios that aren’t shipping games on Xbox. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why,” says Hendersen. “And honestly, if you are using our competitor’s products, you probably have a great perspective we could learn from!”</p><p>Microsoft’s outreach for direct game developer feedback comes amid some noticeable delays for third-party releases on Xbox. <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> launched on Xbox <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993155/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-game-of-the-year">several months after</a> it first debuted on PS5, because of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23844418/baldurs-gate-3-xbox-release-series-x-s-cross-save-split-screen">technical issues</a> developing for the Xbox Series S. Capcom revealed last month that its two new fighting game collections —&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>&nbsp;— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234863/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-xbox-release-2025">will come to Xbox in 2025</a> after “technical discussions” with Microsoft.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is also coming to Xbox after its PS5 release, as its developers “are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.” Microsoft says “the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us,” and single-sourced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/29/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-an-exclusivity-deal/">reports</a> suggest there could be some kind of Sony exclusivity deal involved.</p><p>The developers of&nbsp;<em>Enotria: The Last Song </em>also publicly <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">announced an “indefinite delay”</a> to the Xbox version of the game last month, after struggling with Microsoft’s game review process. The studio’s statement about the issues <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1831359412897976811">caught the attention</a> of Xbox chief Phil Spencer, who reached out to the team to help resolve the situation.</p><p>Microsoft would obviously prefer to receive this type of feedback from game developers privately, to avoid potential headlines about game developers skipping the platform due to technical issues, tooling, or even processes. Hopefully, this expansion of Xbox Research will help address the pain points that prevent some game developers from releasing Xbox games.</p><div>

In the attic, Riley is surprised to find a stack of VHS tapes next to an old TV set. The tapes seem to be episodes of an early 2000s-era children’s cartoon they have never seen before. Intrigued, Riley pops the first tape into the VCR.</p><p>Relatively simplistic in appearance, it appears to have been made locally and features a little girl named Amanda and her loyal yet shy best friend, Wooly the Sheep. While the episode appears charming and straightforward on the surface, an uneasiness starts to settle in as Riley realizes that Amanda and Wooly seem to be communicating directly through the television set. A gnawing feeling in the back of their mind presses them to stop, but Riley is compelled to continue watching the tapes. It’s almost as if Amanda needs something, and Riley becomes fascinated with finding out what that something may be.</p><!-- AD: content -->

However, it didn't take long for the speedrunning community to find a major glitch that allows players to beat the game in under an hour.</p><p>The glitch gives Zelda the ability to warp to the game's final dungeon and bypasses most of the world at large and gives players a massive boost to their completition times.</p><p>"It's now possible to [warp] from after you beat the first dungeon to the final dungeon (although it softlocks)," reddit user xIceblue <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1ft6tfr/echoes_of_wisdom_game_breaking_glitch_discovered/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote in a post</a> with a video that shows how it's done.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-review-15-hours/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake will require over 15 hours to complete, according to one of the game's very first reviews.</p>
<p>Japanese magazine Famitsu reviewed the highly anticipated remake launching next week on PC and PlayStation 5 in this week's issue, awarding it a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fuez5j/famitsu_review_score_silent_hill_2_ps5_8999_3540/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35/40 score</a> (8/9/9/9), which is a little higher than the score the magazine awarded the original game (32/40). The review praised the sense of realism brought by the beautiful visuals, the game's unique atmosphere, revamped puzzles that feel more mentally taxing, and combat. The review also confirmed that it will take between 16 and 18 hours to complete the game for the first time, which is almost double the length of the original, so it will be very interesting to see how Bloober Team expanded the original.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the Silent Hill 2 remake is about to release on PC and PlayStation 5, but a release on other platforms is not to be ruled out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-wont-be-available-on-other-consoles-until-10-08-2025/">Last month</a>, it was confirmed that the game developed by Bloober Team will remain a PS5 exclusive until October 8th, 2025, so there's a good chance it will eventually launch on Xbox consoles and possibly the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake launches on October 8th on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can check out footage from the PC version of the game by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-hours-of-pc-gameplay-from-review-build/">here.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-developers-the-alters-delayed-to-2025.998595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios' upcoming "emotional sci-fi" game&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has officially been delayed to next year, with the studio citing a need to "optimize all mission-critical systems and ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/4697907940245503472" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which is, rather amusingly, written as though it's a message from the in-game company Ally Corp Communications), 11 bit pledges to "polish each phase of the project" with the additional development time.</p>
<p>The studio says that the initial demo phase of "Project Dolly" (referring to&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>) has "already exceeded expectations", but that "good is never enough" for Ally Corp, and so the delay has been put into effect in order to deliver "results that surpass our prior projections".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-delayed-chasm.jpg?itok=YKWTFVfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-delayed-chasm.jpg?itok=8ZZml9gI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While 11 bit doesn't go into any further detail regarding the delay to&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, we can, perhaps, find a little more context in a message <a href="https://x.com/gdansk_marcin/status/1841175005083934726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released to the studio's investors</a> recently.</p>
<p>In the message (for which we're using machine translation), 11 bit says it wants to give&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>a little room to breathe, and that the negative reception from some&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>fans blindsided the studio, so it wants to make sure that doesn't happen again for&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's worth noting that 11 bit's stock <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shares-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release-2024-09-23/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plummeted recently</a>, with analysts suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s Steam numbers had come in under expectations.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, 11 bit itself appears to disagree with this assessment; the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k">announced recently</a> that&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold 350,000 copies and has already made back its development and marketing costs.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, it's a sci-fi adventure game that contains elements of survival, base-building, and "confronting your own multiverse life choices", per 11 bit.</p>
<p>The game casts you as worker Jan Dolski, who becomes trapped on a distant planet and who must confront alternate versions of himself (the "alters" of the title), each of whom "has a different personality and background".</p>

Following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208868/amd-announces-fluid-motion-frames-2-less-lag-less-jitter-when-its-faking-more-frames-for-you">its technical preview</a> in July, <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/boost-gaming-performance-by-2-5x-with-amd-software-adrenalin/ba-p/711458">Fluid Motion Frames 2 (AFMF 2) is now widely available</a> after being released on Tuesday alongside its supporting Adrenalin 24.9.1 GPU driver.</p><p>AFMF is a frame generation technology similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841148/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction-ray-tracing-quality">Nvidia’s DLSS Frame Generation</a> but operates on the driver level instead of game-specific integration. The second-gen AFMF update can be enabled in OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX 11, or DirectX 12 games — meaning FPS can now be improved in titles that don’t support FSR and DLSS — and currently works on AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, 700M, and 800M GPUs.</p><div><figcaption><em>According to AMD’s tests, AFMF 2 (alongside other optimizations) can provide an impressive frame rate boost compared to raw game performance.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>AFMF 2 can increase FPS by up to 250 percent “on average,” according to AMD, but that was tested in combination with the company’s FSR 2 tech and Hypr-RX optimization suite. Actual performance will vary by GPU, game, and resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjAhju5VGX4?feature=shared&amp;t=3824"><em>Digital Foundry</em> reports</a> FPS was boosted “typically in the 2x range” when it tested the AFMF 2 beta in <em>Control</em>, <em>CyberPunk 2077</em>, and <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> at 4K using a Radeon RX 7900 GRE GPU.</p><p>The AFMF update notably includes fast motion optimization, which should address issues from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24048904/amd-fluid-motion-frames-frame-geneation-directx-11-12-feature-support">the first generation of AFMF</a> that disabled frame generation in games displaying fast movements. AMD has also added two AI-optimized adjustable modes for AFMF 2 that allow users to control how the feature impacts game performance. Search Mode adjusts the FPS smoothness and image quality in games during fast-motion scenes, while Performance Mode can boost AFMF efficiency on low-power devices.</p><p>AFMF 2 supports borderless full-screen game modes on RX 7000 GPUs and AMD’s Radeon Chill low-latency FPS cap to limit the lag that FPS boosters can inflict. Outside of gaming, it also provides a new “geometric downscaling” feature that can reduce aliasing and other visual artifacts when videos are played in a window smaller than their native resolution. This is supported in DirectX 11 apps running on Radeon RX 7000 and integrated Radeon 800M GPUs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for all of the new game’s openness and emphasis on playing how you want, its most brilliant innovation feels like an inspired reworking of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics">2019 <em>Link’s Awakening </em>remake’s</a> clunkiest feature.</p><p>Though the recent <em>Link’s Awakening </em>was a (largely) faithful remake of its Game Boy-era predecessor, the Grezzo-produced title switched things up with a toyetic 3D design, improved controls, and a new dungeon creation mode clearly inspired by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9240795/super-mario-maker-review-nintendo-wii-u"><em>Super Mario Maker</em></a>. After fighting your way through the game’s traditional dungeons, you could build your own in a creepy little shack using chamber tiles modeled after various rooms you had already explored.&nbsp;</p><p>There was never really an element of surprise to these Chamber Dungeons because you were in charge of choosing what went inside them while following a number of rules about how chamber tiles could be arranged. And while your original dungeons could be used as a reliable way to rack up easy rupees, the game’s lack of an online component made it impossible to share your creations, which was a significant part of <em>Super Mario Maker</em>’s appeal.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Also key to the <em>Super Mario Maker</em>’s success was the simple fact that user-created courses could be a lot of <em>fun </em>to play through, and the title as a whole was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9239911/super-mario-maker-wii-u-game-design">a very clever exercise in teaching basic video game design</a>. Chamber Dungeons were a good idea, but in practice, <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-s-awakenings-chamber-dungeons-are-a-big-dis-1838038985#:~:text=This%20feels%20like%20a%20rudimentary,of%20the%20Game%20Boy%20classic.">their repetitiveness and inflexibility</a> didn’t give <em>Link’s Awakening </em>all that much replay value.</p></div><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Dampé, who helps you create custom dungeons in the Link’s Awakening remake, returns in Echoes of Wisdom.</figcaption> <p><cite>Nintendo</cite></p></div></div><p>While a more refined iteration of Chamber Dungeons could still make for a novel gaming experience, the mechanic — much like Link himself — is largely absent as we knew it in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the franchise’s first mainline entry to turn Zelda into the playable protagonist. But rather than completely scrap the core concepts that initially made Chamber Dungeons an intriguing proposition, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>taps into them from a different and more imaginative angle.</p><p>As <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s hero, Zelda and her companion Tri journey out into Hyrule equipped with the Tri Rod — a new magical key item that works a bit like <em>A Link to the Past</em>’s Cane of Somaria. But unlike the Cane, which gave Link the power to create single square blocks to climb on or push, the Tri Rod grants Zelda the ability to conjure multiple copies (referred to as “echoes”) of various objects and monsters she encounters on her adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the game gives you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">a handful of other useful items</a>, the Tri Rod’s echoes are Zelda’s most powerful weapons to use in battle as she searches for a way to close the interdimensional rifts popping up all over Hyrule.&nbsp;</p><p>Some echoes — like the Boomerang Boarblin and Bombfish — basically give you a quick way of whipping up the classic <em>Zelda </em>weapon their names reference. But far more of them are just glowing replicas of the hostile creatures like ReDeads and Darknuts that you commonly find in <em>Zelda </em>overworlds and dungeons.</p><p>When Nintendo first revealed <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, echoes — which disappear after receiving a certain amount of damage — seemed like a riff on <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s approaches to providing players with weapons. But in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1%2F">a recent interview about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s development process</a>, director Tomomi Sano and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">series producer Eiji Aonuma</a> explained that the idea for a <em>Zelda</em> title built around the concept of copying / pasting objects actually began as part of a plan for a game focused on Link creating custom dungeons.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption>An early test build of a Zelda game focused on dungeon building.</figcaption> <p><cite>Nintendo</cite></p></div></div><p>As Aonuma played through an early demo, he started thinking that “while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies.” And while the team was already about a year into building an “edit dungeon”-style game, Anonuma felt that the copy / paste mechanic “had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games if the gameplay was changed to use ‘echoes’ instead.”</p><p>Coming after <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom, </em>which some fans knocked for their relative lack of traditional <em>Zelda </em>dungeons, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>feels like a return to the basics in some ways. Individual, themed dungeons filled with small keys and minibosses abound and call on you to solve puzzles to unlock their hidden secrets. Though Zelda can move things around using bind, there’s only so much she can change about the way the new game’s literal dungeons are designed. But the brilliant trick baked into <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>is how it turns the whole of Hyrule into a new kind of dungeon, conceptually, and makes you its intrepid master.</p><p>When I first started playing <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the focus on learning echoes of ordinary inanimate objects to help Zelda made the game feel like a standard top-down dungeon crawler that was trying to make me think more about how to move through space vertically. Table echoes could be used to give the short princess a boost, and stacks of heart-restoring beds could be fashioned into makeshift staircases. Those kinds of echoes all gave me different ways of navigating Zelda out of a jail cell, which felt like a crash course in the game’s stealth missions. But once I was out in the open world and learned my first monster echoes, it was surprising to see that I had to be familiar with a creature’s behavioral patterns to wield it effectively in combat.</p><p><em>Zelda </em>dungeons aren’t just elaborate buildings filled with puzzles and locked doors; they’re places where monsters live, and those monsters’ actions play a significant role in shaping a dungeon’s identity. The same goes for environmental hazards like fire, water, and ice, which can all help or harm you depending on how you interact with them. <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>doesn’t allow you to create your own bespoke dungeons per se, but it does give Zelda many of a dungeon’s fundamental building blocks to play with. And the deeper you get into the game’s literal dungeons, the more it pushes you to fight by sending monsters into battle — almost as if Zelda herself was thinking the way a dungeon designer would.</p><p>There’s a narrative poetry to the way Zelda’s first mainline outing in her own ongoing legend is one in which her power is reshaping the world and using its rules to her advantage. It’s a framing that presents her as both a princess and a kind of dungeon master — and shows how, 40 years in, Nintendo is still finding fantastic ways to make <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>’s old ideas feel new.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One blemish on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne and Liberty</a>’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazons-new-free-to-play-mmorpg-throne-and-liberty-is-coming-for-the-banana-games-crown">so far up the Steam charts</a> it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMORPG</a> having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDeckGaming/status/1841107699036979648">trickling in</a> of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.</p>

<p>As for what <em>actually</em> happened with Easy Anti-Cheat, it sounds like either developers NCSoft or publishers Amazon Games simply neglected to enable Easy Anti-Cheat support for the Linux-powered SteamOS in the final release build. Judging by <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/proton">Valve’s documentation</a>, this isn’t a complicated process – perhaps hence why it was overlooked – but it does require a dash of manual input. Without this, the game assumes that EAC is missing, and blocks off online play completely rather than potentially let any do-badders in while its guard is down.</p><p>No-one seems to have been outright banned as a result of attempting to play on a Steam Deck, so this could be considered a happy ending. Definitely more so than other recent cases we’ve seen where anti-cheat has proven a stumbling block to portable compatibility: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-was-unleashed-on-the-steam-deck-but-only-for-one-day">Wuthering Waves</a> was only briefly playable on the Deck before an update blocked it off again, and despite how the BattlEye anti-cheat software can easily be made compatible with SteamOS, its addition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> last month involved Rockstar just... <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-online-is-no-longer-supported-by-steam-deck-thanks-to-a-slightly-baffling-rockstar-anti-cheat-update">choosing not to</a>? I guess? And the less said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-wont-get-steam-deck-support-epic-ceo-blames-cheaters">Fortnite</a>, the better.</p>
<p>Throne and Liberty, at least, is now having an easier time of it. I’m prodigiously bad at guessing how games will fare in Valve’s Steam Deck Verified ranking system, but if I were to simply ignore that and speculate anyway, I’d go for 'Playable': some of the UI text is absolutely microscopic on the 7in screen, but it controls fine, and typically runs above 30fps on Low settings. I’d swap FSR upscaling from Balanced to Quality mode, though, just to make character models look less like they’re disintegrating into sand when they move.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In 2019, head of publishing Andrey Tsvetkov&nbsp;joined the company to build up a self-publishing arm, and after 5 years and the acquisition of publisher Meta Publishing, the company's ready share its success with other developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Launching a new game publisher in 2024 is a bold choice. The last year hasn't just seen thousands of developer layoffs, it's seen a number of games dramatically undersell and put publishers and developers out of business. In an interview with Game Developer, Tsvetkov seemed keenly aware of that fact, telling us that the company is working hard to prepare its signed games for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main goal, he said, is to help signed developers "walk the path we have already walked." "We know the challenges that await them in this process, so we want to make sure they are avoiding them. After creating three games in a row, we actually know what kinds of pipelines, what kinds of budgets, and what kinds of efforts one needs to create these kinds of experiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A creative vision and backing from an experience publisher aren't enough to succeed on their own—which is why Tsvetkov believes the number one thing developers pitching him should prepare for is to explain how their game can stand out in a given market.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/owlcat-games-opens-third-party-narrative-game-focused-publishing-label" target="_self">Owlcat Games opens third-party, narrative game-focused publishing label</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Owlcat Games' publishing terms favor developers (but it can only help so many teams)">Owlcat Games' publishing terms favor developers (but it can only help so many teams)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers interested in pitching a narrative title to Owlcat Games can expect what Tsvetkov described as favorable terms if they make it all the way to the end. The company isn't interested in taking ownership over intellectual property, and it favors revenue splits that give developers a greater chunk of the change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He couldn't give specifics on signed contracts, but said revenue splits at Owlcat might start at "around 20-25 percent" (for the publisher), then change for "later stages of the product lifecycle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Owlcat apparently isn't just looking for interesting-looking games, but also a sense that there's a core team behind them who can maintain focus on their pitched product even while scaling up the team. If a game doesn't make the cut, Tsvetkov said he's happy to give feedback so developers can pitch themselves better elsewhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The label's first two published games are both striking. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/">Rue Valley</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a narrative RPG in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that uses RPG-like systems to explore a character's inner psyche, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173980/Shadow_of_the_Road/">Shadow of the Road</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an isometric RPG akin to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> set in an alternate history Japan. But what, it's worth asking, made these games stand out from other pitched titles?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer, Tsvetkov said, has to do with how well they can compete with similar games—even ones a decade old. "Right now you're competing with games that are seven, eight, ten years old and are in good shape," he said. "They still look great and you can buy them for $5 on sale."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In isolation that can be a depressing fact, but Tsvetkov seemed to see it as an opportunity. "If you approach with a pitch, we evaluate on our side [and ask] 'what is the market share for this game?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here "market share" refers to the genre a game operates in. Some games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might birth a whole new "genre" that captures player interest, other polished titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might knock down the competition that previously dominated the field. Both options are on the table, but the size of the market will impact what kinds of budgets Owlcat is comfortable with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rue Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for instance, gets to build on the success and mechanics of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game that has sparked a few imitators, but it's still early enough that not many game studios have launched big-budget follow-ups. (Unfortunately for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer ZA/UM, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-za-um-writers-allege-studio-has-become-a-cold-careless-company-">its struggles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may mean it's not putting one out anytime soon either...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Road</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competes in the same market as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (and even Owlcat Games' own turn-based RPGs), but it has a unique setting and gameplay hook for players looking for a fresh take on the genre. Owlcat was willing to bet on both games' success.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Think carefully about what makes your game special">Think carefully about what makes your game special</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For developers inspired by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success, he advised them to be cautious just jumping into the genre because it's relatively unexplored. "It's not about the mindset of 'oh I've seen the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I need to know how to recreate that,'" he said. "It's about 'I have a story I want to tell that's really deep inside me,' and then you can do it with [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">]'s gameplay."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key lesson developers might want to take from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success isn't the subject matter or specific game mechanics, it's that more players want to engage with RPG systems that center the story more than they enable deep complexity with combat builds and character classes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tsvetkov's advice is familiar in some ways—developers need strong creative ideas and a good sense of how they'll bring a game to life to land publishing deals or investors. But his invitation to explore the market share a game is breaking into may help developers spot opportunities in new genres—or see how to thrive in one dominated by beloved classics.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-live-goes-down-following-playstation-outage/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox Live went down today following an outage reported at PlayStation, with a huge outage that started on Monday night. The PSN services were only reported back to being online yesterday, although it's claimed that the outage ended after several hours. While the official PSN Service Status page said all services were up and running on Tuesday morning, it quickly slipped back into the red at 8.25 AM ET / 5.25 AM PT / 1.25 PM BST. Overall, it's said that the outage lasted for roughly eight hours and impacted every PlayStation system, including PS Vita and PlayStation 3, all the way up to PS5. Today, Xbox Live has reported an outage. As of 2.33 PM BST / 9.33 ET / 6.33 PT, it was reported on their <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1841471647531803028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official X page that the outage</a> was resolved. However, as seen by the image below, there are still significant outages in sections of Xbox, with there being no guarantee that players will be able to access their games during the outage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>PlayStation and Xbox weren't the only companies to experience recent outages. Yesterday, Steam was also down for a while in parts of the world.&nbsp; Although, it seems that the Steam outages were very brief, and only required those using the app to restart it.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation outage, it seems it took them quite a while to resolve the issue, as those trying to use their console weren't even able to play single-player games that needed to sign-in online, as well as multiplayer games being off of the table. Offline games were reportedly safe to play and caused no issues.</p>
<p>Compared to Xbox, Sony didn't acknowledge the outage on social media accounts, and the only post that was made was a statement on a<a href="https://x.com/AskPS_JP/status/1840930118379970616" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Japanese PlayStation support page</a> telling users and game developers to notify players that the servers were offline. Additionally, Sony hasn't announced what caused the outage, so it is up in the air as too what was the reason for the outage happening in the first place.</p>
<p>Although Xbox is still suffering outages in some of the places on their overall network, they have handled the situation much faster than <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-class-lawsuit-against-sony-set-to-go-to-trial-in-march-2026/">Sony</a>, as well as able to inform the consumers about what is going on retroactively, compared to Sony, who decided to stay completely silent on the issue, despite people not having access to any online features for over eight hours.</p>

It is him who created the story of Yanus—a private investigator with a troubled past, now trying to solve an unexpected case revolving around a stolen data carrier, all this while fighting his own inner demons, the urban gangs and a nigh-omnipotent corporation responsible for the downfall of the city he used to call his own.</p><p>The game offers solid combat and movement systems, as well as a modular weapon upgrade system, thanks to which the players striding through the dark corners of the city may make every encounter feel and look different. <a title="Genres > Action [2,220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-packed levels with <a title="Genres > Stealth [70 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> elements, hacking, and environmental puzzle solving are intertwined with more slow-paced sequences of city exploration, side quests, and storytelling.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A unique, inherently Slavic take on the cyberpunk world is sure to leave none indifferent thanks to its sharp, caustic sense of humor and a slightly pessimistic outlook at the neon-grey shades of the surrounding reality, at the same time providing a much needed breath of fresh air to the genre itself.</p><p>As a team, the question we asked ourselves was: what was the world going to look like in a couple of decades? How would a hypothetical Central and Eastern European city and its inhabitants differ from, say, <em>Blade Runner</em>‘s Los Angeles or <em>Akira</em>‘s Neo Tokyo?</p><p>The attempts to answer this puzzle has had a tremendous deal of influence upon the game’s artistic choices, including a mix of futuristic-esque and overly outdated technologies, the grim, brutalist architecture typical of the post-communist countries, the character’s not-so-obvious moral choices and the often crudely makeshift, yank-and-tuck character and atmosphere of an environment overpacked with people forced to cope with the uneven distribution of goods and wealth, often relying on their wits and sheer luck to make it to the next paycheck without losing their minds.</p><p>The <em>SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</em> story goes to show that there is more than meets the eye to this dystopian version of the future is, and it is only up to the players to discover what lies beneath the neon glow and the concrete streets – helping Yanus unravel his last case and find out just how brutal and ugly the truth may actually be.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Built thousands of years ago, the tower Megaryon is home to countless secrets, including those related to the true masters of this mechanical behemoth. As Ikarus sets off on this <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,796 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> to ascend the tower, he is accompanied by Phi, a mysterious wandering µbot created through Megaryon’s autonomous operations.

To assist your climb, use elevators between levels to heal and use your resources to upgrade your abilities.

            <p>The Alters - the upcoming release from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> team 11 bit Studios, described as an "emotional" sci-fi game featuring plenty of cloning action - has been delayed.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, which has been laid out like a letter to the game's main character Jan Dolski, the studio said this delay will allow time to "optimise all mission-critical systems", while ensuring "every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible" on the game's release.</p>
<p>This note added that reception to the game so far had been positive, but "good" is "never enough" for Ally Corp, the company coordinating Jan's rescue from the hostile planet he is trying to escape from within the narrative of The Alters.</p>

<p>"This additional time will allow us to polish each phase of the project, delivering results that surpass our prior projections - an outcome that benefits both Ally Corp and, naturally, yourself," the delay announcement reads.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience and ongoing commitment to Ally Corp's mission."</p>
<p>The Alters is currently slated to release on an unspecified date during the first quarter of 2025, having previously been pegged to debut this year.</p>

<p>"It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Your first new car is the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII MR GSR '04, which...well, to be honest, that's a mighty fine bunch of numbers and letters, but I'm not enough of a car enthusiast to know what they mean. I'm sure it's fast, though!</p>
<p>You're also getting the Nissan GT-R Premium Edition T-spec '24, a speedy-looking sports car with a pretty beautiful dashboard, as well as the Toyota Hiace Van DX '16, which won't be winning any races but which looks like a sturdy and reliable enough little vehicle.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new World Circuit events, including the Sunday Cup, which takes place on the Tokyo Expressway, as well as the Circuit de Sainte-Croix's Nissan GT-R Cup and the Kyoto Driving Park's Evolution Meeting.</p>
<p>More tracks have also been made compatible with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI, so you've got more places to test your skills against this advanced driving intelligence. Just don't be ashamed if you lose; that's what it's built for, after all.</p>

<p>This update is the latest in a long string of content drops for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, which have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-physics-new-cars">brought plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144">new cars</a> to the game since it launched back in March 2022, as well as new tracks and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully, some of these updates have been able to take the sting out of Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted">delisting&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em>without warning</a> back in January, which probably left a fair few racing fans in the lurch.</p>
<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>. Update 1.52 is due to arrive tomorrow, so make sure you're ready for it when it's up for download!</p>

<p>Nintendo has taken down another popular Nintendo Switch emulator as its war on emulation continues on all fronts. According to the social media accounts for the platform, the Ryujinx emulator has been shut down after the developer was “offered an agreement” by Nintendo.</p>



<p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he’s in control of,” developer riperiperi said in the <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">software’s Discord server</a>. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it’s safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p>







<p>As of writing, all of the emulators files have been removed from GitHub, the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download page</a> on the Ryujinx website is empty,  and there are no more official updates coming to the software.</p>



<p>Ryujinx shutting down is the latest in a long line of Nintendo going after emulators and emulation in general. Earlier this year they had Switch emulator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu shut down</a>. They also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-going-after-more-people-with-lawsuits/">multiple lawsuits</a> going regarding emulation and piracy.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/in-defence-of-alien-isolation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Across the many stories set in the Alien universe, there’s evidence to suggest the xenomorphs are part of some kind of hivemind that, at some level, operates as a collective consciousness. The same cannot be said for IGN: This website is the work of a large group of individuals with varied – and sometimes directly conflicting – perspectives on pretty much every single game. But a review, by its very nature, can only reflect the perspective of one person. A decade ago, our own Ryan McCaffrey <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review">gave Alien: Isolation a 5.9 in his review</a>, noting that, among other things, its genuine scares were “diluted by repetition and padding.” He wasn’t alone in that reaction, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alien-isolation-review/1900-6415897/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other major review outlets</a> gave it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/3/6142209/alien-isolation-review-xbox-one-PS4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">similar scores for similar reasons</a>. Today, approaching its 10th anniversary, I’m here to (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/23/alien-isolation-is-the-bravest-game-of-2014">once again</a>) respectfully dissent and offer a different perspective: I love Alien: Isolation. It is one of my favourite games of all time. And, even after all these years, it remains a singular, terrifying triumph.</p><p>When Alien: Isolation arrived in 2014, I was working at a different website. As the year drew to a close, I wrote that I believed Creative Assembly’s take on survival horror was <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/alien-isolation/best-games-of-2014-alien-isolation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best game of the year</a>. I re-read that piece after recently replaying the whole campaign and found that everything I loved about it at launch remains what I love about it today. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/alien-isolation-02-1727781493029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The headliner of the whole event is, of course, the xenomorph itself: a landmark piece of enemy AI engineering. Creative Assembly somehow managed to turn lines of code into a creature that appears genuinely, terrifyingly alive. Despite operating almost entirely without a scripted sequence of actions, every encounter with it feels as though it was perfectly authored to generate maximum tension. The way it learns from your actions, such as investigating lockers after discovering you use them to hide, is truly unnerving. </p><p>On the ‘hard’ difficulty level, when the AI is firing on all cylinders, the xenomorph truly is the ultimate foe depicted in the movies, and so I can understand why this tougher challenge is listed as the “recommended way to experience the game” in the main menu. But while this mode is more accurate to the experience of Ellen Ripley, it is perhaps not the best way to experience Alien: Isolation for the very first time. Without prior understanding of the systems, many of which are bespoke or subversive, a playthrough on the ‘medium’ difficulty level is the better starting place. Ryan sadly fell afoul of this for his review, where he understandably opted for ‘hard’ based on that menu prompt. Better phrasing would have helped here – I’d describe hard mode as the ‘faithful Alien experience’ rather than the recommended one. There are still plenty of scares to be had on the lower settings.  </p><p>I’d assumed, after 10 years and plenty of documentation of how it all works, those scares would have dissipated – just as more recent Alien movies have lost the element of surprise because we know so much about the xenomorph life cycle. I was wrong. Despite a small contingency of well-executed pretenders in the likes of Amnesia: The Bunker’s monster and the Resident Evil 2 remake’s Mr. X, there’s still nothing that truly compares to Alien: Isolation’s authentic-feeling intelligence.   </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The alien’s sharp hunting ability is the catalyst for one of the most interesting stealth games of the era.</p></div><p>The gameplay implications of that intelligence were one of the things Ryan criticised in his review, noting that it forced a restrictive structure of hiding and waiting for the xenomorph to move on every time it interrupted your journey. I can understand where he was coming from, since a long history of games had conditioned many people to play that way, but from my point of view, I see the alien’s sharp hunting ability as the catalyst for one of the most interesting stealth games of the era because of how it boldly defies conventions. </p><p>Up until that point, the stealth genre was built on observation and pattern recognition: understanding how an enemy’s regular patrol path can be interrupted and exploited. The xenomorph, however, has no regular path to exploit, making it unpredictable. Your approach has to be much more reactive and, as a result, more authentic to the reality of the situation. This can, depending on your stomach, force you into hiding in lockers and beneath desks. The more interesting approach, though, is to make extensive use of Isolation’s tools. The throwable noise makers and flares act as distractions, pulling the alien away to open up new routes. Emergency override buttons lock down doors, putting a hard barrier between you and it. Smoke bombs and rewired air purification systems hide you from view at the cost of your own vision. Through smart (and, admittedly, risky) use of these tools, you can <em>sort of</em> wrangle your hunter.       </p><p>While the xenomorph plays by its own rules as it stalks you, Alien: Isolation does make use of observation and pattern recognition in a different way. It is one of the best examples of purposeful sound design in the history of games, with unique audio markers for everything the xenomorph does. Dull thuds from above note the alien’s presence in the air ducts, revealing that it’s close but not yet a direct threat. The clatter of metal and a rattlesnake-like hiss signals that it has emerged from a vent and is now in the environment with you. The heavy thud of its striding footsteps are perfectly calibrated to indicate which direction it approaches from, while the increasingly panicked tones of your motion tracker emphasise its proximity. And, eventually, a scuttle and scrape on steel signals that your foe has finally retreated back into the ducts.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/alien-isolation-01-1727783673311.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>All this hide-and-seek stealth gameplay is supported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-isolations-terrifying-introduction-to-the-perfect-predator-art-of-the-level">exceptional level design</a>. Every zone of the vast, sprawling Sevastopol Station is built around sightlines, with plenty of windows and looping corridors to allow for clear (and, occasionally, purposefully unclear) vision of your environment and the alien. The air ducts that snake through these levels offer life-saving hidden paths that bypass the alien… although they purposefully never lead you quite where you want to go, ensuring emerging from them is always a tense experience. </p><p>The design of each area frequently loops and folds in on itself, cementing the sense Sevastopol is a coherent, functional whole rather than a video game level. Within each mission, the use of backtracking grants you familiarity and, eventually, mastery over an area, akin to the design of Resident Evil 2 and Silent Hill 2. There’s also backtracking built into the overall campaign design, which evokes Dark Souls’ interconnectedness. Within that environment, Creative Assembly took a Metroidvania-inspired approach to using new tools on old locked doors, so the station expands in new ways with every deck revisited. </p><p>All of those decks and corridors, of course, still look absolutely gorgeous even 10 years later; the meticulous recreation of the 1979 film’s retrofuturism is well documented, but in 2024 it’s the lighting that really impresses. The darkness is primarily lit by indirect sources, lending the entire playspace a distinct visual identity. The glow of computer monitors, projectors, and emergency bulbs softly illuminate each room, gently highlighting trails of volumetric smoke and leaving darkness in every corner. And while Creative Assembly’s bespoke engine is able to render dynamic lighting, much of the final effect is created through careful use of baked-in shadows. It’s proof that artistic intention can trump technical brawn; there’s no ray tracing here, but it really doesn’t matter that every light isn’t dynamic when everything is so fine-tuned by hand. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Through the flamethrower, Creative Assembly brilliantly replicates the Final Girl trope.</p></div><p>The xenomorph and the Sevastopol are impressively designed, then, but together they produce some of the most stressful gameplay in modern(ish) memory. Creative Assembly shows a strong understanding of what our limits are, though, and so the campaign undulates between stretches of alien encounters and other gameplay styles. The most stressful sections are often followed by quieter, safer periods of exploration and puzzle solving. There are also variations on the stealth systems. Sequences with the creepy Working Joe androids or human security staff use more traditional stealth gameplay, with the option to avoid enemies or engage with lethal force. But – akin to sections with the alien – these stealth encounters have an interesting twist thanks to their intersection with survival horror mechanics. Limited ammunition for your very loud weapons means engaging is a risky endeavour in multiple ways, while the incredibly powerful bolt gun must go through a lengthy charge-up process before releasing the trigger, adding tension to every headshot. Stealth has always been a game of risk and reward, but Isolation’s trickiest encounters force you to really think on the implications of every action.  </p><p>All this mechanical variety contributes to a strong sense of pace; you can practically feel the campaign breathing in and out, although you can never quite predict how deep or shallow each of those breaths will be. My favourite aspect of Alien: Isolation’s pacing, though, is its use of the flamethrower. Picked up roughly halfway through the near 20-hour campaign, its searing emissions are the only thing that can force the indestructible xenomorph to flee. In the final third, when you discover there are multiple aliens infesting the station and their behaviour becomes increasingly aggressive, the flamethrower becomes vital to your survival. Armed with its power, you become more confident. You’re given the strength to walk the corridors upright rather than constantly crouched. Inevitably, you shout “Get away from me, you bitch!” at the TV as you hold down the trigger. Through the flamethrower, Creative Assembly brilliantly replicates the Final Girl trope; after a dozen hours of desperate survival and learning your enemy’s mode of operation, it’s time to finally stand up for yourself. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/alien-isolation-03-1727783941137.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The time it takes to reach that point is a common criticism. Ryan’s review, as well as many others that were much more positive overall, posit that Alien: Isolation is simply much too long. It’s an idea I reject – that aforementioned pacing means the campaign doesn’t outstay its welcome, at least in terms of gameplay design. It’s a clear demonstration of how we all have different responses, even to the things we collectively agree on. And, as my own thoughts on length and pacing shows, even some of the most glowing assessments don’t always correlate with your own positive experiences.</p><p>What I will concede, though, is that the final third is flawed in terms of narrative and objective design. As Ryan correctly identified, it suffers from ‘Return of the King syndrome’, with the final stretch featuring a number of false finales that try your patience. There’s also a reliance on backtracking under pressure, which instead of feeling organic seems included purely to induce panic and frustration. But rather than cut the campaign short, I’d rather Create Assembly had shuffled its last act objectives to make them feel more meaningful. Like any good Alien story, after leaving Sevastopol you discover that one final xenomorph has infiltrated your escape vessel. But instead of acting as a killer final sequence, this story beat is an underbaked obligation. There’s no exploration of the ship, no clever solution to the problem – just a quick-time event button press and a disappointing cut to black. I wish the extended retreat from Sevastopol Station had been condensed in order to allow more time on the escape ship, enabling a much more significant and satisfying “you thought it was over…” twist and subsequent alien extermination.</p><p>Even so, I maintain that the vast majority of Alien: Isolation is nothing short of brilliant, and while GameSpot, Polygon, and The Toronto Sun all put out reviews along the same lines as Ryan’s, Alien Isolation eventually landed on a score of 79 on Metacritic. It’s safe to say those reviews were outliers among critics. To be fair, so am I – just in the opposite direction. There’s no shame in that; we are all outliers on one game or another, and if you write enough reviews (especially before you know how other people will react) the same thing will inevitably happen to you.  Opinions, eh?</p><p>It may not be fully universally beloved, but in 2024 Alien: Isolation has many fans who remember it as something special – its user scores currently stand at 8.3 on Metacritic, 8.2 on our Playlist app, and ‘very positive’ on Steam. It’s considered a landmark horror game. And, understandably, there’s a lot of upset among those fans over its disappointing sales that led to a lack of sequel (some like to blame IGN for that, but we certainly don’t have anywhere near that much power! The reality likely lies in Alien: Isolation being an incredibly challenging stealth horror game, a niche with a limited audience). </p><p>But while I can see how a successor could have iterated upon what we have, I think the wider Alien franchise is a demonstration of why Isolation is best left as a single entity. Returning to its design would likely result in an Alien 3 (an admirably flawed attempt at the same terror) or Alien: Romulus (a beautiful facsimile that ultimately offers the same old hits). There’s a reason James Cameron armed all his characters with pulse rifles for Aliens, but I don’t think you could pull the same trick with an Alien: Isolation 2 and still give fans the very specific thrills they crave.</p><p>Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe Creative Assembly had a killer idea for whatever may have come next, and publisher Sega never gave them the chance to realise it. But a sequel isn’t required to affirm the brilliance of the original. What we have is perhaps not quite a perfect stealth game organism, but it’s something damn close. It’s an unforgettable feat of video game design that has successfully endured the test of time, and – like the 1979 film from which it burst forth – will undoubtedly still hold up after another decade has passed. Today, on its 10th anniversary, Alien: Isolation remains a singular, extraordinary experience. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Alien: The Complete Video Game Playlist</h3><p>Here are all games set in the Alien universe, including games based on Ridley Scott's Alien, James Cameron's Aliens, and the rest.
