            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fbc-firebreak-preview-synergistic-mayhem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy is well-known for being wonderfully weird, so it’s no surprise to learn that <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>is an exercise in using the insane to kill the horrifying demon-like Hiss. It’s mechanically dense with a lot of interconnected systems that has a few rough edges but a strong heart.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Firebreak </em>is set six years after the events of <em>Control </em>and takes you back to some iconic locations in the Oldest House. In those six years, the Hiss have done a lot to make The Oldest House home, so it’s up to you and a couple of friends to clear them out.</p>

<h2>Firebreak is Like Left 4 Dead But a Whole Lot More</h2>

<p>A co-op shooter made of teams of three, <em>Firebreak </em>will give you <em>Left 4 Dead</em> vibes fairly quickly when you first start to play the game. The more you understand its mechanics, however, the more you’ll come to see all they share is the hordes of enemies to contend with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the guns in Firebreak are pretty ineffective and inefficient when it comes to killing the Hiss. You will quickly become overrun, and while there are means to keep getting ammunition more or less indefinitely, it won’t be enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s where the special weaponry and Crisis Kits come into play. Crisis Kits are classes that come with specific weapons and tools. We had access to three but there will be five on launch. For example, the Fix Kit gives you a big wrench that lets you quickly repair things like healing stations or maybe deploy a turret mounted to a wheeled office chair that will shoot wildly at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Utilizing the abilities and special weaponry within your kits is absolutely the key to <em>Firebreak</em>. As mentioned, guns will only get you so far. Even more, while the kits themselves offer a lot of firepower, their synergy is their greatest strength.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They get more nuanced and complex than this, but an example is the synergy between the Jump Kit and the Splash Kit. The Jump Kit lets you shock enemies and the Splash Kit lets you spray enemies with water. You get the gist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More importantly, though, those weapons have big areas they hit and allow you to take out a huge group of enemies at once. You’ll never get that sort of efficiency with weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The funnest parts of your kit, however, come in the sort of “ultimate” abilities you get. Each kit has a SCP-like Altered Item that you can unleash on enemies. The Jump Kit lets you fire off a garden gnome that creates a massive storm that will damage anyone, including allies, caught within it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the kits offered up enough variety they made my experience with each mission, or Job, very different. Your role and what you contribute changes quite dramatically, so you can find the role that fits you like a glove or bounce around if you ever get tired of one.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Can Adjust the Difficulty to Your Liking</h2>

<p>We had access to three different Job types in our preview, though there will be five when the game launches. All three of them were wonderfully <em>Control</em>-themed, with very different tasks to complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before getting into some of them specifically, all Jobs have a Clearance Level you can select, which is basically a difficulty selection. The higher the level, the more difficult enemies become, but that's not the only thing that changes.</p>

<p>At higher Clearance Levels, you will have more tasks to complete as well. In one, you essentially unlock a huge boss fight that you must defeat to complete the job. Additionally, there are other wrinkles like moving the ammo and healing stations to random parts of the level. On lower levels, these are always in set locations you don’t need to search for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To further add to the difficulty, you can adjust the Corruption Level as well. Essentially, this will add corrupted items to the Job that will modify the difficulty in some way. You’ll need to find a special item to destroy them as well. In one of my runs, we had to find a corrupted stapler in the office that doubled the health of enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One gripe some may have is in the level design. Each Job’s layout was relatively straight forward, but when a lot of combat revolves around hordes of enemies, the more open layouts with hallways makes some sense. The layouts stay the same for the Job you have each time as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Firebreak's Jobs Are All Refreshingly Different</h2>

<p>With that said, I got the feeling that the goal is to have a good variety of Jobs to complete. Each kind of Job is very different and set in an entirely unique location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Hot Fix, we were tasked with repairing various systems in the furnace, Paper Chase is all about destroying a bunch of sticky notes that have covered everything (even creating monsters of sticky notes to fight), and Ground Control had us collecting radioactive pearls with a payload we pushed along the level to a launch site to send them off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Jobs were varied enough with interesting goals to make each feel very distinct from the other. It is not as though each devolved into a “fend off the horde while we mash X button on Y machine,” though there’s plenty of fending off hordes while you’re trying to get something done.&nbsp;</p>

It sounds simple when written but the varied dynamism in any one level really makes the experience quite different.</p>

<p>There’s even some hazards/benefits to the different levels as well. Fire is generally a bad thing in that it harms you and can make enemies do more damage, so someone using the Splash Kit can put the fire out on enemies and other players. The office building has sprinklers you can set off to get the job done as well. Keep an eye out for environmental context clues, as there were a few things that just made sense in how they worked and interacted with the rest of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final thing to mention quickly is the upgrade system. Each Job you do, you can collect some currency in the level and will be rewarded at completion. You use that to unlock new weapons, upgrade weapons, cosmetics, perks, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perks aside, the rest are set up in a very Battle Pass-like way. Not that there is one necessarily, but it’s a familiar looking way to get upgrades.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perks use the same currencies, and you can have up to 9 at once, all of which are upgradeable to more powerful versions as well. This is where you’ll be able to fine tune a build to what you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will also be premium cosmetic items only available through purchase.</p>

<h2>Firebreak's UI Can Be Confusing and Unwieldy</h2>

<p>Most of my gripes with the game come from the UI and just how little is explained to you. Granted, our preview session gave us access to way more than you’ll get at the start of the game, so it was a little bit of an information overload. We were also told that they’ve already made significant UI changes from the build we played as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like the menus were difficult to navigate and sometimes it was hard to see what was going on or where to go on screen with just how much was going on. Hopefully there will be some nice changes there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ineffectiveness and lack of real weight behind any of the guns may be a big turn-off for some people, too. My first hour or so with the game, I was certainly feeling that. So many enemies felt like a bullet sponge, but it wasn’t until the other mechanics clicked that I felt I was able to make progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the gunplay felt light and lacking impact. I’m sure there will be some builds and upgrades to make them more useful, but <em>Firebreak </em>is definitely more about the various special weapons and tools you get access to in any one Kit. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>FBC: Firebreak Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I think there’s enough here to be cautiously optimistic about <em>FBC: Firebreak </em>but who knows the future of the game. The gameplay systems are fun, engaging, and unique, and the Jobs offer some great variety. But are 5 different mission types, each with their own unique but unchanging level, enough? Does the $40 price tag create too much of a barrier even if there aren’t the usual free-to-play trappings to churn through? &nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s impossible to predict the future of these sorts of games, but I think Remedy has put forth an interesting effort that people should enjoy.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/a-blades-of-fire-demo-drops-tomorrow-with-saves-carrying-over-to-the-full-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A demo for the blacksmithing action RPG Blades of Fire is coming out tomorrow, 15th May, ahead of the game’s full release on 22nd May for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Epic.</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/Blades_of_Fire/status/1922016237875294228">Announcing that a demo was coming earlier this week</a>, developer MercurySteam said, “Thank you SO much for the love in response to this! We weren’t planning to release a demo, but we know many of you wanted one, so we had to make it happen.”</p>


<p>A day later, they confirmed that the demo will arrive on 15th May. The demo will allow players to experience the first few hours of the game, with save data and progress able to carry over to the main game at launch.</p>
<p>A new world trailer previews some of the locales that will feature in the full game:</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - World Trailer [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U5fHtXRfz28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coming from the developer behind Castlevania: Lords of Shadow and more recently Metroid Dread, Blades of Fire is a Souls-like action RPG, though one that looks to put its own stamp on the genre with a new blacksmithing component for creating the weapons that you use.</p>

<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/07/blades-of-fire-is-the-blacksmithing-action-adventure-you-didnt-know-you-needed/">Playing the game earlier this year, I said</a>, “I really enjoyed my few hours with Blades of Fire. The original fantasy setting, the characters, and their voice acting and script all work for me – Aran’s voice acting reminds me of a cross between Matt Berry and Henry Cavill – but it’s really the unique touches for the combat and the puzzle-like forging that stand out. This is definitely one to keep an eye on when it launches in May.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft’s Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time Remake To Release By March 2026, While Some Of Ubi’s “Biggest” Titles Get Pushed Back]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In its latest <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">earnings report</a> for the 2025 fiscal year, Ubisoft claims that the long-awaited Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake will arrive sometime in early 2026. But that's about the only good news Ubisoft has to share about its upcoming lineup of games, as chief executive officer Yves Guillemot says that some of the company's "<em>biggest</em>" titles have had their release windows pushed back.</p>
<p>Guillemot doesn't specify which games have been pushed back, just that they are major games.</p>
<p>"<em>Additionally, after review of our pipeline, we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success,"</em> Guillemot said."<em>As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands</em>."</p>
<p>Ubisoft has already named <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">2026 as a release window</a> for the Sands of Time Remake, but now we know to expect it before the end of Ubisoft's current 2026 fiscal year, which means sometime between January and March 2026.</p>
<p>But if you were waiting for games like The Division 3 or the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">Splinter-Cell Remake</a>, you could be waiting until 2028 to play either of those. Especially in the case of Splinter-Cell, since that series has been practically dormant for years already. It wouldn't be surprising if Ubisoft kept pushing it back to instead focus on keeping its bigger series like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed fed before finally getting around to giving Splinter-Cell the spotlight once again.</p>
<p>At least Prince of Persia: Sands of Time fans have something to look forward to, and with Summer Game Fest around the corner, it's possible we'll get our first look at the game soon.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F" rel="sponsored">Switch 2 specs page</a> is light on details. However, <em>Digital Foundry </em>has shared what it says are “rock solid” specifications for the upcoming console in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">an article</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">a video</a>, offering new information about its processor and a testing tool for developers for GameChat.</p><p>On its specs page, Nintendo only describes the Switch 2’s chip as a “custom processor made by Nvidia.” Nvidia shared <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642793/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-support-nvidia-ray-tracing">a bit more last month</a>, including that its chip enables DLSS and real-time ray tracing on the Switch 2. <em>Digital Foundry </em>gets more specific: it says the Switch 2’s custom Nvidia T239 system-on-a-chip uses an ARM Cortex A78C CPU with eight cores. Six cores will be available to developers, while two will be used for the system.</p><p>The GPU uses Nvidia’s Ampere architecture. The console also has 12GB of LPDDR5X memory, though the system will hold 3GB in reserve.</p><p>As for the Switch 2’s display capabilities, while VRR is supported on the console’s screen, the device doesn’t support VRR while in docked mode and connected to HDMI, <em>Digital Foundry </em>reports. Nintendo originally advertised that VRR would be available while docked as well, but it’s since <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-scrubs-mentions-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-supporting-vrr-on-a-tv-while-docked.1166361/">scrubbed mentions of that</a> on its website. </p><p><em>Digital Foundry</em> also notes an interesting tidbit about GameChat, the new Discord-like chat system for the Switch 2. Nintendo is offering developers a GameChat testing tool that “simulates API latency and L3 cache misses that the real world GameChat system incurs on the system, meaning developers can test this without needing active GameChat sessions running,” <em>Digital Foundry</em> says. Hopefully, this testing tool will help developers make sure that GameChat doesn’t bog down their games.</p><p><em>Digital Foundry</em> has a lot more detail than I covered here, so check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-final-tech-specs-and-system-reservations-confirmed">its</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huxDoYXS8Ng">coverage</a> of the specs to learn more. The Switch 2 is scheduled to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">on June 5th</a>, and if you missed getting a preorder, you might want to consider <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/665958/nintendo-switch-2-best-buy-stock-launch-day">lining up at Best Buy</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can make a pepperoni pizza in the iconic shape of Pac-Man, turn Blinky into a hearty tomato soup, whip up some sweet cherry pocket pies, and even make eerily accurate Ghost cake pops.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-how-limveld-will-change-from-run-to-run-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest questions left over after Elden Ring Nightreign’s network test back in February was: “How will the world of Limveld change in the real game”? After all, Nightreign is, for all intents and purposes, a roguelite. And one of the core elements of any roguelite is a degree of randomness or procedural generation that ensures that every run feels just a little bit different. Nightreign has that in the loot department, with every run giving you different rewards and forcing you to cobble together a build based on what you’re able to find within that run; and also in the enemy and boss department, since none of the boss encounters are static, with the sole exception of the Nightlord battle on Day 3. But as far as the world of Limveld, we never really got a chance to see how it changes from run to run during the Network Test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During my two days of playtime at FromSoft’s office and over the course of about 10 full runs, I got my answer. Here’s how Limveld will change from run-to-run in Elden Ring Nightreign:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Elden Ring Nightreign: How Limveld Will Change</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Actually, we jumped the gun. Before we go into the ways Limveld will change, let’s quickly establish what doesn’t change:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>This overall structure of Limveld will not change. The shape of the island, the major geographical features, the positioning of the cliffs, rivers, and lakes, will all be the same, barring a few major exceptions that we’ll cover in just a bit.</li><li>The locations of sites of grace, evergaols, the launching spirit springs, cave entrances and exits, the spectral trees and the wind currents, all of these are static and do not change location from run-to-run.</li><li>There is also a giant castle that features exceptionally tough battles and big rewards right smack in the middle of the map that will never change. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else, from the locations of all of the rest of the points of interest, the types of rewards offered at those points of interest, to the wandering mini-bosses, and the bosses you’ll fight at the end of Day 1 and 2 are left completely up to chance. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, there are two other huge factors that can completely alter a run. The first are world events known as “Shifting Earth”. Occasionally, before you even launch into a level, you’ll be made aware that there is a Shifting Earth modifier in effect. In our playtime, the one we encountered was “Crater,” which transformed the northern section of the map, placing a giant crater in the middle and rivers of lava all around it. The enemies around and inside the crater are no joke, and wiped the floor with us when we first attempted to even get close enough to investigate the crater on the first day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But investigate it you should, and you should do so as soon as the second day begins, if you’re up to the challenge. Exploring the crater took us pretty much the entirety of the second day, but when we did eventually make it all the way to the bottom, we beat a boss that granted us an epic rarity level reward by itself, but then also the unique reward of being able to take any weapon in our arsenal and upgrade it to max for free! It’s a risky endeavor though, as in order to escape from the crater, you need to use a bunch of spectral trees and ride the hawks from platform to platform as you try to escape, which will certainly lead to nail-biting escape sequences when you take too long in the crater and now must race against the clock to get out while the circle closes in around you. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big way that runs can change are through the appearance of certain events that seem to occur completely randomly and can throw a huge wrench into an otherwise routine run. I’ve seen a couple of these, and some might be familiar with the Margit invasion from the Network Test, in which Margit the Fell will just all of a sudden jump into your game and mercilessly hunt your squad down wherever they are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But a new one that I encountered involved the appearance of a swirling tornado-like phenomenon in the sky. When our squad approached it, we were suddenly attacked by a very tough group of AI-controlled Nightfarers who seemingly invaded us from another world. Like typical NPC invasions in Elden Ring, these enemies were smarter and hit a lot harder than typical enemies, making it another big risk/reward consideration to explore the areas near one of these ominous swirling tornadoes in the sky. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most impactful of all of these random events, though, was the appearance of a mysterious boss that would attack from miles away with mortar shots of level-sapping bugs. That's right, get hit even just once by these telegraphed mortar strikes, and you lose a level. It’s not even limited to losing just one. Get a hit again, it’ll take another level from you. The only way to get those levels back is to find and kill the boss by following the bugs to his hiding spot. Unfortunately, I don’t have footage of this, nor do I know what the reward is for killing him, because by the time we found the boss by following the bugs, the circle had started encroaching, and we just wouldn’t have been able to kill him before the circle killed us. I’m not going to lie, It was pretty soul-crushing to have to just give up on those levels that he stole from us, and it really kind of doomed our run right from day one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are certainly more of these that I still haven’t encountered, like the forest of corruption, the madness towers, and more that we can see in the overview trailer released by FromSoftware. It’s worth mentioning as well that if you don’t like the Shifting Earth modifier that will affect the world, you can use the bed in the Roundtable Hold to sleep to either remove the modifier or have it be replaced by something else. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As devastating as some of these modifiers can be, I’m nonetheless eagerly anticipating seeing more of them. They inject a healthy level of chaos into what otherwise might start to feel very routine, and led to some great emergent moments with high emotion between me and my squadmates as we raced to escape the crater, or panicked at an unexpected ambush, or felt true despair as we realized the levels that were stolen from us were gone forever. Moments like these are the heart of any good roguelite, and hopefully Nightreign is able to keep them coming at a steady pace.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In annual financial results posted today, the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest developer reported an 8 percent decrease in net sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, diving from ¥356 billion (about $2.5 billion) billion to ¥324 billion (about $2.2 billion).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Operating income decreased accordingly, dropping from ¥40 billion to ¥32 billion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These changes—and a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-reviewing-production-pipeline-amid-spluttering-sales">steady stream</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of sagging </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/square-enix-final-fantasy-xvi-and-final-fantasy-rebirth-did-not-meet-our-expectations-">quarterly financial results</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> over the last year—prompted the company to announce a 3-year business plan promising a "reboot for long-term growth."

This means all Square Enix developers working on online games, "HD games," and "SD games" are in one business unit. Its AI and engine development divisions, as well as its audio, QA, and other "development-related specialized organizations" now sit outside these studios.

Developer Team Lazerbeam describes the game as a first-person roguelike double-deckbuilder. Players must work through mysterious fungi-filled dungeons that combine hand-drawn 2D art and animations with 3D exploration.</p><p>The reveal trailer shows how the game’s mechanics work, including why Shroom and Gloom is a “double deck-builder.” The first deck players build is one for exploration, with different cards serving as tools to help advance through dungeons. Then, when it’s time to fight, players use a separate combat deck to take down fungal enemies.</p><p><strong>Check out the double-deck action in the trailer below:</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Shroom and Gloom allows players to collect new cards and upgrade and modify them “infinitely,” suggesting a lot of customization for players’ decks. After defeating these mushroom foes, you can season, skewer, roast, and ultimately eat them to restore health.</p><p>Team Lazerbeam says its dream version of Shroom and Gloom features “hundreds of cards, deep meta-progression and scores of unique enemies, spread across a dense network of caves and tunnels.” It also says the game is in an early stage of development, but it encourages players to check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3271280/Shroom_and_Gloom/">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more about Shroom and Gloom, check out this fresh batch of screenshots below:&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hbo-which-was-always-hbo-is-hbo-again.1189392/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hbo-max-warner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Warner Bros Discovery <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/max-changes-name-hbo-max-1236397399/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it’s changing the name of its streaming service, Max, back to HBO Max. You might think it already had “HBO” in the name, because it is HBO, except Warner Bros has gone through a multi-year debate over the extent to which the thing it owns, HBO, is actually HBO, only to land us here on, yeah no, it’s HBO.</p><p>Come with me on a journey: in 2010 HBO launched its streamer HBO Go, which was available to HBO subscribers. In 2015 the company launched <a href="https://time.com/3774026/hbo-now-launches-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO Now</a>, a different streamer that could be paid for without an HBO subscription. In 2020, both of these got subsumed into <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/hbo-max-launch-date-price-streaming-1234585776/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO Max</a>. In 2023, Warner <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/hbo-max-renamed-max-pricing-launch-date-1235532179/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed the name of HBO Max to just Max</a>, which necessitated the <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax/status/1662202418963070977?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tagline</a> “the one to watch for HBO,” a fact previously conveyed by having the word “HBO” in the name. More confusingly, sometimes the company just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6yoTKa58Qw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called</a> it “the one to watch,” while other times it used <a href="https://www.facebook.com/streamonmax/videos/154883714124231/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both taglines</a> in the same breath.</p><p>But now, in 2025, Max is HBO Max again. The announcement is and isn’t a surprise; at the end of March, Max <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/max-changes-logo-black-and-white-hbo-1236352161/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changed its logo</a> to a black and white palette evocative of the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lihxb2kg4s2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original HBO colors</a>. As quoted by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/max-changes-name-hbo-max-1236397399/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, WB CEO David Zaslav said of today's name change, “Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media,” despite a two-year hand-wringing over that very idea.&nbsp;</p><p>CEO of streaming and games <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JB Perrette</a> said, “We will continue to focus on what makes us unique — not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families.” This statement comes despite Zaslav saying of the <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/why-did-hbo-max-become-max-rebranding-1235626295/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original name change</a> that Max would let “every member of the household… see whatever they want at any given time.” Perrette also said that today’s change is “really not subjective, not even controversial — our programming just hits different,” but did not clarify who was finding calling HBO “HBO” controversial, or exactly what his definition of "subjective" is. </p><p>On Twitter, the <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Max account</a> (which as of this writing has not changed its profile pic or user name to include "HBO") is having a field day with this whole thing, <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax/status/1922675183422259438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quote-tweeting dunks</a>, making <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax/status/1922662280367333410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pope</a> and <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax/status/1922665329332748347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-man</a> memes, and getting <a href="https://x.com/StreamOnMax/status/1922670003460944055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-referential</a> about the audience response. While this entire situation is an exercise in absurdity, an official brand account getting in on it reads less like good fun and more like a marketing department desperately flailing to make sense of something that cannot be made to make sense.</p><p>Honestly, I sort of admire that Zaslav and Perrette can get up in front of people and cast this whole thing as a brave new direction instead of a symptom of their complete <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inability</a> to understand the value of their own product, a brand of confidence those of us with self-awareness do not possess. They do not know what makes the streamer “the one to watch” or even whether or not people should be watching HBO on it. (2023: no. 2025: yes.) They are not wrong that Max has (had?) more than just HBO on it, but their strategy for how to signal that was to… pretend it <em>didn’t</em> have HBO on it, only to walk back that decision by suddenly discovering that it seems like people want to pay for HBO’s streamer so they can watch HBO. I have long given up on wanting execs to actually care about their own products, but to watch these people so thoroughly and energetically fumble the bag by nitpicking over a name like an on-the-rocks couple getting a new dog is such a public humiliation that I’d almost feel bad for them if they weren’t systematically destroying <a href="https://aftermath.site/coyote-vs-acme-fuck-david-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/rooster-teeth-shut-down-warner-brothers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-warner-bros-monolith-wonder-woman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">path</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, it’s 2025 and I guess you can watch HBO on HBO again, a thing you’ve been doing since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_HBO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1972</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sour-patch-kids-flavor-rankings"><h3>Sour Patch Kids, Ranked</h3></a><p>An objectively correct ranking of Sour Patch Kids and various Sour Patch Kids-flavored things</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/1047-debuts-impressive-splitgate-2-map-creator-the-lab-ahead-of-open-beta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> open beta right around the corner on 22nd May, 1047 Games has revealed another key component of the portal-based arena shooter. The Lab is a fully-fledged map creator that will allow for some impressive community-created maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing The Lab - Map Creator | Splitgate 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBiSnzHaoxk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking a leaf out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/26/halo-infinite-is-getting-a-the-pit-remake-via-forge/">Halo franchise’s Forge map creator</a>, The Lab aims to be both accessible for more casual map creation, and incredibly deep in terms of the terrains and map layouts it can create in the hands of an expert.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to collaborate in real time with up to 16 people modifying maps at once, and these creations can then be quickly shared. 1047 will provide a range of blank templates to start with, scalable geometric shapes and pre-created map items, environmental props and other gameplay objects.</p>
<p>This isn’t the endgame for the tool with 1047 stating that more map creator content is planned for after launch.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Splitgate 2 will be available from the following store pages to dive into the open beta on 22nd May.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/">Splitgate 2 for PC via Steam</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/splitgate-2/9PF5Q1B0FHSL/0010">Splitgate 2 on the Xbox Store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010012">Splitgate 2 on the PlayStation Store</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This full sequel is a complete overhaul with a new progression system and faction skills that start to push the game toward hero and class-based shooters. This could take it past that happy Halo-with-Portals vibe that the original game had, more towards ultra competitive esports, but will allow for more iterative and expanding gameplay over time.</p>
<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. With the open beta coming on 22nd May, it seems that they’re getting pretty close to an eventual release, though details of the full launch have not yet been confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-preview-out-now-epic-promises-vast-open-worlds-at-consistent-60hz/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-preview-out-now-epic-promises-vast-open-worlds-at-consistent-60hz/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games has released the Unreal Engine 5.6 preview to developers, who can download it via the Epic Games Launcher, <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux</a>.</p>
<p>The Unreal Engine maker has shared bold claims of enabling vast, high-fidelity open worlds with a target baseline of 'consistent 60Hz' (frames per second). To begin with, Unreal Engine 5.6 provides developers with device profiles based on Fortnite's optimized settings to achieve 60fps on all supported platforms. The streaming performance has also been optimized when streaming content in and out of the world at runtime. Hopefully, this can help alleviate some of the stuttering issues often seen in UE-powered games.</p>
<p>Lumen-based hardware ray tracing has also been optimized, as detailed in this overview provided by Epic:</p>
<p><em>In Unreal Engine 5.6, Lumen Hardware Ray Tracing (HWRT) mode delivers even greater performance on current-generation hardware. These low-level optimizations ensure faster, more efficient rendering, bringing high-end visual fidelity and scalability that now matches the frame budget of the software ray tracing mode. This frees up valuable CPU resources on your target platform and overall helps achieve a more consistent 60hz frame rate. </em></p>
<p>This would be very useful in a game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, where Lumen hardware ray tracing is very heavy on the CPU. Of course, the game would need to be updated (and tested) in Unreal Engine 5.6, which is unlikely for a released game with no significant post-launch support plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.productboard.com/epicgames/1-unreal-engine-public-roadmap/tabs/124-unreal-engine-5-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There's a lot more in this preview</a>, like parallelization of the Renderer Hardware Interface (RHI) API, optimizations for virtual shadow maps, GPU Profiler 2.0, improved PCG GPU Compute performance, the addition of the MetaHuman Creator in-engine and what Epic has described as the largest expansion to the engine's animation authoring toolset yet.</p>
<p>Unreal Fest Orlando is coming up on June 3, and Epic will delve even deeper into the new features during the State of Unreal keynote. Meanwhile, developers are free to install Unreal Engine 5.6 but should be aware that it is still unstable; as such, projects should not be converted but copied from earlier versions to ensure work is not disrupted.</p>
<p>Of course, all the aforementioned improvements won't change the fundamental issue of Unreal Engine, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">openly recognized</a> by Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney: its reliance on single-threading. That will change with Unreal Engine 6, which is, however, still two to three years out from a preview.</p>

			<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/">March</a>, Ubisoft announced that it had formed a new subsidiary with Tencent to house its Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. We've had some <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">leaked insight</a> into how this new subsidiary will be structured, but we finally got a more official update on what its focus will be moving forward.</p>
<p>In Ubisoft's <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/75aGUbWM9kwnQj44Tr7d6H/ce4ca047ddadf45cf1e98cea8d1d7a78/Ubisoft_FY25_PR_English_vfinal.pdf">earnings report</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, the company said that this new subsidiary will "<em>focus on building brand ecosystems capable of becoming evergreen, billion-euro franchises</em>" by focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improving the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences</em></li>
<li><em>Expanding live service offerings with richer multiplayer features and more frequent content updates</em></li>
<li><em>Significantly enhancing content creation by leveraging Ubisoft's technological stack</em></li>
<li><em>Scaling into underpenetrated markets such as mobile and China</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It's not surprising at all that part of this venture with Tencent will be Ubisoft trying to gain some footing in China's game market, or that Ubisoft is hoping to bolster its mobile portfolio. What we still don't know about this new subsidiary is how much it will impact Ubisoft developers.</p>
<p>Ahead of the notes about what this new subsidiary will focus on, Ubisoft's report says that it is "<em>currently working on reshaping its operating model with the objective to better meet player needs, deliver superior game quality and drive disciplined capital allocation. Management targets to announce new organization by the end of the year.</em>"</p>
<p>Later on in the report, Ubisoft says it will work to reduce costs through "<em>ongoing targeted restructurings</em>," which all point to more layoffs being announced by Ubisoft, sometime before the end of this year. Continuing the terrible string of mass layoffs that the video game industry has suffered over the last few years, with seemingly no end in sight.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Inside, you'll find the base Mortal Kombat 1 game, the Khaos Reigns story expansion, the two Kombat Packs that introduced several new characters to the roster, and Mortal Kombat movie character skins for Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Liu Kang, and Shao Kahn.</p><p>While the game wasn't quite as good as Mortal Kombat 11, Mortal Kombat 1 is still a fun brawler that took the series in an interesting new direction. Set in a rebooted universe watched over by Liu Kang following his ascension to the rank of Elder God, Mortal Kombat 1 introduced quite a few twists to the lore of the series and it changed up backstories for several characters. It was followed by the Aftermath expansion that reintroduced several elements from the older games, including the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mortal-kombat-1-animality/2900-5790/" data-ref-id="2900-5790">gruesome Animality finishers</a> as a freebie for all players.</p><p>Here's the full list of everything included in the Definitive Edition:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat 1</li><li>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns story expansion</li><li>Kombat Pack Fighters: Quan Chi, Ermac, Takeda Takahashi, Omni-Man, Peacemaker, and Homelander</li><li>Kombat Pack Kameo Fighters: Tremor, Khameleon, Janet Cage, Mavado, and Ferra</li><li>Kombat Pack 2 Fighters: Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, Conan the Barbarian, and T-1000 Terminator</li><li>Kombat Pack 2 Kameo Fighter: Madam Bo</li><li>Shang Tsung fighter</li><li>Mortal Kombat 2 (2025) movie skins: Johnny Cage, Shao Khan, Kitana, and Scorpion</li><li>Mortal Kombat (2021) movie skin: Sub-Zero</li><li>Tournament Liu Kang character skin</li><li>Jean-Claude Van Damme Character skin (voice, likeness, outfit) for Johnny Cage</li><li>Wedding Scorpion and Empress Mileena character skins</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 character skins for Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot</li><li>Animality finishing moves</li><li>1,250 Dragon Krystals</li></ul><p>The Kombat Packs were a big highlight, as the new fighters added to the game included fan-favorites like Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot alongside crossover characters like Peacemaker, Homelander, and the T-1000 Terminator. "Great mechanics and a wild story make a solid first impression, but a shallow selection of modes keeps MK1 from a flawless victory," Jason Fanelli wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-1-review-new-era-familiar-kombat/1900-6418115/">Mortal Kombat 1 review</a>.</p>

Due out soon on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690030/The_Last_Gas_Station/">Steam</a>, The Last Gas Station falls somewhere between cozy and spooky; service other woodland creatures still driving a gas vehicle during the day, but mysterious things happen to anyone who runs a pump at night.</p><p>As the new owner of this abandoned gas station, you’re tasked with stocking shelves, managing customers' fuel levels, serving snacks, and upgrading your operations to keep things running smoothly. It’s also up to you to solve the mystery behind the previous owner’s disappearance.</p><p><strong>Check out the screenshots for a look at the game below:</strong></p><p>“[Always] keep an eye on the shadows,” a press release reads. “This place has secrets, and not all of them want to stay buried.”</p><p>Alongside running the gas station, players can design custom neon signs, decorate the inside of the store, and ultimately, bring this cozy, tucked-away gas station back to life. While managing the gas station is the main objective of The Last Gas Station, Alawar also describes the game as a “bite-sized, story-driven sim where cozy vibes meet mysterious undertones.”</p><p>“It’s a game about forgotten places, creeping dread, and the effort it takes to keep something – anything – going in a world that’s already moved on,” the press release says.</p><p>There is no release date for The Last Gas Station, but Alawar says it’s coming to PC soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/persona5-the-phantom-x-announcement-set-for-may-15th/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>ATLUS has announced a stream for tomorrow, May 15th, at 3pm BST to reveal Persona5: The Phantom X. What we already know about the game is that it is a free to play mobile title that has been in open beta in China since April 2014, and also launched in Taiwan, and South Korea. Just like Persona 5, Persona5: The Phantom X is set in Tokyo, but introduces a new main character for players to name and customise.</p>
<p><iframe title="P5X News -First announcement! We’re the Phantom Thieves, and we’re here to steal your heart!-" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQsdIWTGn_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The stream for tomorrow will delve into details including release dates, at least for a Japan version, along with the newly announced English version of the game. Details of a release date are also expected for that. Much like the mainline Persona 5 game, players will be able to take part in various activities around Tokyo that can help boost stats, gain experience points, or earn some money. Confidants are also dotted around and are people you can speak to you. To unlock unique dialogue options with them, you will need to rank up your relationships. It’ll take longer to do in Persona5: The Phantom X compared to the main game as there are more ranks to work through. There are turn based battles too that will take place in Mementos, where you will grind out daily challenges, along with battles in the story specific Palaces.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Persona 5 game we reviewed was Persona 5 Tactica, and in that review Nic said, “Persona 5 Tactica is a good game, but it is a game that’s standing on the shoulders of giants – when the giant is the size of Satanael, you have a lot to live up to. Indeed, it’s very difficult to score this and not compare it to the other games in the series as a result. Tactica is good, but it’s not great, and while it is always nice to sink into that warm-bath feeling of hanging out with your fictional friends, it won’t be remembered as either a series high or the best spin-off the franchise has to offer.”</p>

		<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> is reporting that Ubisoft’s extreme sports game Riders Republic is going to be getting a movie adaptation, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah set to jointly direct. Writer Noé Debré is also attached to the project, and he has writer on films including Dheepan, Stillwater, and Parlement. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are best known for Bad Boys For Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riders Republic: Season 14 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZB-d5e_Z7wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Riders Republic launched in October 2021, bringing a wacky approach to extreme sports with snowboards, skis, and wingsuits, bikes, and jetpacks all being added. It is essentially a sequel to Ubisoft’s 2016 winter extreme sports game Steep. Riders Republic has been getting regular content updates since its release, which points to an active player base, with Season 14 coming last month. That added the Pockett Car and the Park Creator to the game.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/02/riders-republic-review/">Riders Republic Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Riders Republic review, Jim said, “Riders Republic is a game players can effortlessly lose themselves in, even if the gameplay itself is pretty shallow. The endless barrage of events populating the world map become less exciting over time, resembling a shopping list rather than milestones in your ascension to extreme sports godhood. If you’re still keen to take the plunge, make sure you have a posse ready to party up with.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-dimension-20-cloudward-ho-trailer-reveals-characters-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dropout has released a brand new trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dimension 20&nbsp;</em>series&nbsp;<em>Cloudward Ho!</em>, and it introduces the players' characters, the steampunk land of Gath, and more.</p>

<p>The trailer teases the steampunk adventure on which the gang will be embarking, which premieres on June 4th. During the trailer, perennially irrepressible DM Brennan Lee Mulligan describes Gath as "a world of high-flying stunts and wild adventure".</p>

<p><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>will serve as an Intrepid Heroes series, which means your players will be the usual rogues' gallery: Ally Beardsley, Brian Murphy, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Siobhan Thompson, and Zac Oyama (and, of course, Mulligan himself in the top chair).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-cloudward-ho-new-trailer-cast.jpg?itok=H2OCJjmg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-cloudward-ho-new-trailer-cast.jpg?itok=WY4K1k74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>takes the Intrepid Heroes to the steampunk land of Gath.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, Thompson introduces her character Van Chapman, who comes from an "old sailing family". Murphy will play a strapping athlete by the name of Maxwell, and Axford will play Marya Junková, who is "gaunt with starvation, not of the body but of the soul".</p>

<p>Oyama's character doesn't get a name during the trailer, but he's an elderly cowboy type with a pistol and bandolier (and, of course, a Texas-style southern-boy accent to match). He's joined by Beardsley's Olethra McCloud, an adventurer who's "extremely into" her family's adventuring legacy.</p>

<p>Finally, Wilson's character, who, like Oyama's cowboy, is unnamed in the trailer. He is possessed of "big, broad shoulders" and a "big chest", and his art shows him with a pencil and book in hand, as well as mutton chop-style facial hair.</p>

<p>Together, the group will form the Windrider Society, who will be taking to the skies of Gath in order to search for "the missing Professor Comfrey MacLeod", according to a press release. It promises to be another unforgettable Intrepid Heroes adventure.</p>




<p><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>reunites the core Intrepid Heroes cast following <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-fantasy-high-junior-year-trailer-highlights-new-looks-for-bad-kids-and" rel="nofollow">last year's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy High: Junior Year</em></a>. It'll be the show's third actual play series to air this year, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-titan-takedown-combines-tabletop-storytelling-with-pro-wrestling" rel="nofollow">April's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-titan-takedown-combines-tabletop-storytelling-with-pro-wrestling" rel="nofollow">Titan Takedown</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dimension-20-dungeons-drag-queens-season-2-sashays-onto-dropout-in-january" rel="nofollow">January's second season of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens</em></a>.</p>

<p>Digital Foundry also notes that the Switch 2's stated clock speeds can be tuned to higher theoretical maximums: 1.4 GHz for the GPU and 1.7 GHz for the CPU. Nintendo could eventually make use of this headroom for improved graphical performance and faster loading screens, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-nintendo-switch-boost-mode-analysis">it did on the original Switch in 2019</a>. And while developers can adjust the GPU clock rate used by their games, it's unclear if they'll be able to directly overclock to the theoretical maximum themselves.</p>

<p>As on the original Switch, 25 percent of the CPU cores and overall memory on the Switch 2 is reserved by the system for OS features and is thus inaccessible to game developers directly. Digital Foundry also notes that some GPU resources are reserved by the system OS, though it didn't provide a precise measurement for this amount.</p>

<p>This time around, those system-level features include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">Game Chat</a>, which offers the ability to stream gameplay and/or webcam video from up to four friends to a single system. Even with significant resources set aside by the OS, though, Digital Foundry notes that Game Chat has "a significant impact on system resources," leading Nintendo to provide developers with a testing tool that "simulates API latency and L3 cache misses" that can happen when Game Chat is in use.</p>
<p>Aside from the core pixel-pushing hardware, the Switch 2 also adds a new separate File Decompression Engine, which can handle loading game data off of the system's 256GB of on-board UFS memory and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express expansion cards</a> without taxing the CPU. And while the Switch 2's portable screen includes support for variable refresh rates up to 120 Hz, there is currently no official support for VRR on HDMI displays connected to the system's dock.</p>
<p>While it's fun to look at numbers, the real proof of the Switch 2's hardware power will be in the performance of its games. We look forward to having more direct comparisons of software performance when the console launches next month.</p>

"We‛re not just simply calculating the tariff to come up with 100 billion yen, but thinking about the currently available information and also looking at the market trend, we might pass on to the price and also shipment allocation, so we‛re taking different measures in managing to come up with the 100 billion figure," Tao said via a translator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As pointed out by senior vice president Sadahiko Hayakawa, the 100 billion figure may not be reflecting this week‛s reduction between China and the US.
