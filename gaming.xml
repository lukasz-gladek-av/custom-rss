			<p>While they might not have initially won everyone over, Luigi’s ghost-busting antics have aged like a fine wine, especially with the excellence of Luigi’s Mansion 3 a few years ago. Yet, much like the ghosts that end up trapped inside Luigi’s Poltergust, all but the most recent game has found itself stuck on older consoles. Until now, that is, as Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD has slurped up one of the highlights from the 3DS library and deposited it right onto the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="A closer spook at Luigi's Mansion 2 HD! ???? (Nintendo Switch)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pdG9qVt5zI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Madcap inventor Professor E. Gadd is enjoying a lovely evening with his friendly ghosts –&nbsp;at least one of which would surely be called Casper, but for some kind of trademark infringement –&nbsp;when the Dark Moon that hovers over his perpetually moody valley is shattered into pieces and all the ghosts go absolutely nuts. Putting the potential ethical quandary of using a mysterious magic crystal thing to affect the behaviour of free spirits (destructive though they might be) to one side, Prof. Gadd needs help getting things back under control and calls upon his ghost-hunting pal Luigi back into action. Ghostbusting might not make him feel good, but he’s darned good at it!</p>


<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD will be immediately familiar to anyone that’s played it or the other entries in the series. Luigi has to traipse around the haunted world, battling spectral miscreants with just a flashlight to stun them and a vacuum cleaner to scoop them up. Ghosts come in all shapes and sizes, they can attack from afar, hide in the scenery and pop out to spook Luigi, or come wielding items that shield them from being stunned. It’s up to you to time your Strobulb blasts to weaken them, then activate the Poltergust to pull them in, and pull in an opposite direction to the one they’re trying to escape in order to build up a more damaging burst of suction.</p>


<p>Compared to Luigi’s Mansion 3, ghost battling feels more forgiving. You can be a good bit looser in how you pull against a ghost’s panicked flight, and you don’t have to deal with the plunger for pulling away items and armour. That said, with the tight confines of many rooms and passages, multiple ghosts coming at you together, and still having to deal with the timing of a Strobulb flash, it can still be pretty tricky. Another part of that is getting used to having movement in 3D space switch from have Luigi face the direction of motion to strafing – a persistent quirk for the series that you need to overcome, though it’s now helped by having the right analogue stick to aim and the shoulder buttons to trigger the flashlight.</p>
<p>Where Luigi’s Mansion 2 stands apart is in having a mission-based structure, taking you back to Prof E. Gadd’s lab after completing each objective, and then zapping you back to a location each time, as opposed to the more connected mansion and multi-floor hotel of the other games. A level generally takes 10-20 minutes to complete, pushing you to different parts of a location and often mixing up the puzzles and enemies that you’ll find there. Gloomy Manor could be completely covered in cobwebs that you need to clear, the front gate to Haunted Towers can suddenly be guarded by an oversized Venus Flytrap, and even a simple objective can be interrupted by ghosts that whip away the item you were after and force you to keep exploring.</p>
<p>Figuring out each room is a delight, though, and there’s a pleasing interactivity to many objects and secrets to find. You’ll have to remember that you’ve got a darklight that can reveal hidden doors and items, and that you can both push and pull using the Poltergust, but aside from those core items and door keys, everything you need to progress will almost always be contained within a room. There’s often switches to pull, buckets that you can pick up to gather liquids, plants that become balloons and more. It’s always fun finding the connections between the environmental puzzles, with some great design that obfuscates things just the right amount.</p>

<p>All of this is rendered with some big improvements for Nintendo Switch. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD naturally runs in HD now, instead of a resolution that would be look pixellated on a postage stamp, and that does an awful lot of the heavy lifting to make the game look clearer and much nicer. However, all of the character models are now much higher quality and more detailed, improved textures and more. I do wish that they had gone a little further to get the light and shadow up to the standards of Luigi’s Mansion 3, and the character animation is somewhat limited, but it’s still a fairly handsome game thanks to the overall art style. It’s also stuck at 30fps, when you might have expected a remaster like this to shoot for 60fps.</p>
<p>Another place where this remaster could have gone further is with the multiplayer. We’re back to the original suite of multiplayer modes and options in the ScareScraper, where up to four multi-coloured Luigis can team up to take on a multi-level tower with either straight up ghost hunting, racing to reach a floor’s exit, or trying to track down polterpups. There’s also a surprise mode that mixes up the three game types floor-by-floor.</p>

<p>It’s good fun, and you can increase the number of floors and difficulty to suit your team, where you’ll often have to deal with strange curses that need teammates to come help you out, but it is also fairly limited. By comparison, Luigi’s Mansion 3 has up to 8 players online and always mixes up the objectives, and then there’s the Luigi’s Mansion remake for 3DS, which introduced co-op to the story mode with the first appearance of Gooigi. This remaster could have done similar.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shift Up has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>sales have topped one million, and that the studio is still actively considering a PC version of the game as well.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1750274" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an article on Korean news platform GameMeca</a> (for which we're using machine translation), the sales figure was announced by Shift Up CFO Ahn Jae-woo during a press conference held earlier today for the company's IPO launch.</p>
<p>Ahn Jae-woo pointed to&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>'s user rating of 9.2 on Metacritic, which is the highest of any PS5 game, although the game is beaten out by titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>&nbsp;</em>when it comes to critical reception.</p>

<p>Shift Up CEO Kim Hyeong-tae, meanwhile, said that the goal for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>was to create a new IP that fans would love, and that this was emphasized over pushing for profit or including unnecessary microtransactions.</p>
<p>He does, however, say that there's a possibility paid DLC for the game (as opposed to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode">free updates it's been receiving</a>) will be released in future, especially if&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>were to cross over with another IP.</p>
<h2><em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC version still under consideration, devs say</h2>
<p>As part of the IPO press conference, Ahn Jae-woo confirmed that Shift Up is still considering a PC version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, and that releasing one could increase the value of the game's IP even further.</p>
<p>However, CEO Kim Hyeong-tae stopped short of announcing a PC release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, so it might be a while before we hear anything about the hack-and-slash game's PC launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24185022/nintendo-switch-2024-game-lineup-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This was supposed to be the year the Nintendo Switch rode off peacefully into the sunset. After a packed 2023 that included hit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Legend of Zelda</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario</em></a> games, the Switch had little on the calendar this year and the prospect of a successor looming. And yet, here we are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24170561/summer-game-fest-2024-trailers-news-geoff-keighley">after a hectic few weeks of gaming news</a>, and Nintendo might just have the most exciting lineup for the rest of the year, besting the likes of Xbox and PlayStation.</p><div><p>In the Switch era, it seems the company’s greatest strength has been consistency. This likely harkens back to a seemingly boring restructure at Nintendo in which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">the company merged its handheld and console development teams in order to focus purely on the hybrid Switch</a>. It certainly seems to have worked: unlike its predecessor, the Wii U, the Switch hasn’t had prolonged periods without a first-party Nintendo game. Sure, a lot of them are remakes or ports, but then again, so is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">the device’s bestselling title</a>.</p></div><div><p>The launch of <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> on June 27th kicks off what looks to be a very solid run from Nintendo for the rest of the year, which the company kept secret until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180183/nintendo-direct-june-2024-news-trailers">a Nintendo Direct earlier this month</a>. It will be followed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151970/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch-release-date"><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em></a> in July, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24180977/a-new-mario-party-game-is-here-to-ruin-your-family-relationships"><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em></a> in October, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> in November.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>In terms of quantity, Nintendo’s lineup is comparable to its competitors over the same period. (I’ll have to reserve judgment when it comes to quality.) Xbox Game Studios has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173672/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-november-19th-release-date-trailer">a new <em>Flight Simulator</em></a><em>,</em> a pair of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24172089/welcome-to-the-age-of-mythology">strategy</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2021880%2FAra_History_Untold%2F">games</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173678/heres-another-look-at-avowed-coming-in-2024">Obsidian’s latest RPG</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">a <em>Starfield</em> expansion</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174850/heres-another-look-at-the-new-indiana-jones-game">likely <em>Indiana Jones</em></a> capping things off, along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173669/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-october-25th">multiplatform <em>Call of Duty</em></a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, has the adorable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167370/astro-bot-ps5-sequel-trailer-date"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, a multiplayer shooter called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168249/an-intro-to-sonys-next-multiplayer-shooter"><em>Concord</em></a>, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24168045/god-of-war-pc-release-date-ps5-state-of-play">PC port of <em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a><em>, </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24172801/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-trailer-summer-game-fest"><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></a><em> </em>(which is coming to the Switch in addition to PC and PS5).</p></div><p>The difference is that the Switch has been out three years longer than the most recent Xbox and PlayStation, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo is clearly gearing up for its successor</a>. It’s not usually this way: the latter years of a console’s lifespan are typically muted, while the company focuses on the next generation. It’s not the time when you get a much-anticipated twist on the<em> Zelda</em> formula. Nintendo even has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer">major Switch games going into next year</a>.</p><p>Similarly impressive, even the games that don’t necessarily seem that exciting — namely ones that already exist on other platforms — have still been turning out great. <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2</em> is a remake of a portable game that debuted more than a decade ago, and yet, it looks, plays, and feels much like its modern predecessor, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">the excellent slapstick comedy <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em> from 2019</a>. (Even if the new game is lacking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/13/18668931/luigis-mansion-3-nintendo-switch-interview-gooigi-e3-2019">Gooigi</a>.) It’s the kind of silly and playful game that few major developers outside of Nintendo have really explored, and it stands out because of it. Its release follows other well-made ports from this year like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24041577/another-code-recollection-review-nintendo-switch">the <em>Another Code</em> collection</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em></a>.</p><p>The major test for Nintendo will be maintaining this consistency across console generations. The company has often had an uneven success rate with new platforms; the megahit Wii and Switch were preceded by consoles that both underperformed and struggled when it came to a dependable release schedule. It’s hard to gauge the potential for a Switch successor without knowing anything about it, but a steady stream of high-quality Nintendo games will certainly go a long way toward avoiding the dire days of the Wii U.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cyan Worlds' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-remake-of-myst-sequel-riven-is-coming-later-this-year-complete-with-vr-support">remake of their 1997-released Myst sequel Riven</a> launches today on Steam. Word on the reviewvine is that it's jolly decent, offering free movement around a real-time 3D reinvention of the original point-and-clicker's shimmering archipelago, with its many murals of crushed and scattered civilisations. There’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">a demo on Steam</a> at the time of writing, a relic of long-ago Next Fest 2024. Demos tend to be removed once the game hits shelves, so I thought I’d rush you a quick post based on 30 minutes with the remake over lunch.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Riven’s world feels odder today than it did when I laid eyes on it as a teenager. I think that’s partly because it’s a fossilised vision of the internet from before the broadband era, a Narnian panegyric to the humble hyperlink. The Myst games unfold in a universe of pocket dimensions or “Ages” - accessed by diving into the pages of magic books and made up of obscure, half-real mechanisms, where generations of artisanal explorers and inventor vie to reclaim lost knowledge while prosecuting grudges and giving into their megalomaniacal tendencies.</p>
<p>You are a nameless Stranger, asked by Myst’s benevolent patriarch Atrus to rescue his wife, Catherine, from an Age created by his wayward father. Play is about exploring the archipelago and poking at exquisite, weather-worn brass instruments to open doors and reach different islands. It's a mesmerising place, but a frustrating one to unravel: one of the first things you discover is a broken lever.</p>
<p>The other reason the Riven demo feels odds is that something in me rebels against the translation of the original’s static environment art into real-time 3D. The remake is beautiful, and moreover, true to the ethereal pristine dessication of the 1997 game’s Softimage-produced and Hypercard-mounted landscapes, but – perhaps because I used to dabble with making games in Hypercard myself – I felt a bizarre anxiety about failing to match my perspective to the old frozen vistas. Exploring the demo landscape felt like trying to align a pick with the innards of a lock. Probably that’s specific to me, and probably it’s a feeling I’ve amplified into a Take for want of thinking time. This isn't the first Myst game to undergo such cosmetic surgery - Myst V: End Of Ages and Uru were also given the real-time 3D treatment.</p>

<p>If it’s extended analysis of the Myst series you’re after, I will refer you initially to John Walker (RPS in peace), who in 2020 declared that the original Myst is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-myst-still-one-of-the-worst-games-ever">one of the worst games ever</a>. Below that article there’s a comment from Doomsayer who anxiously urges John to play Riven, because he will hate it even more.</p>
<p>“Here's the secret: There's only one real puzzle in Riven,” Doomsayer explains. “You'll know it when you see it. (And you will despair.) It's a puzzle that you'll need to gather clues for over the entire game; one that will send you going back and forth over and over again across the entire world. Even diehard fans hate it. It's brilliant: The entire game all for the one puzzle. There's no game on this Earth quite like it.” This is the kind of empathic audience participation you only ever get on Rock Paper Shotgun. We don't have the headcount to review the new Riven at the minute, but I might circle back to it at the end of the year.</p>

			<p>Diablo and Warcraft fans galore - Models of the Lich King's Frostmourne blade have been spotted in the Diablo 4 Season 5 PTR.</p>
<p>Two models of the legendary blade from the The Lich King were <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/frostmourne-models-discovered-in-diablo-4-season-5-ptr-343336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovere</a>d by outlet Wowhead. This might suggest that Diablo 4 players will soon be able to wield the iconic mourneblade. Both the Lich King's helm and Echo of Frostmourne already made their way to the latest Diablo entry as trophy slots, but Frostmourne might actually be added as a wearable blade.</p>
<p>As covered yesterday, Diablo 4 Season 5 will add a new roguelike mode to the game, new legendaries, items, and uniques. Also, weapon types will be expanded in this new season. Season 5 kicked on the PTR earlier today and is available on PC through July 2nd.&nbsp; The new season is expected to release on August 6 - running two months before the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-gets-october-date-new-cinematics-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred expansion</a> on October 8. We've included some additional details about this expansion below:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ranked among the apex predators of the jungle, the Spiritborn is an entirely new class to the Diablo series. They are battle-hardened with mystical synergies that could only be awakened deep within the jungles of Nahantu. Become one of the Spiritborn and embrace the ethereal Spirits entwined with this ancient civilization.</em></li>
<li><em>Explore Nahantu, the new jungle region in Diablo IV full of secrets, dangerous new Dungeons, Strongholds, and ferocious demons from warring Tribes.</em></li>
<li><em>Never fight alone, as new Mercenaries can join you on your quest to fight in the dense undergrowth of Nahantu and beyond. These powerful allies grow in power as they progress, and each are equipped with unique abilities to help you in combat.</em></li>
<li><em>Vessel of Hatred also has huge updates for all Diablo IV players with new class skills, paragon boards, legendary glyphs, dungeon types, Tree of Whispers activities, and more.</em></li>
<li><em>A new co-op PvE mode where you work with your friends to complete objectives and slay the boss in a multi-level dungeon, while getting loot and rewards.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Diablo 4 is available worldwide now across PC and consoles (and Game Pass).</p>

					<p>The Switch is home to more than its share of remakes and remasters, but despite having a hearty library of games worth revisiting, few if any Nintendo 3DS games have been up for revival. That’s about to change though, as the 3DS is finally getting a little love in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> (originally known as Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon in North America).</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2/Dark Moon really pushed what the 3DS could do back in the day, but does it still bust with the best a decade later on more capable hardware? Or is it hard to scare up much enthusiasm for this latest Nintendo revival? Tip-toe onward for the full rundown…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you’ve ever played a Luigi’s Mansion game before, you’ll be familiar with the basic setup here. That dastardly King Boo has escaped his bonds and shattered the Dark Moon which protects the Evershade Valley, causing it to become haunted up something fierce. Luigi is again recruited by friend/tormentor Professor E. Gad to don the upgraded Poltergust 5000 and cleanse multiple themed mansions of their pesky paranormal activity.</p>
<p>While there’s always debate about where the line between remasters and full-on remakes lies, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is unquestionably on the remaster end of the scale. While the game sports updated textures, character models, and improved lighting, actual level layouts and geometry doesn’t appear to have changed, with everything having a rather chunky, angular 3DS look. That isn’t to say the game is ugly, but it’s a solid notch below <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, which is one of the most visually polished first-party Switch titles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not a ton has changed in terms of core gameplay, either. As in all games in the series, Luigi uses his Poltergust vacuum to both interact with the environment and suck up specters. In battle, your goal is to stun ghosts with your flashbulb and then vacuum them up. Ghosts will try to break free from you, but pulling in the opposite direction fills a meter which allows you to unleash an extra burst of suction power. None of the moves added in Luigi’s Mansion 3, including the satisfying ability to smash ghosts into objects and each other, have been reverse-engineered into Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD – combat plays out like it always has.</p>
<p>Well, that’s not <em>entirely</em> true. The game was, unavoidably, a bit awkward to play on a 3DS owing to its lack of a second analog stick, but that’s obviously not a limitation Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD has to deal with. You can now move Luigi with the left stick and aim the Poltergust independently with the right stick, much like in Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3. That said, continuing this series’ history of inexplicable control limitations, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD doesn’t offer a single-stick option where your vacuum always points the same way you’re facing.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The level design of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is largely identical to how it was on the 3DS, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Each of the game’s five themed mansions offer satisfying classic-adventure-game-style exploration, with plenty of goodies and secrets hidden around nearly every corner. While there are some surprisingly challenging brainteasers to be found here, the puzzles aren’t quite up to the same level of creativity found in Luigi’s Mansion 3, with solutions eventually starting to feel a bit predictable. Boss encounters run the gamut, with some, like the giant spider lurking at the end of the first mansion, feeling like complex puzzles in their own right, while others are more by-the-book and repetitive.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unfortunately, Luigi’s Mansion 2’s generally impressive level design isn’t always well-served by the game’s mission structure. Unlike Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3, which give you a degree of freedom to explore the world as you wish, Luigi’s Mansion 2 is strictly mission-based, with areas of a mansion that don’t serve said mission typically being blocked off. While the majority of missions you’ll tackle are interesting enough, serving up new areas to explore and challenges to face, others are pretty obvious fillers. Particularly groanworthy are the repeated missions that task you with tracking down a wayward Polterpup, usually by revisiting numerous rooms you’ve already seen.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Also frustrating is the game’s save system, which only records your progress after you’ve completed a mission, some of which can be 30 to 40 minutes long. Have to quit midway through a mission? Too bad, back to the beginning. Die during a mission? Unless you find a hidden golden dog bone item during a mission, too bad. While Mansion-ending bosses are standalone missions that allow you to start right back at the beginning of the battle when you die, there are multiple missions that place minibosses likely to kill you the first time around at the end of a lengthy stage. Overall, Luigi’s Mansion 2 has more annoying difficulty spikes than you generally expect from a Nintendo-published game.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PVeXriFVrw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Luigi’s Mansion 2 may have started life on a small screen, it isn’t a small game. The main campaign will take you at least a dozen hours to complete, with additional collectibles, unlockable bonus stages, and ScareScraper mode to consider. A randomized four-player co-op dungeon hack with various game types, ScareScraper isn’t likely to take the world by storm, but it provides some quick-shot fun and, based on my hands-on time with Nintendo PR reps and fellow reviewers, the online play seems to be quite functional. Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD might not be the freshest dish, but you can’t criticize the portions.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a copy of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD provided by publisher Nintendo. </em></p>

					
					

<p>It’s easy to see why Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD stood out in its original form on the 3DS, and even today, there’s plenty of reason to like the green guy’s spooktacular sophomore outing. That said, limited efforts to update the original material, particularly some of the game’s more frustrating structural and design choices, makes this Mansion feel just a bit creaky.</p>

<h2 id="idsMpt"><strong>What to expect from Prime Day 2024</strong></h2>

<p>State of Decay developers Undead Labs have granted a fan’s wish by adding his late father in State of Decay 2.</p>



<div><p>The wholesome moment first appeared on Reddit by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EmbarrassedBudget859/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/u/EmbarrassedBudget859</a> four days ago, which was retweeted by the official <a href="https://x.com/StateOfDecay/status/1804644258600865870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1804644258600865870%7Ctwgr%5E69fb299fc6faebff529e1782333aebd6d65f14f4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fxboxera.com%2F2024%2F06%2F25%2Fstate-of-decay-developers-undead-labs-grant-a-fans-wholesome-wish%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">State of Decay Twitter page</a> a day later.</p><p>The official post said, “So my dad died a few years ago and I’m one of the many who are obsessed with this game. So… I sent the devs a message asking to put him in the game. And they did what they could, which means just adding his name to random survivors. 3 years later and I found HIM. not just his name. But his traits, everything about him. This will always be my forever community.</p></div>



<p>He continued, “Sorry the photo is trash but I’m still in shock. These devs need more recognition.”</p>



<p>As admitted, the photo wasn’t the best; however, just a few hours later, he uploaded a better image of his dad in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The State of Decay Twitter account credited Undead Labs Game Designer <a href="https://x.com/Rangutang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geoffrey Card</a> for granting the wish of the fan, a gesture that will stick with him for the rest of his life.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Undead Labs revealed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-decay-3-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer for State of Decay 3</a>, but unfortunately, there’s still no word on when the game will be released.</p>

Director Hidetaka Miyazaki himself says some of the bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree were designed to push players to their very limit, and after finishing the DLC, we’re inclined to agree.</p><p>So of course we decided to rank all of the new bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, from least difficult to most. One important caveat is that there are way more bosses than the ones we’ve listed here in the DLC. However, we’ve decided to just rank the main bosses – the ones that drop Remembrances you can then take to exchange for legendary gear and weapons. </p><p><strong>And of course, this is one of the most spoiler-filled lists we have for Shadow of the Erdtree, so do not read on if you haven’t finished the DLC. </strong></p><p>So with all that in mind, here are the toughest bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3><strong>10. Romina, Saint of the Bud</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-830-1719264941269.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though Romina is a bit of a later-half boss, she  ends up not being all too difficult. A sort of play on Melania’s Scarlet Rot boss, Romina is a flowery spellcaster whose primary attacks inflict Scarlet Rot if you stay too long in her poisonous fumes. Dodging those, and she can also send exploding butterflies at you.</p><p>Luckily, it’s quite easy to escape these noxious AoEs to get your hits in until she’s defeated. Whether you’re a melee player or a spellcaster, Romina hardly puts up a fight considering how late in the game you’ll face her.</p><h3><strong>9. Scadutree Avatar</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/elden-ringtm-20240618003517-1719274889332.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>One of the many big bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree, the Scadutree Avatar might be large, but is also, funnily enough, easy to miss. Tucked away in a hidden part of the Shadow Keep, the Scadutree Avatar is a large sunflower monster who takes big swipes and can cause some massive bleed damage at range. You also have to fight it three times in a row.</p><p>Luckily, like other big FromSoftware bosses, the Scadutree Avatar’s attacks are easy to dodge, and the boss’s primary difficulty stems from having to beat it three times more than any of its actual attacks. </p><h3><strong>8 . Metyr, Mother of Fingers</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/metyrboss-1719275676985.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Despite coming in near the bottom of the list, Metyr is still a very difficult boss thanks to her combination of big, physical AoE attacks and ability to fire lasers and other ranged abilities. Get too close and Metyr can squash you like a bug, while attacking from afar risks getting shot with a pretty powerful beam attack.</p><p>She also has a nasty ability to summon some fingery goons to help her, which can get pretty tiresome real quick. Still, Metyr is pretty weak to magic, so depending on your build you can quickly melt her health bar. </p><h3><strong>7. Divine Beast Dancing Lion</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-568-1719264965211.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Depending on how closely you’re following the critical path, the Divine Beast Dancing Lion is likely the first boss you’ll encounter in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, and FromSoftware sure enjoys setting the bar high.</p><p>The Divine Beast hits hard, moves fast, and can switch between shooting lighting, blasting you with frost, or blowing you away with wind. This is true FromSoftware combat, so get ready to dodge, duck, dive, dip, and get one, maybe two hits in before you repeat. The only reason why Divine Beast is this low on the list is because the other bosses are just straight-up harder.</p><h3><strong>6. Rellana, Twin Moon Knight</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/eldenringbosses-blogroll-1719274678707.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Rellana follows a rich tradition of duel-style bosses where the players feel like they’re going one-on-one with another player character, similar to Artorias and Lady Maria. The sister of Renalla, Rellana is a magical knight who combines vicious swordplay with a magic-focused second phase where she’ll wield both fire and ice magic against you. </p><p>A mix of close-combat hits, long-range AoEs, and a one-hit magic attack that took this writer multiple hours to figure out how to counter, Rellana was the first boss that I got stuck on, meaning I spent literal days trying to beat her, even with the help of a NPC summon.</p><h3><strong>5. Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/21/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-rune-skeleton-1708529241307.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>In a sense, Midra and Rellana are fairly similar bosses who utilize the same attack style of combining close-range sword attacks and long-ranged  abilities. Only in the case of Midra these long-range attacks are Frenzied instead of magic. The main differences between the two bosses is that Midra is a bit faster, Frenzy is slightly more annoying to deal with, and he has a bigger range for AoEs than Rellana.</p><p>Also, true to the Frenzied Flame name, Midra’s attack patterns are definitely more chaotic, meaning finding the patterns to dodge his attacks are just a bit trickier. </p><h3><strong>4. Putrescent Knight</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/godewyob0aajlu0-1719275490368.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Putrescent Knight gave me big Bloodborne vibes, not only from its design as a goopy, skeletal knight riding a slime horse, but also in its relentless attacks. The Putrescent Knight has a tendency to always hit a few more times than you expect, meaning when you think you’re in the clear and ready to take a swig from your flask, oops! He’s hit you again and now you’re dead.</p><p>More than that, the Putrescent Knight’s nasty habit of being able to split from his horse and temporarily become two enemies is also a headache to deal with.</p><h3><strong>3. Commander Gaius</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/commander-gaius-1719274578680.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>When speaking with my fellow early access Shadow of the Erdtree enjoyers, Gaius repeatedly appeared in the “Toughest Bosses” conversation. Sort of like a remixed version of Radahn from the base game, Commander Gaius charges into the battlefield on a mighty boar, to trample over players. Survive that? Well he’s armed to the teeth with gravity magic that he can then use in the second phase to crush you.</p><p>The biggest problem with Commander Gaius is you need to be perfect with your timing. If you fail to dodge him once, there’s a good chance he’ll stomp you out in a single go. But much like Radahn, if you take him head on and perfect your timing, you should be in a good place for one epic duel.</p><h3><strong>2. Messmer the Impaler</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/20240608021047-1-1719265032204.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>FromSoftware has heavily advertised Messmer leading into the release of the DLC, and for good reason. Messmer’s boss fight is one of the toughest in the entire DLC, and maybe the game. A two-part fight, Messmer begins his onslaught with his mighty spear, which has a huge range. Not only is Messmer fast, but his fire damage and counters make his first phase alone a pain to deal with.</p><p>The second phase is where, unfortunately, the real fight starts as he’s able to add a giant snake to his arsenal. You’ll have to dodge both Messmer and the snake because if either gets a hold of you, it’s likely game over. Whether you get gripped in the jaws of the snake as it pummels you into the ground, or deal with Messmer’s fiery grasp that can practically one-shot you, Messmer is a hard boss to read, and an even harder boss to dodge.</p><h3><strong>1. Promised Consort Radahn</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/25/consortradahn-1719274564949.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: FromSoftware, Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Effectively the “Final Boss” of the DLC, I have a feeling Promised Consort Radahn is who director Hidetaka Miyzaki might be referring to when he talked about pushing the boundaries of boss difficulty for the DLC.</p><p>To put it simply, Promised Consort Radahn is relentless. In his first phase, Radahn’s size belies his absolute speed. Hard-hitting, fast-moving, you’ll be lucky to get through his first phase unscathed between his massive sword swings, gravity attacks, and huge health bar.</p><p>The second phase, however, feels downright impossible. Adding Miquella’s holy attacks to Radahn’s moveset makes nowhere in the arena safe for the player. As holy beams rain down continuously around the duo, Promised Consort Radahn is now also able to move at the speed of light, rushing down the player insanely fast, and hardly ever letting up even then. What this does is effectively takes away the players’ greatest skill: the dodge roll. </p><p>It will take frame-perfect movement, guile, and maybe more than a little luck to get through this two-part boss fight. But I promise the feeling afterward will be worth it.</p><p>So that’s how we rank the toughest boss fights in the new Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree. Let us know in the comments which bosses are giving you a particularly hard time, and be sure to check out our Shadow of the Erdtree review if you haven’t already.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

The mod was posted to <a href="https://github.com/lostkagamine/SdvHardcoreMode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> by self-described software engineer and system administrator ‘lostkagamine’, and seemingly follows Hard Drive’s joke to the letter.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/stardew-valley-player-turns-hardcore-mode-joke-into-reality-creating-a-mod-that-ruthlessly-deletes-your-saves-if-you-dare-to-use-guides/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=gamestm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, the mod works by scanning every window on a player's computer while the game is open, and will immediately erase the current save file in the event that it detects ‘Stardew Valley Wiki’ in the title of an open browser page. “I have since updated it so that instead of just deleting your save, it also closes the browser window it finds the wiki in, just to add insult to injury,” wrote the mod’s creator in a <a href="https://x.com/nightshademagia/status/1804415579190620392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post on X</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i have since updated it so that instead of just deleting your save, it also closes the browser window it finds the wiki in just to add insult to injury <a href="https://t.co/xQCaG19DSA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xQCaG19DSA</a></p>— akemi homura, fallen from grace ⌚️ (@nightshademagia) <a href="https://twitter.com/nightshademagia/status/1804415579190620392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>You have to admire the commitment to the bit, and the mod will undoubtedly catch the interest of players who occupy the shared space on a very specific ven diagram that includes ‘<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> players’, and ‘Stardew Valley Enthusiasts.'

                <p>The developer behind the enormously popular Palworld said that it hasn't actually faced any sort of legal action from Nintendo or the Pokemon Company.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameFile</a>, Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe explained, "[We heard] nothing at all. Nintendo and the Pokemon Company didn't say anything to us." Palworld has been nicknamed "Pokemon with guns" by the general gaming community and players have noted the similarities between Palworld's creatures, called "Pals" and the ones in Pokemon.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-says-it-intends-to-investigate-palworld/1100-6520591/" data-ref-id="1100-6520591">issued a statement</a> saying that it would investigate acts that infringe on Pokemon's intellectual property rights.</p><p>Interestingly, Mizobe also said that creating something new is hard, and that he'd like to avoid it as much as possible. It was a lesson that he learned from working with Nintendo itself early in his game-development career. He was previously part of a training program sponsored by Nintendo for a year and helped launch a game called Tentai Shooter for the Nintendo DSi.</p><p>Palworld has been a massive success since it launched into early access on PC and Xbox earlier this year, passing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-tops-19-million-players-with-12-million-copies-sold-on-steam/1100-6520750/" data-ref-id="1100-6520750">12 million copies sold</a> on Steam and 19 million players total as of the end of January. Its first major content drop, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-is-getting-a-new-region-and-so-much-more-with-the-sakurajima-update/1100-6524055/" data-ref-id="1100-6524055">Sakurajima update</a>, launches on June 27 with a brand-new island and a PvP arena mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/should-we-abandon-the-hud-examining-its-impact-on-player-flow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a game designer, you’ve got to keep asking yourself: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What’s the goal of my design?</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> For a lot of us, it’s creating an immersive experience, which can be achieved by getting players into a flow state. To get them there, you need to know what might be getting in the way. One gameplay element that has been debated for a while is the head-up display (HUD).</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Flow in games">Flow in games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s clarify what flow actually is about. You’ve probably heard it’s about balancing challenge and skill, and that’s true, but there’s more to it.</span></p><p>Skill/challenge curve (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Flow is a special state where players get so absorbed into the game that they forget everything else—time, space, you name it. They’re focusing so hard that nothing else matters. Giving them a sense of control and making the gameplay experience incredibly engaging.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there’s a catch. The flow state can also lead to players losing self-reflection, making it hard to remember what happened. So, as a game designer, always consider your design goals. If you want to create an unforgettable experience, flow might not be the way to go.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The role of the HUD in game">The role of the HUD in game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The HUD is the piece of user interface (UI) that overlays gameplay, serving a crucial role. It conveys information and feedback to the player, but it also has a supportive role. Information and feedback shown on the HUD can often be gathered through other means. Take a healing effect, for example. The primary way of showing this is through some VFX and animation, but it’s also indicated by sounds and HUD animations that support the conveying of this crucial information to the player.</span></p><p>Screenshot from Overwatch 2 (Blizzard, 2022)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, information and player feedback are often represented in multiple ways, with the HUD being one of them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Impact of the HUD on flow">Impact of the HUD on flow</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, how does the HUD impact flow? In a few ways. First, removing the HUD might make players feel slightly out of control. This happens because players can feel lost without an ease of access to information, possibly weakening the flow state. However, this lack of easiness could also have its benefits. It forces players to concentrate more on what they’re doing, which could lead to a stronger flow state. This presents a confusing situation: losing the HUD might both strengthen and weaken the flow state.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So, should we abandon it?">So, should we abandon it?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s no clear answer to this question yet. The use of HUD has both its ups and downs, and it’s up to the game designer to figure out whether the benefits outweigh the downsides for their game. In game design there is one big rule: there are no set rules. It’s all about experimenting and taking the core of your game in mind. So, for anyone still wondering whether they should abandon the HUD, try it out. Who knows? Perhaps your game will be better for it. Or maybe not, and that’s why we experiment.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/25/deadrop-studio-drops-co-founder-dr-disrespect-after-allegations-surrounding-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/08/02/check-out-dr-disrespects-upcoming-shooter-deadrop-in-new-gameplay-clips">Deadrop</a> studio Midnight Society has terminated its relationship with co-founder and streamer Guy Beahm aka Dr. Disrespect. It did so after looking into allegations surrounding Beahm that emerged over the recent weekend regarding his 2020 Twitch ban.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Friday, June 21, former Twitch account director of strategic partnerships Cody Conners said on Twitter, "He [referring to Beahm] got banned because he was caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang." Conner replied to his own post on X (formerly Twitter) and said, "No one made the wrong decision, f*** him and his boys."&nbsp;</p>

<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>He got banned because got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text.</p><p>

— Cody Conners (@evoli) <a href="https://twitter.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Though Conners didn't name Beahm, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2019/2019/06/12/dr-disrespect-banned-from-e3-for-streaming-from-public-bathrooms-twitch-account">who was previously banned from E3 and suspended on Twitch after livestreaming from a public bathroom in 2019</a>, it was clear that he was referring to the streamer. Beahm even <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804337822415097955">replied</a> from his Dr. Disrespect account, saying he knows it's a "hot topic" but that it "has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged and they paid out the whole contract." He then <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">tweeted</a> separately, "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the f***ing internet. I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 2020, when Beahm was suddenly banned on June 26, Twitch shared little of the reasoning behind the decision. It released the following statement, "As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community." This ban happened shortly after Beahm signed with Twitch (again) for reportedly an eight-figure sum, as reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/#click=https://t.co/RnjsaKeGJP"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following this ban, Beahm told&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/#click=https://t.co/RnjsaKeGJP">The Washington&nbsp;Post</a>&nbsp;</em>weeks later he still didn't know why Twitch "effectively voided his contract" with the ban. A year after the ban, Beahm sued Twitch and roughly a year after that – so about two years after the ban – he and Twitch settled. At the time, Beahm posted a photo on March 10, 2022, with a paper he signed that read, "I have resolved my legal dispute with Twitch. No party admits to any wrongdoing."&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this sequence of events, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/dr-disrespect-launches-new-aaa-studio-with-call-of-duty-halo-veterans">Beahm also launched a new triple-A studio with Call of Duty and Halo veteran game developers</a> called Midnight Society. After Conners' reveal about Beahm on Friday, Midnight Society apparently assumed his innocence but began speaking to parties involved. After doing so, it decided to terminate its relationship with Beahm. Here's the studio's full <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">statement</a> on the matter:</p>

<p>"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder's Guy Beahm aka Dr. Disrespect. We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.</p>

<p>"While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially with fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Midnight Society doesn't say anything too specific, it did look into the situation following Conners' reveal, spoke to parties involved, and decided then (after previously assuming Beahm's innocence) that it was terminating its relationship with the streamer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Beahm hasn't acknowledged the Midnight Society situation, people that tuned into the Dr. Disrespect stream happening when the studio posted its statement think they can see the moment he sees the news live on-air. Here's a clip from&nbsp;<em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>reporter&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ethangach">Ethan Gach</a>:&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>You can see the exact moment Dr Disrespect appears to find out that Midnight Society is dropping him, or some other seemingly bad news related to his Twitch ban allegations.</p><p>

He had just defeated Bayle The Dread and went to look at his phone after fast travelling to Scadu Atlus <a href="https://t.co/CwgPSVYCXc">pic.twitter.com/CwgPSVYCXc</a></p></div>
— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1805357542786449698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Considering Beahm's Twitch ban was settled in court with the Amazon-owned streaming service, there's a good chance we don't learn about the sitaution as there are likely legal obligations stopping either party from sharing further details.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Streamer and Midnight Society co-founder Dr. Disrespect has been fired from his studio following an investigation into allegations that he sexted a minor.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Midnight Society says it became aware of allegations against Dr. Disrespect, real name Guy Beahm, on Friday evening. Beahm is one of the studio's co-founders, having set up Midnight Society alongside other heads <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drdisrespect-game-studio-midnight-society-announced">back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The studio says it presumed his innocence at first, but after speaking with "parties involved" with the allegations, Midnight Society "needed to act", hence the termination of its relationship with Beahm, effective "immediately".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-society-dr-disrespect-fired-deadrop.jpg?itok=YPc7Up7E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-society-dr-disrespect-fired-deadrop.jpg?itok=3Yq3IQ0Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Midnight Society is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Midnight Society goes on to say that details of the allegations are "difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept", but that it's the studio's "duty" to act "with dignity" on behalf of everyone involved.</p>
<p>These allegations emerged a few days ago thanks to <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676" rel="noopener" target="_blank">former Twitch employee Cody Conners</a>, who claimed Dr. Disrespect was banned from Twitch in 2020 because "he got caught sexting a minor".</p>
<p>Conners says Beahm was trying to meet up with the person in question at TwitchCon, but that Twitch shut the interaction down and banned Beahm from their platform.</p>

<p>Subsequently, esports news writer Jake Lucky <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1804328239441285485" rel="noopener" target="_blank">picked up Conners' post</a> and reported on it on X, prompting a response from Beahm in which he told Lucky that "no wrongdoing was acknowledged" and that the matter was "settled".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a recent Payday 3 developer diary, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r26hIijRoRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the upcoming additions due with the patch scheduled to go live on Thursday, June 27. One of the highlights is undoubtedly the arrival of the solo mode (as a beta) that franchise fans have long awaited, though it will still require an online connection for the time being.</p>
<p>Payday 3 Global Brand Director and Head of Community Almir Listo explained:</p>
<p><em>It's not our full vision for this feature. For now, we're setting it as a beta to test how it runs. We expect performance to be affected since the parts normally frontloaded by our servers will now have to be run on your own hardware. It will work, though, and you can get progression that'll update you once you return online. You will still be required to start the game while online in solo mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature. For now, though, we want to test that the features that went into this work work properly. Before the next iteration of the feature, we hope we'll have hosted co-op and all that cool stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>Keep in mind this is not an offline mode. It's a solo mode where the portions of the game previously hosted on our servers are now hosted on your device. Bear in mind that this is a stepping stone for a feature to come, not something we're releasing and calling done.</em></p>
<p>The upcoming Payday 3 update will also introduce support for NVIDIA DLSS 3 on PC (previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-ii-to-support-path-tracing-and-dlss-3-5-cod-modern-warfare-3-fortnite-payday-3-also-get-dlss-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> but mysteriously absent at launch), the ability to rename loadout, a free new playable character (Clover), two Weapons (Clover's signature gun and the LMG), three Masks, twelve Flag Stickers, and one Charm.</p>
<p>Payday 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/remnant-2-sales-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't have a successful launch</a>, and part of that was due to lackluster matchmaking. Starbreeze is preparing a new matchmaking service that should be ready by the end of the year, providing a better online experience for everyone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-ps3-emulation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-is-working-on-ps3-emulation-for-playstation-5-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.910455/</guid>

<p>Two insiders have claimed that PlayStation is reportedly working on PS3 emulation for the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s according to XboxEra’s Nick Baker and Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb, who have both claimed that PlayStation is working on PS3 emulation for the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The first report of the rumor came from Nick Baker, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwVRYZGPWEA&amp;t=10789s&amp;ab_channel=XboxEra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">who claimed</a> that “Sony is working on select PlayStation 3 backward compatibility.” Unfortunately, Baker doesn’t provide any other details and has seemingly covered all his bases using the term ‘select,’ which could mean one game or all of them.</p>



<p>However, Giant Bomb’s Jeff Grubb took to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7VhpUERtTk&amp;ab_channel=GiantBomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his podcast</a> to also cover the news and add a little more input on what he’s heard. “It’s something I’ve heard has been in the works for quite some time; I thought it was going to get revealed earlier this year when I first heard about it, but that clearly didn’t happen. That doesn’t mean it will never happen; maybe it does,” he said. Unfortunately, Grubb’s input is also pretty vague and doesn’t necessarily confirm that this could ever be released, but as always, with smoke, there’s fire.</p>



<p>Do you think PlayStation is working on PS3 emulation for the PlayStation 5? If so, which games would you like to see make their way to the console? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A remake of the original Jet Set Radio is in the works at SEGA, it is a full remake of the Dreamcast game and it is not related to the F2P reboot.</p><p>Source: Midori <a href="https://t.co/D7Cd8yDLly" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/D7Cd8yDLly</a></p></div>— Senhorita Kazzy (@MSKAZZY69) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSKAZZY69/status/1805073421916569982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Three of the screenshots show protagonist Beat exploring Tokyo by grinding on rails and running across walls, while the fourth shows the World Map, which features locations such as Central, DennoCho Station, Neribei, SubCul, and South.</p><p>The video shows what appears to be an in-development trailer for the game, again showing Beat traversing Tokyo while spraying graffiti, performing tricks, and more. This footage is incredibly similar, if not identical in places, to the "Next Generation" montage released by Sega when it announced the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-golden-axe-and-more-are-in-development-game-awards-2023">reboot alongside revivals of other classic franchises</a> Crazy Taxi, Golden Axe, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage in December 2023.</p><p>This remake, if real, is allegedly separate from the reboot of Jet Set Radio, but it does tick a lot of the same boxes. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jet-set-radio-reboot-appears-to-be-open-world-based-on-newly-revealed-info">The reboot is also likely open-world</a> and brings the classic characters and gameplay to modern platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/if-mr-house-is-in-fallout-season-2-which-new-vegas-ending-is-canon-fans-have-their-theories<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This week the showrunners of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunners-confirm-robert-house-for-season-2">confirmed Robert House “will be involved” in Season 2</a>, cementing the appearance of a major <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> character after a pre-war cameo in Season 1.</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Fallout Season 1 and Fallout New Vegas follow.</em></p><p>Given the Fallout TV show is set after all the Fallout games and is considered canon, the confirmation of Mr. House’s appearance in Season 2 has sparked all sorts of fan theories about how he’ll make his live-action appearance, and what it means for Obsidian’s much-loved New Vegas itself.</p><p>First, some background. Robert House appears in New Vegas as Mr. House. He rules New Vegas as a brain plugged into a supercomputer that has extended his existence from the pre-war era hundreds of years into the post-war era. Robert House makes a cameo appearance in the Fallout TV show during a pre-war scene in which the then RobCo Industries boss plots with Vault-Tec management and the heads of other companies to not only survive the inevitable nuclear apocalypse, but maybe even trigger it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Companies</h3></div></output><p>Season 1 ends with a Power Armor-clad Overseer Hank stomping towards New Vegas, with The Ghoul and Lucy MacLean in hot pursuit. Much of Season 2, it seems, will be set in New Vegas and deal with the coming together of the main characters there.</p><p>As for how this fits in the Fallout timeline, the Fallout TV show is set in 2296, nine years after the events of Fallout 4 and 15 years after the events of Fallout New Vegas. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-fans-are-convinced-a-brotherhood-of-steel-airship-confirms-one-of-two-canon-endings-from-fallout-4">We’ve already seen a debate about which Fallout 4 ending should be considered canon</a>, if any. And now we know Mr. House is in Season 2, presumably in the current post-apocalyptic timeline and not relegated to pre-war flashbacks only, fans are debating which New Vegas ending would make most sense as canon.</p><p>Let’s talk about New Vegas’ various endings. Depending on the choices the player, aka The Courier, makes throughout the course of the game, New Vegas can end with victory for the player during the Battle of Hoover Dam, which drives out all factions including Mr. House himself, a victory for Mr. House in which he remains in control of New Vegas and takes over Hoover Dam, a victory for Caesar's Legion, or a victory for the New California Republic.</p><p>There are variations within these endings, but let’s look in more detail at the one most fans now believe will be considered canon as we head into Season 2 of the TV show. If Mr. House is in Season 2 in a post-war setting, as in alive when the main characters turn up at New Vegas, then it’s likely he survived the events of New Vegas the video game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So, perhaps the New Vegas ending the show assumes to be canon is the one in which Mr. House's Securitron army takes control of Hoover Dam and the Strip, pushing both the Legion and the NCR out. This ending, the player is told, causes Mr. House to continue to run New Vegas in a despotic vision of pre-War glory. “The streets were orderly, efficient, cold,” the ending says. “New Vegas continued to be the sole place in the wasteland where fortunes were won and lost in the blink of an eye.”</p><p>As Fallout co-showrunner Graham Wagner has now confirmed: “Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound. Las Vegas in the world of Fallout is Robert House’s town. Robert House will be involved in Season 2.”</p><p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/TKsMantis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fallout lore expert TKs-Mantis</u></a>, the House ending in Fallout: New Vegas “is about to be canon when Season 2 of the show drops.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">House is alive, which means we might have chosen the Dam with NCR, they launch a bomb like shady sands. Maybe it goes downhill siding with House, The Courier is the unknown variable. So perhaps we died, or left. House had to pick a more irreliable apprentice. Caesars Legion??? <a href="https://t.co/a7AMNNR58e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a7AMNNR58e</a></p>— Hector Moya (@Pope831) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pope831/status/1805277440715219415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>What we don’t know is what happened to New Vegas in the 15 years after the events of the video game. The glimpse we get of New Vegas at the end of Season 1 shows the area in apparent ruins, which is not the state of the place at the end of the video game. If that glimpse does indeed reflect the New Vegas we’ll see in Season 2, how did things get so bad?</p><p>But there is some debate about the reliability of the New Vegas teased at the end of Season 1. Some believe the images we see do not show New Vegas in ruins at all, rather just as run-down as most places in the Fallout universe (no-one ever tidies up!). Similarly, there are questions over whether Caesar's Legion, the NCR, or even The Boomers will have survived. Will the Courier still be around? The only thing that is clear, really, is that there are many questions to be answered.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-the-snake-oil-salesmans-mysterious-serum-in-the-fallout-tv-show-fans-have-theories"><u>Fans have plenty of theories about the Snake Oil Salesman’s mysterious serum</u></a>, for example (this one's my favorite!).

In the interview, Howard confirms the bombs that destroy Shady Sands, as seen in the Fallout TV show, fall just after the events of New Vegas.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>It is that time of year again, folks.</p>
<p>Steam has announced that its summer sale - often lauded as being one of PC gaming's most important and beloved annual oppurtunities to save some money - will kick off in just a couple of days, on 27th June.</p>
<p>"Fighting games? Check. RPGs? Check. Relaxing? Hack &amp; Slash? Adventure? FPS? Check, Check, Check, Check. In other words, ALL genres," Valve teased in the sale's promo video, which you can watch below. That includes deals on some of this year's most popular releases, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> (pictured above) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-tips-how-to-get-started-and-what-to-do-first-9431">Manor Lords</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-0-to-introduce-120-fps-support-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s.910422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming Final Fantasy XIV 7.0 patch will bring plenty of visual improvements to the MMORPG, as well as 120 FPS support on consoles and NVIDIA DLSS support on PC, among other things.</p>
<p>As confirmed by the preliminary 7.0 patch notes found on the game's official website, the upcoming patch will introduce 120 FPS support on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game, however, is not expected to run at the maximum framerate all the time, so it will be very interesting to see how it will run with the new visual improvements the patch will bring, which include improved hair and face textures, changes in lighting due to the passage of time, soft shadows, improvement for lenses in glasses and other glass objects, metallic material on certain gear, water and waves, fog, textures of distant terrain when riding a Mount and more.</p>
<p>The upcoming Final Fantasy XIV patch will also bring some PC-specific improvements, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-benchmark-test-previews-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-additions-and-graphics-improvements/">AMD FSR 1.0 and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 upscaling</a>, which were both announced a while back, anti-aliasing via TSMCAA and SSAO via GTAO.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy XIV 7.0 patch also brings plenty of additional content as part of the new Dawntrail expansion. You can find the full patch notes by going <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game could be released on Nintendo Switch 2 as well, but not in its launch window.</p>

            <p>
Square Enix has released the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d">full patch notes for Patch 7.0</a>, ahead of Dawntrail's early access launch later this week.

</p>
<p>
The notes give a rundown of what additions and tweaks players can expect from the new expansion. Much of this includes known and expected changes like level cap increases and new quests, on top of a look at new locations and duties. If you're avoiding spoilers, you may want to skip the notes.
</p>
<p>
However, there are also some smaller but welcome additions worth pointing out, as well as a stark look at the visual changes the graphical update will bring.

<p>

Firstly, though, it should be pointed out Final Fantasy 14 will be unavailable to access from 26th - 27th June as maintenance is performed across all Worlds in preparation for Dawntrail. These patch notes explain what will be implemented.
</p>
<p>
As already widely reported since the announcement at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-next-expansion-dawntrail-will-be-the-very-best-summer-vacation">Las Vegas Fan Fest</a>, Patch 7.0 will introduce a graphical update that's been applied for all Dawntrail content, with similar updates coming to older content in future updates. The update includes improved textures and lighting, as well as other more subtle effects and changes.
</p>
<p>
In the patch notes, a couple of slider images indicate the improved textures - it looks like wearing glasses after having blurry vision. The aim of this update is to futureproof the game for years to come.
</p>
<p>
To ensure players are happy with the graphical changes to their characters, everyone will receive a free Fantasia item with which to edit their character. Now, though, players will have up to 60 minutes of in-game time in which to re-edit their character should they change their minds once seeing their character in action.
</p>
<p>
Further, the patch will introduce new hairstyles, the ability to add two colours when dying gear, and a separate option for facewear - so now you can wear glasses and a helmet together.
</p>
<p>
Two other tweaks are very welcome. The first, as previously mentioned in the Live Letter from the Producer but worth reiterating, is that other players around a quest giver can be temporarily hidden - a major tweak considering the high number of players expected for Dawntrail's launch.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Secondly, quest objectives that require following an NPC now have visual indicators to help avoid detection. Endwalker introduced a number of these stealth missions, but they sometimes proved frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Other small tweaks include: the ability to use a DualSense Edge controller on Windows; trophies and achievements unlocking from play on other platforms; and the addition of the mute list and term filter for better safety.
</p>
<p>
And, very importantly, there is now a new adorable llama mount.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the notes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-server-capacity-increased-by-roughly-50-compared-to-launch-of-endwalker">reiterate measures temporarily implemented to reduce server congestion</a>: restricting travel between certain Worlds and data centres; automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity; and new areas being split into multiple instances.
</p>
<p>
Dawntrail releases in early access this Friday, 28th June, with the full launch arriving on 2nd July. This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-dawntrail-wont-release-until-the-end-of-june-so-you-can-play-the-elden-ring-dlc">pushed back a week</a> due to the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree.
</p>
<p>
I played a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">preview version of Dawntrail last month</a> and described it as Final Fantasy 14 "at its most colourful".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-1080p-not-smart-performance-concerns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/">1080p screen</a>, but this may not be the smartest decision due to various reasons, including mishandled backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QzCkpTE0bM0?si=k3F_0juuhO3ZK0nc&amp;t=5007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DF Direct Weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry answered a fan question regarding the next Nintendo console, commenting on how a 1080p screen may not be the best of choices. If the console supports backward compatibility with the original Switch games, as rumored, it could lead to some image quality issues, as games in portable mode on the current console output at 720p resolution, which would look blurry on a 1080p screen. To address this issue, the Nintendo Switch 2 would essentially have to use backward compatible game's docked mode, which output at 1080p resolution, while running them in portable mode.</p>
<p>Even for Nintendo Switch 2 games, a 1080p screen could be an issue. While developers can certainly target 720p resolution, it wouldn't look good on such a screen. On the other hand, NVIDIA DLSS support could be quite helpful in this regard, as 540p resolution upscaled to 1080p would look better than 720p resolution on a 1080p screen. Digital Foundry, however, feels that a 720p screen would be more beneficial for the system, as a lower resolution could leave more performance headroom in portable mode and would still look good, as proved by the Steam Deck. HDR support would also be quite an update over the current Switch models.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #168: Starfield Series S 60FPS, New PS2 Emu For PS5, ARM Windows Gaming Disappoints" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzCkpTE0bM0?start=5007&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2, but more information on the system, rumored to launch in the first few months of 2025, should be coming before the end of the year.</p>

This change was welcomed by fans because, it was hoped, it would finally make the Spear weapon more reliable out on the battlefield.</p><p>However, players soon found that the Spear, the very weapon Arrowhead had sought to fix, caused crashes, resulting in a fresh recommendation not to use it.
