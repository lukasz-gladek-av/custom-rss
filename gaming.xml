Anyone order a point-and-click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game for later this month featuring a cast of British actors that'll make you go "oh, right, them!" when you Google them? Well, someone must have, because Earth Must Die, the next game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lair-of-the-clockwork-god">Lair of the Clockwork God</a> developer Size Five Games, now has a release date. Come on, it's getting cold!
</p>
<p>
Or it's still cold, because it's not out yet? I'm losing myself in the metaphor here, point is, Size Five announced today alongside publisher No More Robots that Earth Must Die will be launching January 27th. That's less than two weeks away! I can count! In any case, not only did the game get a new release date and a star studded trailer, it also has a demo for you to have a crack at!
</p>

<p>
For those that need a more formal introduction first, Earth Must Die stars the very regularly named VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the Tyrythian Empire, who is very upset that "those idiotic, moronic Terranoids" took over his kingdom that he definitely didn't inherit from his father and for sure built up himself (sounds like we got a real nepo baby over here). As a result, he's decided he's going to kill pretty much everyone on earth. Lovely!
</p><p>
Right, those British actors - you'll find the likes of Joel Fry (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, Our Flag Means Death), Little Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Martha Howe-Douglas (Horrible Histories), and for a name that'll be more widely familiar globally, Final Fantasy 16 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>'s Ben Starr.
</p>
<p>
If all of that sounds good to you, you can wishlist and check out the demo for Earth Must Die on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">Steam</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[I Nearly Made It Through All Of 2025 Without Playing A Single Console Game]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/gran-turismo-7-review-impressions-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1406383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Right before Christmas time,<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/"> <u>when I started putting my Game of the Year list together</u></a>, I had an odd realisation: not only was not a single game on the list something I played on console, but I didn't remember playing <em>any </em>console games through all of 2025.</p><p>I mean, I'd <em>dabbled</em>. You can't work in this job without picking up a controller at some point, and so if you were being a pedantic asshole you could say I "played" <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> at a friend's place. But both were for a matter of minutes, literally to check them out; to say I'd <em>played </em>them would be like sitting through the first four minutes of <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> then saying you'd seen the movie.</p><p>It was an odd thing to reckon with. Partly because it must surely have been the first year I hadn't properly played a console game since the 1980s, which would have been a hell of a run, but mostly because I quickly realised that instead of being some life-changing realisation, shaking the very foundations of my understanding of this medium and my place in it, it ended up as some harmless trivia. I just didn't really care. It was 2025, you can play <em>The Last of Us</em> on PC now, who gives a shit what machine you play a game on.</p><p>Not that it really mattered, because on December 25 I opened a present from my kids and it was a copy of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The most perfect game to land in this situation, given the fact it's probably the most console-ass AAA title left on the planet that doesn't have the word Nintendo on the box. Sony has put a lot of PlayStation games on PC over the last few years, from <em>Horizon </em>to <em>God of War</em> to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, but not this. Never this. <em>Gran Turismo</em> IS PlayStation, it is born of the console; PC racing games are a different breed, and Polyphony must rightly reckon that this experience, a quintessential Japanese console game right down to the music and menus, just wouldn't work there. So if I wanted to play <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and I did, it was going to have to be on the PlayStation 5.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Those are Australian dollars, but whatever dollars you're using, it's a lot</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why now? This game came out in 2020! Well, I'm not ashamed to say that while I am an enemy of brands and the idea of loving brands, I have one glaring and fatal exception: the electric car manufacturer Polestar. I'm very into the company's focus on both design and sustainability. I own a Polestar 2 and it's incredible, but I want a Polestar 5 more than I have ever wanted a car in my life. Thing is, it's priced at roughly <em>AUD$250,000 </em>(see above), so it's a car I'll likely never get to even <em>drive</em>, let alone park in my garage. So the closest I'll probably ever get is driving one in a mostly-realistic driving video game, where it recently arrived as part of an update that doubled as a marketing exercise for Polestar (see below). A cheap and obvious marketing trick, but they got me.</p><p>I'm still not buying the car (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">unless?!?!</a>), but PlayStation in particular got me, because I <em>love </em>this game. I've always been a fan of <em>Gran Turismo</em> for the simple reason that while it's got its fair share of car tweaks and spare part settings, the main purpose of the series is to serve as an interactive car brochure, a digital exploration of the fancier end of automotive culture. This isn't a driving game with radio DJs and a neon interface,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assetto-corsa-rally-impressions-review/"> <u>nor is it <em>Assetto Corsa</em></u></a>; this one goes out to everyone who obsesses over driving a car that costs more than an apartment, but who doesn't mind having to drive a Mazda 3 for a few laps first. Like me.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBDF7TuSjQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Polestar 5 meets Gran Turismo 7 | Polestar"></iframe></figure><p>To give you an idea of the game's tone, if you haven't already played it: Your main source of progression in <em>GT7 </em>is visiting a lovely little cafe in the woods and getting missions from its friendly owner, while a camera pans lovingly over whatever car you're driving at the time and a succession of automotive celebrities and designers share trivia with you about some random BMW from the 1970s. For anyone who is into the looks and history of cars, this is sicko stuff, it's perfect.</p><p>It's also great that despite all the advances in video game horsepower over the last three decades, this is still very much a <em>Gran Turismo</em> game, with the same pros and cons I could have listed after a few hours with <em>GT2</em>. It feels "real" but also weirdly sterile, and the sound effects are realistic but also empty, but the handling and races are all honed so perfectly that none of that really matters. The urge to win a few more bucks so you can buy an old Ferrari overpowers every other complaint I have about spending more time in menus than on the track, or the game still somehow not having a proper damage system. About the only things that <em>have </em>changed since 1997 are that the graphics have got better while the music has got worse.</p><figure></figure><p>Not that I bought too many Ferraris; I wanted this game for the Polestar 5, and after a little grind to unlock it I got my hands on it and never looked back. This thing <em>flies</em>, especially with upgrades, and while I'll never own one I can now at least say I've come as close as I ever will, from getting to hear its electric whirr through my soundbar to panning the in-game camera around its interior and leaving its cinematic driving videos to play on my TV like an aspirational screensaver.</p><p>For the sake of trivia, it would have been interesting to make it through all of 2025 without properly playing a console game. But for the sake of my own enjoyment, I'm very glad I broke that streak with just a few days to spare.</p>

Hurst is probably best known for his role as Opie Winston in the FX series <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, and he most recently appeared in the Netflix series <em>The Abandons</em> last year. However, Hurst also provided the voice of Thor in 2022’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness">God of War Ragnarök</a>, a performance that earned him a BAFTA nomination. In those games, Kratos was portrayed by Christopher Judge.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS Plus Extra Packs A Big Lineup This Month Just In Time For Resident Evil 9]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jan-2026-ps-plus-resident-evil-village-2000659885</link>
            <guid>1406344</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony revealed the latest games coming to PS Plus Extra in January 2026 and the headliner will be arriving just in time for anyone who still needs to catch up on Capcom’s survival horror franchise ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>.<em> Resident Evil Village</em>, along with eight other games, will all be joining the PlayStation subscription library this month.</p> <p>Even if you’ve never played <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, you’ve probably encountered its fan-favorite vampire giantess <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-villages-lady-dimitrescu-was-worth-the-wa-1846848171">Lady Alcina Dimitrescu</a>. And while completing <em>Village</em> isn’t essential for anyone planning to play <em>Requiem</em> at launch on February 27, it’ll certainly be a nice option for passing the time until then. The other headliner this month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, the 2024 <em>Yakuza</em> game that’s a turn-based RPG and the first in the series to go outside of Japan.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games for Extra and Premium tiers in January 2026:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Resident Evil Village</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Exit 8</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Art of Rally</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Little to the Left</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li> <p><em>Ridge Racer</em> | PS5, PS4</p> </li> </ul> <p>I’d like to draw quick attention to two of the smaller games above: <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> and <em>Art of Rally</em>. Both are excellent. <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> isn’t what some fans of the original game wanted, but it’s a neat crisis-management RPG mapped onto the roguelike structure of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. <em>Art of Rally</em> is a beautiful, minimalist, chill top down racing game. Give both a try if you haven’t already.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>A Little To The Left</em> is great as well, especially for couch buddies who might not normally play games. You organize stuff in unusual ways to unlock little easter eggs. It’s way cooler than it might sound.</p>

			<p>Amazon's upcoming <strong>God of War TV show</strong> has a <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner in <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a>, a director for its first few episodes in Shogun director <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">Frederick E.O. Toye</a>,</strong> and today, Amazon and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong> announced the first confirmed member of the show's cast. <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who players will recognize as the voice of <strong>Thor</strong> from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a></strong>, will step into the role of <strong>Kratos</strong> for the upcoming show.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2011529372608364835"> post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Prime Video account</a>. The post simply reads, "<em>Meet Ryan Hurst, your Kratos in the God of War series coming to Prime Video</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it's not <strong>Christopher Judge</strong> in the role, the voice actor who is now famous for his portrayal of Kratos and his ability to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H30ydojdbuc">one three-letter word with more authority than anyone has ever put behind it</a>, Ryan Hurst is still an incredible choice. The side-by-side photo shows that he at least has the beard down (save for some colouring that'll likely come once filming starts), and we know from his performance as Thor that he'll be able to step into the role of Kratos without skipping a beat.</p>



<p>Now that we have our Kratos, with the show reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to begin filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, hopefully, we'll soon learn who else will be filling out the rest of the cast. As cast members and characters start to be named, we'll also learn more about the approach that Amazon is taking to this show. We know that it will be jumping into the Norse setting of the recent games, but whether it will follow the same story from the previous two games or create its own is unclear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/ryan-hurst-cast-kratos-prime-video-god-of-war-1236683097/">Deadline</a> </em>is&nbsp;reporting that Sony and Amazon have tapped <em>Sons of Anarchy </em>and <em>God of War: Ragnarök </em>actor Ryan Hurst to play Kratos in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-amazon-ps5-release-date-trailer-1851675600">upcoming live-action <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p> <p>Hurst, who played Thor in the 2022&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game, will be swapping roles for the show, and will lead the series based on the storylines of the modern <em>GoW </em>games, which find Kratos interacting with (and often fighting) figures from Norse mythology. We still don’t know who will be playing his son Atreus, but it’s cool to have Hurst on as someone who is intimately familiar with the source material.</p>  <p>Along with playing Thor, Hurst’s notable credits include playing Opie in&nbsp;<em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, as well as Beta in the&nbsp;<em>Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise, both in the main series and the <em>Fear the Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>spin-off show. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series&nbsp;<em>The Abandons</em>.</p>

 <p>If you want a quick refresher on Hurst’s acting chops, someone was kind enough to compile all his scenes as Thor in <em>Ragnarök</em>.</p>  <p>That’s the only casting news we have for now, but given that the show seems to be comfortable picking from the game’s cast, it would be interesting to see Sunny Suljic&nbsp; reprise his role as Atreus for the series, though the 20-year-old actor might be a bit too old to play the child as he appeared in the 2018 game at this point. Atreus was still a young teen by the time <em>Ragnarök&nbsp;</em>came around, however, and Suljic still looks pretty young.</p>

 <p>There were rumors that Christopher Judge, the actor who plays Kratos in the Norse <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, was also up for the live-action role last year, but Judge himself seemed to debunk these in <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1968155387863109880">an X post</a> in September.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series is coming from writer, showrunner, and executive producer <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-tv-ronald-d-moore-battlestar-galactica-1851770751">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who is best known for his work on <em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.</p>

<p>Prime Video’s God of War series has its Kratos.</p>



<p>The company announced on Wednesday that Ryan Hurst has been cast to play the lead protagonist Kratos in the upcoming series. The show is currently in pre-production with casting continuing.</p>







<p>Hurst is known for his roles as Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans. In the video game world, Hurst’s only role was as Thor in God of War Ragnarok. He was nominated for a BAFTA in 2022 for Performer in a Supporting Role for his depiction of the God of Thunder.</p>



<p>Speaking of Thor, according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to recent reports</a>, Olafur Darri Olafsson is in talks to play the role in the series. The series will focus on the Norse saga from the 2018 God of War and the aforementioned Ragnarok. </p>



<p><strong>“God of War&nbsp;follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye,” </strong>the show’s synopsis reads. <strong>“Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p>In addition to casting, it’s been revealed that the series has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already been renewed</a> for a second season before the first season even begins filming. Filming of the initial season is expected to being sometime in February, with the first two episodes directed by The Boys and Fallout director Frederick E.O. Toye.</p>



<p>There’s been no word on when the series will debut. </p>

            <guid>1406305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">An enjoyable survival crafter with some thoughtful tweaks and additions.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After about 10 hours in Hytale, the new survival crafter from some former <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review">Minecraft</a> modders, there really isn't a better way I could describe it other than to say it's basically Minecraft 2. From the block-by-block breaking and building, to the stylized environments and enemies, to the procedural world generation, this feels like the, "What would we change if we had the chance to start over again?" version of the now legendary 2009 classic. Many games have been influenced by Mojang's trendsetter, but this is more of a cover song than a subgenre from what I’ve seen so far (though I’ve got plenty more to play before my final review). And while developer Hypixel Studios’ lawyers might not love hearing me say that, I honestly don't think it's a bad thing. Even in Early Access, it's a good cover!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the gameplay will be pretty familiar if you've put any time at all into Minecraft, but with some streamlining here and there. You no longer have to begin your journey punching trees, for instance, since basic tools are made with sticks and rubble that can be collected easily with your bare hands. Also, breaking the trunk of a tree will cause everything above it to collapse and drop its resources, which was almost enough to win me over on its own. I still to this day hate having to chop upwards to hollow out a tree in Minecraft!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Movement is also a lot more modern and fluid. You can jump up to three blocks high and pull yourself up, which feels like such a huge quality-of-life improvement over the one-block jump limit in Minecraft. It's even possible to take a running leap at a ledge, hit the side, and pull yourself up. We've got proper parkour now, and I don't know that I would ever want to give it up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also just runs better than Minecraft on my Ryzen 7 3700X, 32GB RAM, and RTX 4070 Ti-powered system. Even with the draw distance cranked up, my framerates sit comfortably above 60. We'll see how long that lasts when I start building elaborate megastructures, but for now it's like butter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is fine. There are a handful of different weapon types, from swift-slashing double daggers to a classic sword and shield setup with more defensive options, and every one has its own unique charge attack and a special meter that can be filled up to release a devastating finisher. I'm impressed with the enemy variety so far, with everything from goblin bomb-throwers to really terrifying lava toads that can catch you with their tongues and pull you in for a very painful bite attack.</p><p>It's almost like someone's wishlist of things Minecraft can't or will never do.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building can be a little bit fiddly. We have more pieces to pick from, like proper roofs that make Minecraft's classic stair tricks redundant. But sometimes I had to do silly stuff like building a dirt "mold" to make sure all the pieces were facing the right way. Still, once I got the hang of its quirks, I was able to start making some pretty neat-looking stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's very little direction in this Early Access version of Hytale, currently. The main hub area, the Forgotten Temple, is a rotunda of literal Under Construction signs. I even stumbled into some dungeons out in the world where I'd be excited to throw the doors open only to find one of these disappointing barriers. It's not clear what the larger, overarching goal is supposed to be, although I'm happy enough to build cool stuff and seek out new ores for higher-level tools at the moment. But I'm not sure if there will eventually be a story or bigger bosses to find or anything like that. I haven't run into them yet if they exist already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, I'm quite enjoying my time with Hytale so far, though. Even if it is just Minecraft again, it's an enjoyable rendition with some thoughtful tweaks and additions. It's almost like someone's wishlist of things Mojang will never do, or can't do with its legacy tech. I plan to put in at least a few dozen more hours before I give it a final evaluation, but check back for more updates on my progress in the coming week.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Survival Crafting Games</h3><p>I've reviewed a lot of these!

The Frostfire path can also be completed concurrently alongside the Season 1 battle pass. Unlike previous bonus paths, all points for the Frostfire bonus path are earned through new weekly challenges that will be provided.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 will introduce a new set of daily login rewards and several Double XP weekend events throughout this extended update period.

The third and final phase of content arrived just before the winter holidays, but the update added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-buggy-update-is-being-fixed-as-new-patches-scheduled-and-tournament-delayed/1100-6536891/">host of issues that affected gameplay</a>. This mishap also caused Battlefield 6's $1 million tournament series for Redsec to be postponed.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield Studios said it will reinforce Battlefield Labs as a public preview for future game updates once they are in the late stages of development. "Both the Season 1 extension and the use of Battlefield Labs will set the foundation for new and exciting content throughout our live seasons, including what will come in Season 2," the developer said.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 will now begin on February 17, and the developer said new details will be revealed next month.

What follows is the players navigating the various factions and internal politics of Ship City, and exploring ancient ruins on distant moons.</p><p>The summary of <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> is in keeping with the appeal of <em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em>.

<p>The recent run of layoffs at Ubisoft are continuing as the company confirmed that it has let go a number of staff at its Abu Dhabi studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, 29 people have been let go by Ubisoft. In a statement, Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs took place last year, and says it was based on a decision made in November. </p>







<p><strong>“In November, Ubisoft made the difficult decision to restructure its Abu Dhabi mobile studio, discontinuing some projects in order to focus on&nbsp;Growtopia,”</strong> they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Game Developer</a>.<strong> “As a result, this change impacted 29 team members.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We remain deeply grateful for their contributions and are providing support to them throughout the transition.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the layoffs at the Abu Dhabi studio, Ubisoft has recently closed its Halifax location while also letting go dozens of other employees in Sweden and elsewhere. Regarding the Halifax closure, the union representing 61 of the staff impacted has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a legal complaint</a> against the company and is requesting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cwa-union-met-ubisoft-company-brought-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparency on claims</a> that the decision is out of financial necessity.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for clarity on its current plans and if more layoffs should be expected. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

			<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> announced it had voted for wall-to-wall union representation</a> under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/"><strong>CWA Canada</strong>,</a> with <strong>61</strong> of the studio's <strong>71</strong> employees joining <strong>Local 30111 </strong>alongside <strong><a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a></strong>. Not even three weeks later, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>shutting down the studio and laying off all 71 workers</strong></a>, denying that the shutdown had anything to do with the majority of its staff unionizing.</p>



<p>In response, the CWA Canada said it would "<em></em><em>pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way</em>." That process has seemingly begun, as the media union has <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/13/union-files-labour-board-complaint-over-ubisoft-halifax-shutdown/">filed an official complaint with the <strong>Nova Scotia Labour Board</strong></a> over the closure, and today, the union expressed further outrage after learning that Ubisoft was given <strong>nearly $1 billion CAD in tax credit subsidies</strong> in the last five years alone while operating in Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>Provincial and state governments will often offer companies tax breaks as incentives to establish a base of operations in their state or province, and in the case of Ubisoft, the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> company has quite the history of taking advantage of these breaks to establish what have become some of its most important offices. </p>



<p><strong>Ubisoft Montreal</strong>, for example, was first set up due to Quebec having attractive tax incentives. If not for those incentives driving Ubisoft to open a studio in Montreal, the city may not have grown into the incredible hub of game development it is today, with scores of talented developers calling Montreal their home.</p>



<p>While Halifax hasn't grown as a game development hub in the same way that Montreal did, as CWA Canada president Carmel Smyth pointed out when the union filed its complaint, "<em>Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry. Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology</em>."</p>



<p>Once the union dug through French Senate documents to see just how much of a tax break the company was receiving, it not only found that Ubisoft had received more tax breaks from Canada than any other country, but also that in the last five years, it had received hundreds of millions in tax credits.</p>



<p>"<em>According to the documents, Ubisoft got 605.6 million Euros (about C$980 million at today’s exchange rates) in tax credits from Canadian governments from 2020 through 2024</em>," CWA Canada writes in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s outrageous that a company can take hundreds of millions in tax breaks – public money – and then shut down an operation and lay off workers</em>," added Smyth. "<em>And it’s shocking that governments allow it to happen</em>. <em>We need immediate changes to hold companies to account. The rules must make it clear that if you close or significantly downsize a business, you must pay back any government subsidies.</em>"</p>



<p>CWA Canada is also holding to its accusation that Ubisoft shut down the Halifax studio "<em>to keep out the union</em>." While Ubisoft denies that the shutdown had anything to do with the studio unionizing, CWA Canada notes that if the shutdown had been planned as Ubisoft claims, it wouldn't have caught the staff entirely by surprise as it did, and that Ubisoft has yet to provide evidence proving the shutdown was a decision made through "<em>financial necessity</em>."</p>



<p>Since the shutdown was announced, legal and public pressure from the CWA Canada has already pushed Ubisoft to <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/12/ubisoft-agrees-to-reconsider-compensation-for-laid-off-halifax-workers-amid-union-public-pressure/">consider raising the severance offered to the 71 workers laid off from the Halifax studio</a>. While that may be all the union is able to get out of this, the pressure applied here, specifically regarding how Canada and its provincial governments approach tax incentives, could create significant change down the line.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-reading-5-at-a-time">Patrick Recommends: Reading 5% at a Time</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jingdachen?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Jingda Chen</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>I read a lot. I also do not read very often. It depends on your definition of "reading." Because while I spend much of my day on the internet and, inevitably, countless hours reading words, that's not what I'd really call "reading," you know?</p><p>What's the last book I read? A short story collection by Stephen King. The last book before that? Stephen King's <em>Revival</em>, which I have to say was a real banger. But reading does not come in fits and starts for me, it's just been altogether dead once I moved to San Francisco in my early 20s and my career started taking off. Playing video games for a living has consumed all the time I'd used for reading.</p><p>Well, 20ish years later, I'm trying to change that. In a Rob-coded fashion, I tried to kickstart things by buying a new device. In this case, it's just a boring Kindle. Maybe a different E Ink reader will make sense once I've become a regular reader, but it seemed to make the most sense to just get my goddamn foot in the door. And while the charm of a new device was enough to boost me through half of the first book I nabbed, <em>Wake Up and Open Your Eyes </em>by Clay McLeod Chapman, the Kindle entered a dormant start of slowly losing a charge on my side of the couch.</p><p>Reading, like anything, can become a habit. To become a habit, though, requires work. You need to make it part of a routine, so that it feels weird <em>not</em> to do it. (My body genuinely feels <em>off</em>, for example, when I don't work out after two days.) The method came up with, ultimately, was one born out of a little bit of annoyance.</p><p>While reading, I hated seeing the page number, percentage number, or "hours left to read" taunting me at the bottom. I realize that turning a page in a physical book is, <em>obviously</em>, going to reveal how close you are to to the end, but I found it distracting to watch that number click up while I was reading. (I feel a similar anxiety while running on a treadmill—always checking the numbers. Similarly, how I checked the clock at work when I was a teenager.) I found a way to flip this off (you just have to click it a few times), but then it dawned on me: maybe this was the way to turn this into a habit. What if I decided to read a set amount each night?</p><p>I set an arbitrary number: five-percent every night. At five-percent, you drop stop once you've finished the chapter. It adds up to a few chapters during every session.</p><p>Folks, I love this. I still turn off the percentage <em>while</em> I'm reading, but every 15 minutes or so I'll check in and see how close I am to the end. Not because I'm excited to stop reading, mind you, but because I'm excited to see if I can bust through the goal before I need to be asleep. It's exhilarating to have a night where I hit 10-percent, which is now happening pretty regularly when I fire up the Kindle.</p><p>This helped me blast though the second half of <em>Wake Up and Open Your Eyes</em>, despite loathing the book. I'm having a way better time with <em>The Ruins</em> by Scott Smith, a recommendation from my colleague and friend Kirk Hamilton. Between some combination of <em>The Ruins </em>being a far superior book and a few weeks of doing my five-percent rule, it's clear I'm already going to move past my soft goal of reading one book per month in 2026. I'll become a reader yet, one percent at time.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-brent-hull-snarky-woodworker-builder">Rob Recommends: Brent Hull, Snarky Woodworker / Builder</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@heyquilia?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kenny Eliason</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>MK and I watch increasing amounts of architecture and home design stuff and find our tastes getting further and further into the weeds as home improvement becomes a more practical hobby. Yet how-to videos are generally kind of boring, so we still like a fair bit of criticism or theory to accompany practical advice or demonstration. Enter Brent Hull, who came to our attention via this bit of absolute catnip.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvHCvwwc8xw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Why Brent hates McMansions. There are at least 3 things missing."></iframe></figure><p>McMansions are easy targets, but what striking here is the fact that this guy is a builder in greater Dallas area and he is absolutely shit-talking a peer who has built McMansions to this one particular template that he finds aesthetically, intellectually, and morally repulsive. You can tell this is the product of twenty or thirty years of stewing over a hack's ugly incompetence.</p><p>His channel isn't always this acerbic. In fact, for the most part, his channel is dedicated to really educational analysis of homebuilding techniques for things like windows and cabinetry and how those have evolved in the building trade over the years. Along the way, he's also justifying what is doubtless the extremely expensive service that he provides to clients, and explaining why his way is the right way despite the sticker shock that comes with it.</p><p>But as someone who will never be working with him or able to afford services like his, it's still neat to see someone who knows what they are talking about put words and illustrations to feelings a lot of us have. We all know there are certain tics that you find again and again in places built in the 2000s that make them feel poorly-made, but it's hard to put you finger on if you don't work in the trades. What reads as solid and durable versus cheap and temporary? What is good as opposed to what is merely expensive? This is a channel that sheds light on a lot of that stuff in ways that will help the kind of person who suddenly finds themselves with the need replace their windows, or to know what they can expect if they start getting into the bones of an older home.</p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-the-chair-company">Chia Recommends: <em>The Chair Company</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Photograph by Sarah Shatz/HBO</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tim Robinson’s comedy is polarizing, I feel like everyone I know either loves his work or hates it with very little in between. I personally really enjoyed <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>, so seeing his face pop up on HBO Max one night while my family was considering what to watch next was a pleasant surprise. My previous experience with his work could have never prepared me for what we were about to watch that fateful night.</p><p><em>The Chair Company </em>sees Tim Robinson’s particularly cringe-inducing comedy applied to a workplace drama, and it’s fully unlike anything I have watched before. I don’t particularly think I can get into too many other specifics of the show because it’s so delightfully <em>weird</em> that I think any attempted description of its plot points would do a disservice to the work.Just know that Tim Robinson plays the main character Ron, who becomes obsessed with a chair’s manufacturer after one of their chairs falls apart under him during a work presentation. I fully spent half of the show’s eight episode runtime unsure what, if anything, was <em>real</em> within the diegetic space of the show, and I loved every second of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photograph by Sarah Shatz/HBO</span></figcaption></figure><p>My partner did not particularly like <em>I Think You Should Leave</em>, and was only really convinced to come along on this journey because she had heard the buzz around the show. And while at first blush it might seem like the show is just an extended <em>ITYSL </em>skit, and that<em> </em>Tim is playing the same character that he always does in his shows, it becomes pretty quickly apparent that the context that character is being put in this time is very different. The friction there is where the real sauce of the show exists, and why I think that if you, like my partner, have initially dismissed <em>The Chair Company</em> because you didn’t like <em>ITYSL</em>, you should give it a shot. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

              <p><span>Plenty of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>fans and engineers have created working Pokédexes complete with image recognition to let you scan toys and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-art-characters-raichu-2000659297"><span>art to identify your favorite monsters</span></a><span>. BigRig Creates and Mr. Volt have taken this a step further, creating what they’re calling the “World’s Smartest” Pokédex, capable of not only recognizing Pokémon, but giving you data about them from the games, acting as a voice assistant, and much more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrVolt"><span>Mr. Volt</span></a><span> is planning to release a video about the hardware side of things at some point in the future, but BigRig Creates has already put out a 13-minute rundown of how he accomplished all the image recognition and data dumps, and recreated a voice that sounds similar to the original anime’s Pokédex.</span></p>

  <p><span>Much of the coding under the hood draws from the </span><a href="https://pokemondb.net/"><span>Pokémon Database</span></a><span>, which includes lengthy Pokédex entries for all 1025 monsters, complete with stats, learnable attacks, locations in each game, and more. So now, the World’s Smartest dex can tell you pretty much anything you need to know about a Pokémon just by scanning an image of it. The device uses a reverse Google image search to name whatever monster you’re pointing it at, and it can identify anything from plushies to fan art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The voice, however, needed some tweaking, so BigRig Creates used his own voice to create an AI text-to-speech voice model that sounded closer to the original but didn’t rip the lines from the show. He says this was in an effort to use the tech to make something “ethical” and “homegrown” rather than training it on the performances of actors Nick Stellate and Eric Stuart from the anime.</span></p>

 <p><span>Seeing the completed dex in action is pretty impressive. It correctly identifies several Pokémon, including a Ditto disguised as a Poipole, from toys, plushes, and some hastily drawn Remoraid fan art. It couldn’t quite wrap its head around a Spinda Labubu, though. No tech is perfect, I suppose.</span></p>

<p>The situation surrounding the recent closure of Ubisoft Halifax continues to get messier. Just one day after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing a legal complaint</a> with the Nova Scotia Labor Board, CWA Canada, the union representing 61 of the 71 employees let go by Ubisoft, revealed that they met with the company on Wednesday.</p>



<p>However, the meeting, they say, resulted in no progress.</p>







<h2 id="h-cwa-says-ubisoft-came-without-documents">CWA Says Ubisoft Came Without Documents</h2>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, CWA President Carmel Smyth said that the meeting on Wednesday morning was “disappointing”</p>



<p><strong>“Ubisoft came to the table with nothing,”</strong> she said. <strong>“No documentation proving financial distress, and no plan to find work at other Ubisoft operations or&nbsp;increase severance.”</strong></p>



<p>She added that they brought up the concern of those being out on parental leave being told that they wouldn’t qualify for the proposed two-month severance pay. But, instead of any progress towards a solution, Ubisoft reportedly told the union they will send their ideas on Friday.</p>







<p><strong>“It was frustrating,”</strong> Smyth said. <strong>“Their lack of preparation along with the fact that they gave no advance notice of the closure, makes us question their intentions and their commitment to treating people fairly.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We continue demanding real information, and to get the answers and the compensation you deserve after 10 years with this company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statements on the meeting, the union sent a release claiming that Ubisoft received nearly $1 billion (C$980 million) in government tax credit subsidies from 2020 through 2024.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment on where things stand and its view on the meeting. As of writing, multiple requests have gone unanswered. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

He's played the narrator for pretty much every Fallout video game since, with the "war never changes" line becoming seared into the memories of a legion of fans. It’s a line that even made it into Amazon’s Fallout TV show, although Perlman didn’t say it himself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/ron-perlman-1768415672528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ron Perlman at the premiere of Fallout Season 2 in Los Angeles, California.

He's not even necessarily saying he was actually paid $40. And it sounds like it was a throwaway encounter even in his mind back then, because he had forgot all about Fallout when he got the call to come in for Fallout 2 the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the '90s, I think,” Perlman said. “They gave me $40 and a sandwich. And a year and a half later, I get a call: 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' 'No.' ‘Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' 'Because the first one went through the f***ing roof.' I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, and then a year later the third, fourth, and now it's like a whole brand. I didn't see that coming."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Perlman is the narrator of Fallout, he’s never actually played a Fallout character before. At least, that's what he says. "I've never been in the game,” he insisted. “I just did a couple lines and, you know, got my $40 and my sandwich and went home." Did he forget he voiced Butch Harris, Far Go Traders caravan leader, in Fallout 1 as well as the intro?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tim Cain, one of the chief creators of the original Fallout, has spoken about Perlman’s role in the games before. Posting on <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/71191-i-have-some-questions-for-tim-cain/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Obsidian forums</a> back in 2015, Cain said he wrote the intro to Fallout, including the “war never changes” line, and described Perlman as “a great narrator,” adding: “He managed to sound decisive and sad at the same time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">$40 and a sandwich in hand, Perlman went on to play roles in a number of video games, including Lord Hood in Halo 2 and Halo 3. And the same year Fallout 1 came out, Alien Resurrection, in which he played mercenary Johner, hit theaters, helping Perlman reach new heights. Perhaps his most iconic film role, however, is the much-loved Hellboy, which came out in 2004.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Steve Granitz/FilmMagic.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The Switch 2 upgrade is live now as well.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Good morning, everyone! If you, like me, popped open Animal Crossing: New Horizons before work today for a stroll around your island, you were greeted with a pleasant surprise: the 3.0 update just dropped a day early, and the Hotel is officially open for business, along with a number of other new features.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094155-01keyjjhxjycpqjsqms7yw51wd-1768413480987.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The meat of Animal Crossing: New Horizon 3.0 is a hotel that will set up on your island at the end of your pier, wherever that's located for you. Just download the update (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/How_to_Update_Your_Game_Manually_(And_Access_3.0_Update_Early!)">make sure you actually download it</a> - there was a system update this morning as well for me and I almost missed it!) and it should be there waiting for you if you're a returning player who put some time into your island already. It seems likely there is at least one other requirement for the hotel to show up that prevents it from being there for new players, but we're still working out just what that is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hotel works a lot like the Happy Home DLC: you'll be asked to decorate different rooms in it based on themes you're given from Leilani. However, unlike the DLC, the catalog is the limit on what all you can put in these rooms. Though you're given a list of recommended items if you need help, apart from that, any item you've ever collected (via DIY, purchase, gift, or whatever) is available for use in the hotel, as many times as you want.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094158-01keyjk03cyqky0ghkjr25m58t-1768413494594.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Whenever you finish a room, it will become available for guests to stay in. This is a great way to meet other villagers you don't have living on your island at the moment, as they'll come stay and share cute and unique dialogue. You'll also be given Hotel Tickets, which you can spend at the souvenir shop for unique decor newly added to the game that you can use in your own house or elsewhere on the island.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094200-01keyjkq7z95ztxng8btr3mfwh-1768413506058.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, outside the hotel, Tom Nook will invite you to use a box outside the hotel where you'll be asked to craft certain DIY items to help promote your island elsewhere. Completing these requests will get you more Hotel Tickets to spend on more items. And, by the way, DIY crafting is easier than ever now that bulk crafting and crafting using ingredients from storage has been enabled with the new update.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094202-01keyjm2a1htprtb650pcpnwfr-1768413518148.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all this, there are several other new additions: There's tons of new furniture available both via the Souvenir Shop and the Nook Shopping app, including a bunch of LEGO items and classic game systems that you can use to activate games using Nintendo Switch Online from within Animal Crossing. Dream Worlds are now active, and let you build and decorate up to three Dream Islands either alone or with friends. And the new Zelda and Splatoon-themed amiibo villagers and themed items are available if you scan their amiibo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/20260114094216-01keyjmwxmkzmjc2etw8zwdp33-1768413534295.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those who have purchased the Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade (and are playing on the Switch 2, of course) also have access to their update! That means: improved graphics, mouse controls, 12-player multiplayer if you can manage to get that many people with Switch 2s, Megaphones that let you yell at your Switch and call your villagers over from across town, and it's only $5 (the rest of the 3.0 update is free for everyone).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got a comprehensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/ACNH_3.0_Update_and_Switch_2_Edition:_All_Details_and_Everything_New">guide to the 3.0 update</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/animal-crossing-new-horizons/Kappns_Family_Hotel_-_How_to_Unlock_and_Guide">how to unlock everything</a> and what's included, as a part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide.
