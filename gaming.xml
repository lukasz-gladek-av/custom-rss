			<p>For those who want a hit of nostalgia, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered has finally gotten an official release date. This eccentric rock and roll adventure will hit Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch as of 31 October 2024. Pre-orders for this classic game are available except for on Nintendo Switch. The team will announce the release dates for this pre-order soon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwpT42plQiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The trailer</a> for the remaster is up on their YouTube channel and available now.</p>
<p>Grasshopper Manufacture will host a Grasshopper Direct on their YouTube channel on July 31, where interested fans can learn more about the upcoming game. Within this Grasshopper Direct, fans can expect to see the producer of Shadow of the Damned, Shinji Mikami, Suda51, and a couple of other members of the team who will all be present to answer your burning questions about the upcoming release, as well as take you on a deep dive into the development of this brand-new remaster.</p>
<p>The remaster of Shadows of the Damned comes with plenty of new features, such as new costumes. This new game plus+ mode carries your weapons and appearances over to your next play through, where the difficulty is upped, but you still get to be just as powerful, if not more so, as before.</p>
<p>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered also comes with a new 60 FPS patch and 4K support, giving players the highest fidelity gameplay. Unfortunately for those on Nintendo Switch, you'll still be stuck at 30 FPS, with 4K support limited to Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam.</p>
<p>You play as Garcia Hotspur, a demon hunter for those unfamiliar with the game. This comedic game allows you to fight off demons and traverse through Hell, fighting off various horrifying creatures. Garcia Hotspur is on this grand adventure to save the love of his life from a genuinely awful demon king.</p>
<p>Garcia Hotspur is joined by his trusty sidekick, Johnson the Skull, who provides comedic commentary as you explore the depths of Hell. The darkness is a disadvantage to the player as the demons grow ever stronger in the dark. However, blast them with light and utilize your arsenal of weapons, and Garcia Hotspur can take down all the demons.</p>
<p>This game was created by Goichi Suda, also known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/hotel-barcelona-suda-51-swery-trailer/">Suda 51</a>. They are one of Japan's most prolific game developers and have helped develop franchises such as No More Heroes, Killer7, and Fatal Frame.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But SimsGuruNinja, an EA employee who works on the game, happened to be lurking in her chat, and his answer was as interesting as it was cryptic: "But don't worry. Elders will die better soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Predictably, the livestream's chat exploded with excitement, with Lilsimsie demanding answers.</p><p dir="ltr">"What do you know?!" she asked.</p><p dir="ltr">SimsGuruNinja replied, "Meant elder [Sims] will LOVE better soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the smiley face emojis included at the end of his message, the interaction seemed to indicate that SimsGuruNinja was simply keeping his cards close to the chest for the time being, because his reply to Lilsimsie's initial question about the exercise poster makes no sense in the context of love.</p><p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis have been known to hide Easter eggs with hints about future expansion packs within newly released DLCs. Even more damning is the fact that, throughout the Sims franchise, death-by-treadmill has been a relatively common demise for elderly Sims, who are at risk of dying of a heart attack if they do too much cardio with a low Fitness skill. They can even die from "WooHooing" too much. Including a poster of an elderly Sim doing cardio seems rather out-of-place in a DLC focused entirely on romance, which has led to speculation that the strange poster is a hint regarding the content of the game's next expansion pack.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims content creators, leakers, and even developers working on the game have also hinted at the existence of a death-based expansion pack, with one content creator--who also accurately predicted Lovestruck's existence--<a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1811855924430250426" rel="nofollow">cryptically tweeting</a>, "Honestly? I would DIE for another EP this year." Meanwhile, another "Sims guru" shared a cryptic tweet indicating that she's working on something big, and that it has nothing to do with the Lovestruck expansion pack, which releases July 25.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's even more evidence supporting the idea that a deadly new DLC may be on the way, and it's currently tucked away in the game's files. Based on information found via datamining, Sims fans have uncovered a tentative schedule that seems to suggest that another new expansion pack is indeed on the way, and there appear to only be two other DLCs (likely game packs, stuff packs, or kits) scheduled to come out between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sims-4-lovestruck-expansion-pack-adds-depth-to-sims-love-lives/1100-6524571/">Lovestruck</a> and the next expansion pack. According to <a href="https://simscommunity.info/2024/07/24/sims-4-expansion-pack-17-hints/" rel="nofollow">the game's files</a>, the order of release is as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 16</strong> (The Sims 4 Lovestruck expansion)</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 84</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 85</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 17</strong> (possible "Drop Dead" expansion)</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 86</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 87</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 88</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 DLC 89</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Expansion Pack 18</strong> (unknown expansion)</li></ul><p>Though EA has yet to confirm anything regarding the upcoming expansion--which players are currently calling "the Drop Dead expansion pack"--it would certainly make sense to release a death-themed DLC around Halloween. Additionally, given the amount of time EA and Maxis have recently spent revamping Sims' love lives, it's high time they give ghost-Sims some appreciation, too. Since players now can plan a Sim's wedding right down to the attire of guests and the type of wedding cake topper, letting players plan detailed funerals--and experience fun new ways to kill off their least-favorite Sims--seems only fair.</p><p dir="ltr">Death has always been a major part of the franchise, with Sims capable of dying in a number of comical ways, from being squashed by a rogue Murphy bed (or meteor) to the classic death-by-drowning (in a pool that has had its ladders mysteriously removed by some unseen force). Sims who have obtained a special, very rare flower can plead for the life of a fallen fellow Sim, potentially causing the Grim Reaper to change his mind and let them live. On the other hand, they can always choose to simply let their simulated family member die, then start up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/ymchph/the_grim_reaper_is_my_roomate_and_woohoo_partner/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a romance with the Grim Reaper</a> instead.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> recently found itself in some hot water due to changes it was going to make to its battle pass. The studio had intended to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-will-now-have-two-battle-passes-per-season-says-respawn/1100-6524756/">break up the premium battle pass into two when Season 22 launched</a>. This upset much of the game's fanbase and the outcry worsened as Respawn revealed that players would now have to pay real-world money to unlock both battle passes instead of the usual choice of real money or Apex Coins (Apex Legends premium currency). Apex Legends' battle passes have always awarded Apex Coins, allowing players to purchase new passes by completing previous ones--this change would have removed that perk, meaning individual players would be pouring more money into the game than before</p><p>Shortly after that was announced, a significant portion of the Apex Legends community began pushing back against this. On July 24, Apex Legends issued a statement on its <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859" rel="nofollow ">official X/Twitter account</a> claiming that the team will not proceed with its original battle pass plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The statement explains that in Season 22, Apex Legends will continue to allow players to get the premium battle pass for 950 Apex Coins. "We recognize that we could have handled the battle pass changes better--that's on us," the Apex Legends team writes in the statement. When the season launches on August 6, players will have the chance to get the season's first premium battle pass by completing in-game challenges. When the second split occurs on September 17, players can purchase the season's second premium battle pass using the game's premium currency or real money with plans to run with this format going forward after that.</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-announces-changes-to-apex-legends-battle-pass-after-community-outcry" rel="nofollow ">interview with IGN</a>, Steven Ferreira, the creative director of Apex Legends, revealed that the studio had made these changes because the team wanted to be able to "track data on how many players are engaging with the battle pass" and that this was something the team did on its own without EA pushing them one way or the other.</p><p>According to the statement, going forward, whenever the team plans to implement significant changes, it'll slowly roll them out and engage more with the community instead of just dropping them.</p>

But some fans on Xbox, perhaps not as familiar with video games, are frustrated after buying the new college football simulator and discovering that it doesn’t play on their console.

Since then players have used mods to try and keep the aging Xbox 360/PS3-era football game up-to-date with the real world. Thankfully, fans got a new game this month. However, due to a confusing situation, some people are buying the game, only to discover they’re not actually able to play <em>EA College Football 2</em>5. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D3PB2DBS/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&amp;asc_source=&amp;filterByStar=one_star&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;reviewerType=all_reviews&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20#reviews-filter-bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D3PB2DBS" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">If you look at Amazon</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0D3PB2DBS/ref=acr_dp_hist_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/xbox-one-series-x-s-college-football-25-madden-nfl-ea-1851604118&amp;asc_source=&amp;filterByStar=one_star&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;reviewerType=all_reviews&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20#reviews-filter-bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D3PB2DBS" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Walmart</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesS/comments/1e48auw/college_football_25_not_compatible_issue_on_my/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesS/comments/1e48auw/college_football_25_not_compatible_issue_on_my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/Will-EA-Sports-College-Football-25-be-available-on-PS4-or-Xbox/td-p/13729616/page/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/Will-EA-Sports-College-Football-25-be-available-on-PS4-or-Xbox/td-p/13729616/page/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s official forums</a></span>, you’ll find that some<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/i-purchased-ea-sports-college-football-25-deluxe/45b656fd-6679-48e8-b2c9-f0c40e2623b4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/i-purchased-ea-sports-college-football-25-deluxe/45b656fd-6679-48e8-b2c9-f0c40e2623b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Xbox One owners purchased <em>College Football 25</em></a></span> and can’t play it. That’s because the new football sim is only available on current-gen platforms, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. On PlayStation, this is fairly simple. PS5 games can’t work on PS4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-shakes-things-up-adds-big-white-rectangle-to-ps5-1844325384&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-shakes-things-up-adds-big-white-rectangle-to-ps5-1844325384">They look different, too</a></span>. But on Xbox, it’s a mess. Microsoft currently sells or has sold an Xbox Series X, an Xbox Series S, an Xbox One X, an Xbox One S, and even at one point a basic Xbox One. So it’s not surprising to see so many Xbox players leaving negative reviews online after buying the game and realizing they can’t play it.</p><p>“I have an Xbox One X. I did research and saw the X/S and Ones can use Series X games and it doesn’t even allow me to play. It says it is not compatible and you can’t even return the item because once you open the packaging it’s no good and considered used. Waited so long for this game and used to play the old ones just to find out I spent $75 on a game I can’t play,” said one user on Amazon.<br></p><p>“I don’t play video games but my son wanted the game so I bought it for them. Now it doesn’t work and I spent $65 on it,” said someone on Reddit. </p><p>“I need to return this I don’t have the right Xbox for this,” posted a person on Walmart’s website. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.target.com/p/ea-sports-college-football-25-xbox-series-x/-/A-91991657?showOnlyQuestions=true&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.target.com/p/ea-sports-college-football-25-xbox-series-x/-/A-91991657?showOnlyQuestions=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over on Target’s store page for the game</a></span>, you can find tons of questions about which Xbox console it will work on, which one has a disc drive, which one doesn’t, if the digital version works on last-gen machines, and so on. </p><h2 id="h11351"><a id=""></a>This is a really confusing situation</h2><p>Now, you are someone who reads <em>Kotaku</em>. You likely understand that while almost all Xbox One games are playable on Series X, <em>no</em> Series X games are natively playable on the older consoles. But it’s a pretty confusing mess for people who might only play a few games a year, which could be a large chunk of <em>EA College Football</em>’s fanbase.<br></p><p>However, things get even more confusing when you look at how some Xbox games come in plastic cases that list both Xbox Series X/S <em>and</em> Xbox One. In fact, what with the ever-increasing blurring of console generations, a lot of games are playable on both and sold as such. And then you have the other wrinkle that,  technically you can play <em>some </em>Xbox Series X/S games on an Xbox One via cloud streaming. </p><figure id="" data-id="7beb5cc90f08b439678c99cd8863297c" data-recommend-id="image://7beb5cc90f08b439678c99cd8863297c" data-format="png" data-width="1659" data-height="613" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Xbox store page for the College Football / Madden bundle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Oh and let’s add even more confusion to the mix. <em>Madden 25,</em> which is out in August, is launching on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. And EA’s <em>Madden </em>series has been playable on Xbox One since 2013's entry, which was confusingly named <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25_(2013_video_game)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25_(2013_video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Madden 25</em></a></span>, which is also the name of the <em>new </em>one coming out later this year. Sigh. Anyway,  I imagine a ton of people playing <em>Madden </em>every year on Xbox One are the same people excited to play <em>EA College Football 25</em> this year.<br></p><p>In fact, those people might have bought the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ea-sports-mvp-bundle-madden-nfl-25-deluxe-edition-college-football-25-deluxe-edition/9MZB0BJFVCTS/0010/B3TWNK19RKL6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ea-sports-mvp-bundle-madden-nfl-25-deluxe-edition-college-football-25-deluxe-edition/9MZB0BJFVCTS/0010/B3TWNK19RKL6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently available bundle</a></span> that comes with both <em>Madden NFL 25</em> and <em>EA College Football 25</em>. Here’s the weird catch: <em>Madden NFL 25</em> is still coming out on Xbox One this year. So that bundle contains a game playable on both generations of console and a game playable on only one. Phew. It’s enough to make even my head start to spin.<br></p><p>Should these buyers have done more research? Maybe. Does Xbox’s store state directly that you can’t play<em> EA College Football 25</em> on Xbox One? Yes—in somewhat small print, but yes. The warning is there. But this whole situation is so confusing and silly that I don’t blame folks for thinking EA’s latest sports game would, like <em>Maddens </em>before and upcoming, play on Xbox One. And I don’t blame them for getting frustrated to find out that’s not the case. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More than 500 developers at Blizzard Entertainment who work on <em>World of Warcraft </em>have voted to form a union. The <em>World of Warcraft</em> GameMakers Guild, formed with the assistance of the Communication Workers of America (CWA), is composed of employees across every department, including designers, engineers, artists, producers, and more. Together, they have formed the largest wall-to-wall union — or a union inclusive of multiple departments and disciplines — at Microsoft.&nbsp;</p><p>This news comes less than a week after the formation of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202271/bethesda-game-studios-workers-unionize-cwa">Bethesda Game Studios union</a>, which, at the time of the announcement, was itself the largest wall-to-wall Microsoft union. These unions represent a major shift in video game union organization strategy, and <em>The Verge</em> spoke to two members of Blizzard’s organization committee about how this union came to be and the challenges of organizing such a large and comprehensive group.</p><p>Kathryn Friesen, a quest designer on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> team, spoke about how the impetus for the union came out of the desire to uphold one of Blizzard’s company values: “every voice matters.”</p><p>“You can tell just by talking to people how much they care about one another and the work that they do in the game,” Friesen said. “I think that that’s where [the unionization effort] comes from, the desire to stand together to fight for collective bargaining rights at the table.”</p><p>Paul Cox, senior quest designer and Blizzard veteran, agreed, saying that the company’s response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay">the state of California’s discrimination lawsuit</a> spurred employee action. “A lot of the early responses felt very corporate and didn’t feel like they reflected the values that, as a company, we said we upheld,” Cox said.&nbsp;</p><div><p>As a result, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit">employees at Blizzard took action with walkouts</a>, which became the beginning of unionization efforts at the company.</p></div><p>The <em>World of Warcraft</em> GameMakers Guild is made up of over 500 members across Blizzard offices in California and Massachusetts. Despite its size — it is the second largest union at Microsoft overall behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">Activision’s 600-member QA union</a> — Cox said that <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft’s labor neutrality agreement</a> helped get the organization ball rolling.</p><p>“We were able to come out into the open about it, and everybody was able to see that no retaliation was occurring,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>With organization efforts out in the open, including CWA tents on Blizzard campuses, Friesen said that getting people across all the different departments was made simpler, too.</p><p>“Across departments, we had a lot of support,” she said. “I think we are actually well above 50 percent [union support] in each specific department.”&nbsp;</p><p>Interdisciplinary unions like Blizzard’s are relatively rare, especially in the video game industry, as each department has different needs and goals. Up until this point, the majority of unionization efforts in the video game industry have been spearheaded by QA workers who have traditionally been among the least paid and least protected employees.</p><p>The first union at Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22901563/raven-software-union-game-workers-alliance-activision-blizzard">was made up of QA workers</a>, as was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23495139/microsoft-union-zenimax-bethesda-cwa">the first union at Microsoft’s game studios</a>. In addition to the <em>World of Warcraft</em> GameMakers Guild, yet another new union made up of QA workers at Blizzard’s Austin, Texas, office has also formed. The Blizzard Quality Assurance United-CWA is a 60-person unit including QA testers for games like <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Hearthstone</em>, and other Blizzard games.</p><p>“It is really, really great that we are a wall-to-wall union. We’re all in it together, and it’s a signal that QA is dev as well. I am especially excited for that signal to go out to the rest of the industry,” Friesen said. “[QA employees] work with us every single day. Their desks are next to our desks. So, I hope that we can win better workplace protections for everyone on the team.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s actually a Scorched, which isn’t anything special, but lately you might’ve seen them dressed in holiday attire. The bright red and white frock of a Scorched Wanderer stands out in the bleak post-apocalypse, and if you manage to beat your fellow survivors to the punch, you can actually farm Holiday Scorched in <em>Fallout 76</em> for fantastic rewards. Why would you want to? Well, read on.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196903" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="189" data-playlist="196903,196049,196834" data-current="196903"><div><p>Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22460.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As part of the Holiday Scorched Event in <em>Fallout 76</em>, numerous points of interest around Appalachia now host Festive Scorched that you may wish to farm. If you do, you’ll receive a prize in the form of small Holiday Gifts, regular Holiday Gifts, and large Holiday Gifts. The bigger the gift box, the better the rewards within. Oh, and you can craft gifts, too. But more on that in a bit!</p><p>Here is where to farm Holiday Scorched until August 6, 2024, when the event ends!<br></p><h2 id="h87"><a id="where"></a>Where to farm Holiday Scorched</h2><p>First and foremost, to identify Holiday Scorched, look for bright colors, especially red and white jackets and dresses. When you’re near one of the festive enemies, they’ll jingle with holiday music. Honestly, they’re tough to miss.</p><p>But most importantly, you must farm the right locations, such as:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Morgantown Airport (Exterior)</li><li>Tyler County Fairgrounds</li><li>Bolton Greens</li><li>Helvetia</li><li>Wavy Willard’s Water Park</li><li>Camden Park</li></ul><p>You’re likely to stumble upon Festive Scorched in any point of interest where normal Scorched usually spawn, but these six locations tend to have the most luck.</p><figure id="" data-id="68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-recommend-id="image://68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player looks down at a dead Scorched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player looks down at a dead Scorched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-recommend-id="image://68718b4949f526b67ce0f3f99fe75211" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player looks down at a dead Scorched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, they’re also the most highly frequented by the community. You may wind up traveling to Morgantown Airport, as I did this morning, only to find the entire camp clear of all enemies. Then, the same thing happened at Bolton Greens. People want to participate in this event, seemingly more so than usual, so expect company.</p><p>Alternatively, if you subscribe to Fallout 1st, you can enter a Private World. It’s the best way to farm Holiday Scorched without competing with an entire server of interested players.</p><h2 id="h88"><a id="craft"></a> How to craft Holiday Gifts yourself</h2><figure id="" data-id="064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-recommend-id="image://064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows special wrapping paper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows special wrapping paper." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-recommend-id="image://064ddbad285875ca8b9a8801adef385f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows special wrapping paper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned earlier, instead of farming Holiday Scorched, you can craft Holiday Gifts yourself. First, you must purchase Gift Wrap from train station vendors or Grahm.

<p>New gameplay for Star Wars Outlaws has leaked online ahead of its August.</p>



<p>The leak comes from known<a href="https://x.com/404LEAKbackup/status/1816188519016194493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> leaker Visceral</a> and 404 leaks online, and shows over 13 minutes of gameplay and cutscenes.</p>



<p>The footage shows what appears to be the beginning of the game. Right at the start it cuts to Kay Vess recovering from a crash and discovering her bike to travel across the planet. If you are worried about major spoilers, it doesn’t appear to have anything too big from the game’s story.</p>



<p>If you want to watch it, you can below before it likely is removed.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>During a recent earnings call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the company has put <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-marketing-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more into the marketing of the game</a> than any other Ubisoft title ever.</p>



<p>The footage appears to originate from press and content creator access, where previews of the game will be coming by the end of the month.</p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws launches August 30 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Those who buy the game’s season pass get access to an exclusive Jabba The Hut mission at launch that Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-responds-to-star-wars-outlaws-backlash-over-jabba-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says isn’t key to the game’s story</a>.</p>

            <p>
Apex Legends developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> has said it will once again allow players to purchase the free-to-play shooter's battle passes with in-game premium currency after it announced it would only be selling them for real money starting in Season 22.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Respawn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-is-evolving-its-battle-pass-by-splitting-it-in-two-and-charging-players-twice">unveiled a number of controversial changes</a> to Apex Legends' existing battle pass system, in a move it insisted would provide more "value" to players. One of these changes will see the current season-long Battle Pass essentially split in two, with Respawn charging players full price for each half-season premium pass across the same amount of time.
</p>
<p>
However, the change that attracted perhaps the most fan ire was Respawn's decision to begin charging real money for its battle passes, and no longer enable players to purchase them with premium currency. That's significant as Apex Legends' premium battle passes have traditionally rewarded enough premium currency to purchase the next season's pass.

<p>
Now, though, the studio has formally reversed that decision in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859">statement shared on social media</a>. "You've spoken, and we've listened," it wrote. "With the release of Season 22 we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins. We recognise that we could have handle the Battle Pass Changes better - that's on us."
</p>
<p>
Respawn also confirms each battle pass will still include enough Apex Coins across its various unlockable tiers to purchase the next one.
</p>
<p>
"Moving forward, we recognise that we need to be more timely, transparent, and consistent in our communications with you," the studio continued. "Your priorities are our priorities: cheaters, game stability, and quality of life updates are top of mind. We need to get better and it's why we're acknowledging them here... Thank you again for all of your passion and time in Apex Legends because we couldn't do this without you."
</p>
<p>
Apex Legends' 21st season, Upheaval, started in May and is due to conclude in August. Respawn has confirmed that once Season 22 begins, players can unlock the first of its two battle passes for free by completing a series of "simple" in-game challenges.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crowdstrike-apologises-with-a-10-gift-card/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On July 19th, a worldwide incident known as the ‘blue screen of death’ affected&nbsp;millions of Microsoft computers, rendering them non-functional for several hours. Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later revealed</a> that a software update from an independent cybersecurity company, CrowdStrike, caused this incident. Recent developments have shown that CrowdStrike is offering the affected users a $10 gift card as an apology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/24/crowdstrike-offers-a-10-apology-gift-card-to-say-sorry-for-outage/?utm_source=whatsapp&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechCrunch</a>, CrowdStrike’s Chief Business Officer, Daniel Bernard, emailed the affected users to acknowledge the blue-screen incident between July 18 and 19. A screenshot of this email has now surfaced on X (formerly Twitter). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To express their “heartfelt thanks and apologies for the inconvenience”, CrowdStrike wants to pay for the “next cup of coffee or late night snack” for the impacted users with a $10 Uber Eats Gift card, the email states. The affected users in the United Kingdom received a £ 7.75 gift card, which revealed another user.</p>



<p>Some users could successfully redeem the gift card from CrowdStrike, whereas some weren’t as lucky. Those who couldn’t were met with an error message on Uber Eats stating that the gift card “has been cancelled by the issuing party and is no longer valid.”</p>



<p>Additionally, to prevent such incidents in the future, CrowdStrike informed the users that their cloud services have been improved to “dramatically speed up their ability to make rapid communication to the sensor.” The company has published a <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Preliminary Incident Report</a> today, detailing the incident and the steps taken to prevent its recurrence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the movie finally releasing nine years after it was first announced, Randy Pitchford said in a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-cinematic-universe-first-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past interview</a> that the first film is the “start” of a Borderlands cinematic universe.</p>



<p>“The Borderlands movie is the first of the Borderlands Cinematic Universe and you’ll see some characters from some of the different parts of what you might know from the video games,” he said.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-borderlands-the-movie">About Borderlands The Movie:</h2>



<p><em>Lilith , an infamous bounty hunter with a mysterious past, reluctantly returns to her home, Pandora, the most chaotic planet in the galaxy. Her mission is to find the missing daughter of Atlas, the universe’s most powerful S.O.B. Lilith forms an unexpected alliance with a ragtag team of misfits – Roland , a seasoned mercenary on a mission; Tiny Tina , a feral pre-teen demolitionist; Krieg, Tina’s musclebound protector; Tannis, the oddball scientist who’s seen it all; and Claptrap a wiseass robot. </em></p>



<p>T<em>ogether, these unlikely heroes must battle an alien species and dangerous bandits to uncover one of Pandora’s most explosive secrets. The fate of the universe could be in their hands – but they’ll be fighting for something more: each other.

The team wanted to keep fan expectations in check, however, and made it clear that this wasn’t a release date. </p><p>Cut to earlier today (July 24) when a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/K1ngCraft/status/1816108726861922315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/K1ngCraft/status/1816108726861922315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cryptic message</a></span> from <em>Fallout: London</em>’s project manager, Dean Carter, hinted that the release date may come sooner than expected. The message tagged everyone in the Discord channel and linked to an original song from the game’s soundtrack titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GklJpkyQARQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GklJpkyQARQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I Just Can’t Wait (For Tomorrow)</a></span>” along with the comment, “Stay safe and remember. Mind the gap.” Yet again, this wasn’t an official announcement but fans quickly jumped to the conclusion that the mod would be dropping in the next day. Carter finally confirmed to <em>Inverse </em>that, yes, <em>Fallout: London</em> will be releasing tomorrow, “unless nuclear war happens.”</p><p>With<em> Fallout: London</em> finally set to release, this will bring an end to a five-year project. The mod really is effectively its own game; its new titular setting has been built from scratch by the devs at FOLON, and it has unique quests, voice-acted characters (including the talent of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-claims-john-bercow-voice-acting&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-claims-john-bercow-voice-acting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former British Speaker of the House</a></span>,) original music, and more. Just this year the fate of the mod was put into question when Bethesda suddenly dropped a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-release-date-1851403773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-release-date-1851403773">next-gen update</a></span> to <em>Fallout 4</em> to coincide with the Amazon series. Team FOLON announced that the update would likely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-london-mod-1851410501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-london-mod-1851410501">completely break</a></span> <em>Fallout: London</em>, and so the team had to indefinitely delay the project, which was originally supposed to release on April 23. While we now have a<em> Fallout: London</em> release date, players will still need to revert their copy of <em>Fallout 4</em> to a version prior to the next-gen update.

<p>Less than a month after announcing controversial changes to the game’s Battle Pass, Apex Legends has announced that players will continue to be able to buy the Premium pass using in-game Apex Coins.</p>



<p>“You’ve spoken, and we’ve listened,” the <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1816156552396734859">announcement reads</a>. “With the release of Season 22 we will restore the ability to get the Premium Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins. We recognize that we could have handled the Battle Pass changes better — that’s on us.”</p>



<p>Back on July 8, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was announced</a> that Apex Legends would no longer allow players to use in-game currency to upgrade their Battle Pass. Instead, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players would have to spend</a> real money for the added in-game benefits. Rather than 950 Apex Coins every season, it was going to cost $9.99 every half season. On top of that, those who wanted the Premium Bundle were no longer able to spend 2,800 Apex Coins every season. Instead, that was going to cost $19.99 every half season.</p>



<p>There is still the $9.99 Battle Pass option, now called Ultimate. With this tier, you get everything in the Premium Battle Pass as well as 8 Apex Packs and 1200 extra crafting metals.  A new Ultimate+ tier, which replaces the previously announced Premium+ tier, will remain $19.99 and comes with 2 legendary skin variants, 8 Apex Packs, 1200 extra crafting medals, all playable legends, and more.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>When the new season starts on August 6, players will be able to get the Premium Battle Pass for Split 1 by “completing a series of simple in-game challenges”. Starting with Split 2 on September 17, you can then buy the pass for the aforementioned 950 Apex Coins.</p>



<p>“Moving forward, we recognize that we need to be more timely, transparent, and consistent in our communications with you,” Respawn said. “Your priorities are our priorities: cheaters, game stability, and the quality of life updates are top of mind. We need to get better and it’s why we’re acknowledging them here.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/robinson-crusoe-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Simulating the perils of being stranded on a desert island, the Robinson Crusoe board game series is a daunting epic. Like the many dangers that roam the island, the base game and its various expansions aren’t for the faint of heart. A dense ruleset and a wealth of mechanics await those looking to pick up Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island, as well as its various expansions. Those who stick with it, however, will be treated to one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games"><u>best cooperative board games</u></a> money can buy.</p><p>Adventures on the Cursed Island is a thematic experience with intricate mechanics, and the subsequent expansions add even more depth. The Robinson Crusoe series doesn’t feature quite as many add-ons as some other popular games in the medium, but each package contains quite a bit of replayability in its own right. Completing the various scenarios within the base game is its own challenge, and it’s one players will find quite difficult.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><p id="robinson-crusoe-2nd-edition"><h3 data-toc-title="Robinson Crusoe 2nd Edition">Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island 2nd Edition</h3></p><div catalogid="d2ba3e2a-899b-4f2d-a7fa-c5cc0303e2f3" id="157792"><div id="157792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $70.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1-4</li><li>Play Time: 60-120 mins</li></ul><p>The only place to start with the Robinson Crusoe series is with the base game, as all future expansions require it. That said, rather than begin with the initial release, it is recommended to grab the second edition, which is the version currently in print. The first edition is fine if you find it at a good price from a secondhand seller, but the newer iteration features a much-improved rulebook along with updated artwork and components.</p><p>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is an intricate cooperative worker-placement game in which players must survive a wide range of scenarios on a deserted island. In each round, players can choose what actions they wish to take to ensure survival, from exploring new areas to crafting tools or even hunting wild animals for food and resources. Players must also mind the group’s morale levels and any random perils they might encounter, such as weather, attacks, and other threats to general health. </p><p>Of course, mitigating threats and surviving are key, but so are taking actions to accomplish end-game goals. What makes Robinson Crusoe so difficult yet addicting is that it asks players to live in the moment and still plan for the future while also being aware that the next card could completely alter their strategy. Challenging games like this might put some perspective players off, but it only aids in Robinson Crusoe’s excellent theme of survival.</p><p>The first scenario is just beginning, too. Players can experience several stories within the initial box that involve volcanoes, cannibals, and even King Kong. Before moving on to other expansions, chances are you will be playing Robinson Crusoe for hours and hours between all of the built-in variability. Not to mention, actually beating one of the included scenarios will likely take most players multiple playthroughs.</p><h2>Robinson Crusoe Expansions</h2></div><p id="mystery-tales-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Mystery Tales Expansion">Robinson Crusoe: Mystery Tales Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="4709d73d-ed67-42e6-aedb-174419eccb61" id="205181"><div id="205181" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe: Mystery Tales</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $50.00 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lost City of Z Campaign</li><li>2 Standalone Scenarios</li><li>9 New Characters</li><li>10 Double-Sided Terrain Tiles</li><li>New Santity Mechanic</li><li>New Event Cards, Adventure Cards, Beast Cards, and Mystery Cards</li></ul><p>While the base game falls firmly in the action-adventure genre, Robinson Crusoe: Mystery Tales adds a bit of spookiness to the survival title. Mystery Tales doesn’t simply dip its toes in the uncharted waters of the horror genre; it dives in head first. Outside of the new campaign and additional scenarios, one of the biggest additions to Mystery Tales is the new sanity mechanic, a staple in other scarier games. That’s not to ignore the sizable campaign and scenarios, which are drenched in horror, from its storytelling to the addition of new beast cards featuring werewolves and other terrifying creatures.</p><p>Like the horror genre itself, Mystery Tales is a bit divisive among the fandom. It’s not just the foray into the spookier side of medium, but it’s also the added mechanics that insert even more rules into an already difficult game. Still, if a deserted island with horror monsters sounds like something you’d be interested in, Mystery Tales is an easy recommendation. Not to mention, the additional content also works with the base game, so you can add even more dynamic encounters to scenarios from the original box.</p></div><p id="treasure-chest-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Treasure Chest Expansion">Robinson Crusoe: Treasure Chest</h3></p><div catalogid="cfa1eb50-809a-4b17-9c67-d10993305330" id="205182"><div id="205182" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe: Treasure Chest</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $29.99 USD</p><p><strong>Components</strong> (REQUIRES THE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>5 New Scenarios</li><li>2 New Characters</li><li>More Than a Half-Dozen Mini Expansions</li><li>Custom Wooden Food Markers</li><li>New Event Cards, Adventure Cards, Beast Cards, and Mystery Cards</li></ul><p>While the fanbase is somewhat split on Mystery Tales, players across the board agree that Treasure Chest adds more Robinson Crusoe goodness. Essentially, the Treasure Box is a hodgepodge of previously released content through Kickstarter and various other platforms. Still, for fans who weren’t keeping up with the slow trickle of content over the years, the Treasure Box is a great way to catch up in one neat package.</p><p>While there isn’t one killer app in the box, so to speak, there are plenty of great additions that add even more replayability to the base game. The new sailor and gamer characters, five new scenarios, new beasts, and over 90 new cards offer plenty of variability to the previous releases.</p></div><p id="book-of-adventures-expansion"><h3 data-toc-title="Book of Adventures Expansion">Robinson Crusoe: Book of Adventures</h3></p><div catalogid="219b77bc-6334-4cc3-ba83-fea1065adffc" id="205184"><div id="205184" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe: Book of Adventures</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $29.99</p><p>The Robinson Crusoe: Book of Adventures expansion is exactly what it sounds like; it’s a book packed with 50 different scenarios with various difficulties for players to enjoy. Like other expansions, the Book of Adventures requires the base game to be playable.</p></div><p id="robinson-crusoe-collectors-editio"><h3 data-toc-title="Robinson Crusoe – Collector’s Editio">Robinson Crusoe – Collector’s Edition</h3></p><div catalogid="8b351cce-ede2-4bcc-a8ab-a6ba89a40344" id="205183"><div id="205183" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Robinson Crusoe – Collector’s Edition</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $79.99</p><p>The Robinson Crusoe – Collector’s Edition makes a compelling case for first-time buyers with its various stunning miniatures and its tutorial book reminiscent of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</a>. One of the knocks against the Robinson Crusoe series is that it features a ton of rules, but the tutorial book walks players through how to play the game step-by-step in what is arguably the best onboarding process for the series yet.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island is a deep and complex survival adventure game for solo gamers or groups looking to get cooperative. Mystery Tales brings the franchise into the horror genre, and the Treasure Box adds even more replayability through various scenarios and mini-expansions. That said, the base game should keep players busy for quite a while on its own. </p><p>Luckily, many of the games and expansions listed above can often be found well under MSRP.

<p>Like the first game, <em>Borderlands</em> centers on a group of gun-toting Vault hunters searching for treasure on the planet Pandora.&nbsp;They also get roped up to save a mysterious girl who holds the key to a great power. If you’re still not sure what to make of the film after watching its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/02/21/the-borderlands-movies-first-trailer-looks-as-ridiculous-as-the-games">first trailer</a>, hopefully, this last preview will help you decide whether or not you’ll be making the trip to theaters in a couple of weeks to see it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Sure, TV seems to be doing a decent job of making video game adaptations that don't utterly suck these days, but the movie world's still waiting for its The Last of Us moment. Will it come in the form Gearbox's soon-to-be-released Borderlands film? Probably not, but if it's brightly coloured chaos you're after, you can expect plenty of that judging by its newly released "final" trailer - which has been shared ahead of the movie's August launch.
</p>
<p>
The Borderlands movie has, of course, been a long time coming; it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-in-the-works">initially announced back in 2015</a>, with Saw and Insidious co-creator Leigh Whannell at one point rumoured to be attached. Then, just as it looked like the project had been consigned to the celluloid graveyard, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hostel-director-eli-roth-is-helming-the-borderlands-movie">unexpectedly resurfaced in February 2020</a>, this time with Hostel director Eli Roth at the helm.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've seen a succession of eyebrow raising casting announcements - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cate-blanchett-cast-in-eli-roths-borderlands-movie-adaptation">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-signs-up-jamie-lee-curtis">Jamie Lee Curtis</a>, Gina Gershiwn, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">Jack Black</a> all signing on to star - alongside a bit of behind-the-scenes shuffling, as new scriptwriters came onboard and Eli Roth briefly stepped aside during reshoots.
</p>
<p>
And now, following a first Borderlands trailer in February, distributor Lionsgate has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icnysn53neU">shared a "final" trailer</a> ahead the movie's launch. If you saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU_NKNZljoQ">first one</a>, this latest will be distinctly familiar - the car-in-exploding-monster and pee-in-mouth sequences both return - but there's a little bit of new stuff too.
</p>

<p>
The Borderlands movie - which Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has, perhaps prematurely, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-start-of-cinematic-universe-randy-pitchford-says">called</a> the start of a "Borderlands Cinematic Universe" - sees Blanchett's infamous outlaw Lillith returning to the planet Pandora in search of a missing girl. Along the way she teams up with former mercenary Roland (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kevin-hart-to-play-roland-in-borderlands-movie">Kevin Hart</a>), pre-teen demolitionist Tiny Tina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/young-gamora-actress-to-play-tiny-tina-in-borderlands-movie">Ariana Greenblatt</a>), her protector Krieg (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/florian-munteanu-viktor-drago-in-creed-2-is-krieg-in-the-borderlands-movie">Florian Munteanu</a>), Padorian archeologist Tannis (Jamie Lee Curtis), and robot Claptrap (Jack Black), uncovering an "unimaginable power".
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like it might be an entertaining way to spend 100 minutes, the Borderlands movie hits cinemas on 9th August this year.
</p>
