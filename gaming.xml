But amongst all the Bells and whistles announced, you might have missed the news that retro Nintendo games are also returning to the series. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Yes, you will once again be able to play 8-bit and higher-bit classics in Animal Crossing, just like you could in the original game back on GameCube! However, there are some caveats.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5kyruhx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">According to the announcement</a>, there'll be a new resort hotel added on the pier in the 3.0 update where you can help out and, by increasing its "island brand recognition", a souvenir shop will start stocking new items. On one of the tabs labelled 'Special', you'll find a host of retro Nintendo hardware, including the Ultra Hand, the Love Tester, and a bunch of lovely Nintendo consoles. <em>Yaaaaas.</em></p>
<p>Buying these with the new currency lets you set them up in your room as you'd expect. However, if you've got an active NSO subscription, you can play "a select classic game on each system." <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/clu_clu_land">Clu Clu Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/dr_mario">Dr. Mario</a> (for the Game Boy) are shown in the clip.</p>

<p>The consoles shown include a Switch 2, Famicom, NES, Famicom Disk System, Game Boy, and Super Famicom, so it looks like we're going up to at least 16-bit this time!</p>
<p>For those who weren't there, the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> game had a selection of NES games, including games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/donkey_kong">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/excitebike">Excitebike</a>, that you could obtain and actually play <em>in</em> the game long, long before Virtual Console turned up and having retro titles on your current Nintendo system was a matter of course.</p>
<p>So, the retro games are back in AC! But only one per system, and probably not the classics you were hoping for.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no reason to be glum because all the games are playable in a more straightforward way via NSO itself. Still, we kind of hope Nintendo might decide to let you play <em>all</em> the games in the NSO library through this Animal Crossing wrapper. Pointless? Sure. But delightful? Absolutely.</p>
<figure data-uuid="67abf0000c4e3"><a title="Animal Crossing New Horizons Retro Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67abf0000c4e3/animal-crossing-new-horizons-retro-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>That arcade cab looks pretty great, too, although we doubt 'Space Blaster' will be playable. C'mon, Nintendo, put <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/radar_scope">Radar Scope</a> on it! — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elsewhere, a bunch of cool collabs with other Nintendo games will see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-collabs-with-lego-splatoon-and-zelda"><strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Splatoon</strong> items crop up in New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p><em>Do you think they'll get N64, the upcoming Virtual Boy, or GameCube in there too? Is there a scenario (stick with me here) where we could be playing the original GC Animal Crossing NES games in the original GC Animal Crossing in <strong>this</strong> Animal Crossing?</em></p>
<p><em>Woah. Let us know which game you think they'll make accessible for the other systems below.</em></p>

</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has just revealed that it's getting an absolutely huge update on <strong>15th January 2026</strong> alongside a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>. It's stuffed full of new features, characters, and an entire hotel. But maybe the biggest update comes in the form of some brand new collaborations.</p>
<p>First up, after several successful sets of Animal Crossing Lego Sets, Lego is <em>actually</em> coming to the game itself. You'll be able to buy a whole suite of Lego-themed furniture and clothes via Nook Shopping, meaning you'll be able to live your brick life fantasy on your island.</p>
<p>You better save those Bells up, then. We're already eyeing up that arcade game as our first purchase. No, we don't <em>need</em> a sofa, this is way more important...</p>
<p>Next, we have a Legend of Zelda collab which will net you some gorgeous themed furniture and clothes if you have compatible Zelda amiibo.</p>

<p>There's lots of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>-themed stuff like a Guardian (it's inactive, don't worry) and a Zonai Device, but you can spy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a>, the Master Sword, Tri (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>) and wallpaper and flooring themed after the forest where the Master Sword resides.</p>
<p>Similarly, Splatoon amiibo will also unlock some extremely colourful furniture (note: Big Man Sofa) and clothing. It looks like these are buyable via Nook Shopping once you've scanned the amiibo in.</p>
<p>And, two more amiibo bonuses. Scanning in Zelda amiibo will unlock Mineru and Tulin as villagers, while Splatoon amiibo will allow you to get Cece and Viché. And they look <em>adorable.</em></p>

<p>Goodness. That's a <em>lot</em>, and it's not even the bulk of 3.0! There's a whole range of stuff being added to the game next January, with playable retro games consoles making their grand return (kind of!) alongside tons of quality of life updates.</p>
<p>And, don't forget, update 3.0 is <em>free</em>.</p>

<p><em>Are you looking forward to these collaborations in Animal Crossing: New Horizons? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

<p>In a new trailer, Nintendo reveals that the game, which passed its fifth anniversary back in March, will be getting enhanced visuals, Joy-Con 2 mouse control support, and "expanded online play" on January 15th. The pack will cost you $4.99 or your regional equivalent if you already own the game.</p>

<p>It's not just the Switch 2 Edition upgrade, though; a free update is also on the way for both platforms, and it brings a brand new resort hotel that you can help Kapp'n and his family to manage.</p>

<p>Those outfits may then be worn by villagers around your town, as well as people who come to visit your island via&nbsp;<em>New Horizons</em>' online play mode. Make sure you dress up those lobby mannequins nicely!</p>

<p>Everyone's favorite mole Mr. Resetti is making a reappearance in this update as well; he'll help you to reset parts of your island so that you can clean them up, and he'll get rid of things like flowers, custom designs, and objects you don't want lying around.</p>

<p>There's tons of other new stuff coming as part of this update, so check out the trailer below to get the rundown on everything you can expect to land in&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons&nbsp;</em>in January.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now is a great time for a laptop upgrade. Even though Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still weeks away, Amazon has already started rolling out some hard-to-miss tech deals, but it’s not always easy to spot the ones that are truly worth it. That’s where we come in, and we just found an incredible offer for those finally ready to say goodbye to their old, noisy machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5107/">Right now on Amazon, the 17.3-inch HP 2025 laptop is down to $800, after a huge $2,500 drop in its retail price</a>. This version sits between the entry-level and high-end configurations of the same model, and is appropriate for everyday work and play. Even better, you’re getting free accessories with your purchase, too! You can rely on this machine for your office tasks, creative projects, streaming, and even light gaming. The deal, however, is a limited-time one, and there’s no telling how long it’ll stick around. So if this one checks your boxes, it’s smart to grab it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5107/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Windows 11 Pro Ready to Go</h2>
<p>This laptop runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. You’re getting Intel’s 10-core i5-1334U processor, which ramps up to 4.6GHz, so it’s got plenty of power for resource-intensive tasks. Those who often need to work with different applications at once will appreciate the 32GB of RAM that actively prevents lag, plus a 1TB SSD, which makes for faster boot times. You can easily jump between a ton of tabs and programs without slowdown, while also keeping all your important files in a single place.</p>
<p>The display is also bigger than the standard options out there. You will enjoy impressive visuals on the large 17.3-inch HD+ BrightView display that’s suited for both indoor and outdoor use. Expect vivid, vibrant colors and impressive detail, regardless of what’s playing. There’s also an HP TrueVision 720p HD camera with a privacy shutter paired with dual microphones for clearer video calls.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3, alongside a wide range of ports to connect your essentials. The freebies include the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro we mentioned above, plus an external CD/DVD drive, a portable hard drive, a wireless mouse, a cleaning cloth, dust plugs, and a webcam privacy cover. Basically, there’s no need to buy anything extra to get started.</p>
<p>Snag the discount before it vanishes for good!</p>

The family of Kapp'n runs the new hotel off the pier, letting players decorate themed rooms for tourists. Slumber Island looks to be all about customizing and decorating with friends online.

Players will also find new Nintendo items, even playable NES and GameBoy systems. </p><p dir="ltr">In May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons received its first update in years</a>, with a focus on stabilizing online sessions.

		<p>MicroProse and Not Knowing Software have finally confirmed the early access release date for the helicopter shooter Cleared Hot, and that date is November 20th. If you do not know about Cleared Hot, think of it as a new take on classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike. The new trailer for Cleared Hot which shows the kind of gameplay to expect, including shooting at enemies, dodging incoming fire, and using a magnet to wreak some havoc.</p>

<p>In a post, the development team stated why they chose the early access route, saying, <em>“We chose to do Early Access for 2 reasons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Letting the community guide the direction of the game</em></li>
<li><em>Give us the option to build more content as we go</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Without early access, we would be much more limited on the scope of what we can do. You guys have been really great at providing feedback, and I want that to continue as we expand the campaign. For now, we are launching with the first “chapter” of the campaign, which takes place in Texas. We are planning to do 2 additional chapters during early access, as well as expanding with side / contract missions. We will be posting an early access roadmap before launch, which will give some more info on what you can expect.”</em></p>

<p>The team also confirmed three more helicopters for the game including the Mi-24 Hind, the Bell 222 Sky Wolf, and the UH-1 Huey. Every helicopter in Cleared Hot will have its own stats, along with various upgrades to each one’s weapons, which are split between light and heavy. General upgrades will also be available for each helicopter model.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Nintendo announced that its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/switch.html">second-best-selling Nintendo Switch game</a>, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is getting a Nintendo Switch 2 version, with graphical updates and features that take advantage of the Switch 2 and its improved hardware. Today's Animal Crossing news isn't just for Nintendo Switch 2 players; a new 3.0 title update is also on its way, which will be available to players on both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</p>



<p>The new Switch 2 version of Animal Crossing: New Horizons leans on the updated hardware for several updates, each shown off in a new trailer, which also goes over the features coming in the 3.0 title update. </p>



<p>Both the Switch 2 version of New Horizons and the 3.0 title update will be available on January 15, 2026, and if you already have New Horizons, you'll be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 edition of the game by purchasing an upgrade pack. The 3.0 title update is free for all players.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition &amp; Free Update – Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nODHyw3lgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When it comes to the graphical updates included in the Switch 2 edition of New Horizons, Nintendo doesn't exactly go into details, but does showcase that the Switch 2 version will look much sharper compared to what you get on Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>The more significant updates seem to be how New Horizons takes advantage of features like mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 controllers and the microphone on Switch 2, which now lets you call out to your island guests to more easily find where they are. Also, rather than having eight players come and visit your island, you and eleven of your friends who were all wealthy enough to buy a Switch 2 can all play together with up to twelve players capable of visiting one island on the Switch 2 edition.</p>



<p>The free 3.0 title update meanwhile adds new amiibo functionality with compatible Legend of Zelda and Splatoon amiibos allowing players to add up to four new characters to their island, along with new items and furniture styles with which to decorate their island. There's also a new LEGO collaboration on the way which has a slew of LEGO items for players to decorate and use.</p>



<p>New Horizons also gets a new hotel with the 3.0 update, where players can run and unlock new items and outfits from, as you'll decorate the various rooms in the hotel to suit a guest's specific needs.</p>



<p>New Horizons launched in March 2020, and has since become one of the best-selling first-party games from Nintendo on the Nintendo Switch. </p>



<p>When we <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/">reviewed it at launch, we gave it a 9.4/10</a>, and what we wrote back then still stands: "<em>When I saw that I had played 40 hours of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, I was shocked because it didn't feel like that long at all. And that's because it still has that Animal Crossing magic. I played for what felt like five minutes a day, but in reality was multiple hours of fishing, bug catching, material collecting, crafting, and more. I feel like a complete newbie still, like I have so much to do, so much more to learn, and I can't wait to see more. I have to. I'm going to continue playing, and build my perfect island. Animal Crossing: New Horizons has its hooks in me, and while I still don't know if it's my favorite Animal Crossing game, it's undoubtedly one of the best.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-pvpve-extraction-maps-embark-studios-2000639945"><em>Arc Raiders</em> launches today</a> across PC and console and it’s already tearing up the charts on Steam. The influx of players means some are experiencing day-one server issues, even as the extraction shooter is propelled into the Valve-owned storefront’s top-10 most-played games.</p> <p>Despite being $40, Embark Studios’ latest PVPVE game is already climbing past free-to-play games like <em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em>&nbsp;and <em>Apex Legends</em>. It’s currently ranked seventh overall with over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">160,000 concurrent players</a> and remains the best-selling game across all of Steam at the moment. Not bad for a Thursday release when most people are still at work or in school.</p>

 <p>But the initial flood of players did bring with it some early server problems. Some players got kicked from the game with a screen that read “<a href="https://twitter.com/kelskiYT/status/1983830108210426328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983830108210426328%7Ctwgr%5E49b2d22e0e8daecd8b18ce1cd77d1d94e3502fbc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem">online connection error</a>” while others faced a problem called “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ojwo7x/what_does_this_mean_is_it_my_wifi_or_is_it_the/#lightbox">network timeout</a>” in which the game said it had failed to retrieve their data from the backend services. Fortunately, it doesn’t sound like these issues were super widespread and they appear to be resolving as we get further from when <em>Arc Raiders</em> first went live earlier today.</p>

   <p>The pitch for <em>Arc Raiders</em> is straightforward enough. You play as a fighter scavenging through a post-apocalyptic world that feels trapped in the surreal analog years of the late ’70s, early ’80s in the best way. You collect loot, battle other players, and try to take down powerful computer-controlled machines called Arcs. It’s from Embark Studios, which also shipped <em>The Finals</em>, and shows potential for helping the extraction shooter genre break out beyond the notoriously hardcore communities that usually play them.</p>

 <p>It’s currently sitting at a rating of over 80 percent positive on Steam with 1,000 reviews in so far. “I didn’t know bots could hold grudges, but apparently Embark Studios wrote the AI like, ‘If player breathes, hunt player,'” wrote one early player. “Each encounter feels alive, unpredictable, and truly earned,” another wrote. A third was more succinct: “Pew, pew, pew.”</p>

 <p>But not everyone’s buzzing. There have been calls for less emphasis on paid cosmetics and the addition of a solo mode. Some players have also called for a PVE-only option, speculating that the launch would be that much bigger if <em>Arc Raiders</em> had gone the <em>Helldivers 2</em> route. “<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/discussions/0/811335793676561765/">PvE Isn’t a Threat, Karen – It’s Just Another Way to Play</a>,” reads one of the most active threads on the Steam Discussion page. Some hardcore fans don’t want the option “diluting” the experience. Others think the extraction shooter could be one of the biggest games of the year with it.</p>

 <h2>Is there AI slop in <em>Arc Raiders</em>?</h2> <p>You might have noticed an generative AI warning on the<em> Arc Raiders</em> Steam page. “During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation,” it reads. “In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.” Embark’s previous game also used generative AI for its in-match announcer commentary.</p>

 <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em> in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We use something called machine learning, or reinforcement learning, and that’s to do with the locomotion for our larger drones with multiple legs, but there’s no generative content whatsoever.”</p> <p>Studio boss Patrick Soderlund elaborated on that process in a different interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/arc-raiders-the-game-that-dares-to"><em>The Game Business</em> this week</a>. “If you ask for [development that’s] 100 times faster, you have to take what you know and basically throw that away and then start really thinking about what type of modifications and transformation do we need to go through in order to completely change the way that we approach this,” he said. “So that’s when we came into procedurally generated content, to using AI and machine learning to some extent in even the content creation pipelines, to what types of tools we build, and realizing that a lot of these tools that we’ve been working with for so long stem from software that’s 25 to 30 years old.”</p> <p>While <em>Arc Raiders</em> also uses the text-to-speech AI for voicing certain character lines, it doesn’t sound like the visuals or any other objects directly visible in the game were made with generative AI tools. Whether the development team’s assurances get your slop senses tingling is another question entirely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even people who&nbsp;<em>really</em> love the holidays will admit that scaling a ladder to hang festive holiday lights, and then doing it all over again to take them down weeks later, is a massive pain. It’s not a stretch to say that people standing on rickety ladders in freezing weather have spent decades wishing for a solution.</p>
<p>It’s also not a stretch to say that Govee’s smart outdoor LED strip lights are that solution, because they’re weatherproof and completely customizable to fit every holiday and special event, and even just serve as accent lighting for your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/">Amazon has a limited-time deal taking 25% off the price of a 98.4-foot package of Govee smart outdoor LED lights, giving you the option to retire the rickety ladder forever for just $120</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Every Holiday Covered</h2>
<p>You know the drill — Christmas lights are green and red, or all-white; Halloween lights are orange, and if you really go all-out with the festive decorating, green for St. Patrick’s Day, red for Valentine’s Day, and so on. That used to mean more or less constant installation and removal, but these Govee LED lights have virtually limitless color possibilities, and 64 vivid festive presets to cover every occasion. With the Govee Home app you can also design and save your own color schemes and effects, including ones where the lights dance in sync with music.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app is the key to complete control and customization of your outdoor lights, including timers, brightness, scenes, colors, and more via Wi-Fi. Voice control with Alexa, Google Home, and other smart home assistants is also easy to set up.</p>



<h2>Year-Round Decor</h2>
<p>The Govee LED light strips and control box are both rated IP65 for waterproofing, and the power adapter is rated IP44. The light strips are made of durable, transparent silicone, and they operate in temperatures ranging from 140 degrees Fahrenheit to minus-22, which means once you complete the easy installation of the three 32.8-foot LED strips with the included light clip sets, you can leave them up for good. And no, it’s not like the old lights where if one went dead, the entire strip gives up.</p>
<p>It might be on the late side to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5106/">take this Amazon deal for 25% off and buy your Govee smart outdoor lights for just $120</a> in time to get them up for Halloween 2025, but they’ll look amazing for Christmas and every holiday or special occasion for years to come, and they’ll provide beautiful accent lighting anytime you want. You’re just one click away from making your last trip up that ladder.</p>

Amid reports <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">Amazon has 'gutted' its video games division</a> as part of 14,000 company wide job cuts earlier this week, one former developer has suggested its Lord of the Rings MMO has also been cancelled.
</p>
<p>
On Tuesday, Bloomberg shared an internal memo to staff from Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and Game) announcing "significant role reductions" across Amazon Game Studios. Boom added the job cuts were a result of the company's decision to halt a "significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs". Amazon is yet to reveal the exact number of employees affected within its games division.
</p>
<p>
Following that announcement, impacted staff began announcing their departure from Amazon on social media, with the ensuing messages suggesting teams from two projects - New World and the still-unreleased Lord of the Rings MMO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-announces-fresh-stab-at-turning-the-lord-of-the-rings-into-an-mmo">announced back in 2023</a> - were both impacted. However, a LinkedIn post by former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine suggests the Lord of the Rings MMO will now never see the light of day.
</p>
<p>
"This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games," Amrine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388971058642522112/">wrote</a>, "alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)."
</p>
<p>
If Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO <em>is</em> cancelled, it would mark the second such project to die a death under the company's watch. It previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-is-co-developing-the-free-to-play-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">announced a different Lord of the Rings MMO</a> back in 2019, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">scrapped it amid reports of a dispute with Chinese mega-corp Tencent</a>. Eurogamer has contacted Amazon for comment on the fate of is more recent Tolkien MMO.
</p><p>
As for New World, Amazon has now confirmed the MMO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">will no longer receive updates</a>, but will remain playable for now. The company has guaranteed servers will remain live "through 2026" and promised to give "a minimum of six months' notice" before making changes that would impact its availability. More details on its future are due "in the coming months".

<p>Alongside a new free update</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will be arriving alongside a new free Ver. 3.0 update on <strong>15th January</strong>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Edition includes all sorts of new features to make the most of the new console. There's Mouse Mode integration for improved home layout and clothing design, a Microphone item so you can call out your Villagers' names, improved visuals and frame rate, Camera and GameChat opportunities and more.</p>
<p>Those already with the Switch 1 version (and that means... everyone) will be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition by purchasing an Upgrade Pack for <strong>$4.99</strong>. If you're one of the few who haven't played it on the older console, ou can pick up the Switch 2 Edition (digital or physical) for <strong>$64.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some snaps so you can see it in action:</p>

<p>The free update, meanwhile, is an especially beefy one. Ver. 3.0 packs in a new resort hotel run by Kapp'n and his family for you to decorate as you please, expanded home storage (5,000 items beefed up to 9,000!), Sonny Resetti arrives to provide a clean-up service, a dream 'Slumber Island' for you to start afresh and edit <em>with your friends</em>, additional amiibo functionality, and collaborations with retro Nintendo, LEGO, <strong>Zelda</strong> and <strong>Splatoon.</strong></p>
<p><em>Phew...</em> we need a breather after that!</p>

<p>We still have a little while to wait before both the update and Switch 2 Edition officially wash up on our shores, but gosh, are we excited!</p>

Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Nintendo has always had a dark side. Though it's built up a name for itself as a family-friendly company, every so often, when it can be contained no longer, its dark side manifests in the form of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> or a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a>. But while we expect a touch of gloom and misery in our Zeldas and Metroids, it may strike you as more than a bit curious that one of Nintendo's darkest adventures stars a platforming hero previously known for some of the happiest, most family-friendly games on earth.</p>
<p>But then, nearly every aspect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> will strike many as more than a bit curious. Nintendo had launched each of its three previous consoles with a bright and colourful Mario platformer, yet for the GameCube the company chose a dark, atmospheric title starring the mascot's lesser-known brother. Not only that, but Luigi's Mansion was about as far from a traditional Mario game as it could possibly get. It didn't even feature a jump button.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159976/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Perhaps it's for these reasons that Luigi's Mansion didn't get the recognition and reception Nintendo had hoped, at least at launch. It simply wasn't the game that people were expecting. It's a shame, really, because in actuality it's quite a remarkable little game, a unique and atmospheric experience that's as fun as it is technologically impressive.</p>
<p>The premise is a simple one: Luigi has won a mansion in a contest... except he doesn't remember entering any contest. To see what the deal is, he heads out to check out the mansion for himself.</p>
<p>Once inside, he is almost immediately confronted by a gang of disgruntled ghosts; thankfully, the notorious Professor E. Gadd (creator of such classic commodities as the Portraitificationizer and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a>'s F.L.U.D.D.) comes to your aid with one of his latest inventions. He explains that Mario is being held captive inside. Naturally, Luigi must find a way to save him.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/accessibility-report/2195/embed @ 1761832395 -->
<p>In addition to your trusty flashlight, the Professor equips you with two of his cleverest inventions to survive the haunted abode: the Game Boy Horror (GBH) and the Poltergust 3000.</p>
<p>The former — which is quite literally a Game Boy Color with a more groan-inducing name — might be likened to the Scanning Visor in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>. The GBH screen is sort of like a window, and pressing the 'X' button lets you look through it and examine your surroundings. This item becomes useful as you encounter some of the game's trickier bosses, as it allows you to scan them and get insight into their possible weak points.</p>
<p>However, the focus is undoubtedly on the Poltergust 3000, which served as both an incredibly fun gameplay mechanic and a technological showcase for the then-new console. When used in tandem with the flashlight, the vacuum-like device is simply a way of sucking up the ghastly inhabitants – first shine your light on the ghost to catch it off guard, then quickly suck it up using the 'R' button and control stick.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159982/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>However, it quickly reveals itself to be much more than a simple vacuum. The GameCube's pressure-sensitive trigger buttons were quite cutting-edge when the system launched, and Luigi's Mansion was one of the first titles to showcase their use. Being able to precisely control the airflow of the Poltergust sets the groundwork for some pretty neat boss fights and puzzles, and this, in conjunction with the game's still-impressive physics engine, makes interacting with the environment a real joy.</p>
<p>The way in which your vacuum is able to affect things like table cloths, shelves, beach balls, and carpeting is still really cool even today, and goes a long way in pulling you into the game. Interacting with the environment doesn't go unrewarded, either – exploring every nook and cranny to find cash, pearls, and gold bars is addictive and gives the game a high score twist.</p>
<p>Structurally, Luigi's Mansion is about as far-removed from a Mario game as you could get – in fact, the closest thing you could compare it to might be dungeon-crawling in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Gone are the spacious and whimsical environments of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a>. Instead, you're given one ill-lit, claustrophobic, creepy mansion that you must explore room by room. Upon entering one, you're greeted with darkness; darkness, that is, and the haunting giggles of hidden ghosts. One by one, these spectres will reveal themselves, and it's your job to suck them up.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159980/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Clearing all of them in a given room will cause the lights to come on and, more often than not, a treasure chest to appear. Nine times out of ten, these will contain keys that allow you to access some previously impassable door, and round-and-round the formula goes.</p>
<p>It would run the risk of being repetitive if the core gameplay mechanics weren't so much fun, but thankfully the odd satisfaction of seeing Luigi getting yanked around the room by unruly ghosts never gets old, and the game's knack for creating a mood means exploring each new room is always exciting.</p>
<p>This being a launch title and all, it's not surprising that this launch title isn't the prettiest GameCube game, but what it lacks in pixels, it makes up for with artistic flair and technological impressiveness. In addition to the aforementioned physics and great use of the controller, Luigi's Mansion was also a pioneer in realistic lighting effects. The flashlight was an immediate stunner, and its effect still manages to impress after other flashlight-driven games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/silent_hill_shattered_memories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alan_wake_remastered">Alan Wake</a> drove the concept further.</p>
<figure><a title="Luigi's Mansion Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159975/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>But one of the most consistently enjoyable aspects is how much work went into turning Luigi, who began life as Mario's bland palette-swap, into a hilarious and lovable individual with a distinct personality. Simply put, the character animations in this game are astounding: the way Luigi's hand trembles as he opens a new door, or how his teeth chatter as he walks down a darkened hallway. He flattens into a thin sheet of paper when something falls on him, he stretches and expands when screaming with fear — with care and detail, Nintendo turned a once carbon-copy character into one as expressive and malleable as something out of a Bob Clampett cartoon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Luigi's Mansion's use of sound is still some of the cleverest you'll hear in a video game. There's essentially only one theme here, but it's amazing how much mileage Nintendo gets out of it. Sometimes it plays hauntingly in the background. Sometimes, in the creepiest and quietest of rooms, Luigi will whistle and hum it nervously to himself, as if to keep his mind off the ominous danger at hand.</p>
<p>And in rooms with sneaky ghosts that refuse to show themselves, if you listen carefully, you can hear them cackling the tune to get a better idea of where they are. Genius.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What Luigi's Mansion lacks in content and longevity, it makes up for with a remarkably well-crafted and unique single campaign that will keep you consistently entertained from front to back. It's not quite on the same level as Mario's better outings, but the game is so entirely different from anything Mario has ever starred in that it feels unjust to compare them; and, really, it's this complete departure from the Mario formula that makes the game so successful in the first place.</p>
<p>The gameplay design is so uncommon that it's pretty difficult to slap a genre label on it, but suffice to say that if you consider yourself a gamer or Nintendo fan, you owe it to yourself to give Luigi's first spooky adventure a shot.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aion-2-to-launch-globally-in-2026-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-says-nvidia.1339177/</guid>

			<p>The MMORPG AION 2 will launch globally in 2026 with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation support on the PC version (the game will also be available on mobile devices).</p>



<p>The initial launch in South Korea and Taiwan is set for November 19. The game is a sequel to Aion: The Tower of Eternity, which launched in 2008 in Korea and the following year worldwide. The original game was powered by Crytek's CRYENGINE, whereas this new installment is made with Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>Aion 2 takes place around two hundred years later and features a world that, according to NCSOFT, is 36 times larger. Moreover, unlike the “zoned” areas of the original, Aion 2 features a seamless, fully explorable world with no loading screens between vast regions. Players will once again choose between two factions, Elyos and Asmodian, which are eternally locked in conflict. However, unlike in the original game, they will be placed in separate servers, so the conflict between them will occur entirely in the Abyss. On this special PvP battlefield, the populations of two servers (one for Elyos and another for Asmodian players) will clash.</p>



<p>Beyond that, the developers have promised over 200 dungeons to explore that range from solo instances to group dungeons for up to eight players. Eight are also the classes available at launch: Gladiator, Templar, Assassin, Marksman, Sorcerer, Spiritmaster, Cleric, and Chanter.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The news was shared by NVIDIA as part of a press release highlighting the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gamer-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GeForce Gamer Festival</a>, which is live today at COEX in Seoul to celebrate 25 years of GeForce in South Korea. The MMORPG is playable at the event, just like NCSOFT's MMOTPS Cinder City, which we checked out at Gamescom 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cinder-city-preview-qa-open-world-shooter-mmo-like/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an exclusive developer interview</a>.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also shared a brief update by KRAFTON on PUBG Ally, the 'co-playable character' powered by ACE <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced at CES 2025</a>. PUBG Ally, which is powered by the small language model (SMM) Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k and enables AI teammates to support the player including even engaging in combat with other players, will host a 'user test event' early next year. </p>

            <p>GOG continue to conquer the world of old games you either remember fondly or have totally forgotten about. They've added 18 new ones to their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-are-doubling-down-on-game-preservation-and-making-it-easier-to-see-which-games-run-well-on-modern-pcs">preservation program</a> this week, with the latest arrivals being the Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0.</p>
<p>It's good to see the storefront's preservation efforts keep on expand, given they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-say-their-preservation-program-has-been-harder-than-we-thought-thanks-to-drm-and-elusive-creators">recently revaled</a> that this program's been a tougher undertaking than originally envisioned thus far. Things that're worth doing are rarely easy, though, are they? Well, ok, maybe having a cheeky biscuit with your supper is still worth doing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Resident Evil HD Remaster and Resident Evil 0's arrivals were <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983807379125702969">announced just this morning</a>, and they've been chucked straight into GOG's classic Resi bundle. In terms of tweaks to get them running as they should, both have had their stability checked, their compatibility with Windows 10 and 11 okayed, and support for cloud saves added. They're also currently grabbable with a 75% discount which knocks each down to £4/equivalent until November 13th.</p>
<p>The addition of those two follows 16 other games hitting the preservation program <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1983175739714191850">earlier this week</a>. Tomb Raider GOTY, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-splinter-cell">Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hitman-codename-47">Hitman: Codename 47</a> are the headliners to my young eye. However, you may have much stronger feelings for one or all of (clears throat):</p><p>SPORE Collection, Clive Barker's Undying, Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy, Superhero League of Hoboken, Heart of China, Thunderscape, North &amp; South, Titus The Fox: To Marrakech and Back, Battle Chess 4000, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-cthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a>: Prisoner of Ice, and Bloodwych.</p>
<p>GOG say their preservation program's 250 games wide with these new additions, which is inching closer to their stated goal of around 300 to 350 by the close of 2025. I'm sad they don't publicly track a 'number of private investigators hired to track down rights holders' stat, but retaining some mystery there's understandable.</p>

              <p>There are two big names when it comes to video game escape rooms, and they’re remarkably similar ones. First you have <em>Escape Academy</em>, a wonderfully bonkers college for escape room artists, with a story that somehow includes murder and time travel. Then you have <em>Escape Simulator</em>, a more straight-faced collection of digital escape rooms, but with a much bigger focus on involved puzzles and deep mystery. Both are excellent, but only one of them has a sequel just released. <em>Escape Simulator 2</em> came out this week, offering even more elaborately themed rooms and even more complex challenges to solve. I spoke to developers Pine Studio to find out more about how to find the balance between emulating real-world rooms, and embracing the impossibilities afforded by video games.</p>  <p>Escape rooms, as a concept, are showing no signs of fading in popularity. On the day&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em> released, I wasn’t playing the game because I was out celebrating my birthday with my family by playing in a real-life escape room (<a href="https://tempo-bath.com/">Tempo</a> in Bath, UK—it was&nbsp;<em>fantastic</em>). And we were spoiled for choice, with more and more buildings in my local area taken over by these hands-on, locked-in puzzle chambers. A well-designed escape room is such a thrill, as you and your buddies scramble to unscramble codes, piecing together clues to cause a bookshelf to reveal itself as a secret door, then squeezing down a passage to find a hidden briefcase and new set of clues…It’s the best. But it’s also pretty pricey, and requires getting together a group of people willing to play. When that can’t happen, that’s when video game escape rooms step in.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator</em>, released with perfect timing during the covid lockdowns of October 2021, provided a way to play such challenges when leaving the house and gathering in groups was very much a bad idea. And it was utterly splendid, a really superb collection of 16 rewarding rooms. Then came the DLC, and oh boy, there was a lot of it! In the years since, the number of rooms has reached 50, with more still to come. Given this, I wondered how a studio knows when it’s time to stop adding to their previous success and make the decision to create a sequel. “What pushed us toward&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em>,” says Boris Barbir, co-founder of developer Pine Studio, “was the chance to create much larger rooms with a more realistic look. That change opened the door to a whole new kind of puzzles that we could not do before.” That doesn’t mean they’re done with the first game, however. Remarkably, there are still new rooms in development, with Barbir noting, “We will continue supporting it for a long time.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639911" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639911"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639911">© Pine Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Part of Pine Studios’ method is to involve real-world escape room creators when developing their challenges. “For both games we worked closely with real-life escape room designers,” says Barbir. “They start by sketching puzzles on paper, then we curate, adapt, and build them into playable virtual spaces. From there we go through several rounds of testing and adjustments until everything feels right.” For the sequel, the developers had the smart idea to add another group of consultants to the process: the best community creators who had built rooms using the first game’s room creation tools. “Their input,” says Barbir, naming Zesty, Elkondo, and Sade, “helped us keep the puzzles fresh and engaging.”</p>

 <p>But obviously such designs have a delicate path to walk. With the freedom afforded by playing on a computer, these games don’t necessarily have to stick to the laws of reality, allowing for events and sequences that real-life rooms could never deliver. But then, at the same time, if they become too fanciful they can lose that unique sense of being trapped in an elaborate room and the hands-on nature of solving the puzzles. I wondered how Pine Studios approaches this balance. “We always try to keep the game true to being a simulator,” Barbir says. “Our playtests showed that players generally do not enjoy puzzles that work ‘magically’ without logic behind them. We design spaces and mechanisms that feel grounded in reality.” That’s not to say that magic isn’t a part of the games, however.&nbsp;<em>Escape Simulator 2</em> begins with four puzzles set in a vampire’s castle, involving literal magic mirrors and some rather impossible spells, but there’s always a grounding rationale to their use. “The virtual world still gives us plenty of freedom,” Barbir notes. “We can build a pirate island or a zero-gravity spaceship, things that would be almost impossible to pull off in real life, but the puzzles themselves remain logical and believable.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639912"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639912">© Pine Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The community certainly became a big part of the original game. Via Steam’s Workshop feature, players were able to add their own creations to the mix, with over 4,000 rooms submitted in the last four years. A pattern Pine Studio noticed was that “a huge number of them leaned into darker, creepier or horror themes.” The same, Barbir says, is true of real-world escape rooms, with horror-themed settings proving the most popular. “In the first game we kept things light and playful,” he adds, “but with the sequel we wanted to explore that darker side.” That’s not to say this is a horror game, and there’s certainly nothing even approaching a jump scare. Instead it has a “moodier” atmosphere, still entirely suitable for younger players, but with a bit more spookiness.</p>

 <p><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> comes with a 2.0 version of its room creator, and the hope the community will get just as engaged this time around with the more elaborate tools and room sizes. Of course, that requires some time, given just how involved it is to build something worth playing. A handful have started to appear, but it’ll be in the next few months that the game’s 12 developer-made rooms will start to be joined by the best creations from players. Talking of which, how long exactly does it take for the developers to create just one room? “Some of our larger rooms,” Barbir says, “take over six months to design, test and polish before they feel ready. It is a lot of work, but the result is worth it.”</p> <p>I’d agree. I’ve played a fair few rooms in the sequel now, and they so satisfyingly scratch that escape room itch. You can play in co-op, too, to really embrace that pleasure of working as a team to crack the mysteries. And completed rooms unlock versions with even more difficult puzzles, giving a genre that’s usually very much one-and-done a reason to replay. Of course, if the previous game is anything to go by, we can expect dozens more official rooms to be added to the game over the next few years (and it’s worth noting plenty of these were free, especially the bizarre crossover packs like rooms themed around&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em> and&nbsp;<em>Among</em> Us, with other DLC adding five new rooms for around $5).</p> <p><em>Escape Simulator 2</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2879840/Escape_Simulator_2/">is out now on Steam</a>.</p>

              <p>Finding an affordable cordless vacuum that actually delivers professional-grade cleaning feels impossible these days. Most budget options sacrifice suction power or build quality, while premium models from Dyson or Shark demand prices that make your wallet weep. The Shark IX141 Pet Cordless Stick Vacuum sits firmly in the mid to high-end category with its Hypervelocity suction and 40-minute runtime, but Amazon’s early Black Friday discount slashes the price from $299 to $149. This all-time low pricing positions a quality Shark vacuum at entry-level cost, which explains why over 20,000 people grabbed this deal last month alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Hypervelocity Suction That Handles Real Messes</h2>
<p>The Hypervelocity motor provides strong suction that <strong>handles everything from fine dust to pet hair on both carpets and hard floors</strong>. Shark’s bristle brushroll has self-cleaning technology that stops hair tangles, and automatically clears wrapped strands while you vacuum. This feature is essential for pet owners or homes with family members who have long hair since regular brush rolls quickly become ineffective when hair wraps around them.</p>
<p>The <strong>40-minute runtime in standard mode</strong> with no accessories gives you enough battery life to clean most homes on a single charge and this performance surpasses what many competitors provide at this price. The runtime stays consistent throughout the battery cycle, which means it doesn’t weaken as the charge runs low. <strong>Also, charging from empty to full takes about 3.5 hours</strong> which is typical for cordless vacuums in this category.</p>



<p>The LED headlights in the floor nozzle light up hidden debris that you might miss in dim corners, under furniture and along dark baseboards. These bright lights uncover dust, pet hair and dirt that blend into shadows so that you can clean everything instead of just moving mess around. The low-profile design is slim enough to fit under most furniture, reaching spots where dust bunnies gather but traditional upright vacuums cannot access.</p>
<p>The <strong>XL dust cup holds 0.4 quarts of debris</strong> and allows for several cleaning sessions before you need to empty it. The CleanTouch Dirt Ejector lets you dispose of dirt with one touch, keeping your hands clean and stopping dust from escaping into the air. This hands-free system opens the bottom of the dust cup completely, letting compacted debris fall straight into your trash without getting stuck inside.</p>



<p>Switching to handheld mode takes seconds; just remove the wand. This transforms the vacuum into a lightweight tool for above-floor cleaning tasks. The <strong>handheld version weighs only 7.5 pounds</strong>&nbsp;which makes it easy to clean stairs, furniture, car interiors, and ceiling corners without tiring. The Pet Multi-Tool has an anti-tangle conical brush bar designed to lift embedded fur from upholstery, car seats, and pet beds where hair collects stubbornly. The included Crevice Tool reaches into narrow gaps between cushions, along baseboards, and into tight corners where standard attachments don’t fit.</p>
<p>At $149, you pay half the usual price for a vacuum that competes with models priced at $250 or more, making this early Black Friday deal one of the best values for cordless cleaning.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment’s busy 2025 ends with the release of The Outer Worlds 2. If you’re committed to the series, you can upgrade to the Premium Edition to get more bang for your sci-fi buck. But doing so also comes with a great benefit and a bit of thinly-veiled banter.</p>



<p>With so many big releases toward the end of 2025, it’s easy to forget that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-explained-exact-start-times-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds 2</a> is sandwiched in between all of this. The first game was tremendous, and the sci-fi sequel is just as good, if not better. If you’re really keen, you can go all out for the Premium Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-comes-with-a-flaw">The Outer Worlds 2 Premium Edition Comes With A ‘Flaw’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>DLC and more are coming your way. Image by the PlayStation Store</figcaption></figure>



<p>Chances are, you’ve already checked out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-the-outer-worlds-2-pre-order-bonuses-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all The Outer Worlds 2 Pre-Order Bonuses &amp; Editions</a>. The Premium Edition is the big, bad wolf of the pack. It comes with future DLC expansions, cosmetics, and a digital artbook and soundtrack. But one thing it doesn’t make clear is the Flaw you can gain from it.</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 has many ‘Flaws,’ all of which give your character permanent attribute afflictions and benefits. The Consumerism Flaw is automatically presented to you for buying the Premium Edition.</p>



<p>“<strong>You’re the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you’re more interested in buying the next big thing than in financial planning</strong>,” the Flaw’s description says.</p>



<p>If you accept the Flaw, you gain “-15% Vendor Prices” and “-10% Sell Value at Vendors.” It’s an optional Flaw, so you don’t have to take it, but Obsidian’s self-awareness and humor are very much appreciated on this one. Basically saying ‘We’re glad you bought our game’s most expensive edition, but praise capitalism!’</p>



<p>Have you picked up The Outer Worlds 2? Do you plan to? Let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, which is getting more popular by the minute.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>The Bitsummit Executive Committee will host BitSummit PUNCH, the 2026 edition of Japan’s largest independent games exhibition, from May 22 to 24, 2026 at Miyako Messe in Kyoto, the organization announced. Exhibitor registration is <a href="https://bs-entry-system.com/en/" target="_blank">now available</a>. <span id="more-1003745"></span></p><p>“The theme for BitSummit 2026 is ‘High Impact,’ making your mark on the industry with the resources you have available,” reads the announcement. “Going beyond just being ‘efficient,’ we believe that through creative purity and passion, games can harness a power great enough to move the world.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the event, via the Bitsummit Executive Committee:</p><blockquote><p>BitSummit is Japan’s largest indie game festival. Held annually in Kyoto, the event was launched in late 2012 with the aim of promoting unique local indie games to an international audience. The first event was held in 2013 as a small-scale event for indie game fans and attracted 200 attendees. By 2025, Bitsummit had grown into a major event with over 58,000 attendees present. </p><p>2026 marks Bitsummit’s 14th year and the event’s growth shows no signs of stopping. Bitsummit has been featured on major gaming websites around the world as well as local and international gaming magazines such as Weekly Famitsu, Dengeki Online, and EDGE. It has also been a hot topic at panel discussions at the Game Developers Conference, IndieCade, IndieCade East, and CEDEC.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/bitsummit-punch-set-for-may-22-to-24-2026]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> has officially launched, and like several other live-service games, the servers for the extraction shooter game are currently being overwhelmed with people attempting to log in. On Steam alone, the game has currently peaked at 153,919 players at the time of writing (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>), and that's not even factoring in players on the Epic Games Store version or console players on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of people are getting error connection messages, with the issue being compounded by players constantly trying their luck to gain access. Arc Raiders developer Embark Studios hasn't issued a formal statement yet, but if you're one of the people affected by online connection errors, you may want to be patient and wait for things to die down a little.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>A rocky start to online games isn't novel these days, with numerous live-service titles all experiencing these teething pains. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-developer-in-crisis-mode-working-on-fixes-for-launch-issues/1100-6520932/" data-ref-id="1100-6520932">Helldivers 2 was an infamous example</a>, with other games like Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft also experiencing surges in player traffic during the launch of new expansions. We haven't even reached the weekend yet, so Arc Raiders is likely going to see even more players flock to its servers for a few days of post-apocalyptic scavenging.</p><p>This launch does bode well for the game, as it's sandwiched between two of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-shooter-games/2900-6622/" data-ref-id="2900-6622">biggest shooters of the year</a>, Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Embark Studios co-founder Patrick Soderlund was recently quizzed about the launch timing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-aint-scared-launching-between-battlefield-6-and-black-ops-7/1100-6535792/">but he expressed confidence in Arc Raiders and its ability to find an audience</a>.</p><p>In the months leading up to its release, Arc Raiders saw some pretty radical changes. Originally envisioned as a free-to-play PvE shooter, development saw Arc Raiders evolve into an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-new-game-dumps-free-to-play-model-changes-to-40-premium-release/1100-6525993/">extraction shooter priced at $40</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-server-test-put-up-some-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535545/">The game also posted impressive numbers on Steam</a> for its server slam test, and it looks like that early slice of Arc Raiders has won quite a few people over to it during the busiest time on the gaming calendar.</p>
