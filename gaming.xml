			<p>As part of the ongoing exclusive Game Informer coverage, BioWare <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/01/a-look-at-dragon-age-the-veilguards-difficulty-options-and-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> more information on the difficulty settings available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p>Preset difficulty options include Storyteller, Adventurer, and Nightmare, which are pretty self-explanatory. You may swap between them at your leisure, with the notable exception of Nightmare difficulty: once that has been selected for a playthrough, it cannot be reverted. You'd have to start a new one at a lower setting if needed.</p>
<p>The surprise option is the custom 'Unbound' setting, which will allow players to craft their own challenge level by tweaking parameters like parry timing, aim assistance (up to auto-aim), enemy pressure (how quickly and often you will be attacked), the amount of damage dealt to and received from enemies, and even wayfinding. Last but not least, fans who are interested in Dragon Age: The Veilguard solely because of the story (and there are quite a few of those) can turn on the no-death setting.</p>
<p>Game Director Corinne Busche told Game Informer that the studio doesn't consider these as 'cheat' options. Rather, they have been implemented to allow all kinds of fans to partake in the adventure. Players can expect other accessibility features, too, with more information to be shared closer to launch.</p>
<p>On that note, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is still scheduled for a generic Fall 2024 launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. That may change soon, though, with Gamescom around a month and a half away.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to learn absolutely everything there is to know about the fourth mainline entry in the fantasy RPG franchise, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our freshly published roundup article</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-superb-case-of-the-golden-idol-joins-game-pass-in-july.917346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190770/game-pass-july-2024-free-xbox-games-case-of-the-golden-idol-tchia-neon-white-flock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="WNbCum">Microsoft has revealed what’s coming to Game Pass during the first half of July and, while absent any big-hitters, the lineup features at least four really excellent indie games that will be well worth your time during this relative dry spell for big releases.</p>
<p id="T31elC">Polygon’s favorite of the lot is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23433618/case-of-the-golden-idol-review-return-of-obra-dinn-detective-game"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a>, joining Game Pass on July 9: a hilarious, macabre point-and-click detective mystery set in the 18th century, with an illustration style you’ll never forget. It’s also an excellent puzzle game with perhaps the most satisfying murder-mystery detection mechanics in any video game.</p>
<p id="c92Gmz">But it’s far from being the only worthwhile pick here. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23645683/tchia-review-action-adventure-zelda-open-world"><em>Tchia</em></a> (joining July 11) is a joyful, Zelda-influenced open-world exploration game set in a version of the beautiful Pacific island nation of New Caledonia. If you fancy something a little less sedate, may we direct you toward <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23185130/neon-white-review-speedrun-fps-deck-builder-pc-switch"><em>Neon White</em></a> (also July 11), a fast-paced, first-person, anime-style action game about slaying demons. It’s a speedrunners’ delight, with a perfect difficulty curve, and you might find your friends’ leaderboard gets pretty competitive.</p>
<p id="0FEa7e">Also of note: <em>Flock</em> is a new release coming to Game Pass on day one on July 16. This chill multiplayer game about the joy of flight isn’t out yet, but what we’ve seen is very promising indeed.</p>
<p id="68DdZc">Here’s everything coming to Game Pass over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="MsOdBY"><strong>New games on Game Pass in July</strong></h2>

<p>It’s a day that many football fans have been waiting for for a long time, a deep dive into the Dynasty Mode coming to College Football 25.</p>



<p>The deep dive comes with a six-minute trailer along with a 17,000-word blog post from EA. In it, everything you can expect from the mode is covered. From the coaching carousel to recruiting to conference alignment to even how gameplay falls into off-field decisions. It’s clear that a lot of passion has gone into the mode, and it shows with the deep dive.</p>



<p>Without getting into all 17,000 words of it, here are a few of the biggest takeaways:</p>



<ul>
<li>You can be a head coach, offensive coordinator, or defensive coordinator</li>



<li>Coaches fall under three archetype categories: Recruiting, Motivation, Scheme</li>



<li>RPG-like skill tree for your coaches</li>



<li>Over 3,500 high school recruits are generated each year to scout</li>



<li>14 pitch grades to determine a recruit’s interest in your school</li>



<li>Some players have dealbreakers than can lead to them not wanting to talk with you or even transfer from your school.</li>



<li>Players can de-commit from your school ahead of National Signing Day</li>



<li>Full conference re-alignment</li>



<li>Team Builder allows importing of up to 16 teams per dynasty (private dynasties only)</li>
</ul>

<p>The latest trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead not only showcases how the franchise’s blind extraterrestrial creatures with superhuman hearing will appear and behave in the game but also hints at the game’s exploration of the origins of this world with an original storyline. This storyline will seemingly delve into how the aliens invaded and impacted the planet, introducing new characters and narratives to the franchise.</p>



<p>In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, we’ll see Alex, a college student with asthma, navigating a terrifying alien invasion alongside her boyfriend, Martin. The situation becomes even more challenging for Alex as she discovers she’s pregnant. The trailer promises intense moments as the couple faces close encounters with the fearsome blind beasts of the franchise. And man, it looks scary in the first person.</p>



<p>“A Quiet Place” is an expansive post-apocalyptic horror film series produced by Paramount Pictures. The franchise boasts a talented cast, including John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and other notable actors. Krasinski and Michael Sarnoski have directed the series, which has already seen the release of three movies. The most recent instalment, “A Quiet Place: Day One,” hit the screens a few days ago.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-sues-two-switch-pirates-for-substantial-and-irreparable-harm<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>"Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Nintendo of America has filed lawsuits against two individuals it accuses of violating its copyright by trading and selling "circumvention devices".</p>
<p>In court papers uploaded to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/">Torrent Freak</a>, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-modded.pdf">Ryan Michael Daly </a>of Modded Hardware – a website Nintendo believes has contravened the DMCA by selling modded consoles, pirated games, and mod chips – has been accused of trafficking in circumvention devices, copyright infringement, breach of EULA contract, and tortious interference with contract.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/nintendo-archbox.pdf">James C. Williams</a> – known online as 'Archbox' – has similarly been accused of copyright infringement, circumvention of technological measures, trafficking in circumvention devices, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contract.</p>
<p>The complaint – filed in Seattle, Washington, on June 28 – states that the defendants' sale and distribution of "circumvention devices, hacked consoles, and circumvention services" has done "substantial and irreparable harm" to Nintendo.</p>
<p>"Defendant not only offers the hardware and firmware to create and play pirated games, but he also provides his customers with copies of pirated Nintendo games," the lawsuit against Daly asserts.</p>
<p>"Typically, when a customer purchases a Hacked Console or the Circumvention Services, Defendant preinstalls on the console a portfolio of ready-to-play pirated games, including some of Nintendo’s most popular titles such as its Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid games."</p>
<p>Nintendo adds that "it is only because of products and services such as those sold by Defendant that illegal marketplaces distributing pirated games exist and thrive".</p>
<p>In Williams' paperwork, Nintendo claims he "became a leading (if not the primary) moderator of the SwitchPirates Reddit community, which he helped grow to nearly 190,000 members."</p>
<p>Nintendo claims it issued a cease and desist to both Daly and Williams in March 2024 and alleges the latter "bragged publicly that he is a 'pirate' who '[isn’t] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game'."</p>
<p>The "defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo’s intellectual property rights," Nintendo states.</p>
<p>Back in May, Nintendo issued a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-issues-dmca-takedown-notice-against-over-8500-yuzu-emulator-repositories">DMCA takedown notice against 8,535 GitHub repositories that contained code from the Yuzu emulator for Switch</a>. It followed a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-and-yuzu-developer-settle-lawsuit-for-24m">settlement in March between Nintendo and Yuzu developer Tropic Haze</a>, in which the latter agreed to pay $2.4 million to the company and end its support for the emulator.</p>
<p>Nintendo initially <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-files-lawsuit-against-yuzu-emulator-creators">took legal action against Tropic Haze in February</a> for copyright infringement and, back in April 2023, the Paris Court of Appeals sided with Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-court-battle-against-site-used-to-pirate-its-games">similar dispute with sharehosting website operator Dstorage</a>.</p>

		<p>Publisher Kasedo Games and development studio Bulwark Studios have confirmed that the sci-fi city builder will be releasing on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. It was released in 2022 for PC. The announcement trailer shows some of the issues you will be dealing with as the unlucky Administrator of the space station Tiqqun.</p>

<p>The description for IXION says, <em>“IXION is a city-builder that requires you to be vigilant, to constantly assess and reassess, to learn and adapt. If you and your crew are to endure, you must confront the perils of space, while at the same time uncovering its secrets and extracting its resources. Danger, however, will come from within as well as without; you’ll need to establish, maintain and develop the Tiqqun’s infrastructure while managing the station’s population, deciding how best to answer their pleas so as to maintain their trust in you and the mission.”</em></p>
<p>Every single decision you make as the Administrator of the Tiqqun will have consequences that will have both immediate and long term impacts. There are issues like electrical fires and hull breaches to deal with too, and there is no help readily available. IXION is a game that will have tough decisions, and you will need to balance the needs of the survivors with the reality of trying to survive in a drifting space station.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two years after we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-pc-beta-test-dated-ue5-f2p-looter-shooter-also-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered the game</a> ahead of a PC beta test, NEXON has finally released The First Descendant, its free-to-play third-person looter shooter game. During this time, the Unreal Engine 5-powered title underwent various tweaks and additions, some directly requested by fans (over two million users played the cross-play open beta).</p>
<p>Beomjun Lee, Game Producer at NEXON Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>With The First Descendant being our first global multi-platform launch, we wanted to develop something that allowed the voices of our players to be heard. Our goal is not only to create a game that we are proud of, but also to create something our players will love and enjoy for a long time. We implemented many changes for launch based on the community's requests and we hope it makes the experience even more enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>Minseok Joo, Game Creative Director at NEXON Games, added:</p>
<p><em>Descendants, from everyone on our development team, we thank you sincerely for choosing to join us in the fight against The Vulgus. Back when we first developed this concept in 2019, we set out to create a world inspired by some of our personal favorite looter shooters. The genre holds a special place in our hearts, and our development team has worked hard to create a game that we believe stands proudly among those prominent titles.</em></p>
<p>In the game, players choose one out of 19 playable characters, the titular Descendants, heroes who protect humanity against the alien invaders from The Vulgus. The playable roster is split between 14 original Descendants and 5 high-performance ultimate Descendants. Three new playable characters have been introduced with the launch build: Esiemo, Enzo, and Yujin. Esiemo handles explosives with a unique and dynamic gameplay style; Enzo is a support character with the ability to supply ammunition, making him suitable for tactical weapons. Yujin is a healing Descendant, and when played cooperatively with another player, can bring new cooperative strategies. Additionally, new high-performance Ultimate Descendants have been added, joining the previously announced Ultimate Lepic and Ultimate Viessa: Ultimate Ajax, Ultimate Bunny, and Ultimate Grey.</p>
<p>As with any looter shooter, players will enhance their character's statistics and gear by equipping loot, in this case, modules (of which there are 560). The First Descendant includes 11 weapon types and 22 Ultimate weapons at launch. Modules can boost their attack power, modify recoil, and add extra effects.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Descendant│Play Free Now│Dev Launch Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cxkdEC6hUjc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The endgame content includes the instanced dungeons named Infiltration Operations and large boss raids called Void Intercept Battles. In the former, players can choose between normal and hard difficulty. The latter allows you to add extra challenge options called modifiers before starting the mission. The more challenge options you add, the more points you'll be able to earn for more rewards. There are 16 Infiltration Operations at launch.</p>
<p>In Void Intercept Battles, Descendants are tasked with defeating the massive Colossi bosses (who are equipped with unique attack patterns) by targeting weak points with unique strategies. This content is meant to be played cooperatively with up to four players, but it can also be completed solo. At launch, there are 16 bosses, including Executioner, Dead Bride, Devourer, Pyromaniac, Swamp Walker, Obstructer, Frost Walker, and Molten Fortress.</p>
<p>The main story was also revised following the community's feedback, making it more immersive. Descendants will now appear as NPCs (non-player characters) throughout the storyline. They will also have their own quests to better understand their personalities, starting with Bunny, whose quest is available at launch.</p>
<p>So far, a lot of players are checking out The First Descendant. NEXON's new game has reached Steam's Top 10 chart. As we are writing this article, the game is ranked #6 after Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, PUBG, and Banana, with around 217K players currently online,<a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> according to SteamDB</a>. However, user reviews are currently quite low: only 42% of the 5,349 reviews already posted recommend the game.</p>

<p>As a reminder, The First Descendant supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction), NVIDIA DLAA, and Reflex on PC. According to NVIDIA, the GeForce RTX 4090 can run at an average of 125 FPS at 4K (thanks to a 2.5X DLSS boost) with ray tracing enabled and Super Resolution set to Performance mode.</p>
<p>AMD users can activate AMD FSR 2.2 (although it should be updated to FSR 3 soon), and Intel XeSS 1.1 is also supported. Moreover, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdr10-gaming-debuts-with-the-first-descendant-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> HDR10+ displays. If you don't have a powerful enough PC, cloud streaming via GeForce is also available.</p>
<p>On consoles, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-descendant-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer</a> three graphic modes: Fidelity, Balanced, and Performance. Ray Tracing and AMD Frame Generation are also optionally available.</p>

<p>Surgent Studios, the studio behind Tales of Kenzera: Zau, is the latest developer to be hit with layoffs.</p>



<p>The news comes via multiple LinkedIn posts from, now former, employees at Surgent. </p>



<p>“Well, it looks like I’m joining all the people affected by industry layoffs this year,” technical artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jordan Smee said</a>.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, I have been affected by the layoffs at Surgent Studios,” 3D Environment Artist Joe Phillpot wrote.</p>



<p>Level designer Pete Brisbourne posted that, “The chapter entitled “Pete Works At Surgent Studios” is coming to a close at the end of the month.”</p>



<p>It’s unclear how many people at the studio are being let go. It’s also unclear as to why the layoffs are being made at this time.</p>



<p>Tales of Kenzera: Zau launched in April on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch. As of writing, the game has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tales-of-kenzera-zau/critic-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic score of 76</a> or generally favorable.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Surgent and studio founder Abubakar Salim for comment on the situation. Should we receive a response, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Some adjustments are made to conversion kits for various weapons in multiplayer. The JAK Jawbreaker conversion kit for the KV Broadside shotgun no longer blocks the JAK BFB muzzle attachment and it can now be equipped. The update also fixes incorrect iron sights and misaligned optics that previously happened after unequipping the JAK Requiem conversion kit for the Kastov 762 and Kastov 545 assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">Two changes are included for Zombies mode.

<p dir="ltr">Aptly titled "Silver Layered Necklace" in-game, the expensive bling's addition to the Ponsonby's catalogue has some players convinced the jewelry may have some sort of significance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Could be a stretch but whatever the price of that necklace is might mean something," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/comment/lb403xt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">one comment</a> on the post.

(The necklace's in-game price isn't shown in the post, but it likely goes for a little over $30,000, based on other items for sale in the store.)</p><p>In all likelihood, the necklace's addition to GTA Online's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-summer-update-introduces-diy-bounty-hunting-new-creator-tools/1100-6523963/">bounty-hunting update</a> is simply an Easter egg referencing GTA 6, but that hasn't stopped players from coming up with some pretty wild theories.

<p dir="ltr">"Descendants, from everyone on our development team we thank you sincerely for choosing to join us in the fight against The Vulgus," creative director Minseok Joo said in a recent press release. "Back when we first developed this concept in 2019, we set out to create a world inspired by some of our personal favorite looter shooters. The genre holds a special place in our hearts, and our development team has worked hard to create a game that we believe stands proudly among those prominent titles."</p><p dir="ltr">"With The First Descendant being our first global multi-platform launch, we wanted to develop something that allowed the voices of our players to be heard," producer Beomjun Lee added. "Our goal is not only to create a game that we are proud of, but also to create something our players will love and enjoy for a long time. We implemented many changes for launch based on the community's requests and we hope it makes the experience even more enjoyable."</p><p dir="ltr">The game's pre-season launch period has introduced a battle pass that includes three new playable Descendants: Esiemo, Enzo, and Yujin. The battle pass also gives players access to new weapons, Void Intercept Battles, and Instance Dungeons, along with other exclusive content.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking to the future, Nexon Games has announced plans to update the game five weeks after launch, though it's not immediately clear what that update will include. A second update, Season 1 Episode: Invasion, will arrive sometime in August, and will feature a new Descendant, new Colossus, new dungeon, and new weapon. According to Nexon, Season 1 Episode: Invasion will also dive deeper into the backstory of a "fan-favorite Descendant."</p><p>The First Descendant is currently available for free on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. For more information on Descendants, weapons, and the new battle pass, check out <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/main" rel="nofollow ">the game's official website</a>.</p>

This month continues that trend with some real bangers worth checking out if you are a subscriber. </p><p>Here’s the list of games coming to Game Pass over the next few weeks and which platforms they will be available on:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - July 3<br></li><li><strong><em>Nickelodeon All-Sta</em>r Brawl 2 </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 3</li><li>  <strong><em>Cricket 24</em></strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 9</li><li>  <strong><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 9</li><li>  <strong><em>Neon White</em> </strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 11</li><li>  <strong><em>Tchia</em> </strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – July 11</li><li>  <strong><em>Magical Delicacy </em></strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 16</li><li>  <strong><em>Flock </em></strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – July 16</li></ul><p>Some standouts this month include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-the-kotaku-review-1841220139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-the-kotaku-review-1841220139"><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></a></span>, which has a less-than-stellar name but is still a fun semi-open-world survival-action game about exploring an alien environment filled with weird creatures and colorful art. </p><div><p>I also loved <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-pc-nintendo-switch-annapurna-interactive-got-1849072088"><em>Neon White</em></a></span>, a first-person hyper-fast action platformer built around mastering short, gorgeous levels set in a fucked-up version of Heaven. </p><p>I haven’t played <em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em>, but it has a reputation for being one of the best detective games in recent years, so maybe I’ll finally take this opportunity to check it out.</p></div><p>And hey, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-new-characters-trailer-1850682210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-new-characters-trailer-1850682210"><em>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2</em></a></span><em> </em>might not be as good as <em>Smash Bros.</em> but it will be free on Game Pass on July 3 and might be a perfect party game to load up the next time you and your friends get together. You can all pick your favorite cartoon characters and beat the shit out of each other over the 4th of July. </p><p>But, as new games arrive, old games must leave as deals expire. According to Xbox, these are all the games leaving Game Pass on July 15:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly</em></strong>&nbsp;</li><li><em><strong>Figment 2: Creed Valley</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>TOEM</strong></em></li><li><strong><em>The Wandering Village</em>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>If you’re playing any of these titles, you need to finish them up soon. Or take advantage of the Game Pass discount and buy one or more of these games so you can play it forever. Or well, until Xbox decides to shut off the servers. So at least a decade or so. That seems like plenty of time to beat <em>Coffee Talk Episode 2.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Elden Bling. When you summon people, you always summon the people that aren’t wearing anything, and it’s like, ‘These people are fucking crazy.’”</p><p>As the interviewer points out, there’s a bit of a phenomenon around <em>Elden Ring</em> where players who really wanted to dial in on a particular fight would strip their characters down to their underwear. Headland—who’s very <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505">stoked about the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>expansion</a></span> throughout the conversation—responds affirmatively, sharing that, “Yeah, you have to go in with that offensive attitude, especially with those bosses. You can’t be getting back and panic rolling. You have to be aggressive with them. You have to roll <em>into</em> things.”</p><p>Headland is almost certainly taking inspiration from players like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-him-messmer-shadow-erdtree-1851563743">Let Me Solo Her</a></span>, who became a folk legend of sorts in the <em>Elden Ring </em>community.

However, much like Headland describes, they would only don two swords and their character’s underwear for the fight.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506"><strong>The Latest <em>Acolyte </em>Episode Is <em>Star Wars </em>At Its Most Sexy, Deadly</strong></a></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Even Qimir’s lone bit of armor, a strangely fashioned helmet seemingly bearing a sinister smile, seems to lift from the fact that Let Me Solo Her’s only real armor—if you’d even call it that—is a jar on his head.</p><p>This design ethos not only guided Qimir’s relatively lax clothing, but also seems to have defined Jacinto’s approach to the character’s body language and confidence. As Headland puts it, “I was like, ‘Why would you wear armor if you’re not going to get hit?’”</p><p>When we think of a Sith, we think of someone kind of stuffy, who dons either big black robes (Palpatine) or has heavy black armor (a la Darth Vader). The prevailing image is certainly not a smarmy slut of a man showing off how toned he is and who flows through a fight with the swagger of a dude who could pull anyone he wants.</p><p>Qimir reveals himself to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NklTiHYiK38&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NklTiHYiK38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most efficient fighter in the sequence</a></span>, showing off what an imposing figure he can be, and why he makes such a striking Sith. He disables Jedi’s lightsabers left and right, and dispatches with numerous warriors without breaking a sweat. He’s got this brazen brutality as he cuts down person after person that’s reminiscent of Vader’s famous hallway massacre in <em>A New Hope</em>. In Headland’s own words, he’s “aggressive” and “roll[s] into things.” Yet when he speaks, he talks in a relaxed cadence, and doesn’t parrot platitudes about darkness—rather freedom. It’s a chilling dichotomy, and it works. Speaking of freedom, you know what Jacinto is free to do? Call me!</p><p>I’d say that stripping Jacinto down for Qimir’s portrayal has absolutely worked. It’s not just that he’s hot as hell, though that certainly helps. His interpretation of a Sith is just so bare and unburdened, that it’s refreshing to see. Now, everyone say thank you to <em>Elden Ring</em>, Let Me Solo Her, and Leslye Headland.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since the December 2023 release of GTA 6 Trailer 1, as it’s called, information-hungry fans have analyzed the trailer to within an inch of its life, coming up with all sorts of outlandish theories and predictions about what to expect when Rockstar finally releases the game next year.</p><p>Now, though, they have something tangible to work with, something more than speculation to chew on: a necklace.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1dsoqum/noticed_a_small_detail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor DogWifDreads signaled</a>, the latest <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> update, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-5/GTA_Online_Bottom_Dollar_Bounties_Update">Bottom Dollar Bounties</a>, appears to have added the necklace worn by perhaps the standout character from the GTA 6 trailer: the woman in the bikini. Comparing a screenshot of the character from the trailer to the silver layered necklace now available to buy in GTA Online, DogWifDreads sent the GTA community on high alert.</p><p>“Dunno if anyone else has caught this but I was rewatching a trailer breakdown and I noticed that the necklaces seen here in the trailer have been added in GTAO with the Bottom Dollar Bounties DLC,” DogWifDreads said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/07/gta6-trailer-4k-00-00-38-29-still001-1701962524689.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/02/screenshot-2024-07-02-155847-1719932343759.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: DogWifDreads / reddit / Rockstar Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>There’s nothing new to be gleaned from this apparent crossover, but that hasn’t stopped people from trying to find some meaning in it. “Could be a stretch but whatever the price of that necklace is might mean something,” suggested Affectionate-Wing771. “Considering all last digits are 0, we could skip that and we'll have four digits, a possible date and month - for something,” OtteLoc wondered, in full GTA theory meme mode. “Or it could just be another generic price like the rest of the items.”</p><p>Most people are taking this as what it probably is: a fun nod to GTA 6 in GTA Online. But that kind of sensible behavior is no fun at all, is it? I suppose it does bring to mind the tough questions Rockstar faces in dealing with the current GTA Online community with the GTA 6 version waiting in the wings. GTA Online is a part of GTA 5, but how will GTA 6's version of GTA Online be made available? Will it be sold standalone? Free-to-download? A part of GTA 6 at a $70+ price point? And what happens to GTA 5's GTA Online when GTA 6 comes out?
