            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Even though we've just entered a new era of Nintendo of America, Reggie Fils-Aimé is still <em>the</em> name most people associate with the role. And, speaking at this weekend's New York Game Awards, the former NoA president shared a little tidbit about his time early on in his career at Nintendo (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/only-a-week-into-his-job-nintendo-legend-reggie-fils-aime-had-to-deal-with-retailers-upset-there-werent-enough-copies-of-pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire-i-never-let-that-happen-ever-again/">Gamesradar+</a>!)</p>
<p>Just a week into his role as executive vice president of sales, Reggie had to deal with an issue surrounding one of Nintendo's biggest names — <strong>Pokémon</strong>, specifically the first GBA titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>.</p>
<p>He didn't bring this up by coincidence — Reggie was at the ceremony presenting the Andrew Yoon Legend Award to the franchise. And it's here where he brought up his first professional brush with the series which he says he "had a long history with Pokémon when I was at Nintendo."</p>
<p>Kicking off, Reggie told the audience about his first week at Nintendo in 2003: "I has just joined the company and [was] there for only about a week when I had to work with our retail partners because they literally did not have enough copies of Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Emerald [note: Reggie probably means Sapphire as Emerald launched in the West in 2005] for the Christmas rush."</p>
<p>Reggie recalls that retailer were understandably "a little upset", and given the huge popularity of the series even then, that's pretty understandable. It was an early test, and lesson, for the then-new exec, who said that "I never let that happen ever again."</p>
<figure data-uuid="74299cdf66f71"><a title="Pokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74299cdf66f71/pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2wqNVnh2OE">The Pokémon Company</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reggie concluded his speech with this, before rolling a heartfelt clip from industry members sharing their memories of the series: "I always enjoyed working with The Pokémon Company and I loved all of their games — even the Pokémon Plus controller [the Poké Ball Plus] with the Mew inside, remember that? One of my favourites."</p>
<p>So, perhaps not the best start, but at least it allowed Reggie to make things right quickly <em>and</em> improve relations between Nintendo and TPC. So, all in all, a valuable moment in his career.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Research Firm Predicts a “Global Price Hike” for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026 Driven by Tariffs, Memory Costs, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/</link>
            <guid>1410997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://nikopartners.com/">Niko Partners</a></strong>, a research firm that provides global data analysis and insights into the video game industry in five regions, namely China, East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), has published its <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/"><strong>2026 predictions</strong> report</a>, with 10 trends for consumers to be aware of, and it's not good news for anyone who has held off on buying a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Namely because Niko believes that the best time to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 is: right now, before <strong>Nintendo issues a "<em>global price hike</em>" for the new hybrid device</strong>. According to the research firm, at some point in 2026, the added weight of "<em>tariffs, increased memory costs, and broader macroeconomic conditions</em>" will drive a global price hike for the console, with Nintendo following in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> </a>footsteps after both companies increased the prices of their consoles post-launch.</p>



<p>Niko's prediction doesn't include an exact price consumers should expect, but it does add that the Mario company "<em>may opt to discontinue the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or higher bundle SKU instead</em>," which would mean we'd see at least a <strong>$50</strong> price increase.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the latest word from Nintendo on a potential Switch 2 price increase came from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/">recent interview with Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>,</a> who simply said that the company "<em>must monitor the situation closely</em>." Before that, back in November 2025, Furukawa told shareholders that the company expects the price of the Switch 2 to remain where it is,<em> </em><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><em>"unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 was unveiled on the same day the current US government announced its new tariffs back in <strong>April 2025</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">concerns of a Switch 2 price increase have been sky-high.</a> It didn't help that Nintendo had to pause pre-orders and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/">follow the flow of news regarding where the tariff negotiations were going before it could lock in a price</a>. Or that when pre-orders were finally back on, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/"><strong>the price of Switch 2 accessories had already increased</strong> compared to what they were initially meant to be</a>.</p>



<p>Even though the price of the Switch 2 has remained the same, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">we've had multiple warnings</a> that the price could go up, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs being cited as a potential cause more than once</a>. Now, adding in the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage situation</a></strong> (even if <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">consumers reportedly have the narrative around the shortages wrong</a></strong>), the fact remains that a price hike for the Nintendo Switch 2 feels more like a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.</p>



<p>With all that said, this report doesn't factor in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-been-leaky-maybe-they-need-a-plumber-new-potential-nintendo-switch-2-model-discovered-on-official-website/">recent rumours of a <strong>Switch 2 Lite</strong> model</a> potentially arriving soon, which could offer a happy medium for people who want to grab a Switch 2 but don't want to pay its current $449 price. So long as Nintendo doesn't increase the price of the Switch 2 to $499 and release a Switch 2 Lite at $449. </p>

However, they’re fairly affordable to upgrade to today thanks to a deal on <strong>Corsair’s Vanguard Pro 96</strong>, which is cheaper than ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKHPRZ45/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fcorsair-vanguard-pro-96-rgb-wired-magnetic-mgx-linear-hall-effect-96-gaming-keyboard-with-flashtap-socd-rapid-trigger-black%2FJ39TSCPZC5%2Fsku%2F6637498" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, selling for $159.99 (originally $229.99).

And, you know what? I can see some similarities between it and the Vanguard Pro 96, despite the underlying switch tech being different. The Vanguard has a rotary dial, an info-dense LCD screen, nice aluminum housing for the keyboard, plus a magnetic-attaching wrist rest that’s plush and looks sophisticated. It has six programmable macro keys along the leftmost edge, and you can customize its settings through Corsair’s web app. If you want customizable switches, the Vanguard is the better keyboard to buy.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals-to-get-your-tuesday-started"><h2>Other <em>Verge</em>-approved deals to get your Tuesday started</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Perhaps you already know you’re going to dive into <em><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></em> on launch day.

The game will launch for $69.99, but you can nab a digital key to add to your Steam library for $57.39. <em>Requiem </em>is the next mainline entry in the franchise, giving players the ability to toggle between first-person and third-person perspective at will.

            <title><![CDATA[SNL’s Stranger Things Skit Stokes The Flames Of A Dying Fan Fire]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307</link>
            <guid>1410985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> actor Finn Wolfhard hosted </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> over the weekend, and given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>online shitshow that’s transpired</span></a><span> since Netflix’s horror series wrapped up last month, the sketch comedy show had a lot of material to work with. Like most episodes of </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>, this one had its assortment of</span> <span>hits and misses, but particularly noteworthy was its </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>spoof, which touched on the backlash that has sprung up in the wake of the finale and mentioned the widespread Conformity Gate conspiracy theory which proposed the existence of a secret, “better” ending to the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Wolfhard’s monologue may not have touched on the backlash </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season has received online, but it has come under some fire for some low-hanging misogynistic jokes. The former child actor talks about growing up on the Netflix show over the past decade, and says the first time he learned what a woman looked like “down there” was captured on camera during the show. We then cut to a clip of his character Mike seeing a Demogorgon open its monstrous jaws. You get it? Vaginas are scary! Like a flesh-eating monster!</span></p>

  <p><span>Thankfully the show’s actual </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>skit fared better, envisioning Netflix milking the series into multiple spin-offs, including a </span><i><span>Sex and the City </span></i><span>parody starring Wolfhard’s character as a writer in ‘90s New York City. However, it too has come under fire for what some are calling a tasteless joke about Lucas’ future sex life with partner Max, who now “just lies there like she’s back in that coma,” a reference to her character being in a coma during the show.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the skit’s joke about Will’s infamous coming-out scene in season 5, which fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>said was sweet but a bit hokey and longwinded</span></a><span>, has gotten an absurd bad-faith response from some viewers. </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>’s skit jokes that Will isn’t getting a spin-off because this coming-out scene is still going on. The choice to poke fun at the scene has been </span><a href="https://x.com/w1llb1yers/status/2012864726955380789?s=20"><span>deemed homophobic</span></a><span>, to which I say, making fun of the scene’s notorious length is not the same as making a joke at the expense of gay people.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real joke of note is the skit’s direct reference to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Conformity Gate conspiracy</span></a><span> which posits that a secret ninth episode that will “fix” the divisive finale is on the way. Wolfhard and two of his co-stars reunite on a mountaintop in Iceland, and Wolfhard exclaims that “everything we thought happened was an illusion that was planted by Vecna.” When asked for “one good reason” why they should believe him, Wolfhard responds, “How about eleven?” at which point Kenan Thompson steps in for Millie Bobbie Brown, holding an Eggo waffle and spouting gibberish.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the </span><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>episode has come and gone, the Duffer Brothers were in attendance, and some </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans unhappy with the ending </span><a href="https://x.com/bylerhughes/status/2012800392644436357?s=20"><span>heckled them in public</span></a><span> as they were leaving the venue.</span></p> <p><span>The Conformity Gate conspiracy has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>mostly died down at this point</span></a><span>, though some true believers are moving the goalpost and saying that it might still be coming. While some cast members have been hesitant to comment on it directly, actor Joe Keery has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcradio1/video/7595593028492856598"><span>flatly denied that any such episode exists</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Office 2024 Lifetime License Hits Its Lowest Price of the Year With 60% Off, No Subscription Required for Mac or PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-office-2024-lifetime-license-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-with-60-off-no-subscription-required-for-mac-or-pc-2000661036</link>
            <guid>1410982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft Office suite comes packed with all the apps you need to work, study, and handle everyday tasks more efficiently. To get started with these, you must buy a separate license, which normally ranges from $100-$150 for the Home version, and up to $250 for the Home and Business option.</p>
<p>Those shopping for one today – we’ve got great news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/">You can now grab a lifetime license of Home and Business Microsoft Office 2024 at a 60% discount at StackSocial, which brings its price down to just $100.</a> The Home version is discounted too, going for $120, down from $150, after a modest 20% drop. Both of these are one-time purchases that give you access to all the essential tools. Note that this version does not include the services offered with a Microsoft 365 subscription or upgrade to future releases.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Essential Apps</h2>
<p>Once you complete your purchase on StackSocial, you’ll receive a redemption code via email. The code is valid immediately after your purchase and must be redeemed within seven days, after which it expires. There are some browser and operating system requirements to keep in mind. As for compatibility, the license works with Windows Internet Explorer 11 or newer, Mozilla Firefox 12 or newer, Apple Safari 5 or newer, Google Chrome 18 or newer, and Microsoft Edge. Operating system requirements are straightforward and shouldn’t be an issue with most modern PCs and laptops. Still, we recommend going through the complete list once before you make your purchase, just to be safe.</p>
<p>The subscription gets you access to classic apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more. Create assignments using Word, make presentations on PowerPoint, and work on boring spreadsheets with Excel. There’s Outlook to manage emails and create schedules, plus OneNote that serves as a digital notebook for organizing and sharing notes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the 2024 version of Office offers significant improvements over Office 2021. These include superior performance and better speed, which lets you handle larger datasets and juggle multiple tasks at the same time without slowing down. You can now record presentations on PowerPoint with voice narration, and even ensure your emails meet accessibility standards in Outlook before sending them. What’s more, the interface across all Office applications is more unified, and the improved touch and pen input make it easier to stay productive during busy days.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the experience even further. Office 2024 uses the power of artificial intelligence to offer smart suggestions for text, formatting, and design elements. You can use it to summarize text, translate content in real time, create charts, manage data better, and more. So, whether you need to write a lengthy research paper or create digital notebooks for each of your projects, Office 2024 makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6790/">You can now grab the Home and Business version for $100, while the Home version is sitting at $120</a>. Considering how the former offers more for less price, we highly recommend considering that over the standard Home option. It’s best to act fast, though.

              <p>Xbox Game Pass kicked off 2026 with a couple of huge games in its opening crop for the new year, offering both <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em> among eight other games. The latter part of this month seems equally stacked, with the announcement that by the end of January we’ll also have&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em>.</p> <p>Obviously the sheen really has come off Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">last few years of bungled reshuffling</a> of tiers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">outrageous price hikes</a>, but if you&nbsp;<em>can</em> still afford the monthly sub, it’s at least been a decent investment this January. Joining the 10 games that were already added so far are another seven, along with two more sneaking in at the very start of February. And it’s a fantastic mix.</p>

 <p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> is being added tomorrow, January 21, alongside PC-only road repair sim <em>RoadCraft</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265">last year’s stunning 2D platformer</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>. Then, nearly a week later, we get the mindblowingly clever <em>The Talos Principle 2</em>, followed by 2022’s ok-ish&nbsp;<em>ANNO: Mutationem</em>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-clair-baldurs-duchy-savage-planet-1851780035/4">rather splendid</a> 2025 indie mix of city builder and&nbsp;<em>Tetris</em>,&nbsp;<em>Drop Duchy</em>. Then comes whatever&nbsp;<em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> might be, before a massive finish to the month with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029">glorious&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em></a>.</p> <p>For some reason a couple of February releases have been included too. These are <em>Indika</em>, 2024’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861">intriguing exploration of religious trauma</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy II</em> in its revamped 2D pixel form.</p> <p>Here’s the full list:</p>  <ul> <li><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> <li><em>RoadCraft</em> (PC)</li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 27</h2> <ul> <li><em>The Talos Principle</em> (PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>January 28</h2> <ul> <li><em>Anno: Mutationem</em> (Cloud, PC, Console)</li> <li><em>Drop Duchy</em> (Cloud, PC, Console)</li> </ul> <h2>January 29</h2> <ul> <li><em>MySims: Cozy Bundle</em> (PC)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine II</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>February 2</h2> <ul> <li><em>Indika</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul> <h2>February 3</h2> <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy II</em> (Cloud, PC, Xbox Series)</li> </ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Highguard on PlayStation 5 & Xbox Series X|S? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-platforms-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s/</link>
            <guid>1410976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The year ahead promises to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 stacked full of big releases, and Highguard is among the major names landing this year, though there has been some confusion about the platform availability.</p>



<p>Revealed at The Game Awards, Highguard is set to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on January 26</a>, though the build-up has gone under the radar for many players due to an eerie radio silence from the developer.</p>



<p>Expect that to change in the final days before release, however, and if you want to know which platforms Highguard is available on, Insider Gaming has the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-playstation-5">Is Highguard on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Combat ready. Image via Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Highguard is available on PlayStation 5, as the title from the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall is releasing the game across all major platforms.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation 5 is, naturally, among those platforms, and, similarly to other games in the genre, crossplay will allow you to play with friends and other players across various platforms.</p>



<p>Uncertainty over the title being available on PlayStation stems from a very quiet build-up to the game, with pre-ordering and wishlisting for the title not available, apart from the latter on Steam.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-xbox-series-x-s">Is Highguard on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, just like PlayStation 5, Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S at launch, allowing players on the platform to join the new title at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Similar to the PlayStation confusion, the quiet approach to promotion on Highguard has led to some queries on what platforms exactly the game will be released on, with details scarce following the initial trailer.</p>



<p>However, that trailer, albeit briefly, confirmed Highguard will be available on Xbox Series X|S, so fear not if you’re active on either console, as the game will be available.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-highguard-on-pc">Is Highguard on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>Highguard will be playable on PC, and, in fact, Steam is the only place in the build-up to the launch where you can wishlist the title.</strong></p>



<p>While store listings have been absent on other platforms, the Steam listing for Highguard has been live since the unveil, and you can add the game to your wishlist so you don’t forget exactly when it drops.</p>



<p>If you play on PC, you won’t be locked out of playing with those on other platforms, as the game will feature full crossplay support.</p>

<p>Do you have high expectations for Highguard? Share your thoughts on the upcoming release in the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>



<p>For more Highguard, read how the developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t pay for a spot in The Game Awards finale</a>, and find out why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some gamers fear the title could be dead on arrival.</a></p>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to get a regular slew of updates and, following on from the major South Park collab introduced earlier this month, a new game mode, dubbed Pimlico, is set to be added.</p>



<p>Regular content drops in Fortnite often include new game modes, ranging from permanent additions, like Fortnite OG and LEGO Fortnite, to temporary modes, including the recently departed Delulu.</p>



<p>Pimlico is the latest mode set to be added to Fortnite, and Insider Gaming has details on everything we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-pimlico-in-fortnite">What is Pimlico in Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pimlico is a new game mode coming to Fortnite that ties in with another Epic Games title, Fall Guys, but the full details are scarce.</strong></p>



<p>A full reveal of the Pimlico game mode is set to be made on January 21, so this article will be updated with official details as soon as possible, but there are some intriguing leaks that have emerged.</p>



<p>Teasers <a href="https://x.com/Stentric/status/2013627583036821808]" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X by Stentric</a> showed Fall Guys characters dressed as birds, with one holding a basketball-like object, with the caption ‘Why Fall when you can Ball?’ Suggesting that the new mode could be a mixture of sports game in a similar style to Fall Guys, which will be playable through Fortnite.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1982167577603244498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">October</a>, leakers first revealed the Pimlico mode, said to be in collaboration with Warner Bros, which incidentally coincides with the upcoming addition of Warner Bros’ skins in Fortnite, with the likes of Bugs Bunny, Lola Bunny, and Daffy Duck rumored to be landing in the near future.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-pimlico-released-in-fortnite">When is Pimlico Released in Fortnite?</h2>



<p><strong>No release date has been confirmed for the arrival of the Pimlico mode in Fortnite, but it’s widely expected to land on the date of the game’s next update.</strong></p>



<p>Thursday, January 22, is the next patch day for Fortnite, bringing additional content into the game, and the addition of the new mode is a big one after the exit of Delulu this week.</p>



<p>A full reveal of the mode will take place on Wednesday, January 21, unveiling exactly what players can expect, and there’s sure to be a slew of new information.</p>

            <p>Developer 1047 Games will add an Arena Royale mode to Splitgate Arena Reloaded later this week.</p>
<p>Arena Royale allows 24 players to team into six groups of four, and is "built to play at a similar pace and length to a traditional arena match". With this mode, as long as at least one member in a team remains alive, the rest of the squad is able to respawn. Well, at least until the final circle. When that arrives, the respawns end, "and it's all about survival". Ooh.</p>

<p>Arena Royale will allow for a better flow of action when it goes live on 22nd January, 1047 says, while also reducing downtime "significantly".</p>
<p>"Matches take place within a single biome," it explains, "keeping the experience tight and focused. This allows Arena Royale to emphasise constant action, fast fights, and moment-to-moment decision making rather than long stretches of setup or traversal. The result is a faster, cleaner take on battle royale that still feels unmistakably Splitgate."</p><p>Alongside the new mode, Splitgate Arena Reloaded's forthcoming update also adds two new maps, known as Trihard and Runway. Trihard takes players to the clouds, while Runway is set in a neon cityscape "inspired by the energy and density of Shinjuku". There's also a new endgame mastery camo on the cards, as well as a limited-time event - Teabag Takeover. Yes, that's actually what it's called, and yes, it's what you think it is.</p>
<p>"This new Limited Event is a celebration of a long-forgotten sign of respect. Some might even call it an elegant greeting, for a more civilised age," 1047 says. So, basically, players jump into matches and "teabag their opponents to earn points toward unlocking new teabag themed rewards".</p>
<p>Teabag Takeover arrives 23rd January. In the meantime, you can find more details about Splitgate Arena Reloaded's update in the video below.</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2, but after the sequel failed to hit the mark, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 took it back into beta last July</a>, resulting in a number of layoffs at the studio. In November, it announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-take-two-coming-next-month-as-1047-games-announces-relaunch-for-its-free-to-play-shooter">Splitgate 2 would relaunch in December</a>, and it arrived with its new name, Splitgate Arena Reloaded.</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">player numbers on Steam haven't been <em>great</em></a>, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-charts-dont-measure-fun-splitgate-arena-reloaded-developer-responds-to-concerning-pc-launch-numbers">developer has said these charts "don't measure fun"</a>.</p>

<p>Announced via a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">blog post</a>, you'll be able to carry over key progression across all relevant platforms, provided of course you actually own the game on multiple systems. This includes player level, unlocks, location mastery, campaign story progress, and more.</p>
<p>You'll need to ensure that you have an IOI Account and are signed into it on all relevant platforms to enable cross-progression. IO Interactive had included a <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full guide</a> on the steps and process necessary to achieve this.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_evSaRNgyaU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3luwhpm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>For now, here's the full list of everything included in cross-progression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Experience<br>
- Player Level<br>
- Challenges<br>
- Location Mastery<br>
- Unlocks and Inventory<br>
- Achievements / Trophies<br>
- Freelancer Mode Progression<br>
- Campaign Story Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course, just to be crystal clear, here's what <strong>won't</strong> be included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Game license<br>
- DLC license<br>
- DLC-based unlocks<br>
- Leaderboard scores<br>
- Save Games (offline and online)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Our review</a> for the Switch 2 release of World of Assassination was largely positive, though we did take issue with the inconsistent performance on Nintendo's new console. Thankfully, IO Interactive has since introduced a new patch to lock the frame rate at 30fps, resulting in a more stable, enjoyable experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Erenshor</em>, described by developer and publisher Burgee Media as a "single-player simulated MMORPG", is getting a brand new update, and it's got a new class, a guild system, and more for you to try out.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, the game's new Rising Shadows update is coming on February 2nd. One of its main new features is the Reaver, a melee class that can fulfil tank, DPS, and utility roles thanks to its stance system. It's not dissimilar to <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s Death Knight.</p><p>You can also look forward to a guild system that lets you create and join guilds, which Burgee Media says will add "a new layer of identity and progression" to <em>Erenshor</em>'s simulated MMO world.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're more of a solitary type, then you can take solace in the new Reliquary, a player space that you can decorate and customize using "found, crafted, and quest-earned statues", as well as "shrines, buffs, and other objects".</p><p>You can also use the Reliquary as a basis for fast travel, storing portal runes within it so you can move between locations and your home base with ease. Not only that, but you can summon your in-game friends to your Reliquary, as well as hosting auction houses, shops, and banks.</p><p>The new update also introduces a host of SimPlayer improvements, making <em>Erenshor</em>'s inhabitants feel even more lifelike, as well as new GM entities that will request you follow in-game rules if you find yourself feeling a little roguish.</p><p>All of this is in addition to lots of quality-of-life improvements that should make your experience in <em>Erenshor </em>feel that much smoother. If you're feeling like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fellowship-preview-familiar-yet-fresh-take-on-mmo-dungeons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c9e90e9-ffd4-4c64-91cc-0b15cda9f07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship</em></a><em> </em>is just a little too crowded, this one might be for you.</p>
<p><em>Erenshor </em>is a "single-player MMORPG" that aims to recreate the feeling of a classic MMO, only without the online multiplayer component.</p><p>It does so through technology Burgee calls SimPlayers, which, despite what you might think, aren't based on LLMs; instead, they use "a mixture of state machines and decision trees" to simulate real MMO players convincingly.</p><p>In essence, Burgee's goal is to build a living, breathing environment full of the same sort of things you'd find in a regular MMO, namely cities full of NPCs (and "players"), dungeons, lore to discover, and more.</p><p>If you'd like to see how successful Burgee has been at replicating that experience, you can check out <em>Erenshor </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2382520/Erenshor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>If you've been waiting to bless one of your friends with an entire dump truck worth of games in a series they've enjoyed one entry of, then good news. Valve have made Steam's 'complete the set' bundles giftable, with prices adjusting to match whichever bits the recipient might already own - so you're not in danger of hurling someone their second copy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> on one storefront.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The steamywatchers over at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3mctvj67hwf27">SteamDB</a> were  the first to spot that this sort of bundle gifting's now allowed. I've given it a quick test that involved momentarily holding the nearly £120 Fallout series bundle over the heads of several Steam friends.</p>
<p>You'll be glad to hear that the price changed in relation to the games in the bundle they already owned, just as happens if you go to buy one of these bundles for your own account. For one friend, I'd be playing somewhere in the region of £87 for the bits required to totally drown them in rads, while another would set me back only £71. That is, of course still wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much to pay to make sure someone owns both Fallout Tactics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s extra fishing gear, but hey, maybe next time the sale rolls around.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a handy feature for Steam to offer. Not being able to dump all of the Yakuza/Like A Dragons on your mum at Christmas, alongside an email linking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">this article</a> ain't right. Now, to wait a full year for the opportunity to do it.</p><p>In other recent Steam-related news, Valve have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-no-longer-earn-steam-points-from-community-awards-as-valve-try-to-kill-off-clownface-farming">revamped their community award emojis</a> in an effort to stop people deliberately writing anger-inducing and clown sticker-attracting posts in order to earn Steam points they can spend on fancy profile backgrounds. I'm sure it'll work and I'll soon be able to read a discussion thread or review section without the risk of rolling my eyes so hard they plop out onto my desk.</p>

            <guid>1410922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to create content with your phone, there are some great options to help you better the way it looks and sounds. That includes a gimbal to make sure your picture stays static even when your phone or your subject is moving around. Case in point: The DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">If you’re interested in grabbing your own DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer, head to Amazon where you can get it for just $126, which is a $23 or 15% discount from the regular retail price of $149.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A stabilizing gadget to help improve your mobile photos and video</h2>
<p>This gadget is designed to produce smooth video and professional-looking results. It has AI-powered subject tracking (for subjects such as people and pets), and additional features like built-in light support and audio pickup. It even has 360-degree pan rotation for more creative movements, an extension rod and integrated tripod for transitioning between handheld shots and stationary shots without the need to swap equipment, and a stated 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The gimbal itself weighs approximately 13.1 ounces and the handle has been designed to fit comfortably in the user’s hand for extended periods of time. It even includes an extension rod to create space for a wider view for framing groups, overhead shots, etc.</p>



<p>Stabilization using robust 3-axis gimbal technology is the key to providing you with stabilized video footage when moving the gimbal around. The motors on the gimbal will adjust to your hand movements resulting in smoother footage than what would be produced by in-phone stabilization. Plus, its unlimited 360-degree horizontal pan allows for options to capture wrap-around movements and panoramic sweeps. The gimbal has features such as Timelapse, Motionlapse, Hyperlapse, and multiple panorama modes, which provide users with the ability to creatively compress time or stitch together large areas with minimal manual setup.</p>
<p>Tracking with audio and lighting is accomplished natively through the inclusion of the DJI OM Multifunctional Module, which brings several tools into one unit. The module can track individuals and pets, receive audio, and integrate with external light support to ensure your subject remains visible and well-lit.</p>
<p>Overall, this handheld gimbal works hard to deliver more stable footage, improved framing, and smoother movement for the photos and video you take on your phone. It accomplishes that with three-axis stabilization, unlimited 360-degree panning, the extension rod and tripod, and the Multifunctional Module.</p>
<p>For this price, and considering the fact that it’s often hard to find DJI products anymore, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">this a purchase you’re going to want to jump on right now before it’s out of stock again</a>. Be sure to grab yours fast.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-season-1-january-27-bonus-content-frostfire-bonus-path-more/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 launched to high praise back in late 2025, and before long, Season 1 kicked off the live-service model for the title. Just as fans were beginning to get excited for Season 2, though, EA broke some very sour news—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 had been delayed</a>. </p>



<p>Instead of a new Season kicking off on January 20, it was revealed that Season 2 had been pushed back to February 17, leaving three weeks devoid of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>. Luckily for fans, EA has revealed its short-term plans to fill the gap with the Frostfire Bonus Path.</p>







<p>If you’re still playing Battlefield 6 and eager for new content, check out what’s in store while you wait for Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-frostfire-bonus-path-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Frostfire Bonus Path In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content isn’t too far off. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Frostfire Bonus Path is a new pathway of rewards coming alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, launching on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>At this moment in time, the full Bonus Path hasn’t been shared online, but some details have been made available. Rewards will range from a new Weapon Package and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-fans-art-copy-call-of-duty-ghosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soldier Skin</a> to various XP Boosts.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not all of it will come for free. EA have confirmed that some content will require the purchase of the Season 1 Battle Pass. Here are some of the upcoming Frostfire Bonus Path content broken down into free and paid rewards.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Free Rewards</th><th data-align="center">Paid Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Hardware XP Boost</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Package</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Skin</td><td data-align="center">Career XP Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Playercard Customization Items</td><td data-align="center">Additional Customization Items</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-are-rewards-unlocked-on-the-frostfire-bonus-path-in-battlefield-6">How Are Rewards Unlocked On The Frostfire Bonus Path In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully more maps are on the horizon. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rewards on the Frostfire Bonus Path are unlocked with Bonus Path Points; these are earned by completing Weekly Challenges.</strong></p>



<p>The Frostfire Bonus Path can be completed alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you won’t need to choose to make progress between the prior paths and the new one. To make progress through the Bonus Path, though, you’ll need Bonus Path Points, with every ten unlocking a new reward.</p>







<p>Weekly Challenges are the source of these points, but the amount of points varies depending on the difficulty of the challenge. That being said, not all Weekly Challenges reward Bonus Path Points, so be sure to check the in-game Challenges menu for more detailed information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Concept artwork for Microsoft's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a> reboot has been shared online, showing what looks to be a large open world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The images, originally highlighted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a>, reportedly originate from an unnamed artist who previously worked on the project at British development studio Playground Games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than two dozen images show brooding fantasy landscapes that stretch off into the horizon, dilapidated thatched cottages in pastoral scenes, and familiar-looking towns with spired roofs. Several images also make reference to "Bloodstone" — suggesting we'll see locations from past Fable games return.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the images offer a slightly darker color palette than seen in Lionhead's original Fable trilogy, with moody skies and a rugged world that's reminiscent of Hogwarts Legacy. How big is Fable's new world? That remains to be seen, though perhaps it featuring large open spaces shouldn't be too surprising, since it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-is-being-developed-using-the-forza-engine">being built on the same open world engine that powers Forza Horizon</a> (albeit likely with fewer cars).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another set of art showcases a dank dungeon-like area, where water pours down through sewer-like tunnels as cages hang above. One particular image sees the hero confront a werewolf-like creature, as bodies hang in chains nearby.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While concept art naturally shows a work-in-progress look at a project, this werewolf encounter has popped up in a previous trailer. The hero figure used throughout the concept art also matches the character seen in trailers released over the last couple of years. The suggestion, then, is this vision of the game likely isn't too far off the finished article — though of course we'll be seeing much more of it later this week to find out for ourselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's annual Xbox Developer Direct showcase will air this Thursday, January 22 at 10am PT, and include gameplay footage of Playground Games' long-awaited new take on Fable, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, Game Freak action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beast-of-reincarnation">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, and more.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As we prepare for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, set to finally launch in May, and celebrate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-all-time-classic">Hitman 3's five-year anniversary</a>, we've received news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> is, at long last, getting cross-progression support.</p>
<p>We figured this would happen at some point, especially after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port and with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hitman/new-game-after-world-of-assassination-co-op">more content set to arrive this year</a>, but with all eyes on James Bond's game right now, it was hard to predict its arrival. Today, 20th January, <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">IOI confirmed</a> the feature will be available starting 3rd February. Additionally, a "brand-new, fresh look launches today" for the IOI Account service on browsers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full cross-progression guide</a> with FAQ was shared, but the gist of the news is that players will be able to take their Hitman: WoA (the combination of Hitman 1, 2, and 3 under a single roof) progress with them no matter what device they play on. For example, you could launch your PC save on the PS5 in your living room and later continue your killing sprees on the go with the Switch 2 version... as long as you have access to an online connection.</p>
<p>IOI also revealed that a Steam patch (3.250.1) will be arriving next week, which will ensure everything is working for the new cross-progression functionality. Players will have to select, after logging on their IOI Account, a "primary platform" the other devices will follow. Game licences, DLC purchases, and unlocks tied to DLCs aren't shared, meaning you'll have to own all required content on each platform where you want to use cross-progression. That's how the feature has always worked, but it's good to remind the more casual crowd of its limitations.</p><p>On the matter of the saves themselves, IOI also notes "old save games created on a non-primary linked account will not be loadable while Cross-Progression is active." In summary, the system will only recognize saves tied to the IOI Account system, so we recommend making sure everything's properly updated and connected if you intend to embrace this feature.</p>
<p>As a footnote, IOI has also reminded players the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> to 3 "carryover" process will close come 3rd February so all progress is locked to the latest iteration of the three-part sandbox game. The company's approach to progression and upgrades has always been slightly too convoluted and often led to confusion, so it makes sense the devs are being extra careful ahead of this major feature drop.</p>
<p>If you're waiting for news on Hitman's future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-there-will-be-more-hitman-after-007-first-light-io-interactive-assures">IOI hasn't shied away from teasing there are plans in place</a>, but don't expect a reveal until World of Assassination's co-op mode and 007 First Light are out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Of Fallout 3 And New Vegas’ Most Ambitious Mods Won’t Get Ported To The Rumored Remasters]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284</link>
            <guid>1410871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, a mod that combines the world maps of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-director-sawyer-xbox-bethesda-1851620259"><i><span> Fallout 3 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i></a><span>, won’t be getting ported to (or otherwise remade for) those long-rumored remasters and remakes. One of the best ways to experience the wasteland will remain anchored to the older games..</span></p> <p><span>The existence of upcoming new versions of Bethesda’s</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> might be the worst-kept secret in gaming right now, much like </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </span></i><span>was prior to its release last year</span><span>. If this is the first you’re hearing of this, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><span>here’s </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s breakdown</span></a><span> of why everyone is so convinced that the remasters are on the way.</span></p>

 <p><span>The community is understandably excited, with said excitement at least partially fueled by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">success of <em>Fallout </em>season 2</a> </span><span>on Prime. But a remastered version of either game comes with the same potential headache as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-steam-mixed-review-ue5-stuttering-2000624074"><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></i></a><span> did</span><span>: a lack of support for close to two decades of mods.</span></p>  <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> is concerned, Bethesda </span><a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672"><span>outright confirmed</span></a><span> at release that “mods are not officially supported” for the game. This didn’t stop the modding community from </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/"><span>finding workarounds</span></a><span> for certain classic </span><i><span>Oblivion </span></i><span>mods, but the end result is clear: the original </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivion/mods"><span>2006 release</span></a><span> of the game has ten times the number of mods on popular mod distribution site Nexus Mods that </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=downloads"><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> has</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/01/19/161756.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span>, at least one huge total conversion mod for both </span><i><span>Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> won’t be making the jump to the current generation, as confirmed by the team behind </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>in their Discord server. Why? Because, understandably, producing a version of </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> that works with both remasters “would be a mammoth effort and would require an entire rebuild of the project.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Tale of Two Wastelands</em> feels like its own game</h2> <p><span>If you haven’t played </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span> for yourself, let me be the first to tell you that you really should. Merely describing it as a way to play through both games with a single character is massively underselling it, because it doesn’t just smoosh the Mojave and the Capital Wasteland together.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>overhauls both games in a way that makes the experience truly cohesive by completely rebalancing the game, altering the level cap and perks, and even restoring a bunch of cut content. It’s such a huge undertaking that it even has its own separate tag on Nexus, with over 1,200 support mods of its own. The </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> team aren’t exaggerating when </span><a href="https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/faq.html"><span>they describe the project</span></a><span> as its own “unique game.”</span></p> <p><span>Ever since I first tried <em>TTW </em>back in 2019, I haven’t returned to the standalone versions of either </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> or</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span>. It obviously sucks to hear that the project won’t be supported once the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remasters drop, even if it’s completely understandable. We can only hope that Bethesda makes a better effort to support legacy mods this time around, but, in the case of </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, we may have to make peace with the fact that some <em>Fallout</em> modding projects are simply too grand in scope to get ported to their remastered counterparts.</span></p>
