              <p><em>Bully Online,</em> a mod that added online multiplayer to Rockstar’s classic open-world game, is shutting down less than a month after launch. The creators haven’t explained why yet, but fans are already blaming Rockstar Games and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for the sudden demise of the project.</p> <p>Developed by Fat Pigeon, a collection of modders and fans, and led by <em>Bully</em> content creator Swegta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bully-online-mod-play-free-gta-online-release-pc-rockstar-2000639618"><em>Bully Online</em> took years to develop</a> and launched on PC on December 15. The mod added new content like mini-games, multiplayer activities, custom vehicles, and competitive racing. Fans were excited to check it out, especially as the original <em>Bully</em> didn’t include online multiplayer and Rockstar seems unwilling to make a sequel or remaster anytime soon. But now, not long after it was released, the mod is shutting down.</p>

  <p>On January 14, a message was posted to the official <em>Bully Online</em> Discord server announcing that the mod will be shut down “forever”&nbsp; in 24 hours. According to the Discord announcement, <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964/photo/1">as seen in a message shared by TheNathanNS on Twitter,</a> the devs are stopping development of new content and scripts for the mod, removing the source code from the main site, and deleting any webpages connected to the mod, as well as wiping all account data connected to the project. The modders say players can hop on and enjoy <em>Bully Online</em> for the next 24 hours until the servers are completely wiped and deleted for good.</p>

 <h2>Why is <em>Bully Online</em> shutting down?</h2> <p>As for why <em>Bully Online</em> is being killed, nobody involved has provided a clear answer. On Discord, the announcement does make it clear that this wasn’t what the modders had planned, saying, “For now though, know this was not something we wanted.” The messages also promise that Swegta will be posting a video in the near future explaining more.</p>

 <p>Many fans are already blaming Rockstar and/or Take-Two Interactive, companies that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ambitious-gta-underground-mod-shutdowns-after-six-years-1847619249">have a long track record</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-is-removing-old-gta-mods-using-dmca-notices-1847315391">screwing with</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-sues-gta-reverse-engineering-project-1847613341">shutting down fan projects and mods</a>. But it should be noted that at the moment, we don’t know for sure what happened.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted both Swegta and Rockstar Games for more information, but didn’t hear back from either before publication.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/SWEGTA/status/2011478849431687225">Swegta himself also confirmed the news on Twitter</a>, posting on Wednesday that he will make a “proper statement on the situation” on January 21. On the creator’s website, a new message was added that states: “The Bully Online project is shutting down. Thank you all for playing.”</p>

And now, it's coming to the U.S. for a one-night-only theatrical release on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2026/1/14/umamusume-pretty-derby-beginning-of-a-new-era-anime-film-north-american-release-date" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared by Crunchyroll</a>, the film will hit select, to-be-announced theaters in the U.S. for a one-night screening next month, and shared an English-language <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4dMQOzj-5g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> and poster alongside the news. Tickets will be available at a later date via the <a href="https://www.movie-umamusume-newera-en.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official English website</a>, though it's unclear how broad a release this film will actually get.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/filters-quality95formatwebp-1768426269047.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not familiar with Umamusume: Pretty Derby, it's an exceedingly popular franchise from Cygames centered around a mobile game that launched in 2021. It features the Umamusume, or women with some of the features (such as ears and tails) and abilities of horses who participate in races styled after real-world historical horse races. In the game this takes the form of a sports simulation game where players train Umamusume to compete in various raises and meet certain, character-specific goals.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the mobile game, a multi-season anime, a manga, and various other spinoffs, Umamusume has covered the stories of multiple characters based on real-world race horses from the '90s, '00s, and '10s. The film, Beginning of a New Era, released in Japan on May 24, 2024 and follows Jungle Pocket, based on the real-world horse of the same name, and her rivalries with Agnes Tachyon, Manhattan Cafe, and Dantsu Flame. In the film, Jungle Pocket trains with veteran trainer Tanabe in an effort to win the Triple Crown, a series of three races that can only be competed in once in a lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby launched in the U.S. in July of last year and only increased its popularity from what it already enjoyed in Japan. So much so that fans are now paying attention to the real-life horses that inspired their fictional counterparts, cheering them on, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-fans-mourn-death-of-champion-racehorse-grass-wonder">even mourning the death of one last year</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Punching trees might never be the same. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than 10 years in development, Hytale early access is here! If you’re just getting started, we’re writing a variety of early-game guides on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Make_a_Furnace_and_Smelt">smelting</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/How_to_Play_with_Friends_and_Set_up_Hytale_Servers">setting up servers for friends</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hytale/Hytale_Progression_Guide">plenty more</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I preferred to go in blind. Hytale is quite obviously heavily Minecraft coded, but developer Hypixel is also doing its own thing in ways big and small, too. Below are seven things in Hytale's early game that surprised me, coming at it specifically from a Minecraft’s player’s perspective. Anything I missed? Have some early-game observations of your own? Leave a comment! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>1. Punching down a single tree knocks down the entire thing at once, giving you a pile of wood, sticks, and sap along with it. No floating tree trunks here!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is very clearly heavily Minecraft-inspired, but one area in which it does feel quite different is in that time-honored opening crafting survival game moment of punching down your first few trees. In Hytale, like Terreria and plenty of other survival games, the whole tree collapses and explodes like a little piñata of wood and resources once you disconnect it from the ground. You'll need all that sap, trust me. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>2. Early overworld mobs are tankier than expected</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-11-49-25-am-1768423172423.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">How was I supposed to know this cutie would take nine hits?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Within my first few minutes in Hytale I had come across squirrels, rabbits, sheep, and even a fox. And although none of them were hard to kill at all (sorry little guys, but I need your pelts for early-game crafting recipes), I was a little surprised at how much HP they seem to have, and how many hits from my first crude sword it took to take them down. I had to chase one rabbit halfway across the plains - they're quite speedy when making their getaway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>3. Ores glint faintly in underground caves</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-42-54-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Sweet, sweet early game Copper.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is truly a tiny detail, but still one I thought was neat. When spelunking in Hytale, if you look carefully, an otherwise pitch-black cave wall or crevasse will glint off distant light sources like your torch if there are any valuable ores present. Helpful!
</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>4. Gear Progression Is a bit more complicated</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-41-18-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Iron upgrades will have to wait.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In my first cave I explored I found plenty of copper ore for Tier 1 armor, but I also found a stack or so of iron ore, for Tier 2 gear. I was initially a little bit disappointed, thinking maybe I could just leapfrog past tier 1 entirely. But crafting weapons and armor in Hytale actually requires a few different raw materials, which I appreciated. Copper armor requires only copper and plant fiber. But Iron requires iron, light leather, and linen scraps. So it looks like I have more mob grinding in my near future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>5. There are more decorative options</strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-00-pm-1768423553440.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale’s crafting system in early access is still very basic (and a little buggy), but coming from Minecraft, I still appreciated some small crafting details like being able to turn raw wood and stone into slanted, tiled roof blocks and half-block-thick walls when building out my starter hut. You can also place shelves on our walls and stick a few decoratives like candles and books on them. By the way - huge fan of how Hytale's crafting benches can see and make use of resources stored in nearby chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>6. There are promising secrets and surprises</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-1-19-53-pm-1768423653838.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A first look at the still-heavily-under-construction Forgotten Temple.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale is what I would describe as an “aggressively” early access game. Most of the time when you come across something interesting in the world like what looks like a dungeon entrance, or a hand-built ruin, you’ll be stopped from entering and shown a literal under construction “work in progress” sign. There is one exception though, which illustrates some of the promise of what is hopefully to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early on I spotted a nearby icon on my map labeled “Forgotten Temple Gateway.” Without spoiling the details, investigating said gateway led to a fight against a unique mob and a portal to a beautiful and entirely unique, hand-crafted location, filled with its own NPCs and points of interest. Hytale for now looks to be very thin on hand-crafted Adventure content, but this tiny taste was an encouraging place to start. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>7 Farming Is a Bit More Complex</strong></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/14/screenshot-2026-01-14-at-2-44-21-pm-1768423553440.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Next order of business: start my chicken empire.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although I didn’t get a chance to dive into the feature in detail because I had to go back to (grumble grumble) <em>work, </em>I did get a chance to poke around Hytale’s farming system a bit. So far it looks like, similar to most of Hytale’s other systems, it’s a bit more complex than Minecraft’s. You can craft animal caretaking buildings including chicken coops and beehives, as well as a farming aids like a watering can. Tree saplings and new crop seeds don’t come from harvesting, but instead must be created by spending “Essence of Life,” which seems a bit like a currency you receive when harvesting mature crops.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, as a Minecraft veteran - I’ve been playing off and on since there were Secret Friday Updates! - Hytale’s opening few hours are familiar enough and yet still different enough to keep me interested and coming back for more.

            <title><![CDATA[Finally, Some Good AI Policies]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/bandcamp-games-workshop-ai-ban/</link>
            <guid>1406416</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>For the lion’s share of companies, there seem to be two schools of thought around generative AI: 1) We’re gonna add it to everything, <a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><u>customer sentiment be damned</u></a>, and then we’re gonna be rich, rich, rich, or 2) Of course we’re wary of AI’s implications, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-larian-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate/"><u>c'maahn I'm just a little guy, it's also my birthday, I'm a little birthday boy</u></a>. I’d like to personally commend Games Workshop and Bandcamp for bucking this trend.&nbsp;</p><p>The former, which makes <em>Warhammer</em>, said as part of its recent financial results that while a few senior managers at the company are well-versed in AI and have been given free rein to be “inquisitive” about potential usage, “none are that excited about it yet,” and it’s banned otherwise.</p><p>“We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW including in any of our competitions,” said CEO Kevin Rountree (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech?ref=aftermath.site"><u>IGN</u></a>). “We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective; the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.”</p><p>He added that “we have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our <em>Warhammer </em>Studio – hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make <em>Warhammer </em>the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p><p>Bandcamp, one of the few services that still tries to help musicians make money, took things a step further, <a href="https://blog.bandcamp.com/2026/01/13/keeping-bandcamp-human/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announcing this week</u></a> that music generated “wholly or in substantial part by AI is not permitted.” AI impersonations of existing artists are also not allowed.</p><p>“We believe that the human connection found through music is a vital part of our society and culture, and that music is much more than a product to be consumed,” the company wrote. “It’s the result of a human cultural dialog stretching back before the written word. Similarly, musicians are more than mere producers of sound. They are vital members of our communities, our culture, and our social fabric. Bandcamp was built to directly connect artists and their fans, and to make it easy for fans to support artists equitably so that they can keep making music.”</p><p>Bandcamp’s stance is a crucial one as the popularity of AI-generated music, regrettably, explodes. Take, for example, neo-soul artist Sienna Rose, who has three songs in the Spotify top 50 <a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-hottest-neo-soul-artist-on-spotify-doesnt-exist?ref=aftermath.site"><u>despite not existing</u></a>. “She,” unfortunately, is just <a href="https://www.avclub.com/ai-music-slop-haven-timbaland-tata-spotify-breaking-rust?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the tip of the iceberg</u></a>. This does not mean AI has reached a standard of quality such that it’s an acceptable substitute for art made by people with hopes, dreams, and, well, souls; rather, decades of paint-by-numbers pop formulated by the same nine producers and the hyper-commercialization of music by services like Spotify – turning artists’ blood, sweat, and tears into disposable background noise – have primed people to accept watered-down, machine-made gruel. It’s not unlike the way SEO and algorithms turned numerous websites into barely sentient content mills <em>before </em>AI swooped in and finished the job. The powers that be have been trying to build this world for decades. AI was just the missing puzzle piece.</p><p>All we can do now is support the people and organizations that prioritize authentic human ingenuity while doing the slow, hard work of constructing something, anything, better than the modern internet – preferably somewhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/please-seek-help-immediately/"><div><p>Please Seek Help Immediately</p><p>Motherfucker have you listened to yourself</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

Anyone order a point-and-click adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game for later this month featuring a cast of British actors that'll make you go "oh, right, them!" when you Google them? Well, someone must have, because Earth Must Die, the next game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lair-of-the-clockwork-god">Lair of the Clockwork God</a> developer Size Five Games, now has a release date. Come on, it's getting cold!
</p>
<p>
Or it's still cold, because it's not out yet? I'm losing myself in the metaphor here, point is, Size Five announced today alongside publisher No More Robots that Earth Must Die will be launching January 27th. That's less than two weeks away! I can count! In any case, not only did the game get a new release date and a star studded trailer, it also has a demo for you to have a crack at!

<p>
For those that need a more formal introduction first, Earth Must Die stars the very regularly named VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the Tyrythian Empire, who is very upset that "those idiotic, moronic Terranoids" took over his kingdom that he definitely didn't inherit from his father and for sure built up himself (sounds like we got a real nepo baby over here). As a result, he's decided he's going to kill pretty much everyone on earth. Lovely!
</p><p>
Right, those British actors - you'll find the likes of Joel Fry (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/game-thrones">Game of Thrones</a>, Our Flag Means Death), Little Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Martha Howe-Douglas (Horrible Histories), and for a name that'll be more widely familiar globally, Final Fantasy 16 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>'s Ben Starr.
</p>
<p>
If all of that sounds good to you, you can wishlist and check out the demo for Earth Must Die on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">Steam</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[I Nearly Made It Through All Of 2025 Without Playing A Single Console Game]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/gran-turismo-7-review-impressions-ps5/</link>
            <guid>1406383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Right before Christmas time,<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/"> <u>when I started putting my Game of the Year list together</u></a>, I had an odd realisation: not only was not a single game on the list something I played on console, but I didn't remember playing <em>any </em>console games through all of 2025.</p><p>I mean, I'd <em>dabbled</em>. You can't work in this job without picking up a controller at some point, and so if you were being a pedantic asshole you could say I "played" <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> at a friend's place. But both were for a matter of minutes, literally to check them out; to say I'd <em>played </em>them would be like sitting through the first four minutes of <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em> then saying you'd seen the movie.</p><p>It was an odd thing to reckon with. Partly because it must surely have been the first year I hadn't properly played a console game since the 1980s, which would have been a hell of a run, but mostly because I quickly realised that instead of being some life-changing realisation, shaking the very foundations of my understanding of this medium and my place in it, it ended up as some harmless trivia. I just didn't really care. It was 2025, you can play <em>The Last of Us</em> on PC now, who gives a shit what machine you play a game on.</p><p>Not that it really mattered, because on December 25 I opened a present from my kids and it was a copy of <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> for the PlayStation 5.</p><p>The most perfect game to land in this situation, given the fact it's probably the most console-ass AAA title left on the planet that doesn't have the word Nintendo on the box. Sony has put a lot of PlayStation games on PC over the last few years, from <em>Horizon </em>to <em>God of War</em> to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, but not this. Never this. <em>Gran Turismo</em> IS PlayStation, it is born of the console; PC racing games are a different breed, and Polyphony must rightly reckon that this experience, a quintessential Japanese console game right down to the music and menus, just wouldn't work there. So if I wanted to play <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and I did, it was going to have to be on the PlayStation 5.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Those are Australian dollars, but whatever dollars you're using, it's a lot</span></figcaption></figure><p>Why now? This game came out in 2020! Well, I'm not ashamed to say that while I am an enemy of brands and the idea of loving brands, I have one glaring and fatal exception: the electric car manufacturer Polestar. I'm very into the company's focus on both design and sustainability. I own a Polestar 2 and it's incredible, but I want a Polestar 5 more than I have ever wanted a car in my life. Thing is, it's priced at roughly <em>AUD$250,000 </em>(see above), so it's a car I'll likely never get to even <em>drive</em>, let alone park in my garage. So the closest I'll probably ever get is driving one in a mostly-realistic driving video game, where it recently arrived as part of an update that doubled as a marketing exercise for Polestar (see below). A cheap and obvious marketing trick, but they got me.</p><p>I'm still not buying the car (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">unless?!?!</a>), but PlayStation in particular got me, because I <em>love </em>this game. I've always been a fan of <em>Gran Turismo</em> for the simple reason that while it's got its fair share of car tweaks and spare part settings, the main purpose of the series is to serve as an interactive car brochure, a digital exploration of the fancier end of automotive culture. This isn't a driving game with radio DJs and a neon interface,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assetto-corsa-rally-impressions-review/"> <u>nor is it <em>Assetto Corsa</em></u></a>; this one goes out to everyone who obsesses over driving a car that costs more than an apartment, but who doesn't mind having to drive a Mazda 3 for a few laps first. Like me.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBDF7TuSjQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Polestar 5 meets Gran Turismo 7 | Polestar"></iframe></figure><p>To give you an idea of the game's tone, if you haven't already played it: Your main source of progression in <em>GT7 </em>is visiting a lovely little cafe in the woods and getting missions from its friendly owner, while a camera pans lovingly over whatever car you're driving at the time and a succession of automotive celebrities and designers share trivia with you about some random BMW from the 1970s. For anyone who is into the looks and history of cars, this is sicko stuff, it's perfect.</p><p>It's also great that despite all the advances in video game horsepower over the last three decades, this is still very much a <em>Gran Turismo</em> game, with the same pros and cons I could have listed after a few hours with <em>GT2</em>. It feels "real" but also weirdly sterile, and the sound effects are realistic but also empty, but the handling and races are all honed so perfectly that none of that really matters. The urge to win a few more bucks so you can buy an old Ferrari overpowers every other complaint I have about spending more time in menus than on the track, or the game still somehow not having a proper damage system. About the only things that <em>have </em>changed since 1997 are that the graphics have got better while the music has got worse.</p><figure></figure><p>Not that I bought too many Ferraris; I wanted this game for the Polestar 5, and after a little grind to unlock it I got my hands on it and never looked back. This thing <em>flies</em>, especially with upgrades, and while I'll never own one I can now at least say I've come as close as I ever will, from getting to hear its electric whirr through my soundbar to panning the in-game camera around its interior and leaving its cinematic driving videos to play on my TV like an aspirational screensaver.</p><p>For the sake of trivia, it would have been interesting to make it through all of 2025 without properly playing a console game. But for the sake of my own enjoyment, I'm very glad I broke that streak with just a few days to spare.</p>

However, Hurst also provided the voice of Thor in 2022’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness">God of War Ragnarök</a>, a performance that earned him a BAFTA nomination. In those games, Kratos was portrayed by Christopher Judge.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jan-2026-ps-plus-resident-evil-village-2000659885</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony revealed the latest games coming to PS Plus Extra in January 2026 and the headliner will be arriving just in time for anyone who still needs to catch up on Capcom’s survival horror franchise ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a>.<em> Resident Evil Village</em>, along with eight other games, will all be joining the PlayStation subscription library this month.</p> <p>Even if you’ve never played <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, you’ve probably encountered its fan-favorite vampire giantess <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-villages-lady-dimitrescu-was-worth-the-wa-1846848171">Lady Alcina Dimitrescu</a>. And while completing <em>Village</em> isn’t essential for anyone planning to play <em>Requiem</em> at launch on February 27, it’ll certainly be a nice option for passing the time until then. The other headliner this month is <a href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>, the 2024 <em>Yakuza</em> game that’s a turn-based RPG and the first in the series to go outside of Japan.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games for Extra and Premium tiers in January 2026:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Resident Evil Village</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>The Exit 8</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Art of Rally</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>A Little to the Left</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li> <p><em>Ridge Racer</em> | PS5, PS4</p> </li> </ul> <p>I’d like to draw quick attention to two of the smaller games above: <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> and <em>Art of Rally</em>. Both are excellent. <em>Darkest Dungeon II</em> isn’t what some fans of the original game wanted, but it’s a neat crisis-management RPG mapped onto the roguelike structure of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. <em>Art of Rally</em> is a beautiful, minimalist, chill top down racing game. Give both a try if you haven’t already.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>A Little To The Left</em> is great as well, especially for couch buddies who might not normally play games. You organize stuff in unusual ways to unlock little easter eggs. It’s way cooler than it might sound.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amazon's upcoming <strong>God of War TV show</strong> has a <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner in <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a>, a director for its first few episodes in Shogun director <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">Frederick E.O. Toye</a>,</strong> and today, Amazon and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong> announced the first confirmed member of the show's cast. <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who players will recognize as the voice of <strong>Thor</strong> from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/">God of War Ragnarok</a></strong>, will step into the role of <strong>Kratos</strong> for the upcoming show.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2011529372608364835"> post on X (formerly Twitter) from the official Prime Video account</a>. The post simply reads, "<em>Meet Ryan Hurst, your Kratos in the God of War series coming to Prime Video</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though it's not <strong>Christopher Judge</strong> in the role, the voice actor who is now famous for his portrayal of Kratos and his ability to say <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H30ydojdbuc">one three-letter word with more authority than anyone has ever put behind it</a>, Ryan Hurst is still an incredible choice. The side-by-side photo shows that he at least has the beard down (save for some colouring that'll likely come once filming starts), and we know from his performance as Thor that he'll be able to step into the role of Kratos without skipping a beat.</p>



<p>Now that we have our Kratos, with the show reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">set to begin filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, hopefully, we'll soon learn who else will be filling out the rest of the cast. As cast members and characters start to be named, we'll also learn more about the approach that Amazon is taking to this show. We know that it will be jumping into the Norse setting of the recent games, but whether it will follow the same story from the previous two games or create its own is unclear.</p>

              <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/ryan-hurst-cast-kratos-prime-video-god-of-war-1236683097/">Deadline</a> </em>is&nbsp;reporting that Sony and Amazon have tapped <em>Sons of Anarchy </em>and <em>God of War: Ragnarök </em>actor Ryan Hurst to play Kratos in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-amazon-ps5-release-date-trailer-1851675600">upcoming live-action <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p> <p>Hurst, who played Thor in the 2022&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game, will be swapping roles for the show, and will lead the series based on the storylines of the modern <em>GoW </em>games, which find Kratos interacting with (and often fighting) figures from Norse mythology. We still don’t know who will be playing his son Atreus, but it’s cool to have Hurst on as someone who is intimately familiar with the source material.</p>  <p>Along with playing Thor, Hurst’s notable credits include playing Opie in&nbsp;<em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, as well as Beta in the&nbsp;<em>Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise, both in the main series and the <em>Fear the Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>spin-off show. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series&nbsp;<em>The Abandons</em>.</p>

 <p>If you want a quick refresher on Hurst’s acting chops, someone was kind enough to compile all his scenes as Thor in <em>Ragnarök</em>.</p>  <p>That’s the only casting news we have for now, but given that the show seems to be comfortable picking from the game’s cast, it would be interesting to see Sunny Suljic&nbsp; reprise his role as Atreus for the series, though the 20-year-old actor might be a bit too old to play the child as he appeared in the 2018 game at this point. Atreus was still a young teen by the time <em>Ragnarök&nbsp;</em>came around, however, and Suljic still looks pretty young.</p>

 <p>There were rumors that Christopher Judge, the actor who plays Kratos in the Norse <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, was also up for the live-action role last year, but Judge himself seemed to debunk these in <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1968155387863109880">an X post</a> in September.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series is coming from writer, showrunner, and executive producer <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-tv-ronald-d-moore-battlestar-galactica-1851770751">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who is best known for his work on <em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.</p>

<p>Prime Video’s God of War series has its Kratos.</p>



<p>The company announced on Wednesday that Ryan Hurst has been cast to play the lead protagonist Kratos in the upcoming series. The show is currently in pre-production with casting continuing.</p>







<p>Hurst is known for his roles as Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy and Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans. In the video game world, Hurst’s only role was as Thor in God of War Ragnarok. He was nominated for a BAFTA in 2022 for Performer in a Supporting Role for his depiction of the God of Thunder.</p>



<p>Speaking of Thor, according <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to recent reports</a>, Olafur Darri Olafsson is in talks to play the role in the series. The series will focus on the Norse saga from the 2018 God of War and the aforementioned Ragnarok. </p>



<p><strong>“God of War&nbsp;follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye,” </strong>the show’s synopsis reads. <strong>“Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

</div></figure>



<p>In addition to casting, it’s been revealed that the series has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already been renewed</a> for a second season before the first season even begins filming. Filming of the initial season is expected to being sometime in February, with the first two episodes directed by The Boys and Fallout director Frederick E.O. Toye.</p>



<p>There’s been no word on when the series will debut. </p>

            <guid>1406305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">An enjoyable survival crafter with some thoughtful tweaks and additions.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After about 10 hours in Hytale, the new survival crafter from some former <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review">Minecraft</a> modders, there really isn't a better way I could describe it other than to say it's basically Minecraft 2. From the block-by-block breaking and building, to the stylized environments and enemies, to the procedural world generation, this feels like the, "What would we change if we had the chance to start over again?" version of the now legendary 2009 classic. Many games have been influenced by Mojang's trendsetter, but this is more of a cover song than a subgenre from what I’ve seen so far (though I’ve got plenty more to play before my final review). And while developer Hypixel Studios’ lawyers might not love hearing me say that, I honestly don't think it's a bad thing. Even in Early Access, it's a good cover!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the gameplay will be pretty familiar if you've put any time at all into Minecraft, but with some streamlining here and there. You no longer have to begin your journey punching trees, for instance, since basic tools are made with sticks and rubble that can be collected easily with your bare hands. Also, breaking the trunk of a tree will cause everything above it to collapse and drop its resources, which was almost enough to win me over on its own. I still to this day hate having to chop upwards to hollow out a tree in Minecraft!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Movement is also a lot more modern and fluid. You can jump up to three blocks high and pull yourself up, which feels like such a huge quality-of-life improvement over the one-block jump limit in Minecraft. It's even possible to take a running leap at a ledge, hit the side, and pull yourself up. We've got proper parkour now, and I don't know that I would ever want to give it up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also just runs better than Minecraft on my Ryzen 7 3700X, 32GB RAM, and RTX 4070 Ti-powered system. Even with the draw distance cranked up, my framerates sit comfortably above 60. We'll see how long that lasts when I start building elaborate megastructures, but for now it's like butter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is fine. There are a handful of different weapon types, from swift-slashing double daggers to a classic sword and shield setup with more defensive options, and every one has its own unique charge attack and a special meter that can be filled up to release a devastating finisher. I'm impressed with the enemy variety so far, with everything from goblin bomb-throwers to really terrifying lava toads that can catch you with their tongues and pull you in for a very painful bite attack.</p><p>It's almost like someone's wishlist of things Minecraft can't or will never do.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building can be a little bit fiddly. We have more pieces to pick from, like proper roofs that make Minecraft's classic stair tricks redundant. But sometimes I had to do silly stuff like building a dirt "mold" to make sure all the pieces were facing the right way. Still, once I got the hang of its quirks, I was able to start making some pretty neat-looking stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's very little direction in this Early Access version of Hytale, currently. The main hub area, the Forgotten Temple, is a rotunda of literal Under Construction signs. I even stumbled into some dungeons out in the world where I'd be excited to throw the doors open only to find one of these disappointing barriers. It's not clear what the larger, overarching goal is supposed to be, although I'm happy enough to build cool stuff and seek out new ores for higher-level tools at the moment. But I'm not sure if there will eventually be a story or bigger bosses to find or anything like that. I haven't run into them yet if they exist already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, I'm quite enjoying my time with Hytale so far, though. Even if it is just Minecraft again, it's an enjoyable rendition with some thoughtful tweaks and additions. It's almost like someone's wishlist of things Mojang will never do, or can't do with its legacy tech. I plan to put in at least a few dozen more hours before I give it a final evaluation, but check back for more updates on my progress in the coming week.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Survival Crafting Games</h3><p>I've reviewed a lot of these!

<p dir="ltr">The free rewards from the Frostfire bonus path will include a hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and player-card customization items, while paid pass owners can grab a new weapon package, a career XP boost, and additional cosmetics. The Frostfire path can also be completed concurrently alongside the Season 1 battle pass. Unlike previous bonus paths, all points for the Frostfire bonus path are earned through new weekly challenges that will be provided.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 will introduce a new set of daily login rewards and several Double XP weekend events throughout this extended update period. The developer also said the game will celebrate the upcoming Valentine's Day holiday.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 had a strong start at launch and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">outsold Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in the US through November, but the post-launch content for Season 1 was met with mixed reviews. The third and final phase of content arrived just before the winter holidays, but the update added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-buggy-update-is-being-fixed-as-new-patches-scheduled-and-tournament-delayed/1100-6536891/">host of issues that affected gameplay</a>. This mishap also caused Battlefield 6's $1 million tournament series for Redsec to be postponed.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield Studios said it will reinforce Battlefield Labs as a public preview for future game updates once they are in the late stages of development. "Both the Season 1 extension and the use of Battlefield Labs will set the foundation for new and exciting content throughout our live seasons, including what will come in Season 2," the developer said.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 will now begin on February 17, and the developer said new details will be revealed next month. While it's uncertain what changes will be made, the Season 2 update will likely include more maps, guns, and new modes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League Publishing has announced its first expansion for its sci-fi TTRPG, <em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em>. The first expansion is <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em>, a new prewritten campaign that tasks players with uncovering long-lost secrets in a new section of the sprawling spacefaring setting.</p><h2><em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> will expand the world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/coriolis-great-dark-fully-funded-in-7-minutes-on-kickstarter" rel="nofollow"><em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em></a> with new locations, stories, and tools for players and Game Masters.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This new campaign tasks Explorers with investigating the mysteries of Ship City and traveling along the Hammurabi Arm. This story begins with the death of an old ruin delver and the disappearance of a mysterious stone tablet. This kicks off a series of strange events within Ship City. What follows is the players navigating the various factions and internal politics of Ship City, and exploring ancient ruins on distant moons.</p><p>The summary of <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> is in keeping with the appeal of <em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em>. This new edition of Free League's spacefaring TTRPG shifts its focus away from spacefaring exploration in the vein of Traveller and more towards archeological digs into ancient ruins on alien worlds. The new book features rules dedicated to these expeditions, including rules for a mysterious, deadly plague called The Blight.</p><p>A copy of <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> contains the following:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ecbdc4f4649417329959a08ae1ddc4300">A Campaign book containing new locations, characters, and key plots</li><li data-list-item-id="e04494d24cce154ffbeba8e24fa96d987">An Expedition booklet, containing player information about new Greatships and systems in the Hammurabi Arm</li><li data-list-item-id="e51823dba3c2028ed41eeee12360b66be">Full-Color maps of Ship City, the Charted Sphere, and the Lost Horizon</li><li data-list-item-id="e7a54b189d04e70fcfdcf752d6c569b7f">Delve maps and handouts</li><li data-list-item-id="ed282c87f413b6a4692c04567de2a7312">Blueprints of new vehicles, including Greatships Akhander and Rigel, the Grasshopper shuttle, and the Rhino rover</li></ul><p>If you missed out on its offering during the 2024 Kickstarter campaign, <em>The Flowers of Algorab</em> expansion for <em>Coriolis: The Great Dark</em> is available for pre-order now on Free League's web store. If you pre-order a physical copy before the official release date of February 3, you will receive a PDF at no additional cost.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>The recent run of layoffs at Ubisoft are continuing as the company confirmed that it has let go a number of staff at its Abu Dhabi studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, 29 people have been let go by Ubisoft. In a statement, Ubisoft confirmed the layoffs took place last year, and says it was based on a decision made in November. </p>







<p><strong>“In November, Ubisoft made the difficult decision to restructure its Abu Dhabi mobile studio, discontinuing some projects in order to focus on&nbsp;Growtopia,”</strong> they <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Game Developer</a>.<strong> “As a result, this change impacted 29 team members.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We remain deeply grateful for their contributions and are providing support to them throughout the transition.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the layoffs at the Abu Dhabi studio, Ubisoft has recently closed its Halifax location while also letting go dozens of other employees in Sweden and elsewhere. Regarding the Halifax closure, the union representing 61 of the staff impacted has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/union-files-legal-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-studio-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a legal complaint</a> against the company and is requesting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cwa-union-met-ubisoft-company-brought-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparency on claims</a> that the decision is out of financial necessity.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for clarity on its current plans and if more layoffs should be expected. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> announced it had voted for wall-to-wall union representation</a> under the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/"><strong>CWA Canada</strong>,</a> with <strong>61</strong> of the studio's <strong>71</strong> employees joining <strong>Local 30111 </strong>alongside <strong><a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a></strong>. Not even three weeks later, <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/"><strong>shutting down the studio and laying off all 71 workers</strong></a>, denying that the shutdown had anything to do with the majority of its staff unionizing.</p>



<p>In response, the CWA Canada said it would "<em></em><em>pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way</em>." That process has seemingly begun, as the media union has <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/13/union-files-labour-board-complaint-over-ubisoft-halifax-shutdown/">filed an official complaint with the <strong>Nova Scotia Labour Board</strong></a> over the closure, and today, the union expressed further outrage after learning that Ubisoft was given <strong>nearly $1 billion CAD in tax credit subsidies</strong> in the last five years alone while operating in Nova Scotia.</p>



<p>Provincial and state governments will often offer companies tax breaks as incentives to establish a base of operations in their state or province, and in the case of Ubisoft, the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> company has quite the history of taking advantage of these breaks to establish what have become some of its most important offices. </p>



<p><strong>Ubisoft Montreal</strong>, for example, was first set up due to Quebec having attractive tax incentives. If not for those incentives driving Ubisoft to open a studio in Montreal, the city may not have grown into the incredible hub of game development it is today, with scores of talented developers calling Montreal their home.</p>



<p>While Halifax hasn't grown as a game development hub in the same way that Montreal did, as CWA Canada president Carmel Smyth pointed out when the union filed its complaint, "<em>Ubisoft took $12 million in taxpayer money from the government of Nova Scotia to nurture a generation of talent, and to build a tech industry. Now it’s walking away without so much as an apology</em>."</p>



<p>Once the union dug through French Senate documents to see just how much of a tax break the company was receiving, it not only found that Ubisoft had received more tax breaks from Canada than any other country, but also that in the last five years, it had received hundreds of millions in tax credits.</p>



<p>"<em>According to the documents, Ubisoft got 605.6 million Euros (about C$980 million at today’s exchange rates) in tax credits from Canadian governments from 2020 through 2024</em>," CWA Canada writes in a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s outrageous that a company can take hundreds of millions in tax breaks – public money – and then shut down an operation and lay off workers</em>," added Smyth. "<em>And it’s shocking that governments allow it to happen</em>. <em>We need immediate changes to hold companies to account. The rules must make it clear that if you close or significantly downsize a business, you must pay back any government subsidies.</em>"</p>



<p>CWA Canada is also holding to its accusation that Ubisoft shut down the Halifax studio "<em>to keep out the union</em>." While Ubisoft denies that the shutdown had anything to do with the studio unionizing, CWA Canada notes that if the shutdown had been planned as Ubisoft claims, it wouldn't have caught the staff entirely by surprise as it did, and that Ubisoft has yet to provide evidence proving the shutdown was a decision made through "<em>financial necessity</em>."</p>



<p>Since the shutdown was announced, legal and public pressure from the CWA Canada has already pushed Ubisoft to <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2026/01/12/ubisoft-agrees-to-reconsider-compensation-for-laid-off-halifax-workers-amid-union-public-pressure/">consider raising the severance offered to the 71 workers laid off from the Halifax studio</a>. While that may be all the union is able to get out of this, the pressure applied here, specifically regarding how Canada and its provincial governments approach tax incentives, could create significant change down the line.</p>
