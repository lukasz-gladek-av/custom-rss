            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-runescape-dragonwilds/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-coming-to-runescape-dragonwilds-mortal-online-2-and-brickadia.1238130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three PC games are integrating NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation shortly. Chronologically, the first one will be Jagex's RuneScape: Dragonwilds, the cooperative open world survival crafting game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in early access nearly three months ago</a>. </p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds debuted to decent numbers, registering a 52K concurrent player peak on Steam. However, those numbers are long gone - over the last week, the game has stayed below three thousand concurrent players at all times, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1374490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>. Anyway, RuneScape: Dragonwilds launched with support for DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and DLAA, but a patch due today will also add NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, boosting frame rates across the board for all owners of GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>On Friday, July 11, Brickadia LLC will launch the namesake next-generation brick building sandbox game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199420/Brickadia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, where it is planned to stay until the end of 2026. In Brickadia, users have every creative tool, such as building, scripting, and more, available right in the game with real-time multiplayer enabled. That means they can work with friends to build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes without ever leaving the action. Some of the examples of things you can craft in Brickadia include skyscrapers, all sorts of vehicles, detailed islands, spaceships, and cityscapes.</p>



<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5 and supports hardware accelerated ray tracing, boosting UE5's own Lumen, as you can see below. To compensate for that performance cost, players will find NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and DLAA options available.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Lastly, the Unreal Engine 5 sandbox indie MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-online-2-gets-epic-megagrant-will-migrate-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Online 2</a> will receive NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support later this month with its first expansion, Reckoning, <a href="https://www.mortalonline2.com/patch-notes-reckoning-ptr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available for testing in the Public Test Realm</a>. The game already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the course of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, you will connect with all sorts of people as you attempt to bring the whole of Australia into the Chiral Network. While the vast majority of preppers are encountered as part of the story, a few are entirely optional, and can be missed if you don't listen to what characters tell Sam and if you don't explore the map fully.</p>



<p>One of these optional preppers is <strong>The Inventor</strong>, a rather peculiar guy who has decided to bring Australia's current isolation to the next level by living on an island off the coast of the continent. Looking at the island from afar, it seems impossible to reach The Inventor's shelter, as no roads or bridges are going through or over the sea of tar, but there are actually a few easy ways to reach the island, and you can even reach him as soon as you get to Australia from the Plate Gate if you so desire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After reaching the beach closest to The Inventor's shelter, use your Odradek scanner to highlight areas where the tar is shallow. These areas, highlighted by yellow dots, can be traversed safely. Before you head out, however, <strong>look around the beach to find lost cargo for The Inventor</strong>, as he won't talk to you unlesss you have a delivery for him. Once you have loaded the cargo, you can follow the safe path, reach the shelter, and connect it to the Chiral Network.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if you are not a completionist who wants to see everything Death Stranding 2: On the Beach has to offer, there are still plenty of good reasons to unlock The Inventor as increasing the connection level with the prepper will unlock some <strong>useful items</strong>, including the Otter Head at level 1, the Stun Bomb at level 2, the Remote Stun Bomb at level 3, the Bola Stun Gun at level 4 and a Custom Hologram and a patch at level 5 with which you can customize your structures and backpack, respectively.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-feasible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-docked-vrr-support-is-technically-feasible-but-would-face-significant-challenges.1238124/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 docked VRR support may be technically feasible, but there would be too many hurdles to make it a smooth plug-and-play feature.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry replied to a supporter's question asking if the dock's authentication chip is the reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't support VRR in docked mode, ruling out the possibility, as the authentication process is a separate process that takes place before any sort of output process begins. The reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 dock doesn't support VRR, Digital Foundry highlighted, has probably nothing to do with the dock, but rather with the Display Port to HDMI conversion through USB-C, which makes it difficult for VRR to work on the Steam Deck. Ultimately, Digital Foundry believes that VRR may be technically feasible, as it was recently proven how&nbsp;the dock can support it,&nbsp;but the hurdles to overcome may be too many to actually make it a smooth plug-and-play experience, which is what console users expect to find.</p>



<p>On a related note, the tech experts at Digital Foundry also commented on why so few Nintendo Switch 2 launch games do not support 40 FPS modes despite the 120 Hz panel making it a feasible option, saying that, at this time, not too many titles would benefit from it. At the same time, however, some games already supporting 40 FPS mode like Cyberpunk 2077, suggests that more titles will support it in the future, although it remains to be seen how many, especially if the VRR situation doesn't improve, as games would need to be locked at 40 FPS without VRR for a good experience.</p>

            <p>If you've been enjoying <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a>, but reckon its towering mountains aren't filling you with enough existential dread, there's a mod you need to check out. It's called Everest, and it fills your game with other players' dead bodies.</p>
<p>Well, skeletons to be exact, and possibly over 10,000 of them by the sounds of it. That's more bones that you'll find at Crufts, and it looks to turn the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-is-a-small-goofy-co-op-climbing-game-from-the-devs-behind-another-crabs-teasure-and-content-warning">co-op climbing game</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> devs Aggro Crab and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> devs Landfall into the sort of morbid fun you can usually only have by chucking a frisbee around the garden of a crematorium. No, I haven't done that last bit. Yet.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Steven, who's part of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> community modding group, has put down their neon sword and made <a href="https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Steven/Everest/">Everest</a>. It's a mod which "saves your death location and populates your world with skeletons where others have fallen." Lovely.</p>
<p>By scattering this spooky, scary stuff throughout your surroundings, the modder aims to create "a shared experience, potentially marking dangerous areas and connecting you to other adventurers in death." Given how often folks die in Peak, it appears you'll be connecting with a lot of corpses in addition to your own, with Steven having tweeted that one of the mod's first days in operation saw "10,000+ skeletons from over 3,000 different players" be summoned.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>I made a silly mod for <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AggroCrabGames</a>'s PEAK that fills your game with the skeletons of those who came (and died) before you. Yesterday's island saw 10,000+ skeletons from over 3,000 different players!</p><p>Download link in the replies. <a href="https://t.co/TeDFNXbjMD">pic.twitter.com/TeDFNXbjMD</a></p></div>— Steven 🎀 (@BSMG_Steven) <a href="https://twitter.com/BSMG_Steven/status/1942302342583574814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It's a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, though I assume instead of 'try finger but hole', the messages these corpses will wordlessly convey are more along the lines of 'try ledge but fall'.</p>
<p>The mod comes with a "detailed" config file so you can adjust things to suit your preferences and handy notifications that'll let you know if it's working or not, just in case your island not being littered with corpses isn't a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving it a go, you'll need to grab modding framework <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx">BepInEx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask">UniTask</a>, the latter being "a library used to better handle async operations in Unity".</p>
<p>I'm not saying you have to blast Drowning Pool's Bodies on repeat while you've got Everest installed, but surely it can't hurt the experience.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peak-modders-are-delivering-peak-modding-heres-one-that-fills-your-game-with-the-skeletons-of-dead-players]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Level-5 has announced that its cozy open-world RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has passed another big sales milestone, and that a major update is coming to the game with a brand new feature soon as well.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250708/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Level-5 says the game has crossed 1.2 million sales across all platforms around the world. That's another 200,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-1m-new-update" rel="nofollow">since mid-June</a>, a feat of which Level-5 can be justly proud.</p>

<p>Along with the new milestone, Level-5 also reveals that a photo mode is coming to&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>as part of an update that will be deployed "later this month". It will, as the name suggests, allow you to pause the action and take snapshots of your favorite moments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1.2m-photo-mode-menu.jpg?itok=hYUKL2DK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-sales-1.2m-photo-mode-menu.jpg?itok=EuBOOjYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is getting a photo mode later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Options will include posing characters, showing or hiding Buddies, and adjusting camera angles, as well as letting characters show their feelings through various emotes.</p>

<p>When the photo mode arrives in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 is planning to hold a photo contest in which players will be invited to "showcase their islands, house designs, and more", so be on the lookout for that closer to the time (whenever that happens to be).</p>

<p>We're still not sure when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-fantasy-life-i-dlc-roguelike-open-world" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>Update the World!</em> DLC</a> will be released, but when it is, it'll bring a brand new roguelike open-world mode to the game in which you'll have the chance to earn new gear and more.</p>

<p>You can also enjoy some free stuff by entering the code "K9E8VADB" in&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s main menu's gift code entry window, which will net you access to a bunch of nifty legendary crafting materials.</p>




<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9PP7TDRDZGHD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and the Nintendo Switch console family.

            <p>
Valve has denied reports its pulled a controversial mod from Steam around the world at the request of the South Korean government, saying the mod was only blocked in South Korea and only because it broke local laws. The mod's author is said to be behind its global removal.
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/valve-cooperates-in-banning-steam-mod-for-depicting-historical-revisionism/">Automaton</a> (citing several South Korean sources including the <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250613133900017">Yonhap News Agency</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?category=4&amp;n=214032">ThisIsGame</a>) reported Valve had agreed to a request by South Korea's Game Rating and Administration Committee (GRAC) to remove a mod for strategy RPG Mount &amp; Blade: Warband not just locally but overseas as well.
</p>
<p>
The mod, titled Gwangju Running Man, reportedly depicted the events of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising - in which student-led pro-democracy protests were violently suppressed by the South Korean military, resulting in significant civilian casualties - in a way that "distorted historical facts". It's said the mod (which featured military dictator Chun Doo Hwan as its cover), depicted protesters as "armed and violent criminals", framing the military's response as "justified".
</p>
<p>
As reports of Valve's response began circulating, some expressed concern that the company was now seemingly willing to remove content worldwide at the request of a country's government. Valve, though, has now provided clarification on the events leading to the Mount &amp; Blade mod's removal, saying access was restricted in March - but only in South Korea - after the company was informed it violated South Korean laws. Valve added the mod was then deleted from Steam in June by its original uploader, causing its worldwide disappearance.
</p>
<p>
Valve has, of course, been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-accused-of-allowing-the-proliferation-of-hate-as-report-finds-18m-instances-of-extremist-or-hateful-content-on-steam">heavily criticised for its lack of adequate content moderation</a> in the past, facing condemnation for allowing the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-steam-school-shooting-game">school shooting game Active Shooter</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-under-fire-as-sexually-explicit-game-glorifying-rape-is-listed-on-steam">Rape Day</a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">non-consensual sex game No Mercy</a> onto its store.
</p>
<p>
In 2018, following the controversy caused by Active Shooter, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-backs-away-from-content-policing-says-it-will-allow-everything-on-steam">announced it had decided to "allow everything" onto Steam</a>, provided it wasn't illegal, "or straight up trolling". While Valve has also been known to quietly remove titles when faced with significant negative public attention, it seems Gwangju Running Man specifically fell foul of its legality rules.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just in case you've been feeling like your shoe collection isn't cursed enough, Nintendo has announced a collaboration between&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>and Crocs. I'll let that sink in for a minute.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, a new collection of&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Crocs will be launching on August 26th, which is, coincidentally, the same date on which a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">trio</a> of previously console-exclusive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">games</a> cross the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">border</a> to join their rival ecosystems.</p>

<p>For adults, the&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Platform Clog comes in size ranges of 4-13 for men and 6-12 for women. These shoes will set you back $69.99, but for your cash, you'll get Crocs decorated with&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-themed pastel shades and characters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=SeHEE8v6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-crocs-nintendo-clog.jpg?itok=mH3qm_8W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look upon these Crocs, ye mighty, and despair.</figcaption></figure><p>For kids, the Kids'&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>Classic Clog comes in sizes 11C to 6Y, and it'll set you back a slightly more modest $54.99. The aesthetic is pretty similar, so you could even buy them as a matching set if you want to hasten the coming of the great Croc God of Destruction.</p>

<p>In addition to the shoes themselves, Nintendo and Crocs will also sell sets of Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, and you can apply these charms to the Crocs as you see fit. A 5-pack will cost you $16.99, and you can buy individual charms for Rosie, Marshal, and Bunnie for $5 each.</p>

<p>These unholy shoes aren't the first collaboration between Nintendo and Crocs; the company also <a href="https://www.crocs.co.uk/c/collections/more-collections/pokemon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sells a set of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-themed clogs</a>, as well as sets of Jibbitz Charms based on the likes of Eevee, Togepi, and Pikachu, among others.</p>

<p>You can also find Jibbitz Charms themed around&nbsp;<em>Super Mario&nbsp;</em>characters, although no&nbsp;<em>Mario</em>-themed Crocs have appeared yet, so at the very least, we haven't reached that stage of Ragnarok yet.</p>

            <p>If you ever wanted the chance to adorn your feet with the island living vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, then I have the news story for you.</p>
<p>Nintendo has announced an Animal Crossing collaboration with Crocs, yes the company of rubber footwear fame, which are admittedly not the most flattering of shoe options but I do appreciate their easy-drain functionality when it comes to post-water sport escapades.</p>
<p>This Animal Crossing collection sees Crocs' footwear dressed up with beachy waves and lush vegetation. Oh, and of course as with all entrepreneurial Animal Crossing endeavours, Tom Nook will also feature thanks to the new Jibbitz charms.</p>

<p>This Croc collaboration will be released on 26th August, and include the Animal Crossing Platform Clog for adults as well as the Animal Crossing Classic Clog for children. These will cost $69.99 and $54.99 respectively, with the shoes being available in the US via the official Crocs online store and select retailers (I have asked for clarification on UK pricing and availability).</p>
<p>Nintendo has also announced some individual Jibbitz charm packs. The first of these features the Able Sisters trio - Sable, Mabel and Label - as well as a shirt and backpack charm. The second pack is made up with charms of Blathers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> and Pascal, as well as a fossil and a seashell. These packs will retail for $16.99.</p>
<p>Individual charms featuring Rosie, Marshal and Bunnie will also be available for $4.99 each.</p>

<p>"Animal Crossing lets players enjoy a relaxing, slow-paced life while interacting with a cast of unique animal characters.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romero-games-not-closing-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/romero-games-says-it-hasnt-closed-down-search-for-new-publisher-is-on.1238073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Romero Games, the studio founded by legendary industry auteur John Romero, has clarified that it is not, in fact, shutting down, and that it's currently seeking a new publisher for its ongoing project.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romerogames.bsky.social/post/3ltfjxsyavs23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Romero Games says that while it's true funding for its game was pulled and that development on the game was halted, the studio is "not closed", and that "any suggestion otherwise is factually incorrect".</p>

<p>Romero Games goes on to say it held discussions regarding next steps just yesterday, and that while the studio will "reassess" its "entire staffing" structure, it's "doing everything in [its] power" to ensure closure doesn't happen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=inBt5iX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romero-games-not-closing-down-doom.jpg?itok=U1nTCsy9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Romero Games has created new levels for the original&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>, and until recently, it was working on a brand new game as well.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, Romero Games has never disclosed the publisher for its now-canceled project, although the studio says readers "may infer it from public information".</p>

<p>Just as a reminder, Microsoft recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">undertook a massive layoff wave</a> that saw around 9,000 of its employees affected. As part of that layoff wave, in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>were canceled, with the latter also closing its doors for good.</p>

<p>It seems fairly obvious to me that Romero Games is referring to Xbox as the publisher for its game, although since the project itself was never officially announced, that hasn't technically been confirmed.</p>

<p>As for the future, Romero Games says it's "currently evaluating" the "opportunities" that the aforementioned publishers have provided, so it's entirely possible that the studio's project will be revived under a different banner. We'll have to wait and see what happens next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=F-VOXCsi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-xbox-layoffs-romero-games.jpg?itok=Bt7CwhFc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox's recent layoff wave saw projects like&nbsp;<em>Everwild&nbsp;</em>canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>Amid cancellations and job losses at Xbox, Microsoft has <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> claimed that every game shown during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">its showcase this summer</a> is safe, so to speak. Still, given how suddenly these layoffs appear to have happened, it's hard to take that assertion at face value.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, as well as whether Romero Games manages to find a new publisher for its game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>One of the industry's most respected creators has joined the chorus of praise for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, the JRPG developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive. Neil Druckmann, president and creative director at Naughty Dog and creator of The Last of Us franchise, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLvd-3qh08Q/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a>:</p>



<p><em>Rolled credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I’m in awe. One of the most moving, creative stories I've played in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Druckmann, who recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> he would leave his role as co-showrunner and director of the HBO adaptation of The Last of Us to focus solely on game development, certainly isn't the only one to rate the game so highly. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the highest rated new releases of 2025 so far, not to mention one of the most successful, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">over 3.3 </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million </a><a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">units sold in 33 days</a> despite also being available on Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In his 9.5/10 review of the game on Wccftech</a>, Francesco De Meo similarly lauded the game's narrative:</p>



<p><em>Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</em></p>



<p><em>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in RPGs in a long time.</em></p>



<p>Have you played the game yet, and if so, do you agree with all these compliments?</p>

But last week, Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire were reportedly forced out the company alongside CEO Ted Gill. Now, Cleveland has shared a message for fans about his ouster and where Subnautica 2 currently stands.</p><p>In an extended post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Cleveland wrote "the events of this week have been quite a shock" in addition to recapping the history of Unknown Worlds, which began with a Half-Life mod called Natural Selection. Krafton's announcement of Cleveland's departure suggested <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/subnautica-studio-leadership-gutted-by-krafton-which-outright-says-that-subnautica-2-needs-renewed-energy-and-momentum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that Subnautica 2 isn't ready for early access</a>, an assertion that the director denies.</p><p>"We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you're ready to play it," said Cleveland. "And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p><p>"Our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world," added Cleveland. "With your Gorge plushies and your hand-drawn fish fan-art, and yes, your hard-earned dollars, you've supported us in every way, in every season, cold and warm, since Half-Life modding was even a thing. And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/subnautica-2-studio-begs-rioting-fans-for-benefit-of-the-doubt-after-leadership-axed-by-owner-krafton-the-team-that-has-been-working-on-the-game-day-to-day-over-the-last-few-years-remains-completely-unchanged/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, some fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1lqzmon/boycott_subnautica_2_remove_it_from_your_wishlist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">called for a Subnautica 2 boycott</a> and urged others to remove the game from their wish lists.

            <p>If you've played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed">Need For Speed</a> game in the last decade, odds are you've seen plenty of cars with Speedhunters stickers slapped somewhere amid whatever delightfully tacky livery their driver's decided to rock. Now, though, it looks like the EA-owned car culture site has gone dormant, with reports claiming it might have been shut down.</p>
<p>This news comes as development of NFS at EA is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now">on a hiatus</a>, with devs at Criterion having been drafted in to help deliver the next Battlefield, though exec Vince Zampella has hinted that there are still plans for the racing series going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/it-looks-like-speedhunters-is-dead">The Drive</a>, Speedhunters' site hasn't had any new stories published to it since April 3. Links to its store return an error message, and its Instagram account boasts an ominous black void as a profile photo.</p>
<p>The Drive reports having heard that Speedhunters might been shut down. We've reached out to EA for comment.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008 by <a href="https://rodchong.com/about/">Rod Chong</a>, Speedhunters have been <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/02/the-need-for-speedhunting/">backed by EA</a> since "since day one", with the various car-related articles and photography they've delivered over the years having been interspersed with plenty of NFS coverage and promo. As recently as December last year, the site were writing about <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/12/my-day-with-the-need-for-speed-bmw-m3-gtr/">the special Most Wanted BMW M3</a> that released in commemoration of the NFS series' 30th anniversary, having also covered <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/2024/08/everything-need-know-nfs-unbound-vol-8-cops-vs-racers/">updates</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/need-for-speed-unbound">NFS Unbound</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, Speedhunters has also been a regular presence in NFS games themselves via those ubiquitous stickers. One of its journalists, Dino Dalle Carbonare, even made a cameo in utterly forgettable mobile game NFS: No Limits.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shootingcars/comments/1lne5xv/comment/n0kzeg8/">Reddit comment</a> responding to chatter about Speedhunters' unclear situation, former contributor <a href="https://www.speedhunters.com/author/2279972671/">Paddy McGrath</a> wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I haven't been involved in any meaningful way with the site over the last few years (although my name is still listed as a contributor). I did have the intention of submitting stories when I could in the future, but that doesn't look like it's going to be possible anymore.</p>
<p>FWIW, there were so many times that Speedhunters was circling the drain over the last decade. We rarely knew ahead of time if our contracts would be renewed each year. A lot of brilliant and dedicated people put a lot of work in to keep things going as long as it did.</p>
<p>As you might know, Speedhunters was founded and supported by EA from day one. It wouldn't have existed without them. However, Speedhunters was such a small project in an otherwise massive company that it was never going to get the attention &amp; resources it needed to grow, IMO. Why would they spend time on a website selling some merchandise when they have multiple billion dollar video game brands to tend to? </p>
<p>As time passed, and the original EA people involved in the creation of Speedhunters moved onto other things, it became more and more difficult to keep the project afloat. I knew this day was inevitable, so made the decision years ago to diversify my client base and take all of my eggs out of the Speedhunters basket. I am genuinely sad that this does look like the end for it, it deserved so much better.</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here's hoping Speedhunters hasn't done its last set of doughnuts in front of some expensive cameras.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-need-for-speed-devs-working-on-battlefield-eas-beloved-car-culture-site-seems-to-have-shut-off-its-engine]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching on Switch this September</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Spike Chunsoft has released a new gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a>, the new title from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> / <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a> creator Kazutaka Kodaka. It provides our best look yet at the game's multi-genre mechanics, with the story branching off into five distinct paths.</p>
<p>You play as Rei Shimobe, the founder of Shuten Order who has been resurrected into a temporary body following his murder. You'll have to investigate one of Shuten Order's 'ministers', with each case presenting you with a completely unique gameplay hook.</p>
<p>For example, if you pursue Kishiru Inugami, you'll engage in a mystery adventure with point-and-click gameplay and puzzle-solving mechanics. Go after Manji Fushicho, however, and you'll be embroiled in stealth-action horror gameplay in which you need to avoid the wandering entity known as 'Nephilim'.</p>
<p>It looks awesome, and if Kodaka's previous work is anything to go by, then you can probably expect a whole bunch of unique story beats and twists as you work to solve your own murder.</p>
<p>Shuten Order launches on Switch on <strong>5th September 2025</strong> and includes an optional digital deluxe edition containing a digital art book and soundtrack.</p>

Duke Nukem and Tomb Raider's Lara Croft will be getting their own personalized tanks as they headline two separate Heroes' Paths chapters from July 10 to July 21. According the launch trailer below, Lara's chapter will have 30 stages while Duke's will have 40.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wmRci2g_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2wmRci2g_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Keeley Hawes is reprising her role as Lara Croft from a handful of Tomb Raider games that were released before the 2013 reboot, as well as Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Although Lara isn't known for using a tank, her vehicle of choice in this game is a Tier VIII U.S. versatile medium tank that comes with a lot of Lara's archeology tools including her hatchet, ropes, cables, a winch, and more.</p><p>Jon St. John--the original and only voice of Duke Nukem--is also stepping back into his iconic role for this guest appearance. Unlike Lara, Duke riding in a tank feels very much in character. His ride is a nuclear-powered TS-6, a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. Understandably, it comes with a lot of Duke's heavy ordinance including laser machine guns, grenade launchers, and other "enhanced weapons systems."</p><p>Duke and Lara's stages will include several nods to their respective histories with returning characters, cosmetics, and collectibles. A new Lara Croft theme was created for this event, while Duke Nukem's Grabbag theme will be used in his portion of the game.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Lesta Games--the Russian studio behind Mir Tankov, an offshoot of World of Tanks--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-studio-seized-by-russia-accused-of-supporting-ukraine/1100-6532140/" data-ref-id="1100-6532140">accused by Russia of illegally funneling money from its title to Ukraine</a>.

However, Wargaming and Lesta Games are no longer tied together, despite the allegations.</p>

			<p>It’s a well rehearsed line from cat people that you don’t own a cat – instead they own you. Unlike a dog’s unending loyalty and affection, cats occupy your house and stereotypically seem to barely tolerate your presence, unless they’re after food of course. A pseudo-psychological reading could easily be made about what kind of relationship you prefer based on your choice of pet, but that’s outside the scope of this review. Copycat takes the idea of the feline/human dynamic and flips the script to see it through the cat’s eyes and ends up being a touching tale of belonging and rejection.</p>
<p><iframe title="Copycat / Out Now Trailer / PS5 &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjXBLeI74Us?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin the game by choosing the appearance of your cat, Dawn. I chose the black and white as it most closely resembled my own little murder goblin, Tash. This choice takes place in the context of an animal rescue centre as your prospective owner selects you. The elderly human has just lost their own cat, and it soon becomes apparent that you are a dead ringer for the misplaced feline. This offers an interesting perspective on the relative replaceability of pets in our lives, but there is more at play here than the fickle affections of a cat owner. It turns out that Olive is experiencing the effects of old age and the inevitable diminishing of her mental capacity.</p>


<p>While Dawn is initially unwilling to be domesticated and longs to be out in the wild – even dreaming about being a majestic big cat hunting on the savannah – the slow process of accepting her place by Olive’s side is a touching part of the game. You get to play out the settling in period in which Dawn hides beneath the furniture and even lashes out in misplaced anger. This all makes the moment when Dawn bonds with Olive all the more emotionally resonant.</p>


<p>Mechanic-wise, Dawn has all the abilities you’d expect from a cat. You can run, climb, jump and swipe to your heart’s content and there are plenty of achievements/trophies to unlock through breaking things or causing chaos in Olive’s house. Once you venture out into the wider world there are rudimentary stealth and combat sections but the key thing here is the narrative with the game mechanics largely being employed to push the story along.</p>
<p>Just as Dawn begins to feel safe in her new home tragedy strikes as Olive is hospitalised and your twin nemeses appear. First there is Olive’s daughter who doesn’t feel that her mother has the capacity to care for a pet so tries to evict you, and later on, the titular Copycat – an exact replica of you who infiltrates the home and leaves you on the outside. While never fully revealed, it seems that this is actually the original Dawn and leaves you questioning ideas of who really belongs with Olive.</p>

<p>As the game progresses towards its emotional conclusion it takes in some surprisingly dark themes through Dawn’s reactions to her shifting circumstances. At one point there is even a harrowing scene where you have to control Dawn’s choice between crossing a road or giving up in front of a moving car. Your adventures in the dark alleys of the real world feel suitably hellish and are in stark contrast to both the comfort of Olive’s home and the vivid dreamworld of Dawn’s escapist fantasies.</p>
<p>Graphically, Copycat is decent but far from groundbreaking. The human characters have a real uncanny valley appearance that makes them pretty disturbing – an effect that actually plays into the game’s perspective so could certainly be deliberate. The juxtaposition between the bland real life environments and the bright dreamscapes is effective, though. The voice acting is good too, although the Australian suburban setting was far too reminiscent of classic Neighbours for this eighties kid.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Copycat is a short and focused emotional story that is well worth playing through for any fan of narrative games and/or cat owners. While the game itself is solid, it is really the writing and emotional impact of the story that elevates Copycat from being just another animal-based 3D platformer. I defy anybody not to be moved by Dawn’s turbulent experiences and the game as a whole forced me to pause and give my own cats a cuddle more than once.	</p></div>

<p>Lobbying group includes Nintendo, Sega, and more in its membership</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure><a title="Stop Killing Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4b73b9a63f9e1/stop-killing-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last couple of weeks or so, an online consumer movement has been doing the rounds that challenges the legality of publishers "destroying" video games sold to customers by revoking access following the cessation of online support. Dubbed <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">'Stop Killing Games'</a>, it consists of petitions to the European Citizens' Initiative and the UK government, with the former surpassing 1.2 million signatures at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Now, the European lobbying group <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/">'Video Games Europe'</a>, which includes Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Square Enix, and more within its membership, has responded to the movement with a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/">statement</a>, making clear that it does not support the 'Stop Killing Games' proposals in the slightest.</p>
<p>Here's what it had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable. We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>"Private servers are not always a viable alternative option for players as the protections we put in place to secure players’ data, remove illegal content, and combat unsafe community content would not exist and would leave rights holders liable. In addition, many titles are designed from the ground-up to be online-only; in effect, these proposals would curtail developer choice by making these video games prohibitively expensive to create.</p>
<p>"We welcome the opportunity to discuss our position with policy makers and those who have led the European Citizens Initiative in the coming months."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has also released a <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf">more extensive paper</a> providing further detail on its position. It stresses that forcing publishers to maintain online support indefinitely would "have a chilling effect on game design, and act as a disincentive to making such games available in Europe".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The right to decide how, when, and for how long to make an online video game services available to players is vital in justifying this cost and fostering continued technical innovation.</p>
<p>"As rights-holders and economic entities, video games companies must remain free to decide when an online game is no longer commercially viable and to end continued server support for that game. Imposing a legal obligation to continue server support indefinitely, or to develop online video games in a specific technical manner that will allow permanent use, will raise the costs and risks of developing such games.</p>
<p>"It will have a chilling effect on game design, and act as a disincentive to making such games available in Europe. It is far from a trivial modification or a simple addition to the game development phase. It would ignore material reputational, safety, and security concerns."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a complex situation, to be sure, and we should also point out that it's not Nintendo or any of the aforementioned publishers making this statement.</p>
<p>Ross Scott, a YouTuber who started the 'Stop Killing Games' movement, <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1941562023973883972">describes the arguments put forth by Video Games Europe as "flimsy"</a>, and has uploaded a fresh video talking about the topic in more detail.</p>

            <p>"Peerlessly satisfying," was how RPS guides editor and self-described "Anton Ego of factory games" Ollie Toms <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shapez-2-early-access-review">summarised Shapez 2 back at early access launch</a> in August 2024. Throwing caution to the winds, he suggested that it had "turned the holy trinity of factory games (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a>) into a holy quartet."</p>
<p>To tinker with such perfection is surely tempting the wrath of the gods, but nonetheless, developers tobspr Games have been meddling. They've just announced that they hope to release the automation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim into 1.0 this November, together with a new mode, proper modding support, and Steam achievements.</p><!--more-->
<p>To catch you up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a> is about manufacturing and feeding shapes to an insatiable cosmic sinkhole. Which is absolutely nightmarish, of course, but as regards the moment-to-moment, Shapez 2 is a laidback experience that  abstracts away many of the pressures of genre kingpins like Factorio.</p>
<p>Building space can be limited, but buildings don't cost resources and there are no outraged indigenous bug monsters to bother about. As such, you can throw up production chains and remove them without penalty, whether to free up real estate or dabble with new approaches. Going by tobspr's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2162800/view/526472884483263920?l=english">recent Steam post</a>, the ethereality of it all has perhaps carried the game a little too far into "pure" puzzling territory.</p>
<p>"The biggest complaint we get about shapez 2 right now is the persistency of factories," they write. "Many of you noted that having to tear down a factory you just built because the shape is no longer needed could feel bad. It also means that the game can feel more like a puzzle game than a factory/automation game at times - nothing is inherently bad about that in the first place, but we felt we are also missing something for the ones of you that are leaning more into the factory game direction."</p>
<p>Hence the planned new mode (teaser WIP image above), which is basically designed to ensure that "the factories you built in the beginning are still useful in the later stages of the game - so it's up to you to decide when you want to redesign, move or extend it, if at all." To put that another way, the developers are trying to avoid the issue of obsolescence. It's an interesting wrangle for a sim about mass production.</p>
<p>The developers may make this new game mode the default for new players, but they'll only do that based on playtesting and the existing mode will remain available as a "classic" option.</p>
<p>As for modding support, they're aiming to integrate mod.io directly into the game, so that you can access mods from within Shapez 2 using a browser. "I know that some of you highly prefer steam workshop, but the main issue for us is cross-platform compatibility," the devs comment. "If we ever would release shapez 2 on GOG for example, it would mean that that version wouldn't support mods for example."</p>
<p>Last but not least, they have some provisional plans for savegame compatibility as and when all of the above is introduced. Older "classic" mode saves will likely not be compatible with 1.0, but there will be a separate Steam branch where you can carry on playing those saves, the drawback being that you won't get Steam achievements or be able to use mods while playing on this older branch. Blueprints will remain compatible between modes.</p>
<p>Again, look out for all of that in November. Unless there's a bottleneck in production, anyway. "We hope we can get everything done in time so we can release it in November, but at this point we have no idea if we'll actually make it in time," the devs hedge. "So please don't be mad in case we don't."</p>
<p>Will that be reassurance enough for our guides editor Antoms Egollie, the cutthroat connoisseur of conveyer belts? Playing the analogy out, I really hope that the Shapez 2 developers are secretly rats, and that Ollie's first five minutes with the 1.0 version will trigger a flashback to the very first time his mum treated him to a nourishing bowl of gears.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/very-good-strategy-sim-shapez-2-to-get-10-release-in-november-including-a-permanent-factory-mode]]></content:encoded>
