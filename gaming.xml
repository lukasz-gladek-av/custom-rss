            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/riverbank-rpg-brings-cozy-animal-whimsy-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has announced a new TTRPG. The tabletop studio, known for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e supplements and their original fantasy RPG <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>, is launching a campaign for <em>Riverbank</em> RPG, a more cozy experience with talking animals and whimsy.</p>

<h2>The <em>Riverbank</em> RPG Announcement</h2>

<p>In a report <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/kobold-press-announces-cosy-rpg-riverbank.711779/" rel="nofollow">by EN World</a>, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG involves you playing as a member of a society of anthropomorphic animals. Their concerns aren't life and death but of cake and teatime by the slow part of the river. It is a cottagecore experience that is less <em>Redwall</em> and more <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riverbank-rpg-dressed-animals.jpg?itok=uh08AAtu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riverbank-rpg-dressed-animals.jpg?itok=IyvI3u_S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It is a cozy experience where roleplaying and decisions impact the narrative. Players can weave farcical fables or dramatic tales of elegant animals on curious quests, navigate polite Animal society, and weather the unique dynamics of life. Challenges or tensions may include attending tea parties, dancing at fancy balls, and dodging difficult relatives.</p>

<p>Since the focus is more on social navigation than swords and magic, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG will utilize an original TTRPG system. Three to five players use D4s, D6s, and D12s to resolve decisions. In addition, they must manage their characters' Animality and Poetry sides. If you fall too far one particular side, disaster may soon follow.</p>

<p>The <em>Riverbank</em> RPG was created and written by the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author Kij Johnson, the same creative mind behind <em>Ponies</em> and<em> The Fox Woman</em>. In addition, the RPG features the work of British Fantasy Award and World Fantasy Award-winning artist Kathleen Jennings.</p>

<p>Given Kobold Press' clear stances <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">against generative AI</a>, their support of these acclaimed creatives showcases their dedication to artistic projects created with human hands.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/67b1a3f2-6637-4c01-a5d3-bd3f22b78591/landing" rel="nofollow">Backerkit page</a>, the <em>Riverbank</em> RPG crowdfunding campaign will go live on March 31. At the time of writing, there are no further details regarding pledge levels, add-ons, or additional books or supplements.</p>

The game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4">originally launched on the PS4 in 2020</a> and has already received an update for those playing on the PS5. It’s not like Ellie, Joel, and Abby need much of an update for modern audiences. But while the slightly enhanced graphics — which include native 4K support and improved frame rates — are nice, they’re not really the reason to play <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>. Instead, it’s all of the <em>other</em> stuff that turns this into an excellent special edition of the game.</p><p>Some of the additions are relatively small. There’s a guitar mode where you can, well, play guitar as much as you want. Using the PlayStation controller’s touchpad to swipe guitar strings was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21318499/the-last-of-us-part-2-guitar-learn-how-to-play">one of the highlights of the original release</a>, and it’s nice to be able to mess around with it freely. I’m sure we’ll see some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6_TtIqnOsY">very cool videos</a> of people rocking out soon. You can also unlock outfits to wear while playing the main game, which is silly but fun. I’m 10 hours deep into a New Game Plus run, and Ellie has been wearing a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a> T-shirt the entire time (even though that game couldn’t exist in <em>TLOU</em>’s timeline).</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjE2MDE2" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616016/the-last-of-us-season-2-date-hbo">The Last of Us season 2 finally has a premiere date</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTM4NzM=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255066/the-last-of-us-tlou-season-two-teaser-trailer">The Last of Us’ new season 2 trailer puts Joel and Ellie through the wringer</a></h2><div><p>Warner Bros.

And as a result, the show’s second season will be a few episodes shorter than the first.</p><p>“The story material that we got from <em>Part II</em> of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin explained. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.” (Season 1 clocked in at nine episodes, for comparison.)</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/5/24172396/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-hbo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Mr. Wright goes to (the) Washington (Liberation Front).</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A first look at The Last of Us season 2.</p><p>We may have to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">wait until next year</a> to return to the post-apocalyptic show, but HBO has released these images to hold us over.

Joel walks on top of the broken watch gifted to him by his daughter Sarah at the beginning of the outbreak, Ellie stands on the guitar Joel will likely give her in the first episode of season two, and Abby is shown on top of a Firefly pendant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-co-director-chris-wilson-leaves-grinding-gear-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to recent document filings, Path of Exile Co-Director Chris Wilson has quietly left Grinding Gear Games, the studio that was co-founded in 2006 and has recently released Path of Exile 2 in Early Access. This information is public in the <a href="https://app.companiesoffice.govt.nz/companies/app/ui/pages/companies/1887410/37860802/entityFilingRequirement?backurl=%2Fcompanies%2Fapp%2Fui%2Fpages%2Fcompanies%2F1887410%2Fdocuments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Zealand Companies Office</a>, where it says that Wilson "ceased" his role as Managing Director on January 21, 2025. Despite his quiet exit, it hasn't been officially announced by Grinding Gear Games.</p>
<p>While the company has not publicly announced his departure, there have been questions from Path of Exile players about his whereabouts, as they have noticed that he has been absent in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/search/results/chris/search-within/threads-posts/forums/54/time/past-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the forums</a> and asked where he had gone. Players feel that Path of Exile 1 is on a downward trend without him being around and feel that the developers are failing those who still play the original with their <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-really-sorry-for-how-this-went-down-work-on-path-of-exile-1-326-on-hold-until-path-of-exile-2-020-has-shipped-dev-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent announcements</a> regarding updates to the predecessor of Path of Exile 2.</p>
<p>Chris Wilson was a huge part of the team, as he co-directed the first game alongside Mark Roberts. However, he did not join the co-directing of Path of Exile 2. His focus remained on the first game, and he remained a public figure regarding the development, updates, and marketing of Path of Exile. Whenever there were issues in the original game, such as streamers getting access to expansions before the rest of the players, he would dive in and give a statement as necessary.</p>
<p>Path of Exile was first released in 2013, and Wilson spoke about the plans for the ARPG to be "played forever" at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmuy9fyNUjY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2019</a>, and the decisions that went into crafting the game to be accessible and enjoyable for the long term.</p>
<p>Since then, Grinding Gear Games has been hard at work on Path of Exile 2, which entered Early Access in December 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Thus far, the game has been highly successful, with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">game breaking records on Steam</a> alongside games like Marvel Rivals. Since its release, the game has received a multitude of updates and fixes to ensure that the game is well on its way to the full release that is planned for May.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 was originally meant to be a new storyline that could be played separately from Path of Exile, but it then expanded so much that it turned into its own game, which seems to have worked out for Grinding Gear Games thus far.</p>
<p>Whether the announcement of Chris Wilson's departure will be made public by Grinding Gear Games or the man himself remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/615768/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-5070-drop-physx-support-32-bit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Remember PhysX, the GPU-accelerated technology that let games realistically simulate destructible cloth, shattering glass, moving liquids, smoke, fog, and other particle effects? It only ever got deployed in a few dozen games — but with 32-bit PhysX turned on, those games reportedly now run faster on<em> Nvidia’s last-gen cards</em> than they do on a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/598045/nvidia-rtx-5080-review-test-benchmark">5080</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">5070 Ti</a> or beyond.</p><p>That’s because Nvidia has quietly removed support for PhysX in its latest graphics chips, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fforums%2Fgame-ready-drivers%2F13%2F557200%2Fgeforce-grd-57242-feedback-thread-released-21325%2F3501715%2F" rel="sponsored">the company confirmed this week</a>, after buyers noticed PhysX games like <em>Borderlands 2</em> were mysteriously taxing their CPU instead of their GPU and either chugging or failing to work. Nvidia points to <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5615/">a support page from January</a> where it did say that the RTX 50 series would not support 32-bit CUDA applications, but that page doesn’t explicitly mention PhysX, and the company’s other PhysX support pages are several years old.</p><p>Again, we’re talking about mere dozens of games here, all over a decade old, but a good number of them were marketed by Nvidia as showcase PC games thanks to their physics simulations — and a handful of those were at least cult hits.</p><p>I fondly remember PhysX cloth effects in <em>Mirror’s Edge </em>(above) and the <em>Batman: Arkham </em>games. The best <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> also used it (<em>Black Flag</em>, the pirate one, don’t @ me) and so did <em>Metro 2033 </em>and <em>Metro: Last Light</em>.</p><p>And as you can see in the video just above, PhysX just doesn’t run terribly well without a GPU’s assistance, tanking performance when its effects are most vividly felt on screen.</p><p>Over on the ResetEra forums, RandomlyRandom67 is maintaining<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rtx-50-series-gpus-have-dropped-support-for-32-bit-physx-many-older-pc-games-are-impacted-mirrors-edge-borderlands-etc.1111698/"> an updated list of 32-bit PhysX games and how they perform on a CPU</a> instead of a GPU — users are reporting that <em>Mirror’s Edge</em>, <em>Batman</em>: <em>Arkham Asylum </em>and <em>Batman</em>: <em>Arkham City</em>, and <em>Cryostasis</em> all have significantly lower lows.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1irs8xk/comment/mdauwh3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">One Redditor claims</a> that when they forced PhysX on in <em>Borderlands 2, </em>they “got drops to below 60 FPS by just standing and shooting a shock gun at a wall,” despite having a system with today’s top PC components (an RTX 5090 and an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D). They claim their RTX 4090 never dipped below 120fps in the same game.</p><p>I won’t terribly miss PhysX, because modern games have plenty of other ways to do physics built into their various engines, but Nvidia could probably have communicated this better. It’s also just the latest evidence that its RTX 50-series cards aren’t the upgrades we’d hoped. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">My colleague Tom reviewed the new RTX 5070 Ti today</a>, and found it’s largely a cheaper RTX 4080, except maybe not cheaper because you probably won’t be able to find one anywhere near its $750 sticker price.</p><p>Nvidia’s older cards don’t seem to be losing value as a result of this year’s upgrades, either: the street price of an RTX 4080 has actually jumped over the past month, from an average eBay selling price of around $1,000 in January to over $1,200 now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fortunately, we took the time to completely uncover Emerald Stair's map so you know everything it has to offer in Avowed.</p><h2>Full Emerald Stair Map in Avowed</h2><p>Compared to Dawnshore, Emerald Stair is a much more open map that's not as full of buildings and dedicated roads to follow. While there are still roads and plenty of locations to visit, you'll find more room to roam in the animancer paradise. Emerald Stair has a total of six large regions, including Fior mes Iverno, and they are as follows:</p><ul><li>Fior mes Iverno</li><li>Maxim's Claim</li><li>Rolling Crags</li><li>The Wildwoods</li><li>The Delemgan Glade</li><li>Grim Wetlands</li></ul><p>You'll find a majority of the map's distinct regions in the bottom half of the map, but there are still sights to see in the northern parts of the map as well. Below, you can see full images of the Emerald Stair fully uncovered in Avowed:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446341" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446341"></a><figcaption>Northern Emerald Stair map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446342" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446342"></a><figcaption>Southern Emerald Stair map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png"></figure><p>As you can see, Fior mes Iverno as a whole is covered. When you enter the hub city, you can bring up a dedicated map showcasing its unique shops and areas. Then, when you exit the city, you'll see the normal Emerald Stair map again.</p><h2>Emerald Stair Key Points of Interest</h2><p>While Emerald Stair isn't quite as large as Dawnshore, it still has plenty to offer. As always, there are treasure maps to find and follow as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-defiance-pieces-and-locations-in-emerald-stair/1100-6529471/" data-ref-id="1100-6529471">Totem of Defiance</a> pieces to gather. There's also a total of 15 fast travel beacons and nine Party Camps, so you have no shortage of ways to get around the map.</p><p>You can see a full accounting of other major points of interest in Emerald Stair below:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Directly to the north of Tama's Cabin and to the northeast The Delemgan Glade. You have to climb a small cliff to reach the Adra, which is sitting at the top of the cliff.</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>The Voice's Memory is located right near the Ranger Outpost area just to the south of The Wildwoods. It's also near a fast travel beacon and not too difficult to reach.</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>The Emerald Stair Pargrun Cache is located to the west of The Wildwoods and south of The Delemgan Glade. It's tucked away near the western edge of the map in the middle of a forest.</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-earthy-aegis-treasure-map-location/1100-6529528/" data-ref-id="1100-6529528">Earthy Aegis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-practical-pockets-treasure-map-location/1100-6529529/" data-ref-id="1100-6529529">Practical Pockets</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-painters-regret-treasure-map-location/1100-6529527/" data-ref-id="1100-6529527">Painter's Regret</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Near the Naku Tedek Grounds in the south part of Emerald Stair (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-emerald-stair-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529445/" data-ref-id="1100-6529445">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>And that wraps up all the major points of interest in Emerald Stair.

                <p>Dawnshore is the first official map you can visit in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>. It's the home to Paradis, where you, as the official Aedryan envoy, need to meet with the ambassador to discuss the growing concern of the Dreamscourge. Of course, Dawnshore is home to much more than Paradis, and the fairly large map can be explored in its entirety as soon as you get off the boat at Claviger's Landing. While we recommend you complete some main story missions first, you'll eventually want to explore the majority of Dawnshore to see everything that Avowed has to offer in its opening hours.</p><p>We went through the trouble of uncovering all the necessary fog on the Dawnshore map so you know exactly where everything is located. Below, you can see the map completely uncovered along with some key points of interest.</p><h2>Full Dawnshore Map in Avowed</h2><p>If you think Paradis is big when you arrive in the city, you haven't seen anything yet. The map of Dawnshore is a gorgeous place full of secret caves, dangerously high vistas, and several different regions. In total, there are seven major regions including Paradis, and they are:</p><ul><li>Paradis</li><li>Ondra's Reach</li><li>Ivona's Threshold</li><li>Fractured Shore</li><li>Southern Embrace</li><li>Overgrown Frontier</li><li>The Rise</li></ul><p>To see everything Dawnshore has to offer, you want to visit all seven of these regions, where you'll find smaller areas that can be explored. Here are full images of the entire uncovered Dawnshore map:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446329" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446329"></a><figcaption>Northern Dawnshore map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446327"></a><figcaption>Southern Dawnshore map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png"></figure><p>The only covered part of the map is Paradis Hightown, which can't be uncovered on the map. Instead, you can visit that location directly and view a dedicated map that showcases all of its different areas.</p><h2>Dawnshore Key Points of Interest</h2><p>Dawnshore certainly has plenty to see and do, including going on a few different treasure map hunts and finding all the pieces to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-rightful-rulership-locations-in-dawnshore/1100-6529446/" data-ref-id="1100-6529446">Totem of Rightful Rulership</a>.</p><p>In total, there are 11 fast travel beacons and four Party Camps in Dawnshore, giving you plenty of ways to get around the map quicker. If you want to find all the fast travel beacons, follow the red lines that become visible on the map as you uncover more fog. Those red lines represent the main road, and fast travel beacons mostly spawn along those lines.</p><p>Below, we'll list off some points of interest in Dawnshore and where you can find them so you can visit them quickly as you play:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Right behind the Emerald Stair Gatehouse on the far eastern side of Dawnshore</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>On the edge of the Watcher's Mirror location, which is northeast of Paradis and facing the far eastern river</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>For sweet rewards, head to the top of Dawnshore right above the Pilgrim's Path and Godless Ruins. There you'll find the Pargrun Cache, which requires some work to get into but has a chest full of unique rewards. Every map in Avowed has a Pargrun Cache.</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-intimidating-feline-codpiece-treasure-map-location/1100-6529375/" data-ref-id="1100-6529375">Intimidating Feline Codpiece</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-captain-henquas-spoils-treasure-map-location/1100-6529374/" data-ref-id="1100-6529374">Captain Henqua's Spoils</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-woedicas-inheritance-treasure-map-location/1100-6529372/" data-ref-id="1100-6529372">Woedica's Inheritance</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Near the Usher's Hand area to the east of Paradis (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-dawnshore-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529403/" data-ref-id="1100-6529403">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>That just about does it for all the main points of interest on the Dawnshore map in Avowed. There are, of course, plenty of additional locations you can visit for main story and side quests, so make sure you're partaking in as much content as possible to easily explore the map. </p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

The added god is Ares, who returns from the first <em>Hades</em>: “gain his varied and vicious Boons to see if you can satisfy his thirst for blood,” Supergiant says <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-warsong-update">in a blog post</a>. You’ll also be able to meet another animal familiar and hear more than 2,000 new voice lines.</p><p>Supergiant has touched on some of its plans for the game’s early access development process, too. The studio is working on a third major update for <em>Hades II</em>, which “we intend to deliver some months from now,” Supergiant says in its blog post. Supergiant is remaining mum on when the eventual 1.0 launch might happen.</p><p>But even though <em>Hades II</em> technically isn’t finished yet, if you’re at all interested in it, I highly recommend checking it out. I’ve already put in more than 30 hours to the PC early access version, and I can’t wait to dig into everything added in this new update.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Supergiant's Hades 2 just received its second major update, which brings in a familiar face, but adds in so much more. Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld and sister to Zagreus, the protagonist of the first game, will be aided by the ultra-violent Ares and can now be granted his boons. There's also the addition of animal familiars, and several boons that have been reworked.</p><p>The Warsong Update is a free, automatic download as part of the early access development of Hades 2. Players may need to restart their Steam client to initiate the download. So let's break down what's new and improved for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpGYTlCjNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yrpGYTlCjNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>The Final Confrontation: Battle to the summit of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits...</li><li>New Olympian: Meet the god of war himself, and choose from his many Boons</li><li>New Familiar: Find one last animal companion to join your journey and aid you in battle</li><li>Revamped Boons: Gain many powerful new and improved blessings from various Olympians</li><li>Revamped Altar of Ashes: Activate several reworked effects, and each Card now has all-new artwork</li><li>Revamped Resource Gathering: Worry no more about which resources you can collect</li><li>Revamped Menus: Look for new and improved animations across many menu screens</li><li>Expanded Story: Discuss the final confrontation and more with many different characters</li></ul><p>As for general gameplay, players no longer prioritize Gathering Tools in the Training Grounds, but they can still harvest any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each Tool. Psyche can no longer be found as a Location Reward; Bones may now be found sooner, instead.</p><p>In addition, all Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style Life Bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of your Casts; previously this applied only to some of them, so watch out for that. Defenses have also been retooled, as any damage resistance effects you have no longer affect any Armor you have. Finally, Supergiant adjusted the requirements for certain key events early on. So, theoretically, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p><p>You can check out the full list of reworked Boons <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, including Chaos' Barren which, after community feedback, now reduces your Curse duration.</p><p>"Early Access continues to be an essential part of Hades II development, and we hope you can feel this reflected in our Major Updates and other patches so far," Supergiant said. "With the core structure of both the Underworld and Surface routes now fully intact, we're excited to turn our attention to filling out more of the game's content categories, finishing more and more of what we started...until we're done!"</p><p>With this update now available, Supergiant says a third major update is on the way "some months from now." There's no word on when the 1.0 release will happen.</p>

			<p>Today, Supergiant Games <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1892272985962402180" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new major <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hades II</a> update called Warsong. The patch introduces the game's final confrontation, allowing protagonist Melinoë to fight all the way to the top of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits there. There's a new Olympian (the God of War) to meet, who has many blessings to bestow upon Melinoë; and the new (and final) animal companion that will help her in battle.</p>
<p>The developers introduced several powerful new boons and improved many existing ones. The Altar of Ashes has been overhauled, though, featuring updated effects and brand new artwork. Resource gathering has been revamped, too. Players can gather any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each tool; resource appearance rates have been adjusted as well.</p>
<p>Menu screens will feature new and enhanced animations. More importantly, the story has been greatly expanded thanks to over 2,000 new voice lines, including new dialogue events for many characters.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, Psyche can no longer be found as a location reward; bones can now be found earlier instead. All Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style health bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of the player's spells. Any damage resistance effects the player has will no longer affect any armor they have. Furthermore, the requirements for certain key events have been adjusted; as a result, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p>
<p>The Warsong update also adds new foes, locations, and Chaos Trials (the Trial of Thunder, a Zeus-themed Trial set in Erebus; the Trial of Glory: a Hera-themed Trial set on Olympus; the Trial of the Fall: a Demeter-themed Trial set in the Mourning Fields; the Trial of Slaughter: an Ares-themed Trial set in Ephyra; the Trial of Destiny: a Chaos-themed Trial set on Olympus; and the Trial of Strife: an Eris-themed Trial set in Thessaly) to Hades II.</p>
<p>Supergiant Games confirmed that plans are already underway for the third big update, and the 1.0 launch, while still some time away, is getting closer.</p>

What [the protagonists’] relationship is, how they evolve, what happens, and how they go forward. But it’s definitely there.”</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>, Fares talked more on the subject of AI and its use in video games, and gave an answer that surprised me given <em>Split Fiction</em>’s obvious and admitted inspirations.</p><p>“We need to adapt to it,” Fares told <em>VGC</em>. “If it’s part of the industry we should see how to implement it to see how we get better games. I can understand the fact that some people could lose their jobs but that goes for every new technology.</p><p>“Bad stuff and good stuff will come out of it,” he continued. “You can’t just close your eyes. I believe AI will have a bigger impact on the world than the internet had, eventually. It’s a long time until you can use it in an actual development, at least not at our place, maybe others can do it.”</p><p>I would have preferred a more robust rejection of AI from Fares, and this quote does make me wonder just how boldly <em>Split Fiction </em>will make pro-art declarations when the full game launches. Ultimately, though, the game will succeed or fail on its own merits, and the three hours I played were quite promising. If you played <em>It Takes Two</em>, you probably have a good idea of what you’re getting into with <em>Split Fiction</em>. You and a co-op partner hop back and forth between different fantasy and science fiction worlds, each with their own bespoke mechanics. </p><p>In one level we fought through a cyberpunk city in which I—as sci-fi writer Mio—could manipulate gravity while my partner— playing as fantasy author Zoe—could use an energy whip to grab objects in the air and toss them at enemies and obstacles. Later, we both rode dragons through one of Zoe’s fantasy stories and flew through ruins searching for a way forward. <em>Split Fiction </em>riffs on fantasy and sci-fi tropes in each level, and even the most frustrating segments are whip-smart and delightfully intuitive. I played several levels without having to say a word to my co-op partner because the clarity of <em>Split Fiction</em>’s level design mitigates the potential disorientation that can occur when a game changes up your mechanics at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Hazelight has always excelled at designing multiplayer games that require constant adaptation and cooperation. As I sped from one level to the next to the next, none of the segments felt the same, even as they oscillated between the fantasy and science fiction genres of both heroes’ stories. Some made use of the same basic aesthetics, but that’s where the similarities ended. Not every level is a grand adventure, as <em>Split Fiction </em>delves into the absurd just as much as the epic. One level had me and my partner playing as pigs, and here I had the ability to launch myself forward with rainbow-colored farts. Eventually, we ended up as sentient hot dogs that had to cover ourselves in condiments and get inside a bun. <em>Split Fiction </em>is often silly, joyful, and too creative to stick with one idea for long.</p><p>I was only able to play about three hours of what Fares says is a 12-14 hour experience. Even if it doesn’t end up having a scathing commentary about the state of AI, I hope it is at least inventive enough to remind us that we don’t need AI to make something magical when it launches on March 6.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Split Fiction</em></strong><em>:</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eneba-games.sjv.io/dO70QK&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eneba-games.sjv.io/dO70QK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eneba</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/am4nfaopmqwde&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/am4nfaopmqwde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>For <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/googles-genie-model-creates-interactive-2d-worlds-from-a-single-image/">a while now</a>, many AI researchers have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/new-ai-model-can-hallucinate-a-game-of-1993s-doom-in-real-time/">working</a> to integrate a so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">"world model"</a> into their systems. Ideally, these models could infer a simulated understanding of how in-game objects and characters should behave based on video footage alone, then create fully interactive video that instantly simulates new playable worlds based on that understanding.</p>
<p>Microsoft Research's new World and Human Action Model (WHAM), <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">revealed today</a> in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3">a paper published in the journal Nature</a>, shows how quickly those models have advanced in a short time. But it also shows how much further we have to go before the dream of AI crafting complete, playable gameplay footage from just some basic prompts and sample video footage becomes a reality.</p>
<h2>More consistent, more persistent</h2>
<p>Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/googles-genie-2-world-model-reveal-leaves-more-questions-than-answers/">Google's Genie model</a> before it, WHAM starts by training on "ground truth" gameplay video and input data provided by actual players. In this case, that data comes from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1189800/Bleeding_Edge/"><em>Bleeding Edge</em></a>, a four-on-four online brawler released in 2020 by Microsoft subsidiary Ninja Theory. By collecting actual player footage since launch (as allowed under the game's user agreement), Microsoft gathered the equivalent of seven player-years' worth of gameplay video paired with real player inputs.</p>
<p>Early in that training process, Microsoft Research's Katja Hoffman said the model would get easily confused, generating inconsistent clips that would "deteriorate [into] these blocks of color." After 1 million training updates, though, the WHAM model started showing basic understanding of complex gameplay interactions, such as a power cell item exploding after three hits from the player or the movements of a specific character's flight abilities. The results continued to improve as the researchers threw more computing resources and larger models at the problem, according to the Nature paper.</p>
<p>To see just how well the WHAM model generated new gameplay sequences, Microsoft tested the model by giving it up to one second's worth of real gameplay footage and asking it to generate what subsequent frames would look like based on new simulated inputs. To test the model's consistency, Microsoft used actual human input strings to generate up to two minutes of new AI-generated footage, which was then compared to actual gameplay results using <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16124">the Frechet Video Distance metric</a>.</p>

                <p>When it comes to treasure, smooth gunplay, and chatterbox robots, Borderlands is in a class of its own. A new mainline entry in the looter-shooter series is set to arrive soon, and this new chapter in the ongoing saga of Vault Hunters and alien booty looks set to introduce some interesting changes to the formula of this long-running series.

We've seen glimpses of him in the trailers for Borderlands 4, and from what little information has been revealed, we do know that he's a sharp-dressed dictator aiming to create a perfect world order. That, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/">and he's apparently far more dangerous than Handsome Jack ever was</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630"></a><figcaption>One of the new locales you'll explore in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg"></figure><p>While Borderlands 3 expanded beyond Pandora to several other worlds, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/">Borderlands 4 will take place on the planet of Kairos</a>. Because the game has been designed for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, this makes Kairos a seamless and "expansive" location to explore. According to Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford, if you see an area of the world that interests you, you'll be free to explore it.</p><p>"One of the challenges with the term 'open world' is other games have done different things with that and there's things that we're doing that none of them have done," Pitchford said. "But there are things that we, specifically, don't do because we are Borderlands. And we care so deeply about combat dynamics and care so deeply about that moment-to-moment feeling. We craft this [world]. Everything that unfolds has [purpose]. You can feel the heart of the designer behind it. You can tell, people that care a lot made this shit."</p><p>"They're putting this here for [the player]. This isn't all just a systemic, algorithmically filled world. So be careful when you're talking about this. I wouldn't say 'open world' because that [term] will come with baggage. That isn't what we are. But it is seamless, and it is expansive, and it is larger than anything we've ever done, and it is filled like nothing we've ever done."</p><p>As for the world itself, Gearbox describes it as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/">high-tech but lo-fi location</a> full of interesting opportunities for players to experiment with gameplay and weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629"></a><figcaption>Meet the new Vault Hunters of Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now let's talk about what we know about the game's playable characters so far.</p><p>Vault Hunters are the bread and butter of Borderlands games, as each unique character allows you to experience the main campaign from a different angle. There'll be four Vault Hunters to choose from on launch day--a tradition that dates back to the first Borderlands game--and each one will offer a specific archetype role. Gearbox hasn't elaborated on the Vault Hunter classes yet, but judging from the early gameplay trailers, it looks like we'll get to play as a hulking gunslinger, powerful Siren, and melee-focused swordsman in Borderlands 4.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_development_news">Borderlands 4 development news</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631"></a><figcaption>This new Vault Hunter is an absolute unit</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Like the previous games, Borderlands is a looter-shooter that mixes an exotic selection of weapons with unique action skills. The previous game shook up its bread-and-butter gunplay by making each weapon family--Dahl, Hyperion, Maliwan, Atlas, Vladof, Tediore, and Torgue--feel even more distinct from each other, so it'll be interesting to see if this idea carries through to Borderlands 4.</p><p>Gearbox has added that it wants to find a balance between approachability and complexity with the gameplay, both with the core first-person-shooting action and the RPG skill-trees that could be customized to create powerful Vault Hunter builds. At the same time, you can expect billions of different weapons to collect on your journey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">Gearbox wants to cut back on</a> the "overabundance of toilet humor" that Borderlands 3 heavily relied on.</p><p>It also wouldn't be a Borderlands game without an option to catch a ride! So far, we've seen a chunky hoverbike and a high-tech chariot straight out of the pod-racing scene from Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, and it'll be interesting to see what else we can get behind the wheel of in the full game.</p><p>While you'll be able to get around Kairos with one of several new vehicles, a big upgrade to the gameplay is a grappling hook that can be used to reach areas and help you out in combat.</p><p>The other big question we're still waiting to see answered relates to what we can expect <em>after </em>Borderlands 4 launches.</p><p>In a tradition dating back to the very first Borderlands game, Gearbox has regularly supported its looter-shooters with post-launch DLC expansions. The developer has yet to confirm if this will be the case for Borderlands 4, but we wouldn't be too surprised to see history repeat itself here.</p><p>Some of the best Borderlands stories have come from these expansions after all--like Assault on Dragonkeep, The Claptastic Voyage, and Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot--so here's hoping we get a few more post-launch episodes.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4 State of Play event</a> is set for this spring, so it might not be much longer until Gearbox shows off and discusses the game even more.</p>

For the launch of the season, Blizzard has sweetened the deal with some limited-time event challenges that reward even more loot boxes than will be normal. Plus, Discord is getting in on the loot box action as well, offering five of them as a reward for a new quest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For the Discord quest, all players will need to do is accept the quest via the app and then play Overwatch 2 for 15 minutes. After completing and claiming the quest, players can redeem the code via Battle.net to receive their five free loot boxes. Quests can be found and accepted in the Discord app via the Discover tab. Players will have until February 25 to accept and complete the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Overwatch 2 weekly event challenges, players will need to first complete five matches (with wins counting as two) and then 15 matches to earn another five loot boxes per challenge. Since wins count as two, these can be done in just a few matches if your team comes out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the Discord quest, and that's a total of 15 loot boxes for very little overall playtime. Players will have until February 25 to complete the in-game challenges, which also feature other rewards like the Rainy Day skin for Mercy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">Loot boxes work a little differently now</a> from when they first debuted in the original Overwatch. For starters, players can't buy them outright, though they are included as part of the game's free and paid battle pass. An item of Rare or better quality is guaranteed to drop from each box. After opening five boxes, players are guaranteed an Epic-quality item, with a guaranteed Legendary drop after opening 20 boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes isn't the only big change as part of Overwatch 2 Season 15, Honor and Glory. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">shakes up Overwatch 2's gameplay in a major way with the introduction of Perks</a>, mid-match upgrades that augment a hero's abilities or even give them entirely new ones.

<p>The MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is MSI’s latest motherboard geared towards that mid-to-lower premium range of gamers and power users who need a board that can handle top-tier components and future upgrades. Featuring the new LGA 1851 designed for the new Intel Arrow Lake processors, MSI put in one of its best efforts when it comes to features, ease of use, an overall look. But is there enough here to justify the $400-plus price point?</p>



<h2 id="h-msi-mpg-z890-carbon-wifi-review">MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi Review</h2>



<p>Despite what people might tell you, a quality motherboard can be just as important as the CPU going in your system. In many ways, it’s the backbone of your gaming rig, and <a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MPG-Z890-CARBON-WIFI/Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picking the right one</a> can make or break your experience. What MSI has with the MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is a product aimed at making that experience as easy as possible, no matter how well versed you are in building your own machine.</p>



<p>It all starts with the overall design.</p>



<p>Building a PC can sometimes feel like a test of patience, but this motherboard makes it as painless as possible. The pre-mounted I/O shield is a small but welcome touch, saving you from the hassle of aligning it just right and possibly snapping or bending the shield. Labels on the board itself are clear and beginner-friendly, making it easier to slot everything into place without second-guessing yourself.</p>



<p>Installing components is refreshingly simple. The tool-less PCIe x16 slot release is a game-changer for those rocking a massive GPU like the RTX 4090 as there’s no more wrestling with tiny latches or putting an obnoxious amount of pressure just to unlock the card from the board. And the screwless M.2 installation? A dream. Pop the drive in, click it down, and you’re done.</p>

<h3 id="h-layout-amp-accessibility">Layout &amp; Accessibility</h3>



<p>MSI does a solid job with the board’s overall layout. Everything feels well-placed on this ATX board, making cable management and clean builds way more achievable.</p>



<p>There are three PCIe slots for components. The top is PCIe 5.0 x16, perfect for modern graphics cards. The middle slot is PCIe 5.0 x8 while the third is PCIe 4.0 x4.</p>



<p>For storage, there are plenty of options. Five M.2 slots give you plenty of space to make sure you always have enough storage on your machine. My only problem is that only one supports PCIe 5.,0 speeds. For a motherboard in this price range, you’d expect at least two or three. If you’re planning a full Gen 5 build, that could be a letdown.</p>



<p>With cooling and RGB, there are 7 fan headers, 4 RGB headers, a 3-pin water flow sensor, and a 2-pin thermal sensor that gives you a lot of flexibility.</p>



<h3 id="h-connectivity-galore-and-then-some">Connectivity Galore (And Then Some)</h3>



<p>When you are spending, possibly, as much as your CPU on the motherboard, one thing you’ll want to make sure of is that what you buy has the connections you need. And one thing the MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi doesn’t skimp on is connectivity.</p>



<p>On the rear I/O, there are 13 total USB ports—10 USB-A 3.2 and 3 USB-C. The 10 USB-A ports support up to 10Gbps while one of the USB-C ports also supports 10Gbps. The other two USB-C are Thunderbolt 4 with DisplayPort output that have speeds up to 40Gbps.</p>



<p>If you need more USB functionality, there are four USB 2.0 headers, four USB 5Gbps Type-A headers, and even a single 20Gbps USB Type C header. Again, if you need connections, this board <em>has </em>connections. With everything I use on a daily basis—Stream Deck, capture card, audio interface, and multiple external drives, just  to name a few—I have found no issue with speeds or connection quality in the months I’ve used this motherboard. For full transparency, there were times with the last-gen Z790 Carbon WiFi where you could sense a noticeable slowdown when trying to move files across external drives even with a high-end CPU. That hasn’t happened once with the Z890.</p>



<p>For the wireless user, the motherboard supports Wi-Fi 7 with speeds up to 5.8Gbps as well as Bluetooth 5.4. There are still some issues with Bluetooth audio cutting in and out, but I have yet to find a motherboard that works perfectly on that front. Two LAN ports support 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps.</p>



<p>On the audio front, the board has built-in optical output with 7.1 channel audio.</p>



<h3 id="h-bios-amp-customization">BIOS &amp; Customization</h3>



<p>It’s long been my opinion that MSI has one of the most user-friendly BIOS there is. With the Z890 Chipset, this becomes even more so with a new look that makes it even easier to find and adjust the settings you’d like. It’s as straightforward as it can be in my opinion, even if you’re not a seasoned overclocker.</p>



<p>As you’d expect from any BIOS, MSI’s offers users the ability for custom fan control, overclocking, boot order, and more. What makes it stand out, however, is how simple they make it. </p>



<p>The  EZ Mode works as expected, which isn’t always the case with some BIOS. From boosting the CPU to NPU to Memory, everything is one click away, which helps take the worry out of your hands. If you want to get more in the weeds, however, even the Advanced Settings are laid out in a way to prevent you from getting overwhelmed.</p>



<p>Everything from PCIe settings to P-Core and E-Core ratios to CPU and Memory Frequency and more is available for your adjustment. Just be careful. If you do decide to try your hand at overclocking, or messing with the settings at all, take it slowly and in increments. Making too large of a change could lead to stability problems and damage your machine.</p>



<p>Lastly, there’s the MSI proprietary software like MSI Center, Mystic Light, and others. Personally, I find these programs to weigh down a system more than help it. Mystic Light for RGB management is kind of a neccessity if that’s what you need to pair with other programs, but for hardware monitoring, there are other lightweight options.</p>



<h3 id="h-msi-mpg-z890-carbon-wifi-review-verdict">MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi Review Verdict</h3>



<p>The MSI MPG Z890 Carbon WiFi is one motherboard with a ton going for it.  It has plenty of connectivity options, a great-looking design, and is one of the easiest borders to build in for the DIY PC enthusiast. It’s price can scare people away, especially with the belief that the LGA 1851 socket will only be supported with new CPUs until 2026. That said, if you are looking at picking up this board, it’s likely you won’t be upgrading again for quite some time. </p>



<p>The support for DDR5 RAM and PCIe 5.0 helps future proof the board as much as you can with how fast technology moves. Again, it would’ve been nice for more PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots, but I don’t think it’s a deal breaker. If the $400-plus price tag doesn’t scare you away, you’d honestly be hard-pressed to find a more well-rounded motherboard.</p>
