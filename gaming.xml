			<p>Despite the high minimum system requirements of the PC version, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is playable on Steam Deck, although with some major compromises in terms of frame rate and image quality.</p>
<p>As highlighted in a new review by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SteamDeckHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Deck HQ</a>, the second entry in the Remake trilogy which launches tomorrow on PC, is more than playable on Steam Deck, keeping a 30 FPS framerate throughout the game, which is stable even in the more demanding open areas of the game. Unfortunately, plenty of compromises had to be made to keep this relatively solid 30 frames per second framerate, as dynamic resolution scaling had to be enabled, which leads to a blurry image here and there and some ghosting. Framerate in towns with a lot of NPCs is also unstable, dropping into the 20s range depending on the city, and one of the biggest issues seen in the PlayStation 5 version, the aggressive pop-in in the open areas, is also present on Steam Deck. Still, everything considered, it is definitely impressive to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth run as well as it does on the handheld system.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launches on PC tomorrow, January 23rd. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-ceo-founder-ted-price-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After more than 30 years with the company, Insomniac Games CEO and founder Ted Price is stepping down. His role will be filled by three of the studio's executives, who are stepping up as co-studio heads.</p>

<p>In a Sony <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Price says he's retiring from the industry as a whole rather than moving on to new opportunities. He says he's leaving the studio in "one of the strongest positions we've experienced in years", and that he's put a succession plan in place that will provide "continuity, stability, and strong leadership".</p>

<p>To that end, three execs will be stepping up to fill Price's shoes: marketing and brand head Ryan Schneider, finance head and CFO Jen Huang, and head of creative Chad Dezern. It's not clear whether they'll also continue those roles in addition to heading up Insomniac.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-insomniac-games.jpg?itok=r4AAaSQJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvels-spider-man-2-insomniac-games.jpg?itok=c4ZUgwac 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Insomniac's most recent game is&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Schneider, Huang, and Dezern share their vision for Insomniac, which, it turns out, is "to preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years", although they do also say they're looking for ways to "strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come".</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like a great deal is going to change in an operational sense with Price's stepping down. It's likely that you'll notice the difference far more if you're an Insomniac employee than if you're a fan of their games.</p>

<p>The three do eulogize Price's career in a rather touching way, though, calling him "not just our leader" but also "our longtime friend" and praising his "ability to inspire everyone around him to grow".</p>

Price will officially step away at the end of March, and he’s being replaced by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/">three new studio heads</a> who will take over Insomniac moving forward.</p><p>According to Price, the succession process has been in the works for a while. “I actually made this decision last year,” he explains. “For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.”</p><div><p>Insomniac was founded in 1994, and since then has gone on to create multiple hit games and franchises, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em></a>, <em>Resistance</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7073527/sunset-overdrive-review"><em>Sunset Overdrive</em></a>, and, more recently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5"><em>Spider-Man</em></a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/19/20812656/sony-insomniac-games-acquisition-spider-man-ratchet-clank-developer-playstation">In 2019 the studio was acquired by PlayStation</a>, and it’s currently working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665529/insomniac-wolverine-ps5">a Wolverine game</a>.</p></div><p>Taking over for Price will be Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang. Dezern previously served as Insomniac’s creative lead, and has been with the studio nearly since its inception, while Schneider was the Head of Franchise Strategy and Studio Relations and joined the studio during the PS2 years. Huang, meanwhile, has been Insomniac’s CFO for the past eight years.</p><p>“I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust,” Price said of the new co-studio heads.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Spending around 14,000 yen a day, he’s opened the maximum number of pretend packs of Pokémon cards possible since the game launched around 12 weeks ago. That works out to almost $9,000, although to be fair he likely took advantage of monthly discount offers, perhaps making the total cost closer to $8,500. A bargain for a mobile card game!</p><p>Now, I wish I could piously report that I’ve never spent a single cent on <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>, but this would be a big lie. I have, in fact, paid for the god-awful Premium Pass for three months running (partly out of some naive belief that the company might finally see fit to add some actually meaningful missions to the battle pass, and partly because I’m as dumb as anyone and just want that extra pack a day), alongside a couple of occasions where I’ve—with plenty of guilt—paid some real-life money for a pile of imaginary golden coins. I wanted to open even more packs, OK!? Was it worth it? No! Of course not! But I got to watch the little ripping animation so many times, and the dopamine feedback loop is real. But I’ve spent maybe $50 total? With that, I’ve pulled a total of 1,476 cards.</p><p>Of course, Hajimesyacho is playing with YouTube money. He has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@hajimesyacho/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@hajimesyacho/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15.5 million subscribers on his channel</a></span>, with regular viewing numbers in the seven digits, so he’s spending money to make money. (Why he’s playing in French, I have no idea.) It’s the sort of goof you can do in that situation. But it also really underlines just how ridiculous the spending limits are on the game.</p><p>I go back and forth on this subject—catch me in an hour and I might have changed my mind—but when something is so gambling-adjacent, I feel like there should at the very least be a way to set personal spending limits within the app. It’s currently possible to spend $38,235 per year opening packs in <em>Pocket,</em> and I’m not entirely convinced that half the average U.S. salary is the amount Pokémon should be willing to take off any one customer. And to be clear, this is how much you can spend just opening packs—you can keep on buying more Gold if you want to.</p><p>Obviously, there’s no way to financially benefit from playing <em>PTCG Pocket</em>, so at least it stops short of having any of the real-world game’s resale market. Even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-rules-gold-cards-date-1851741957">when trading finally arrives this month</a></span>, it can’t be converted to cash via third-party apps or the like. But there’s still this residual ickiness given how the more packs you buy, the better chance you have of pulling the ultra rare cards, and believe me, the pull is strong. There are these pretty things just out of your reach, and if you only pay a <em>bit more</em>, they could be yours!</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">You can fully enjoy the mobile game without ever spending a penny</a></span>, but obviously The Pokémon Company doesn’t want you to. Although let me attest, while I’ve been weak a couple of times, I’ve still managed to pull a pretty impressive array of very  pretty cards, mostly on the daily grind.</p><p>In fact, given we’re learning that so many seemingly random elements in the game are in fact not (the pack you get from the carousel seems to be pre-determined, and it’s now widely believed that Wonder Picks are equally decided for you), I’m noticing that in the last few days I’ve been very coincidentally suddenly filling in a whole bunch of conspicuous gaps in my Genetic Apex Pokédex. And yes, it could just be random fortune, but there sure have been a lot of them showing up. And yay! But also, hmmmm.</p><p>Anyway, point is, don’t be like Hajimesyacho, unless you, like Hajimesyacho, have more money than you know how to spend. Maybe open a couple of packs a day and then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://immigrantjustice.salsalabs.org/donatefy2025/index.html?utm_content=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://immigrantjustice.salsalabs.org/donatefy2025/index.html?utm_content=PANTHEON_STRIPPED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some money to charity</a></span>?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda remake are coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025. At least, that’s according to one store listing online.</p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">popular e-tailer Newegg</a>, the product description for a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card mentions a number of games coming in 2025. According to that description, which you can see below, 2025 will feature “Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, A Legend of Zelda Remake/Remaster, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, Pokemon Legends: Z-A”.</p>







<p>A new Mario Kart was already confirmed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the reveal trailer</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2. A new 3D Mario and A Legend of Zelda Remake have been rumored and expected, but there’s been nothing in the form of a confirmation from Nintendo. While this can’t be viewed as a confirmation, either, it’s still something from a major storefront.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Newegg and Nintendo regarding the store posting and its accuracy. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly as well as posted on Insider Gaming’s social media channels. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-nintendo-switch-2-launching-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially revealed</a> on January 16. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full Nintendo Direct</a> on the new system is set to air on April 2, which is expected to reveal full specs, pricing, release date, and more. There are also rumors of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-to-release-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major AAA games</a> coming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the system</a>, though it’s unknown if any will be announced during the Nintendo Direct.</p>

            <p>PlayStation hit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> released towards the end of last year, and quickly won itself praise for its platforming prowess and limitless charm. It went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">win Game of the Year at the Game Awards in December</a>, but its award-winning streak didn't end there.</p>
<p>Astro Bot was nominated for four awards at the New York Game Awards last night, which were co-hosted by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>. Of those four, it went on to win three: The Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game, the Central Park Children's Zoo Award for Best Kids Game and the Big Apple Award for Best Game of the Year.</p>

<p>With Fils-Aime hosting, and after numerous comparisons between Astro Bot and some of Nintendo's own Mario platformers, the stage was set for the big man to give his verdict. Thankfully, his words about Astro Bot were playful and full of praise. </p>
<p>"I have to admit it," Fils-Aime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=jPsQ7JX8G4Q">said</a>, "Astro Bot almost outdid Nintendo at its own game." This good-humoured remark was met by appreciative laughter.</p>

<p>We here at Eurogamer were equally taken with Astro Bot on its release, awarding it a sparkling five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"When it's all done I'm left with that strange feeling of being very well cared for. I've seen a bunch of wild sights. I've messed around with cool gadgets, used the controller in unusual ways, tilting it, yes, but also blowing into it, trying to read the buried hieroglyphs of its rumble, I've ticked boxes, collected things, unlocked things, nodded at references that make me feel old, or sharp-eyed, or generally in the know," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer's Astro Bot review</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry, meanwhile, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-astro-bot-is-virtually-flawless-a-ps5-masterpiece-and-a-gaming-celebration">Astro Bot "virtually flawless and a joyous celebration of gaming"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An iconic anthem from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> was heard on the runway this week during a Louis Vuitton fashion show by Pharrell Williams.</p>
<p>Yes, bizarre as it may seem, a bunch of moody male models lazily wandered along a catwalk as the stabbing, dramatic strings of bad boy Sephiroth's theme song One Winged Angel were performed by a live orchestra.</p>
<p>Williams is the Men's Creative Director at the French fashion house and was in charge of the music selection, which also included tracks he's written for The Weeknd and multiple K-pop acts.</p>

<p>One Winged Angel, from series composer Nobuo Uematsu, certainly makes for an intense opening though, and stands out from the other hip-hop tracks.</p>
<p>Why was it chosen? It certainly doesn't seem to relate to the actual fashion show, which was more preppy, tweed tailoring and streetwear than wings and long silvery hair.</p>
<p>Still, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> certainly seems pleased with the inclusion. And as musician Alex Moukala pointed out, Pharrell's debut album cover with NERD features a band member playing a PS1, so maybe this is a full circle moment.</p>

<p>This isn't even the first time Final Fantasy music has been heard at an event this year. AEW wrestler Kenny Omega debuted a new entrance song at Wrestle Dynasty in Tokyo earlier this month, which was written by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> and 16 composer Masayoshi Soken.</p>
<p>Omega is clearly a fan of the series, considering his finishing move is called the One Winged Angel.</p>

<p>It's also not the first time we've seen a Final Fantasy collaboration with Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, Final Fantasy 13 protagonist Lightning appeared in a Louis Vuitton campaign to become an unlikely fashion icon.</p>
<p>It's a big week for Final Fantasy 7 fans as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-technical-specs-revealed-ps5-console-exclusive-being-optimised-for-steam-deck">Rebirth is released on PC</a>, which comes with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-verified-for-steam-deck-handheld">Steam Deck verification</a> too but hopefully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">no weird mods</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie studio Yahaha Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special</em>, a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Clock Tower&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, will be coming to Steam Early Access "soon".</p>

<p>In a press release, the studio describes the game as a mixture of "nostalgic '90s 16-bit gameplay" and "cinematic horror", with touchstones like Dario Argento's giallo movies and classic 80s slashers contributing to its tone and aesthetic.</p>

<p><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>casts you as Sarah, a babysitter (because of course she is) who gets caught up in what Yahaha describes as "a night of psychological terror". I don't think it's possible to be a babysitter without going through at least one of those.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=FIbhkWE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=57pO8UWO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure, and you can try it out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>You can look forward to spooky delights like "eerie phone calls", which feel like a classic trope for 70s and 80s horror, and "a seemingly alive plastic dinosaur", which absolutely doesn't feel like a trope.</p>

<p>Yahaha says you'll like this one if you're a fan of old-school survival horror, point-and-click adventure games, and "atmospheric mysteries that keep you guessing", and it's hard to imagine anyone who isn't a fan of the last one on that list, at least.</p>

<p>Most intriguingly, the developer promises a touch of "retro sci-fi" in&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>as well, so it sounds like things take a decidedly weird turn. Consider me on board for this one.</p>

<p>The game's Steam page shows off some rather evocative imagery, including what looks like a millipede crawling in and out of the mouth and eye sockets of a corpse. You'll probably know whether this one's for you or not based on that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=F9qXw-5W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=3sXYyJPx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like spooky vibes and 80s horror,&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you don't have to judge by screenshots alone; a demo is available for you to check out right now. All you've got to do is download it on Steam and you're set.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it lands, it'll come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>. The devs estimate it'll stay there for around 12-18 months before getting a full release.</p>

A new six-minute trailer shows exactly why, and gives the vibe that <em>Phantom Blade 0</em> could be the next <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194513" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="192" data-playlist="194513,197298,197284" data-current="194513"><div><p>Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19959.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new footage released in preparation for the Chinese New Year next week shows the game’s protagonist facing off in a boss fight against the “Seven Judgements,” a formation of warriors constantly trading attacks and healing one another. We also get a look at new snake-shaped swords, a venomous softblade, and savage ax and ink cut abilities, </p><p>The second phase of the boss fight shows one of the Seven Judgements resurrected as a puppet on a string swinging through the battlefield as death metal rock plays in the background. Again, while it all has the look and presentation of a <em>Dark Souls</em> game at first glance, the speed of combat and the array of abilities locates it much closer to a traditional action-game genre. The trailer ends with the puppet unleashing one final ultimate attack before being defeated.</p><p>Made by Bejing-based developer S-Game, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> is another blockbuster breakout from a studio that previously worked on much smaller games. It follows a warrior named Soul who is framed for a murder and has only 66 days to find the true killer, before a magic spell keeping him alive ends. Designer Soulframe Liang has called it a semi-open world game and likened its presentation to “kung fu punk.”</p><p>After <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>—another debut AAA action game from a Chinese studio—became one of 2024's breakout hits, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> so far looks like it has the potential to follow a similar trajectory. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1881776112025620742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1881776112025620742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaming consultant Daniel Camilo claims</a></span> <em>Black Myth</em>’s success was actually crucial to getting extra funding for <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, suggesting the game might end up being even more ambitious than its developers initially planned. </p><p>We won’t know for sure until it actually comes out, and a release date has been conspicuously missing from the last year of gameplay reveals. Maybe S-Game is waiting for the next PlayStation showcase to reveal it. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, confirming five new multiplayer maps and a returning mode during Season 2.</p>



<p>Starting January 28 when the new season launches, players will get access to three new maps with two additional ones coming mid-season. The three maps coming at the beginning of the season are Bounty, Dealership, and Lifeline while Bullet and Grind come midseason. As far as the location details, there’s not much to go on with the maps aside from what was shown in the short trailer.</p>



<p>Lifeline is a small map that’s set on a burning ship in the middle of the sea; dealership takes place in an area surrounding a car dealership of some sort; and bounty, while hard to fully decipher, appears to be at a mansion or museum. Again, however, that was the toughest to see the exact location.</p>







<p>In addition to the new maps, Black Ops 6 Season 2 sees the return of Gun Game along with new weapons such as swords. Lastly, the trailer gives a glimpse at the new Zombies map, The Tomb. According to Treyarch, The Tomb was designed with “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”.</p>



<p>Full details on everything coming in Season 2 is expected this week. One detail that’s been confirmed is that players will be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-disabling-crossplay-ranked-console-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn off cross-play</a> in Ranked Mode moving forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fresh-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-2-details-confirmed-alongside-new-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 2, which kicks off later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 goes live on January 28 and adds five Multiplayer maps — Bounty, Dealership, Lifeline, Bullet (Mid-Season), Grind (Mid-Season) — and sees the return of the fan-favorite Gun Game mode, and adds new weapons and operators.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer offers a look at Bounty, Dealership, and Lifeline, the latter of which looks like a small version of the much-loved Hijacked MP map from Black Ops 2. Dealership looks like it's set in a car dealership. It's hard to make out the setting for Bounty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with an apparent ninja theme, the trailer confirms the addition of swords via an operator dual wielding katanas. Developer Treyarch had already teased the addition of an “iconic” SMG with Season 2, and it’s rumored to be the PPSH-41 from Call of Duty: Vanguard​​​​​​.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Zombies, the trailer shows a first look at gameplay of the new map, The Tomb, as well as an ice staff. Warzone does not appear to be represented in the video. Activision is expected to publish a Season 2 roadmap shortly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans eagerly awaiting the launch of Season 2 not just for new content, but for promised improved anti-cheat tech.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-will-let-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ranked-console-players-disable-crossplay-with-pc-as-cheating-complaints-ramp-up">it plans to let console Ranked players disable crossplay with PC players for the launch of Season 2</a>, with more improvements coming in subsequent seasons after a backlash over cheating across Black Ops 6 Multiplayer and in the battle royale, Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Warzone, Activision has said Season 2 will have less content than originally planned as it addresses some of the more severe issues currently afflicting the game. It will focus on gameplay tuning, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements with the coming season, pushing back new content originally planned for the launch of Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    <p><span>Games industry icon says goodbye after 30 years.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Insomniac Games [305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a> CEO Ted Price will retire from the games industry at the end of March after 30 years, he <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. Studio veterans Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang will become Insomniac Games’ new co-studio heads. <span id="more-939685"></span></p><p>Here a message from Ted Price on his retirement:</p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’d like to start this blog by acknowledging how difficult things have been for our team members and our players in Los Angeles over the past several weeks. As I write this, news reports are being shared predicting more challenges ahead with the fires due to extreme weather.</p><p>Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and we’ll continue to work with our peers at Sony to support our team members and their families as they continue to deal with the tragic situation.</p><p>I’m so proud of the numerous Insomniacs who have rallied to help others in LA both inside and outside of Insomniac. Helping those who are less fortunate is part of our mission statement. Insomniacs embrace it daily and it’s one of so many aspects of our culture that I love.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Another aspect of our culture I hold dear is the Insomniacs’ ability to pull together and successfully overcome what often seem like insurmountable obstacles.</p><p>Speaking of which, despite a challenging 2024, Insomniacs stayed fully focused on building games for our fans. As a result of the team’s persistence and collaboration, we’re in one of the strongest positions we’ve experienced in years, with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic.</p><p>Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March. Today, I’m sharing this news more broadly.</p><p>I actually made this decision last year. For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.</p><p>During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades.</p><p>So also today, I’m extremely happy to announce that Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider and Jen Huang will become Insomniac Games’ new Co-Studio Heads.</p><p>I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust.</p><p>For many years, Chad, Jen, and Ryan have been instrumental in making Insomniac what we are today. I’ve seen each lead major initiatives here which have positively changed Insomniacs’ lives. Plus, they’ve consistently demonstrated the kind of collaboration and transparency that’s part of our DNA. And just as important, their skillsets are truly complementary.</p><p>There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.</p><p>To conclude this blog, Insomniac has been my life, my home away from home, for three decades.</p><p>I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life. Working side by side with Insomniacs for so many years has been a gift that I’ll cherish for the rest of my days.</p><p>I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support – inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won’t be slowing down.</p><p>As for me, I’m very excited to officially join the ranks of Insomniac fans. I can’t wait to experience our future games purely as a player. Plus, I can’t remember the last time I played any game and wasn’t unconsciously scanning for bugs. I’m ready to break that habit!</p><p>Finally, I’m confident that under the combined leadership of Chad, Jen and Ryan, Insomniac will continue to deliver the industry-defining games that players have come to expect from us… while making a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives for decades to come.</p><p>Thank you to Insomniacs, to our players and to videogames for 30 wonderful years.</p><p>—Ted Price</p></blockquote><p>And here are <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messages from each new co-studio head</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ryan Schneider, Co-Studio Head, Insomniac Games</strong></p><p>“I started my Insomniac career during the <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> era in studio marketing and communications, quickly shifting my role to become Insomniac’s first community director and helping establish the role within the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> ecosystem. I joined Insomniac’s senior leadership team several years ago and have held multiple studio roles including Head of Franchise <a title="Genres > Strategy [214 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a> &amp; Studio Relations. In that role I partnered with teams within and beyond Sony Interactive on how and when we talk about our games, including in-game creative integrations. More recently, I’ve served as Head of Brand &amp; Leadership Strategy, which means I’m ensuring through communications, coaching and culture development that what Insomniac says to the world about itself and our games matches what we believe and how we act inside Insomniac.</p><p>“Outside of work, I play games with my family almost nightly. We enjoyed completing <em><a title="Games > ASTRO BOT [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/astro-bot">ASTRO BOT</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a title="Games > LEGO Horizon Adventures [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a></em> over the winter break. I also love cycling (road and gravel).”</p><p><strong>Jen Huang, Co-Studio Head, Insomniac Games</strong></p><p>“I joined our incredible studio eight years ago as [Chief Financial Officer] and Head of Finance, and our team has had my heart ever since. As part of our leadership team, I directly support our development teams across all titles, overseeing project planning, production strategy, business operations, resource planning, and co-development partnerships. Together with the best team in the world, we’ve shipped 12 games since my first day, and I’m super excited about the unforgettable experiences we’ll bring to players in the future.</p><p>“Before joining Insomniac Games, I was a senior finance executive, providing strategic and financial leadership to global tech and entertainment businesses.</p><p>“I’m passionate about driving innovations that elevate our studio and community. Outside of work, I support Glendale’s neighborhood libraries and love playing games with my kids. Over the holidays, I immersed myself in <em>ASTRO BOT</em>&nbsp;and <em><a title="Games > Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a></em>—and loved those unforgettable <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,004 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.”</p><p><strong>Chad Dezern, Co-Studio Head, Insomniac Games</strong></p><p>“One afternoon, I picked up a copy of <em>Spyro The Dragon</em> for Research™ purposes. I was floored by its charm and attention to detail—here, clearly, was the work of a team at the top of their game, and I wanted to learn their secrets.</p><p>“I joined Insomniac in 1998. Since then, I’ve had the honor to contribute to five generations of PlayStation as an Environment Artist, Art Director, Studio Director for the Durham studio, and—starting in 2017—as the Head of Creative. As a senior leader, I support the creative, story, and research teams across all titles to help ensure that our games ship with a uniquely Insomniac vision and a high degree of polish.</p><p>“So what secrets did I learn? Mainly that magic happens when talented people build on each other’s ideas even as they challenge each other to advance their craft. In my new role, I’m excited to work with Ryan and Jen to continue Insomniac’s tradition of creative collaboration.”</p></blockquote><p>Going forward, Insomniac Games plans to “keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them,” as well as “preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years while exploring how we can strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-introduces-new-unified-account-system-with-free-pirate-yakuza-skin.1088745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-account-system-pirate-yakuza-skin<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has introduced a brand new unified account system that promises to give you access to rewards when playing either Sega or Atlus games, as well as "using their online services". The first of those bonuses is available to grab right now if you sign up.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ1QNG67ZW54BR35EAZRAJ7Y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on its website, Sega says that signing up for an account will give you "the latest news" about Sega and Atlus games and promotions, and that it'll also grant you access to "exclusive bonuses", as well as "the ability to link accounts" across platforms.</p>

<p>Signing up before March 7th will give you access to a special&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>&nbsp;</em>skin, which lets protagonist Goro Majima wear the iconic gray suit sported by longtime series main character Kazuma Kiryu (except in&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=txvBflv7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=myRBjEN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can get yourself a free&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>skin if you sign up for a Sega account.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you won't be able to use the skin until the game itself comes out, and signing up for an account doesn't get you a copy of&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, unfortunately. Still, if you're planning to play it anyway, signing up can't hurt, right?</p>

<p>If you want your free skin, you'll simply need to create a Sega account <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, then link it to a corresponding platform in order to redeem the skin on that platform. Obviously, you won't be able to redeem it on Switch, since&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out for that console.</p>

<p>Could the fact that Kiryu's iconic suit is appearing as a skin in the game perhaps portend further development of his story in&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>'s plot? I sure hope so, because&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>'s ending left me desperate to know what happens to him next.</p>




<p>At the moment, there's no suggestion that the Sega account will become mandatory for playing Sega or Atlus' games, although I'm sure if that does happen, Sega and Atlus will know how their fans feel about it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Sega has also <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ71YSH5ZR99A3GSYS1CMTTX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that some users are having trouble authenticating their accounts, promising to resolve the issue soon. Hang on in there if that's you.</p>

<p>Xbox is increasing the size of external storage the Xbox Series consoles will support. In a new update coming to the consoles—Xbox Insiders will get first access to the feature—external hard drives larger than 16TB will now be compatible with the systems.</p>



<p>“We are enabling support for external USB drives larger than 16TB, so you can be sure your favorite games are always ready to play,”  the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/01/alpha-skip-ahead-2502-250120-2200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company said</a>. “Newly formatted drives that are larger than 16TB will be formatted with multiple partitions to utilize all available space for games and apps. These will appear as multiple devices in the storage devices list.”</p>



<p>While the company says that the update adds support for “drives larger than 16TB”, it doesn’t set a new limit. Based on that, it could be inferred that the partition method allows as large of a external drive as you can afford. If you already have a larger drive, Microsoft says they may need to be reformatted.</p>







<p>“Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives,” they said. </p>



<p>This isn’t going to be the only news from Xbox this week as the company airs their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual Developer Direct</a> on January 23. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of all the news that comes from the showcase.</p>

Activision has revealed the season's new gameplay trailer, which features new multiplayer maps, more DLC weapons, and operator skins. The trailer also gives a first look at gameplay and Wonder Weapons for the upcoming Zombies map.</p><p dir="ltr">While most of the post-launch content for Black Ops 6 has forgotten about the game's '90s setting, the Season 2 trailer includes a remixed version of Bush's 1996 hit "Machinehead." Season 2 is themed around ninja-esque operators who are dual-wielding katanas, as seen in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXpnKJBhL48" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SXpnKJBhL48" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One of the multiplayer maps shows gameplay inside a car dealership, which is simply called Dealership. Another multiplayer map features a super-yacht that looks similar to the Hijacked map from Black Ops 2, but this is apparently a new yacht map called Lifeline. A third map is called Bounty, but we don't get to see much of the setting. These three maps will arrive at launch, while two additional maps will drop during the midseason.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies footage is also featured near the end of the trailer, giving the first look at gameplay on The Tomb map. It also reveals the map's unique Wonder Weapons, which are four staffs similar to the ones used on the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision shared the new <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1881754960213512314" rel="nofollow ">promotional art for Season 2</a>, which reveals the katanas, PPSh-41 submachine gun, and FAL rifle as the new weapons in the game.</p><p>Season 2 will bring several game improvements, including the ability to turn off cross-play in Ranked Play modes. Here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything rumored and announced for Season 2</a> so far.</p>

A brief clip on the company’s website gives us a better look at how it works, but it’s an innovation that Nintendo  first teased over eight years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The current Switch has its Joy-Con controllers attach by sliding through a railing on the side until a locking mechanism clicks them into place. Owners then press a very (very) small black button on the back to release the mechanism to slide them back out again. With the Switch 2 there’s no sliding and seemingly a whole lot less friction overall, as the Joy-Con merely click into place and hold on through the force of magnets alone.</p><p>A short snippet recently published on Nintendo’s website shows this all happening in slow motion, including how the (much) bigger triggers on the back of the Joy-Con are held to release the magnets and pull the controllers back away from the screen. It’s a much more elegant solution and, if combined with other Joy-Con features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported anti-drift Hall Effect joysticks</a></span>, mouse-like optical sensors, and a mysterious new C button, could make the Switch 2 feel like a bigger upgrade than it initially appears. </p><p>But it turns out that magnetic Joy-Con, one of the primary points of speculation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">throughout months of Switch 2 leaks</a></span>, weren’t actually a secret at all. Nintendo revealed it was exploring the feature as early as its pre-release breakdown of the original Switch back in 2017. Here is Nintendo executive and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> producer Yoshiaki Koizumi teasing the design possibility to Nintendo of America’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang</a></span>, all the way back then:</p><p>“We tried a lot of different things in terms of connecting the Joy-Con to the console and one that I was particularly excited about at the time was using magnets where you would just snap it right to the console, but as you would play sometimes it would just fall into your lap,” he said at the time. “But because we still wanted to have something that was sturdy enough for you to hold onto the console but also gave you that sort of satisfying snap that the magnets did that’s how we came up with the mechanical rails that give you a click.”</p><p>Nintendo has a way of making its inventions, whether in hardware or the games themselves, feel like they magically appeared out of nowhere, but often it turns out  that they were leftover ideas from long and arduous trial and error processes, later repurposed when the moment is right or newer tech makes them more feasible. So it seems to be with the Switch 2's magnets. I’m super-eager to try them myself and see how they hold up. Hopefully, Nintendo worked out all the kinks this time around. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
