<p>"The fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5761921612aa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the Switch 2's launch last week, Nintendo has now officially confirmed its new hybrid hardware has sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days.</p>
<p>The system debuted on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> and this figure happens to make it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em> in the first four days.</p>
<p>This follows the recent news about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">annihilating the competition in the UK</a> with the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the same day. Other reports suggest the new system has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-switch-2-is-already-breaking-sales-records-in-france">sold incredibly well in locations like France</a> and Spain.</p>
<p>So that's again "over" 3.5 million units and counting. According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">official Nintendo data</a>, the original Switch is currently sitting at 152 million units after an eight-year run. Other platforms like the Wii U and GameCube shifted 13 million and 21 million units respectively during their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World appears to be the go-to launch title for the Switch 2 (and has even been bundled as part of a slightly more expensive Switch 2 package), so it will be interesting to see how many sales it's made from the new hardware release.</p>
<p>Based on Nintendo's information here, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad notes how this technically makes the Switch 2 the "<a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1932629946834563455">fastest selling home video game console of all time</a>".</p>

These discounts are honored at major retailers including Amazon, Target, and Walmart. The Meta Quest 3S is widely considered the best value in VR gaming. Not only is it priced hundreds less compared to most other competitors (including Meta's own Quest3), it's also a standalone untethered gaming system that doesn't require a PC or PlayStation 5 to run,,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To sweeten the pot even more, every Quest 3S purchase includes a copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a> game and a three-month trial of Meta Quest+. In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">8/10 review</a>, Dan Stapleton wrote that "Batman: Arkham Shadow makes most of the Arkham series' defining gameplay work respectably well in VR, and its mystery story pays off."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Meta Quest 3S VR Headset with Batman: Arkham Shadow</h2><div id="222595" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="46006467-4f90-4d47-ad0b-ab15ae567c6a"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meta Quest 3S 256GB VR Headset</h3></p></div><div catalogid="46006467-4f90-4d47-ad0b-ab15ae567c6a" id="207786"><div id="207786" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meta Quest 3S 128GB VR Headset</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Quest 3S is an improvement over the original Quest 2 in every way and, amazingly, without a price increase. It also adopts many of the same features of the more expensive Quest 3, like the new and improved Touch controllers, the upgraded SnapDragon APU, and support for full color AR passthrough. In IGN's 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S review</a>, Gabriel Moss wrote that "raw processing power, full-color passthrough, and snappy Touch Plus controllers make the Quest 3S a fantastic standalone VR headset that also brings entry-level mixed-reality gaming to the masses for â arguably â the very first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What really sets this deal above all other VR deals is that the Meta Quest 3S can be played <strong>completely untethered</strong>. That means you can play games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/28/beat-saber-review">Beat Saber</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/08/pistol-whip-review">Pistol Whip</a> without having to own a powerful gaming PC or a PlayStation 5 console. Try to find another standalone VR headset at this price and you'll come up empty.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Is the Quest 3S Different from the Quest 3?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at retail price, the Quest 3S comes in at $200, or 40% cheaper than the $500 <a href="https://howl.link/33aavd3s563fo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quest 3</a>. Obviously, some compromises were made to get the 3S to its competitive price point. The spec comparisons are listed below:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 <u>Similarities</u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor</li><li>Touch Plus controllers</li><li>120Hz refresh rate</li><li>Mixed reality passthrough (same cameras, different layout)</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 <u>Differences</u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lower per-eye resolution (1832x1920 vs 2064Ã2208)</li><li>Fresnel lens vs. pancake lens</li><li>Lower FOV (96Â°/90Â° vs 104Â°/96Â°)</li><li>Smaller storage capacity (128GB vs 512GB)</li><li><strong>Longer</strong> battery life (2.5hrs vs 2.2hrs)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For the price, the Quest 3S is a better value than the Quest 3, and the best choice for gamers who are just starting out in the world of VR and want to test the waters. It is hands down a major improvement over the Quest 2 that it replaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>Sonic experts are on the case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week, SEGA unveiled the first batch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> guest characters. This includes not only characters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hatsune_miku_project_diva_mega_mix">Hatsune Miku</a> but also Steve, Alex and Creeper from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. There are some other supposed leaks still doing the rounds as well.</p>
<p>Now, the official Sonic social media account has sent Sonic fans into a frenzy once again, with a new piece of artwork apparently featuring a very familiar-looking symbol. The focus here is on what looks exactly like the Triforce from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before anyone gets excited here, no â it's <em>probably</em> not what you might be thinking. Some <a href="https://x.com/Fantactx/status/1932073396486947161">Sonic fans</a> <a href="https://x.com/NoahAFS/status/1931403746895880421">are convinced</a> the character Espio (who is a ninja) and the symbol are linked, and this is more likely to be a reference to Japan's HÅjÅ clan. Others acknowledge how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1l7n72x/so_why_is_the_triforce_in_an_official_sonic/">similar patterns have featured</a> in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fantactx: "It's not a teaser for Link to be in the game, it's a symbol used by the HÅjÅ clan back in 13th century Japan who were allies with a ninja clan which is why it's near Espio as he himself, is a ninja. A example of this being used for inspiration would be the Triforce."</p>
<p>NoahAFS: "No everyone, that's not the Triforce next to Espio, that's the symbol of the HÅjÅ clan, a Japanese samurai family. This does not mean Link is coming to CrossWorlds."</p>
<p>Shaddy_the_guy: "This is just a pattern that can exist, y'know. It's all over the walls in Palmtree Panic"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case closed then, or is it? Stranger crossovers have happened and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> series has even hosted some platform-exclusive characters in the past. Link's also starred in a racing game already, so why not another? And while this kind of crossover would have been unimaginable once upon a time, Sega and Nintendo maintain a great relationship nowadays.</p>
<p>So, while we're not completely ruling anything out here (<em>at least for now</em>), we wouldn't suggest you get your hopes up. In some other Sonic Racing news, Sega has confirmed there'll be a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, along with a paid upgrade.</p>

<p>What do you think? Would you like to see any guests from certain Nintendo franchises feature in Sonic?

For one, it's held over a weekend, which is also the best time to go outside, see friends and hang out. Also there are also too many games spread over too many shows for even the most resolute of you to hope to sit there live and truly catch it all. </p><p>I found that this year, like any other year, the best thing to do was to skip it entirely and just catch up on trailers over the next few days at my own pace. In the spirit of this delayed (yet also emotionally restorative) approach, here are some of the coolest games I saw after SGF, not because <em>I saw them</em>, but because people I love and trust and who did blow their weekend watching commercials (thank you for your service) said "watch this trailer it's sick".</p><p><strong>WHEEL WORLD</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wheel World - Official Release Date Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1DDmlRdgcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Weâve <a href="https://aftermath.site/wheel-world-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written</a> about this game before,<a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-bike-trailer-pc-steam-xbox-ps-bicycle-game-italy-1850593884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> including a couple years back when it had a different name</a>.

So I'm even gladder that this one is almost done, because while we could all do with a decent <em>Sims </em>competitor, it's <em>Paralives</em>' furniture and architecture tools that have got me most excited.</p><hr><p><strong>STRANGER THAN HEAVEN</strong></p><div><figure><p><iframe title="STRANGER THAN HEAVEN - Title Reveal Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Oh look, it's me writing up a RGG game announcement as the highlight of an event,<a href="https://aftermath.site/yakuzas-shopfronts-are-one-of-lifes-little-pleasures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> how off-brand</a>.

</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Harvest Moon</a> is returning to the Switch next month with two 3DS games, but it looks like there could be even more on the way.</p>
<p>According to a new rating that's popped up in Taiwan, the mobile game <strong>Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home 'Deluxe Edition'</strong> is making its way across to the Switch and PlayStation 5. As mentioned by Gematsu, this game originally made its debut on iOS and Android devices in August 2024.</p>
<p>It's developed by Appci, published by Natsume, and is described as being the "biggest Harvest Moon game ever" on mobile devices. In this entry, you'll "woo a variety of bachelors and bachelorettes, marry whomever your heart desires", harvest crops, care for animals, fish, mine, and much more.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You can also get involved in various contests and festivals while collecting and gathering to grow the village and get more residents. Here's an official description from the App Store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Head back to your roots and leave the city life for your childhood village of Alba in Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home, where the freshest fish and tastiest veggies are grown and caught by the local farmers and anglers!</p>
<p>"However, with its population getting older and younger villagers leaving for the big city, Alba Village has seen better days, so can you help turn it from a village on the decline to one of prosperity? With its beautiful surroundings, Alba definitely has the potential, so work hard to bring tourists and even new residents to this sprawling green village! Reunite with your childhood friend and other familiar faces to help put Alba on the map!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Note: this review contains some small spoilers for Deltarune's first two chapters.</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was nearly seven years ago on Halloween when I woke up at the crack of dawn to download an ominous âSurvey Programâ from Undertale developer Toby Fox. It turned out that this program contained not just a simple survey, but the start of a grand adventure that I havenât been able to stop thinking about since. Now, with the release of the third and fourth chapters, that adventure has truly started to take a more solid shape. Deltarune carries on the spirit of its predecessor by subverting expectations of the RPG genre in the wildest ways. It also shares the same sort of clever, heartfelt, and often absurdly hilarious writing, not to mention a truly unforgettable soundtrack. Donât be fooled by its deceptively humble pixel art and initially simple plot: thereâs a surprising amount of intrigue, beauty, and unpredictability just under the surface. The unsettling questions Deltarune raises about our relationship to the characters we control in games provides an engrossing layer of meta-commentary, while still celebrating the indomitable willpower and heart of extraordinary RPG heroes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That aforementioned creepy survey demo ended up only being the first chapter of Deltarune, with the second released in 2021, and finally the most recent two arriving just last week as part of its more traditional âfullâ release â although, thatâs not to say itâs âfinishedâ now, as more chapters are planned to arrive as free content updates in the future. But no matter if you are picking up where you left off years ago or starting fresh from the first chapter, youâll be unceremoniously thrust into the body of a weird teen named Kris. There are a lot of similarities to Undertale here, but also more than enough differences in its setting and how battles work to set it apart. Where Undertale had you navigating an underground society of imprisoned monsters you either had to fight or befriend, Deltarune begins in a pleasant but unremarkable âHometownâ â though for some reason youâre still the only human around in a world of monsters. The only epic struggles to be found here are trying to stay awake through class, or dodging the extreme embarrassment of seeing your divorced adoptive monster parents run into each other at the store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played Undertale, you might get a kick out of seeing several of that gameâs more notable figures living regular lives in this parallel story, but I wouldnât quite say itâs required. In fact, Iâd argue that Deltarune is at its best when itâs not trying to focus on what came before it â funny as those interactions may be. Iâll admit, at first I was a little disappointed to see familiar faces appearing in what was supposed to be a new adventure, but then I realized these arenât simple fanservice cameos. In another universe, these were imposing boss monsters â kings and queens with terrifying strength and magical powers. Here, theyâre justâ¦ ordinary townsfolk: teachers, bored police, and struggling shop owners. While they may have a role to play, this story isnât truly about them.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Itâs a great touch how even the menus and UI change to reflect this new realm.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, things kick off when Kris and a rude, crude monster classmate named Susie find themselves transported into a world of fantasy straight out of an â80s adventure movie. Here, pencils and bandaids transform into swords and armor, while forgotten classroom toys or computer lab accessories spring to life as âDarkenersâ, many of which will stand in your way. Itâs a great touch how even the menus and UI change to reflect this new realm. The environments youâll find yourself exploring in these âDark Worldsâ are anything but: theyâre filled with vibrant and beautiful pixel art backdrops that work in harmony with a stunning soundtrack to capture the themes of these fascinating places.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Happy Feet, Dumbass</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Itâs not long after arrival in the Dark World that you meet your third âparty member:â a lonely Darkener prince named Ralsei who seems to know all about you, and gives you the grand spiel about cleansing dark fountains and saving the world from destruction. You know, hero stuff. To get to your goal, youâll have to fight your way through enemies, frenemies, misunderstood goofballs â pretty much everything you can think of. As with Undertale, youâll learn that the path to victory can be forged with turn-based violence or pacifism, but the long-term consequences arenât as clear cut here. Striking enemies into submission allows you to get stronger quicker, though finding ways to spare opponents will lead to your own Dark Worldâs Castle Town becoming populated with now-friendly occupants, and may even change how certain scenes play out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Truly, the best part of battles is the ability to âActâ on your turn â winning over an opponent with enough mercy to spare them, in between dodging an ever-expanding variety of deadly bullet patterns on the enemyâs turn within the confines of a box that pops onto the screen. On paper, this system could easily lose its charm, but here itâs kept entertaining by exceptionally witty and context-sensitive execution. Each foe has different needs that get more complex (and often wacky) the further you delve into these adventures. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Things may start with you ordering a party member to flirt their way toward mercy, but it wasnât too much later I found myself up against tougher ambulance-themed adversaries. Asking Susie to âActâ instead gave me a challenge: dodge the ambulance-themed bullets on the enemyâs turn to earn more mercy for a risky play (because she doesnât trust doctors, naturally). Whereas Ralseiâs âActâ would suggest getting hit on purpose instead (because theyâre here toâ¦ help?), which wasnât a bad call if I was having trouble dodging already. Itâs moments like these where Deltaruneâs creative juices are at their tastiest, combining fun contextual commands that blend limitless humor while leaning into the personalities of both your team and the Darkeners youâll face. Each new encounter left me eager to see what my Fun Squad could come up with, and with a mix of plentiful enemy variety and Dark World areas that never stretched on too long, I never really found myself getting tired of the opponents I came up against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even beyond fighting and ACTing, I really came to appreciate how Deltaruneâs three party members allowed me to develop synergies and tactics as time went on. Later battles became delicate dances of assigning heals or items, then having one person ACT so that another could spare on the same turn (provided my ACTs were successful). Even the process of dodging incoming attacks provides a new layer of strategy with the ability to âgrazeâ the bullet patterns by moving my little heart icon alongside the attacks or dodging at the last second without getting hit to build a meter necessary to perform certain magical powers. Just like ACTing, certain magic could change depending on the battle to accommodate new strategies and challenges unique to that fight, and often made the risky play to get close to attacks worthwhile.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Power of Page Breaks Shines Within You</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when I wasnât fighting, there was a lot to explore both in and out of the Dark Worlds I visited. Being able to wander around, talk to people, and interact with objects isnât exactly a new RPG idea. (I have vivid memories of obsessively checking every trash can in a Pokemon game, often leaving disappointed.) But what I believe sets Deltarune apart is the confidence it has in making its world worth stopping in to smell the roses. You might find a container of Ice-Eâs Cool Boys Body Spray âSpray For the Boysâ Flaminâ Hot Pizza Flavor under the bathroom sink, for instance. Deltaruneâs hilariously illogical humor oozes into every corner of the world like some sort of weird goop thatâs actually kind of delicious and also addictive for some reason. Itâs so intrinsically linked with everything else â combat, dialogue, story, puzzles, you name it â that I couldnât imagine this adventure being any other way. Seriously, in what other setting would you encounter a weird little dolphin attacking you with internet pop-up screens in reference to some obscure 14-year-old meme about a desktop image trying to lure you into downloading viruses?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itâs not just the jokes, either (rampant as they may be); I found myself constantly intrigued by the world being set up around this adventure. Not all of it is laid out in big, showy cutscenes and plot developments. Thereâs a level of reward that is given to those willing to inspect things they may otherwise walk right past, or talk to someone you may not expect to have a nugget of wisdom to give. Itâs a type of detail that doesnât seem all that impressive at first glance, and yet Iâve come to appreciate immensely during my time in each of the four currently available chapters. Even something as random as inspecting an innocuous patch of moss can steadily grow into its own running gag between chapters, which  feels like Iâve uncovered a special secret. In this way, Deltarune is also rife with small, personal moments and anecdotes that allow its characters to shine in a way I rarely see anywhere else.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each place you visit is accompanied by an embarrassment of phenomenal music.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Every location has these touches, and the areas I explored on my quest to seal the dark fountains led me through some pretty fantastical interpretations of otherwise ordinary places. The plush carpet of a forgotten classroom became a vast red forest with fields of rippling purple grass, while a computer lab transformed into a larger-than-life shining city of lights and superhighways built from advertisements, and all of it works wonderfully in the distinct pixel-art style. Deltarune is careful about keeping its scope in check, and instead saves moments of visual flair for just the right occasion when you least expect it. Even the amount of expression seen in its character portraits continued to delight me at just how well they were able to convey the right emotions, which only got better and more expressive each chapter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each place you visit is accompanied by an embarrassment of phenomenal music, and as with Undertale, the payoff of Fox personally composing the music in addition to developing so many aspects of Deltarune is clear to see. From its incredibly funky and catchy battle theme to the ethereal exploration of the first Dark World and the upbeat tunes beyond, every new area youâll visit is a treat for the ears. Thereâs a wonderful mix of chiptunes in all sorts of genres, and each boss encounter theme somehow surpasses the last with no signs of slowing down. (Did my ears deceive me, or did I hear the TMNT: Turtles in Time soundfont being used?). Itâs not just that the music is great, but its decisive inclusions elevate the material with careful use of leitmotifs to tie events and characters together. In one of the later chapters, there are certain rare sequences that bring out the raw emotion of a live piano playing, and left me floored at how well it empowered the scene to reach greater emotional heights.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Itâs Pronounced, âThe $!$? Squadâ</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Itâs hard to pick which characters to talk about in a cast thatâs so colorful. Whether itâs in the relatively normal Light World, or the dream-like Dark World, the assorted monsters I met made a lasting impression on me. So many of Deltaruneâs cast members are actually very, very dumb (in an extremely endearing way, I promise!), and incredibly distinct in ways too numerous to count. Many times, it almost felt like a Royal Rumble of competing scene-stealers, with new challengers arriving all the time. Iâd always get a sinking feeling that there would be no way a new chapter could top the previous oneâs anticsâ¦ and yet, each time I was proven wrong in ways I literally could not have expected from both new and returning faces. I still donât even know if I like Rouxls Kaard (thatâs pronounced âRules Cardâ) as a person, but Iâll be damned if he didnât leave me in tears every time he popped up â usually against everyone elseâs wishes.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Brendan's Favorite Games Featuring Goofy Little Dogs</h3><p>Seemed like a good idea at the time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But I canât not talk about the true âLightenerâ stars of the show: Kris and Susie, one of my favorite teams Iâve had the pleasure of commanding in turn-based battles. They both go through some very different personal journeys over the course of each chapter, and though we still don't fully know where they lead, they continue to fascinate me. Kris, Susie, and yes - even Ralsei are each loners and outcasts in their own ways, and seeing them form a bond powerful enough to shake the pillars of Heaven has been immensely satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a point early on where I worried that Susieâs own character growth would sputter out too soon after calming down on the more extreme ends of her bullying tough girl act (which is expertly woven into Deltaruneâs mechanics to manifest in clever ways both in and out of combat). Instead, I found a wild card. Sheâs as much the main protagonist of this story as Kris isâ¦ sometimes perhaps even more. Susie continually forges her own path when it suits her, leading to surprising revelations and tweaks on how Deltarune plays. She wonât even let you remove gear from her without giving her something else to equip â sheâs that feisty! And yet, for all her bark, she makes a wonderfully vocal stand-in for us, going from annoyed disinterest to full-throated enthusiasm as she embraces her role in the story, and her newfound friends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>They are truly a dumbass duo with joint custody of a single braincell.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Her relationship with her classmate Kris is also something I never get tired of. It encapsulates some of the funniest, most heartwarming, and most sincere parts of Deltaruneâs story so far. I canât count the number of times I inspected an object and was presented with the option to do something profoundly stupid, only to have Susie right there beside me, excitedly goading me on. They are truly a dumbass duo with joint custody of a single braincell, and the enthusiasm they share for the absurd is inescapably contagious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kris on their own is also a fascinating enigma, and explaining why will require a light amount of spoilers from the first two chapters. I hope youâll forgive me on this, but itâs also one of the central parts of Deltaruneâs themes, and how you play it. <strong>You can click on the spoiler tag below to read more.</strong></p><div><p>In Deltarune, you do not play as Kris: you control Kris. You, the player, are a diegetic force in this world, meaning your presence is a tangible entity. Youâre a red, heart-shaped object referred to as a SOUL, often seen when selecting choices or dodging attacks. However, itâs soon revealed that you are something of an unwanted guest in Krisâ body, and they may have their own motives and goals that donât always align with your own. At times, this can even culminate in you being forcibly removed from piloting your fleshy teenage mech, and left helpless as Kris goes off on their own. </p><p>As both a game mechanic and a story idea, itâs an incredibly wild and unique take on the RPG genre in how this possession manifests itself, and further solidifies how Deltarune isnât just inspired by games that came before it, but also eager to break new ground. As the story unfolds, how can you know if what you are doing is what Kris wants to do? Orâ¦ do you even care? It also puts an entirely new layer of meaning onto how the character we control reacts to things, and what information we can glean from that â and the themes of freedom and control will continually vie for your attention as you uncover Deltaruneâs secrets. Thereâs a subtle yet masterful way that Deltarune drops the tiniest of hints that while we may control much of Kris, they can still find ways to inject their personality into the world despite us. Kris may be a silent protagonist from our perspective, but itâs how others react to the tone of their words or expressions that provides a fascinating look into the life of the human weâve hijacked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I donât want to say more about how your role continues to escalate in later chapters, nor do I wish to spoil much of the contents of Chapter 3 and 4. What I will say is that Chapter 3 felt like a demented roller coaster ride that somehow seamlessly inserted an entirely new way to play that was an absolute blast. Chapter 4 continued to step on the gas pedal, but not in the ways I was expecting â it was more like riding the aforementioned roller coaster into the gaping maw of a dread-inducing abyss. It does have a few slower parts, especially navigating some of the more maze-like areas that seemed to lack the usual unlockable shortcuts until the very end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, nothing prepared me for the harrowing end to Chapter 4. The story remains unfinished, yes, but in no way did I feel let down by it ending where it does for now, having surmounted some incredible odds and witnessed some jaw-dropping moments to get as far as I have.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Splitgate 2 game director Ian Proulx has apologised for causing "division in the community" following his controversial Summer Game Fest appearance, in which he wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat while onstage.
</p>
<p>
Proulx's Summer Game Fest segment last Friday almost immediately drew criticism from viewers; some felt using the high-profile platform to attack another developer's game - he announced he was "tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year" - was tasteless, but it was his hat that seemed to cause most controversy.
</p>
<p>
Its "Make FPS Great Again" logo clearly invoked divisive US president Donald Trump's notorious "Make America Great Again" slogan, and now - after initially <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371">refusing to apologise</a> for wearing it - Proulx has acknowledged the choice, while 'not political', was ill-advised.
</p>
<p>
"It is really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise," he explained in a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">video posted on social media</a>. "We saw it at the TGAs; we had this great trailer and there's 50 other great trailers, and it didn't really have an impact. And so at our biggest stage, coming out of beta, we needed something to grab attention and... this is what we came up with."
</p>
<p>
"We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever," he continued. "Obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was stating our truth. Which is we do want to improve this genre, we are disappointed with the state of the genre. And so we took [the slogan] as a meme that we thought would not be nearly as negatively received as the way it was. And so I want to apologise."
</p>
<p>
"And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community. The most important thing to me right now is I want to have an amazing community... I hate seeing division. And that's what Iâm seeing now, on both sides. There's division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry... I do stand by the [face value] intent of this, which is... we do want to improve this genre... But I also understand that it's not just about intent, it's about impact, and the platform that we have had has had a negative impact, and for that I'm truly sorry."
</p>
<p>
Proulx's Summer Game Fest appearance isn't the only controversy Splitgate 2 has faced in recent days, however. Fans lambasted the free-to-play shooter over the weekend after developer 1047 Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">released a cosmetic bundle priced $80 USD, supposedly discounted from $145</a>. In response, the studio slashed that to $40 and reduced prices across the store, pledging to "double down on being community first and listening to you guys."

                <p>Sony has laid off about 30% of the staff at Bend Studio, the first-party developer of the PlayStation 4 open-world game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a>. The publisher confirmed the layoffs in a statement to GameSpot.</p><p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Schreier</a>, about 40 people were laid off from the studio.</p><p>In its statement, Sony also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Bend Studio had been working on a live-service game</a> earlier in the year, but that game has been canceled and the studio is moving on to a new, unnamed project.</p><p>"Earlier this year, Bend Studio wrapped development on a live-service concept," the statement reads. "After careful consideration, we chose not to move forward with it. As the team shifts focus to its next project, weâve made strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success. As part of this transition, a workforce reduction has taken place at the studio. This decision was not made lightly, and we are extremely grateful for the meaningful contributions of all those impacted. Bend Studio has been a valued part of PlayStation Studios for decades, and we remain confident in its future and creative direction."</p><p>Sony has canceled multiple games since it announced a focus on developing live-service concepts following its acquisition of Destiny 2 developer Bungie in 2022. Originally, the publisher said it intended to launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games by 2025</a>, but in 2023 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">narrowed that figure to just six</a>. The Bend layoffs are just the latest of many Sony has made in recent years, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">closing of Firewalk Studios</a> after the launch of live-service first-person shooter Concord and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">layoffs at Bungie</a> following its acquisition and the release of Destiny 2's last major expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a>.</p><p>Also among recent closures was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/02/london-studios-ps5-live-service-fantasy-co-op-game-will-never-see-the-light-of-day" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's London Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-partnered-studio-from-ex-cod-devs-has-closed/1100-6521774/" data-ref-id="1100-6521774">Deviation Games</a>, both shuttered in 2024.

        <p>Will become new executive chair of the board.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Lars Wingefors, the Embracer Group CEO who oversaw thousands of job cuts and a significant number of studio closures following a turbulent few years for the company, has announced he's stepping down from his role. Wingefors is not, however, parting ways with Embracer, and will instead become its executive chair of the board.
</p>
<p>
"While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers,"  Wingefors said in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/">statement announcing his change of role</a>. "This new phase allows me to focus on strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation, ensuring Embracer's continued growth and success. I am more convinced than ever that the best is still ahead of us."
</p>
<p>
With Wingefors' focus shifting elsewhere, Phil Rogers will step into the vacated CEO role from 1st August. Rogers is currently deputy CEO of Embracer and CEO of Crystal Dynamics â Eidos.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors' time as CEO has been turbulent to say the least. He oversaw a rapid period of expansion at Embracer, with the company embarking on a massive acquisition spree, snapping up the likes of Gearbox, Saber Interactive, Crystal Dynamics, and more - including the â¬2.75bn purchase of board game publisher Asmodee - over a number of years. However, the unsustainability of that expansion became clear after a $2bn deal with the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">collapsed dramatically in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following the deal's collapse, Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">announced</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program" that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">ultimately resulted in thousands of employees losing their jobs</a>, while a substantial number of studios were either divested or outright closed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition shut its doors in August 2023</a>, for instance, while the revived Free Radical Design, which was working on a new TimeSplitters project, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-design-closed-today-staff-say">closed just a few months later</a>. Soon after, Gearbox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">sold to Take-Two Interactive</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">Saber Interactive went its own separate way</a>. Further layoffs, at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Eidos-MontrÃ©al</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics</a>, have been announced since then.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-boss-admits-long-list-of-things-hed-have-done-differently-as-embattled-company-splits-into-three">later admitted</a> there was a "long list" of things he'd have done differently, but that it was "easy to look back in hindsight".

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> is an odd little game. How do you begin to sell the idea that a (presumably emotional) herding simulator might be quite interesting? Yes, people love their farming sims as a band aid form of escapism, but a lot of those games are in the first instance much more about farming and not farm animals, nor the way you interact with said animals. Herdling is all about that, as the whole goal is to guide a group of strange horned beasties up a mountain.
</p>

<p>
The demo, which just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/">launched this weekend on Steam</a> after a recent trailer at the Future Games Show, certainly left me a lot to think about. In the first instance, I feel that it's a game that could quite easily fit into the PS3 era of indie games quite specifically - think something along the lines of Journey, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, games where you're just kind of heading forward because that's the thing you're doing. What you make of it along the way is therefore up to you. What do I make of the little bit I've played of Herdling?

<p>
Well, for starters, it's a little bit janky. To start with, anyway, guiding the actually quite sweet Calicorns is a bit awkward, at least up until the breadth of the game's controls are properly explained to you. After spending a short stint in a city, Herdling quite literally opens up into massive, sweeping fields, giving you a much freer reign to roam with your newfound herd. Just simply making a turn offers a challenge due to its slowness, but I got the hang of it quite quickly.
</p>
<p>
You have to be thoughtful in doing so, though. There are dangers to be met with that can hurt your Calicorns (and I believe in kill them, if the game's immortality setting means what I think it does), so you can't just wave them around willy nilly. The slow moving nature of the beasts then means you have to keep yourself on your toes to avoid any morbid fates. To add on to the weight of being responsible for their lives, you can name each Calicorn too. You are the one guiding them, so you must get to know them, and look after them.
</p>
<p>
I admit there is the possibility that Herdling could end up falling into the trope of overly emotional indie game. Still, I find the idea of having such a leadership role over animals that don't quite have as much autonomy and safety as its world might allow to be an interesting one, so consider this a demo that has successfully caught my intrigue. There's no exact release date just yet, but it is expected to release this summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684957/splitgate-2-hat-apology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Thereâs a line in showbiz that goes, âThereâs no such thing as bad publicity.â Ian Proulx, CEO of <em>Splitgate 2</em> developer 1047 Games, has recently learned the hard way thatâs not entirely true. </p><p>Last week, during the Summer Game Fest keynote livestream, Proulx came out to promote his game wearing a black hat that read âMake FPS Great Againâ â an obvious reference to Donald Trumpâs Make America Great Again slogan. The <em>Splitgate 2</em> community, journalists, and regular gamers seized on the hat (and not, you know, the game), immediately calling the statement gross and tone deaf. As questions from the <em>Splitgate 2</em> community poured in, Proulx <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371">doubled down on social media</a>, saying that he would not apologize and that the hat wasnât a political statement and should be taken at face value. </p><p>Today, however, heâs singing a different tune. He posted on X with the simple caption, âNo excuses, Iâm sorry,â accompanied by a nearly three-minute video explaining the decision to wear the hat and the intention behind it. </p><p>âWe needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is, we tried to think of something, and this is what we came up with,â Proulx said.</p><p>He acknowledged that he was aware the hat would be controversial. His apology was not for the hat itself, but the discussion surrounding the hat within the <em>Splitgate 2 </em>community. Proulx claimed he did not want the division he himself sowed. âThe reason Iâm sorry is because of what this has done to the community,â he said.</p><p>He continued: âWe knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was kind of stating our truth.â As Proulx was making his statement, a few miles away in Los Angelesâ fashion district, where the Summer Game Fest Play Days campus resides, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was conducting raids snatching up people just going about their lives, raids that led to clashes between people protecting their neighbors and defenders of a cruel regime. </p><div><p>When I reported on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682033/everybody-hated-that">the Trump-evoking slogan and the backlash to it</a>, some commenters responded that âitâs just a hat.â </p></div><p>But it is not just a hat. Aping a political statement that has been used to enact state violence isnât âa meme,â it is a continuation of that violence. I think of the people in attendance at the show and those who work at the YouTube Theater who are immigrants or have immigrant family members. I think of the worker at the City Market Social House, the venue where SGF holds its Play Days event, who told me about the protocol they have in case ICE shows up: how people can hide in a room in the basement and hand out cards so they donât have to speak to ICE and potentially implicate themselves.</p><p>Proulxâs statement, no matter its form, isnât just in bad taste. It is a stark reminder to those people that their lives and families are at risk. And saying âIâm sorry, it was just a memeâ isnât enough. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While that kind of item-based back-and-forth isn't new to Mario Kart, it feels like it has been taken to a new extreme by <em>World</em>'s more crowded race track. If you're in the middle of the pack, every tranche of item boxes you pass can lead, in short order, to a flurry of near-unavoidable projectiles and item-enhanced opponents cluttering your immediate space. That's especially true in online races, where human opponents tend to be much more ruthless with their item use than even the hardest computer-controlled opponents.</p>

            <p>
              That blue "Kaboom!" can send you from first to 17th in a hurry.

<p>The change ultimately rewards defensive driving, where you do your best to avoid other racers and utilize protective items until you have a chance to rocket into the relative safety of the top few positions. Sometimes, though, there's simply no avoiding a maddening series of bad breaks that can literally send you from first place to 19th in an instant.</p>

<h2>Itâs not the destination, itâs the journey</h2>
<p>Once you've adjusted to the more crowded field of racers, you'll then have to get used to the odd structure of <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s main racing modes. Rather than racing multiple laps around the game's well-designed tracks, you'll spend the bulk of your race time in most racing modes trekking between those tracks across the great expanses of <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s, uh, world.</p>

      Get used to seeing very straight sections like this in most of the game's racing modes.

<p>These inter-course interludes offer a decent variety to the structure, which will see you traveling through desert wastelands, down traffic-clogged highways, along the surface of tiered waterfalls, across frozen tundra, and more. What's unavoidably similar about most of them, though, is their unbearable straightness. Players used to the undulating, crisscrossing curves of a standard Mario Kart course will marvel at just how rarely they have to powerslide around turns while shuttling between those courses in <em>World</em>.</p>
<p>These long straightaways aren't boring, per se. The designers have done their best to dress them up with plenty of obstacles (of the stationary, vehicular, and livestock varieties), as well as jumps, dash pads, and frequent item boxes to make sure you're still paying attention. But it can still be a jarring transition to go from two or three minutes across one of these mostly straight interregnums into the usual twisty wildness of the game's more familiar pre-designed courses.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the 2025 Xbox Showcase's most shocking reveals was Invincible VS, a new three-on-three tag fighter from Skybound and a new startup studio called Quarter Up Games. Don't let the "new startup" descriptor fool you, however; this is a team steeped in fighting game experience, as it was responsible for bringing back a cult classic to a legion of appreciative fans over a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, Quarter Up and Skybound are set on breathing new life not into just a franchise, but a concept--Invincible VS invokes the highly-praised Marvel vs. Capcom style of 2D fighting games that use a tag-team system to swap between multiple characters, which is a tall task to try replicating. Based on our hands-on gameplay during a recent visit to Skybound in Los Angeles, it seems that Quarter Up is well on its way to answering the call.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS | Official Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">A Killer origin story</h2><p dir="ltr">In 2013, developer Double Helix brought Rare's Killer Instinct series back to the masses on Xbox One. The 2013 installment's gritty, impactful fighting system made it an instant fan favorite, but soon after it launched, the studio was snapped up by Amazon Games. Many of KI 2013's key developers went on to other projects, but Mike Willette--KI 2013 producer and the voice behind the iconic "c-c-c-combo breaker!" sound effect in the reboot--wasn't done with fighting games yet. He wanted to get the band back together.</p><p dir="ltr">"We felt like we had unfinished business," Willette told GameSpot on a recent Zoom call. "I still had that itch, so after working [as lead of the world design team] on New World [at Amazon], I reached out to a whole bunch of the oldheads and said, 'Look, I'm thinking about starting a studio. Would you guys be interested?' Immediately, a bunch of them were in. 'Yeah dude, I had so much fun. We love the people, we love the community. If you can make it happen, Mike, we'll show up.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Not long after, Willette found himself in the offices of Skybound, creators of the dark and gritty Invincible superhero franchise. "Skybound asks me, 'Mike, what game would you want to build here?' and I immediately said, 'I want to build an Invincible fighting game, and I'll build a tag fighting game,'" Willette recalled. "I was a huge fan of the show and the comics, and there's just so much rich material there. It's violent. It's brutal. It has the stakes of what happens with superheroes. I just connected with them on such a level that I said, 'This is it, this is what I want to do.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Making a three-on-three tag fighter was a no-brainer for the team, as Invincible's pantheon of superheroes, according to Willette, lends itself perfectly to that style of fighting game. Tag battle fighting games are hype. They're incredible," Willette said. "The amount of creativity, the combo systems, the different archetypes that let you build your own team, instead of just using a single character... There hadn't been a real big game since Dragon Ball FighterZ, either, so we carried over from our days in KI, plus all the learnings from the past 10 years, and that's the genesis of Quarter Up."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510856" data-ratio="0.56238603803074" data-width="3839" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510856"></a><figcaption>Invincible VS</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510857,1300-4510858,1300-4510859,1300-4510860,1300-4510861" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Becoming Invincible</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS employs a simplified version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3's four-button control scheme for attacks: There are four attack buttons--light, medium, heavy, and special--and each has multiple special attacks that are used depending on which direction you move the left thumbstick, a la Super Smash Bros. Tapping the light attack multiple times also offers an auto-combo that will chain into a super move, should the aggressor have the meter to use it.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, the team has balanced that simplified control scheme with a system that offers plenty of depth and advanced tactics to discover. Those worried about players mashing the combo button over and over again, for example, can take solace in the return of one of Killer Instinct's defining features: the combo meter, which will force a player to drop a combo if they use the same move too often.</p><p dir="ltr">Core fighting mechanics resemble those from other fighting games: Heroic Boost adds extra power or hits to special attacks similar to EX moves in Street Fighter, super meters allow for more powerful moves as you charge them up by attacking and blocking, and so on. Some are adapted in new and interesting ways, however: "snapback"--moves that force an opponent to swap characters--can also blast an opponent into an entirely different stage in Invincible VS. In doing so, the character getting knocked into a new stage will lose access to their assist characters for a brief moment--because, from a storytelling perspective, those characters have to "catch up," while the offensive team is ready to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Incorporating the Invincible franchise into this format, meanwhile, has been incredibly easy for Willette and his team--easier than his previous projects, in fact.</p><p dir="ltr">"Compared to Killer Instinct's historical files, I have a lot more access with this property," Willette explained. "The problem when we worked on KI was that all of the previous developers were gone; we did have [Xbox partner creative director] Ken Lobb, and I could always go to Ken, but here I can go right to the well, and it's a <em>deep</em> well."</p><p dir="ltr">This comes through in the pre-fight character intros, where every character pairing in the game will have unique dialogue with every other character--even if they've never interacted in official Invincible media.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got access to decades worth of comic references, access to the show team," Willette said, "and we're always spitballing ideas back and forth with each other. It's very cool to work here."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle scars</h2><p dir="ltr">That authenticity also bears a more grisly side through Invincible VS' blood-and-gore factor, a trait not normally associated with tag fighters like this. The most obvious implementation of this is in Overkills, where certain special and super moves will decapitate, dismember, or even detonate an opponent's body into pieces if used as the final hit.</p><p dir="ltr">Willette says this level of violence was necessary to convey what Invincible has always been about, but there is a limit.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to be brutal, but not hyper-grotesque for shock value," he explained. "We want to show the sheer brutality of these superheroes fighting, like the ground getting torn up or costumes getting ripped and splattered with blood. If you did a killing blow, it's really important for us, especially to be authentic to the [intellectual property]."</p><p dir="ltr">Willette also reveals that the team has put a unique spin on the battle damage concept through "offensive" and "defensive" versions of it. If one character has a big lead over another, the leading character will still have blood spots on their costumes or fists caked in red--it's just the <em>other</em> character's blood rather than their own.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are really conscious of how these things would affect both fighters," Willette said. "If a character is at low health, for another example, their idle animation will be different to show how tired they are. They're saying, 'All right, I'm messed up, but I'll keep going.' We really wanted to have those as part of the storytelling of the fight action."</p><p dir="ltr">The team at Quarter Up Games wants Invincible VS to appeal to as many players as possible, and it hopes to achieve it through one simple approach: Make each player feel like an absolute badass.</p><p dir="ltr">"When you pick up that game pad for the first time and you can just mash and you feel awesome, that's great. That means you're going to stick around longer," Willette said. "If you've never played a fighting game before, I'd love for this to be your first fighting game. And if lapsed, we'd love for you to come back for this because we love fighting games. We want to make you fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is a love letter from us saying, 'Yeah, we love Invincible, we love fighting games and we want you to come play.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set for launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

I have not beaten <em>Overture, </em>but my impressions based on what Iâve played is that Neowiz still has the juice.

Credit: NEOWIZ</figcaption></figure><p>But because I had previously played <em>Lies of P </em>on Game Pass, I realized when I got code for <em>Overture</em> that I had to fish out my old save file. I think I had assumed before canceling that I had bought the game on Steam during a sale but no, I hadnât. Turns out my save file is tied to Microsoftâs service forever. Whatâs worse, <em>Lies of P </em>is no longer on Game Pass. So if I just wanted to get my save file using a trial of Game Pass, cancelling it, and transferring the save to Steam, I would need to buy the game first. Even beyond the ethics of supporting Microsoft, Iâm not going to buy a game on their store voluntarily.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, sometimes the save file is still on your computer! Thereâs <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042416648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thorough guides</a> on how to convert a Game Pass save file to a Steam one, and I <em>had</em> installed it to play it not too long ago. Maybe it was still kicking around on my hard drive.</p><p>Though Game Pass is fine as a service, it is also a Microsoft product, meaning the way it installs on your PC is generally a nightmare. Unlike Steam, which just puts stuff in Program Files like an adult, you have to make sure âhidden itemsâ are visible, go into your AppData folder and navigate to an obtusely-named folder in Packages. Even in ideal circumstances this would be annoying, but when I followed every available guide I was able to find the remnants of <em>Lies of P </em>on my hard drive, but not the one specific folder that would have contained my save. Either something had changed since the guide was written, something happened with my computer, or Windows had deleted the save off my drive.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Hope you're ready to do this stuff. Credit: Valve/Monkey</figcaption></figure><p>I am <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l5iwlr/can_i_get_my_save_back_from_gamepass_pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently not alone here</a>. I did find at least one other person who had been in the exact same situation on r/liesofp. I contemplated speed running through the entire game, since I have done that multiple times. I got to the end of the first chapter before I realized that I donât have time to do that. This left one solution: download another personâs <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meticulously curated save file </a>from NexusMods.</p><figure><figcaption>Hope you're ready to do this stuff. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>The save file worked wonderfully and contained every available weapon and potential item in the game. This is basically everything I could ask for, and I should state the person who uploaded that save is a saint. But doing that does feel a little wrong. This wasnât <em>my Pinocchio</em>, and though I can respec him, it felt like living in another personâs skin. Whatâs more, this file is on its third playthrough, and every added layer of New Game Plus makes the game harder, so even though I am well positioned gear-wise for the DLC, everything in it hits like an 18-wheeler. Apparently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l6d9ki/i_need_ng1_save_file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least one other person is in this situation as well</a>.</p><p>At the end of the day this whole mess could have been avoided. Archiving is ultimately my responsibility, and Iâm going to <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start running it on a schedule</a>. I knew the DLC was coming up, and I wish I had had the foresight to just back up my saves or buy the game on Steam to begin with. Because if you play a game on a service where you donât own the game, can you even say that your experiences are yours?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We don't really get to write about Playdate, that bespoke games console with a built in crank, here on RPS very much because it is very much not a computer (though former EIC Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdate-review">did review it back when it launched</a>). Well, not in the way we need it to be for our purposes. But I have an excuse to do so today! Over the weekend at the PC Gaming Show, a trailer for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/panic">Panic</a>-published, faux-streaming service <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blippo">Blippo+</a> was shown off, one that captured my attention quite quickly.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You see, Blippo+ is technically already available as part of Playdate Season 2, releasing 1-bit dithered versions of fictitious TV episodes one week at a time, just like in the good old days. The version of Blippo+ shown over the weekend however, is a full-scale FMV game that recreates the feeling of channel surfing through off-cable TV, filled with budget productions featuring all sorts of shows like the news, sitcoms, and the weather.

<p>
It's all made with actual vintage analog broadcasting equipment, which is right up my alley. I'll let you in on an odd pet peeve of mine: I hate it when films and TV just slap on a fake VHS filter or something of that sort and call it a day. You can always tell it's filmed on a modern camera, and it bothers me to no end, so I really appreciate the effort put into Blippo+.
</p>
<p>
There's some kind of "time-hopping" mechanic that lets you go back and forth between weeks worth of television, slowly uncovering the strange lore of this world that's like ours, butâ¦ different. It's been an eon (translation: actually only about 5 years or so) since I last did any channel hopping of any kind, time travel or not, so I'm quite curious to dive into this one.
</p>
<p>
It's also being written by Claire L. Evans and directed by Jona Bechtolt, as in the duo that make-up the musical act YACHT. Not a creative team I would have expected, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/last-flag-announcement-summer-game-fest/">but Imagine Dragons are making that not Team Fortress 2 shooter Last Flag</a> that got revealed at Geoff's Two Hours of Video Games Show, so, anything's possible I guess.
</p>
<p>
Blippo+ doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but it is expected to launch sometime this coming fall/ autumn, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323850/Blippo/">here</a>.

But while this should have been a triumphant moment for the studio and the community, the launch has instead been marked by not one, not two, but three different controversies that have led to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>mixed Steam reviews</u></a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l5jk86/everyone_after_summer_game_fest_cringe_ceo_moment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>disappointed fans</u></a>, and a game community divided between those who support the studioâs actions and those who have been put off from playing Splitgate 2 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, at the gameâs big battle royale reveal at Summer Game Fest, Proulx wore a hat that read, âMake FPS Great Againâ onstage, which drew criticism for its reference to U.S. President Donald Trumpâs signature âMake America Great Againâ hats, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/27/689191278/the-symbol-of-the-maga-hat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>which come with significant political baggage</u></a>. Then, Proulx called out Call of Duty in his speech onstage, saying heâs âtired of playing the same Call of Duty every year,â which drew ire from developers and fans of Call of Duty. And then on top of that, as the game launched, fans immediately called out a $145 microtransaction bundle on the gameâs store that seemed to fly in the face of everything 1047 Games claimed it stood for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke to game director Ian Proulx in the wake of all this, and found him surprisingly sanguine for a company leader currently in the spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âSo, I am surprised, to be honest, to dive right into it, we didn't expect this to be nearly as controversial as it was and we didn't intend for it to be,â he said. âIn terms of the numbers, there have been good numbers, there's been a lot of negativity, but also positivity to match that people love the game. We just crossed the two and a half million player threshold, we tripled our player count. So there's good and bad, I think time will tell mixed emotions for sure, but overall feeling good.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, I had to start by asking him about the hat. What was that all about?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âI'll start by saying, we talked a lot about this, we did not intend for this to be any sort of political statement,â Proulx replied. âI mean, I think we meant for it to be taken at face value, which is, we're not happy with the state of FPS games. I myself, as a gamer, my friends and I, we talk about how bored we are. We thought this was... It's something that's been meme'd to death. Even <a href="https://www.threads.com/@hideo_kojima/post/DHQjgfWSP8h/photo-posted-by-hideo-kojima-hideo_kojima" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three months ago, Hideo Kojima had a hat that said, âMake TV great again.</u></a>â [Author's note: While this photo was reposted in March on Threads, the <a href="https://x.com/NicolasWR/status/939367950003269632" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo itself appears to be from 2017</a>.] And his hat was red and there was no controversy there, so we talked about it, and we thought, okay, maybe some people will take it the wrong way, but it's been meme'd to death. It kind of says what we feel, which is we want to just make an awesome game and we're not happy with the state of FPS.â</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't regret what I said to be candid...my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I pointed out to Proulx that the MAGA hat and its message have become associated for many with feelings of discomfort and even fear due to current political events. I also <a href="https://apnews.com/live/immigration-protests-los-angeles-6-10-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted the protests going on just a few miles away from Summer Game Fest</u></a>, where Los Angelenos were taking to the streets to defend their immigrant neighbors from ongoing raids by ICE under President Trumpâs orders, and where the National Guard is being deployed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/nx-s1-5428579/protests-against-ice-have-continued-in-la-into-the-week-heres-what-to-know" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>despite protests remaining largely peaceful</u></a>. What does Proulx say to Splitgate fans and community members who felt genuinely emotionally distraught seeing the hat, in light of all that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âI think the best I can say is we're not trying to send any sort of political message and we're moving on from this,â he replied. âOur intent is, we just want to make a great game, we want to listen to the fans, we've always been all about the community. And that's not just community in terms of listening to feedback to make the game better, but it's also in terms of making a community that people want to be a part of where the devs are engaging with the players, it's a positive community and so that's our ambition. Obviously, right now, it doesn't feel that way but we're getting back to our focus and that's what our focus is. So we're putting this behind us, we're moving forward, we're just going to keep listening to the community and making a great game.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pushed one more time on this topic, noting that <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371?t=jway7_wXhk9W9VauRWSkrA&amp;s=19" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in a tweet Proulx said he was ânot here to apologizeâ</u></a>, and here he seemed to be deliberately avoiding apologizing as well. He confirmed that was the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âI don't regret what I said to be candid. I think that I stand by it and my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My interview with Proulx, where he committed to not apologizing, took place on Sunday. Today, however, Proulx posted another videoâ¦ apologizing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The truth is I am sorry. And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">âI want to apologize. And genuinely, you donât have to believe me. But the truth is I am sorry. And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community. The most important thing to me right now is I want to have an amazing communityâ¦ I hate seeing division. And thatâs what Iâm seeing now, on both sides. Thereâs division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry. And again, Iâll reiterate, I do stand by the intent of this, which is, the intent truly is, take it at face value. We do want to improve this genre. We do feel that the genre is in a bad state. And we want to make FPS games as amazing as possible. But I also understand that itâs not just about intent, itâs about impact, and the platform that we have had has had a negative impact, and for that Iâm truly sorry.â</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">No excuses, I'm sorry. <a href="https://t.co/4dgOxrSXUJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4dgOxrSXUJ</a></p>â Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Back to our interview, we moved on to the second part of the controversy: Proulxâs comments on the shooter genre and specifically his mention of the Call of Duty franchise. During his speech onstage at the event, Proulx said, "I grew up playing Halo. And I'm tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year, and I wish we could have Titanfall 3." In response, heâs received criticism from Splitgate fans, Call of Duty fans, and developers both for using his platform at the show to disparage other video games, as well as for calling out Call of Duty when Splitgate 2 contains many of the same features, including the free-to-play battle royale mode Proulx revealed onstage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On this front, Proulx admits his studio went too far in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l5ykvq/the_splitgate_page_just_flamed_a_cod_dev_lmao/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>response on Twitter</u></a> to a Call of Duty developer who criticized his remarks. The developer tweeted, ââmake fps great againâ and its splitgateâ, prompting the official Splitgate account to quote tweet it with, âWhich Call of Duty does your team make again? I canât tell them apart.â Both tweets have since been deleted, and Proulx said he was not the person behind that particular remark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âYeah, so I will say there was a tweet that we put out that we have since deleted, and I will apologize for that one. I mean, everything is on me of course as the CEO, that was not my post. My posts are me, right? They're videos of me, I try to be really just honest and off-script and just talk to the fans directly, but there's no excuse for that one and we did take it down.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Proulx stood by what he said onstage. He said he doesnât have a specific beef with Call of Duty, but misses the âgood old daysâ of the game. I asked him what that means, and he said he misses the ânewness and the innovationâ, citing Call of Duty 4. âAnd then Modern Warfare 2 taking it to the next level, whether it was the campaign, the multiplayer, all the skins to grind for, the lack of skill-based matchmaking where you just felt like it was very organic. And it feels like there's sort of a lack of innovation now that they're putting out quality and polish, but they're not necessarily pushing the bar forward.â</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Splitgate 2 Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, thereâs the microtransactions. Splitgate 2 is free-to-play with microtransactions, and when it launched on June 6, players immediately began expressing their displeasure over one particular microtransaction: a $145 bundle, discounted to $80 for launch. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1047 Games cut the price dramatically down to $40 almost immediately</u></a>, along with the prices of a number of other items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a video published just before our interview took place, Proulx apologized for the pricing situation, saying he only learned about the bundle pricing shortly after he got offstage at Summer Game Fest. He attested that 1047 Gamesâ former head of monetization, who âhappened to come from Call of Dutyâ, had been âvery aggressive on the pricing,â and that prices had been even higher before. After his departure from the company, Proulx claimed 1047 leadership did a reevaluation of the pricing and lowered most prices, but âthings slipped through the cracks.â</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Why we went from $80 to $40. <a href="https://t.co/8VC7Ku1qHQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8VC7Ku1qHQ</a></p>â Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1931851534511329731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">I asked him how he, as head of the company, was unaware of the pricing of bundles for the game he was launching. Proulx reiterated that he took responsibility for what happened, saying he had been âvery focused on getting through the beta.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âWe got through beta, we had other fires to attend to so I was focused on servers and just trying to get us through that. I was not thinking at all about monetization because I was just like, we're not going to make any money, it doesn't even matter if people can't play the game. And so that was where my head was at for the last two weeks was like, we got to just make sure this game is great, fix the servers, keep the lights on, fix the issues. Okay, we've made it barely, now we've got to go launch this game. And then it was a kind of, what the fuck moment, like how did we not catch this?â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pointed to Proulxâs comment in the video that the person he alleges is responsible had previously worked on Call of Duty, which seemed to fit with accusations that he was taking shots at the game. Proulx replied that it was âa funny coincidence, but a hundred percent the truth.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We talked a bit more about what happened, with Proulx reiterating that 1047 Games never intends to do anything like that expensive bundle ever again, and that theyâre refunding players who already purchased it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">âWhether you like my original statement or not, that is what I am trying to accomplish here, and I don't need to talk about the statement anymore,â he says. âWhat I'm trying to accomplish here is I want to build a brand, and a community, and a product that people want to support where we are listening, that's the best way to do it. That's not how it's done anymore, and that is how I want to do it. You tell us your feedback, we're going to take that to heart, we're going to iterate, and we're going to actually take action quickly. We're not going to sit around and wait for the proper PR statement. That's why a lot of times when we talk to the players, I don't have a script, I just turn my phone on and we just find out what comes out of my mouth and that's what we go with.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To wrap it up, I asked Proulx if heâs learned anything from this trifecta of incidents. Heâs made it clear 1047 Games doesnât intend to offer expensive bundles in the future, but what about the Call of Duty comments and the Make FPS Great Again hat? Will this incident inform how he presents himself in the future?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I've just kind of learned just the impact that little things like this can have on people.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">âYes,â Proulx said. âSo I'd say the biggest lesson, just kind of realizing the platform that we have, it's got a lot more weight than we realized and also just the seriousness of everything in this day and age. We intended to put out a meme, we intended to put out something that summarized how we feel, truly, but also it was a joke. It's a joke that's been done to death and has literally been done by Hideo Kojima, and we thought, well, this is a good data point for how a similar reaction will occur. We also specifically chose to do a black hat instead of a red one, not that that, I don't know if that makes a difference. So I think I've just kind of learned just the impact that little things like this can have on people and so we're trying to be very thoughtful about it going forward. And we're trying to get back to focusing, there's all this stuff in the air I just want to move on, I want to make a fun game. That's what we're going to do.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all the criticism, Proulx doesnât feel that any of the issues over the last week have impacted Splitgate 2 as a game. âI think there's so many games that have done well over time that have had controversies, whatever it is. I think it did get us a lot of attention, whether good or bad and now it's on us as developers to improve and actually act on feedback. And so if we do that, I think we're going to succeed. And if we don't, I don't think any of this would've mattered.â</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently rebranded</a> tabletop publisher has initiated a new series of strategic acquisitions of prominent board game IPs and studios. Its first most recent purchase is of the co-op zombie game series owned by CMON.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/06/10/asmodee-buys-zombicide-ip-from-struggling-cmon-as-first-move-in-new-acquisition-spree/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, Asmodee has purchased the <em>Zombicide</em> IP from CMON for an undisclosed amount of money. This sale is, in part, connected to CMON's ongoing financial struggles. These troubles are substantive enough, the company is&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">scaling back production</a>&nbsp;due to the proposed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US trade tariffs</a>.</p>

<p>Asmodee CEO Thomas Koegler said, âWe are proud the iconic Zombicide IP further strengthens our tabletop games portfolio and allows us to reinforce our presence in key geographies. I canât wait for the team to get to work at whatâs coming next for this fantastic IP.â</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>&nbsp;Zombicide</em> is one of the earliest success stories of tabletop Kickstarter campaigns. The first campaign was held in 2012 with the simple premise of you and your friends fighting through the zombie apocalypse. It was such a simple, cathartic premise, it spawned dozens of expansions and spin-offs.</p>

<p>Notable entries in the <em>Zombicide</em> franchise include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>DCeased</em></a>, where Superman and friends must fend off Anti-Life zombies, a crossover with the Winchester brothers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-supernatural-zombicide-packs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide: Supernatural</em></a>, a tabletop adaptation of the Zack Snyder film <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-announces-army-of-dead-board-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Army of the Dead</em></a>, and even a licensed spin-off featuring the art and mascot of heavy metal band, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/iron-maiden-goes-plastic-with-zombicide-crossover" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Iron Maiden</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of its monetary value, the sale of Zombicide is illustrative of CMON's ongoing financial struggles. In roughly the same time frame, the company sold five other board game IPs:&nbsp;<em>Blood Rage</em>, <em>Rising Sun</em>, <em>Ankh: Gods of Egypt</em>, <em>Arcadia Quest</em>, and <em>Starcadia Quest</em>, to Tabletop Tycoon.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, CMON is still selling what remains of their stock of other board game franchises they own. These include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-summons-new-cthulhu-death-may-die-to-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em></a>, <em>Rising Sun</em>, and <em>Marvel United.</em></p>

              <section>

                <p> There were more souls-likes than I could muster the interest in at Summer Game Fest 2025. I've never been one to enjoy the genre in most cases anyway, and seeing how many games were leaning into gameplay loops of dodge-roll showdowns with gigantic, spongey bosses had me checked out at times during the various showcases over the past week. But I played one game that borrows from the genre and didn't turn me away. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/end-of-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-681505">End of Abyss</a> takes a few touchstones from games like Dark Souls, ties it in with a Little-Nightmares-in-space aesthetic, and brings it all together in a cleverly creepy twin-stick shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">End of Abyss comes from Section 9 Interactive, a new studio created in part by former Tarsier Studio developers, the team behind Little Nightmares and its sequel. The Little Nightmares influence can definitely be felt in End of Abyss. Though the enemy and world design are much different, trading the stuff of childhood night terrors for coldly blue-tinted isolation akin to a sci-fi horror story, there's something about it that feels familiar. Maybe it's the nameless, voiceless character being chased by fleshy monsters. Or maybe it's their brightly colored jacket--here a lime green as opposed to Little Nightmare's yellow raincoat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eot8qV7CuTA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eot8qV7CuTA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, the protagonist in End of Abyss can defend themselves, unlike those in Tarsier's games. Using a pistol with unlimited ammo, or other found weapons like a shotgun I discovered in my play session, the game's twin-stick shooting felt well-implemented. It wasn't very sticky, which I liked, as it gave it an anxiety-inducing effect. Missing shots meant the enemies were able to close the distance and caused me to dodge them, either out of the room so I could create a bottleneck in a doorway, or just catch my breath. Some enemies grew long, giraffe-like necks, which they swung at me with sneakily far reach. Others came in packs of several small bugs that would jump on me, causing me to shake them off and book it, or try to knife them on their approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The souls-like inspirations can be felt in a few ways some players will be familiar with. For one, the map feels circular in that satisfying way From Software and its lineage utilize a lot. Exploring every space felt key, as it allowed me to find hidden caches of weapon or suit upgrade materials, but just as important, I could unlock passageways that helped me loop back around to earlier areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the enemies respawn when you save at a mysterious type of pod--not to be confused with a traditional bonfire--these shortcuts helped evade the same sequence of enemies each time I came back to the area to save or upgrade my character. There are no corpse runs, but the game will punish you for failing to save manually, so these shortcuts back to a safe haven will be vital for survival.</p><p dir="ltr">I got to take on a huge boss monster too, which, despite its sizeable health bar, didn't prove too tricky given my abundance of shotgun ammo I'd crafted by then, but I expect this was a kindness afforded to me in the demo only, and in the full game, I'd have to scramble a bit more. The boss battle felt soulsy too, where each hit devastated me, so I could only afford to mess up very few times. I'm hoping the game can strike a nice balance between being challenging yet not brutal, and co-creator Mattias Ottvall told me that's the team's vision as well.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played so far, the game's best attribute is its atmosphere. There is a chilling stillness to the world. Enemies often stand around, or even seem to lie in wait, until you approach them, sometimes sneak-attacking from behind a doorway or out of a shadow. This leaves you alone much of the time, unsure of what's around each corner. Your scanner device, which can locate secret caches or puzzle areas, echoes through the ghostly halls of the alien world. I suspect the game won't care to answer many questions about where and when the game takes place, and I'm perfectly happy to go along for that ride into the unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly a horror game, Ottvall told me, but the game has inched closer to that identity during development because its small team featured mostly artwork-focused developers. The mechanics of the game naturally shifted to adapt to the art-driven game. That was an interesting wrinkle for me to learn, as it suggests that the game may have looked quite different if the balance between gameplay designers and world designers was skewed the other way. Instead, we got the icy-blue End of Abyss you can see in the trailer above, which is definitely more up my alley than a demanding combat-first game the devs may have once been targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who loves Little Nightmares, enjoys twin-stick shooters, and doesn't care for souls-likes, I feel what I saw so far is enough of those first two elements to allow me not to get frustrated by its third element. End of Abyss seems to be the start of an intriguing new studio. It's coming to Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege X</a> is now available on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Amazon Luna). The sizable update improves graphics and adds new content, but also brings free access to the game, allowing newcomers to join with a selection of operators and play Unranked, Quick Match, and Dual Front modes without paying. Certain features like Ranked playlists, Siege Cup, additional operators, and cosmetics require payment to unlock.</p>
<p>Two of the available options are the Elite Edition, which grants access to all game modes, including Ranked playlists and Siege Cup, and 16 additional operators for $19.99, and the Ultimate Edition, which also unlocks all game modes, the Ranked playlists and the Siege Cup, but adds immediate access to 52 Operators and the Disruptor Pack for a price of $39.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X: Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Rainbow Six Siege X, players will experience the brand-new permanent 6v6 mode, Dual Front. For the first time, Dual Front mixes Attackers and Defenders to seize enemy sectors while defending their own. During matches, players can respawn, change their selected operator, and complete time-limited Neutral Sector assignments. Siege X also introduces significant upgrades and overhauls to the graphics, gameplay, and audio.</p>
<p>At launch, five modernized 5v5 maps received upgrades to lighting, shadows, and resolution: Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe. Three new 5v5 maps will be modernized each season thereafter.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege X is deeper thanks to new destructible items, including gas pipes, metal detectors, and fire extinguishers. Players can interact with these items strategically to outplay their opponents. Rappel navigation and momentum movement have also been improved, providing more fluid controls. Players can now sprint horizontally along walls on rappel and maneuver around building corners.</p>
<p>The audio propagation and reverberation have been overhauled, making the game sound more realistic than before. This enables players to gather critical intelligence through audio cues, allowing them to pinpoint the location and type of rooms where enemy players are on the map. Lastly, Ubisoft MontrÃ©al has added a new onboarding experience that will help new players build their skills and confidence.</p>

                <p>Funcom's Dune: Awakening is finally out on PC, but you might be wondering if it's also headed to consoles. Now that the game has launched on PC, Funcom re-affirmed that Awakening is, indeed, headed to console platforms, but not until 2026.</p><p>There is no specific 2026 release date, however, nor is there a set of confirmed console platforms, but Xbox and PlayStation systems seem like a safe bet.

This is the full 1.0 launch, not early access, and there are no subscription fees or microtransactions.</p><p>There is a $25 season pass that includes a range of content, including the sandworm, hiroptera, kulon, and Muad'Dib creatures, which are available now.
