Eventually Macarro encounters Reeves’ John Wick and the trailer ends on a suggestion of him training her in his more boutique brand of deadly arts, AKA how to get shot and stabbed for 90 minutes and still kick everyone’s ass. </p><p>What started as intriguing but limited fantasy-infused underworld lorebuilding in the original <em>John Wick</em> has burgeoned into a full cinematic universe.

<p>Developer Lavapotion and Coffee Stain Publishing have announced that its turn-based fantasy strategy game Songs of Conquest is coming to mobile.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to be bringing Songs of Conquest to yet another platform outside of PC,”&nbsp;said Christian Knutsson, Art Director at Lavapotion, via release. “The teams at Coffee Stain and Lavapotion have worked hard to make sure that the experience of playing Songs of Conquest on mobile is seamless and immersive. We can’t wait to see what our players think!”</p>



<p>An exact release date wasn’t revealed with the announcement, but it will be coming soon to both iOS and Android.</p>

<p>Songs of Conquest first release in Early Access in May 2022. The game’s 1.0 launch took place in May 2024, and has sold over 500,000 copies <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/867210/Songs_of_Conquest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>. Lavapotion also has multiple expansions and DLC plans in development for the game.</p>



<p>“Songs of Conquest is a turn-based strategy that follows in the footsteps of genre legends such as the Heroes of Might and Magic series,” the game’s description reads. “The game’s unique 2.5D pixel art design and strategic gameplay blend into an experience likely to make fans of the genre reminisce about the strategy titles they used to play, and revel at the depth and replayability of the game.”</p>

<p>Today marks the debut of the first full trailer for the second season of <em>The Last of Us</em>, the grim but compelling post-apocalyptic drama on HBO that's based on the popular video game of the same name.</p>
<p>The trailer revisits the first season's two protagonists—Joel and Ellie—five years after Joel's fateful choice. Here's the simple, straightforward logline HBO provided:</p>
<blockquote><p>After five years of peace following the events of the first season, Joel and Ellie’s collective past catches up to them, drawing them into conflict with each other and a world even more dangerous and unpredictable than the one they left behind.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to returning characters, we get some glimpses of some new characters and the actors who will play them. Jeffrey Wright (<em>Westworld</em>,&nbsp;<em>American Fiction</em>) will reprise his role as Isaac from the game, while Kaitlyn Dever (<em>Booksmart</em>,&nbsp;<em>Justified</em>) will play Abby, a key character in the sequel.</p>
<p>Just as season one retold the story of the first <em>The Last of Us</em> game, season 2 will retell 2020's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/the-last-of-us-part-2-isnt-a-fully-satisfying-return-to-the-apocalypse/"><em>The Last of Us: Part II</em></a>. Those who've just been following the TV show know to expect something grim, but those of us who have played the game (or followed its controversies in gaming communities) know that non-gaming TV fans are probably not prepared for what's coming.</p>
<p>If that describes you, you fortunately have some time to steel yourself. The show is slated for a 2025 premiere, but there has been no official marketing to narrow that window any further. That said, HBO content chief Casey Bloys recently <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/casey-bloys-hacks-emmy-win-harry-potter-series-euphoria-1236090121/">hinted</a> that the network plans to air <em>The Last of Us</em>'s second season soon enough to position it for the next Emmy Awards, which means it's likely to arrive in the first half of the year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store.993501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At this point, with Sony's antics, it probably doesn't come as a surprise that Sony has quietly raised the price of Horizon Zero Dawn on the Playstation Store. The Complete Edition of Horizon Zero Dawn was $19.99 on the PlayStation Store, but the price has now doubled since they announced the remaster. The doubled price has been visible on the PS store since September 25, where the price is now $39.99. In the past couple of months, Sony has made multiple price changes quietly. For example, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-controllers-receive-price-hike-in-us/">bumped up the price of their DualSense controllers by $5</a> at all outlets without making any sort of announcement.<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/"> Japan saw a huge price hike of the original PlayStation 5 console of $90</a>, which is the second time Japan has seen the console's price go up.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-CUSA10213_00-HRZCE00000000000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price increase of the original version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> puts the cost of the remaster at $49.99 instead of $29.99 if you were someone who had to purchase the remaster new from the PlayStation Store. While those who owned the original are able to get the remaster as an upgrade for $9.99, those who had the game on disc and now use a Digital Edition PlayStation 5 are at a huge disadvantage. Not only can they no longer play the original unless they have their PlayStation 4, but they won't be able to buy the game for the upgrade price of $9.99, as they cannot verify their purchase by inserting the disc into the console. This means that those from that group of people would have to pay the full-blown price of $49.99 if they wanted to own the remaster.</p>
<p>If you want to get a physical copy of the game, you are able to get the game for $19.99 from physical retailers, but of course, those who are digital-only are at a huge disadvantage.</p>
<p>This is the first time Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition has experienced a price jump in the six years it's been on the market. Of course, it's been on sale during this time, but this is the first time the game has bumped up by such a huge margin. At the moment, Sony has made no comment as to why the price increase has happened or has not verified the fact that they did it.</p>
<p>Again, it's not at all surprising that Sony has done this, especially since they have made so much money by remastering games (with The Last of Us being remastered multiple times), and bumping up the price of the original PlayStation 5 console to attempt to bring in more profit, as their finances have been in a rough position, as shown by their financial reports.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-londons-next-patch-said-to-bring-huge-improvements-team-folon-drafted-extra-help-for-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fallout: London was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">mod that took the community by storm</a> and completely overhauled Fallout 4. TEAM FOLON is the team who have been working on the mod, and while the mod did release successfully, there were some teething issues. Since then, it's been relatively quiet. TEAM FOLON has now offered an update regarding what's going on with Patch 1.02. To ensure the update is going how it should, TEAM FOLON has drafted in some extra help to improve the performance of the mod.</p>
<p>While they haven't provided an exact date for the patch, they've said that the patch should be out before London Comic Con, which takes place on 25-27 October. "We know we said it'd be soon and yes it's taken a little longer than expected, but it's for a good reason - we've brought in some external help to improve performance, facegen data, and LOD, and it took awhile to get them up to speed, but <em>wow</em> the difference," says Project Manager Dean 'Prilladog' Carter. It's not specified if the people hired to help out with the Fallout: London mod came from a specific company or whether they were freelancers. Depending on how the patch goes, it'll be interesting to see if any of it leads to a potential position working alongside Team FOLON.</p>
<p>For those who want to know what Team FOLON is working on, the team provided a link to a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTHHRBjaKituLhWsOBQtYsH1oXkZQljkQNaiHTyfNRY/edit?gid=1194763901#gid=1194763901" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Spreadsheet</a> that shows off all of the fixes and improvements they are making so that you can keep an eye on their progress.</p>
<p>While the Google Spreadsheet is extensive and covers a lot of ground, some of the main tweaks they're including are changes to LOD clip volumes, which should hopefully reduce the number of save file corruption issues that players are experiencing when visiting Islington or St Paul's Cathedral. They are also working on pre-combine regeneration, which should "fix various random/repeatable crashes."</p>
<p>In addition to these, they are working on some of the mod's long-broken quests, such as Lay of the Land, which has caused many issues for those who have been playing Fallout: London. Of course, the tweaks don't end there. There will also be many gameplay tweaks, including the removal of the ability to eat Atkins robots. The message regarding your afflictions at the start of the game will also be tweaked to provide the player with accurate numbers.</p>
<p>Team FOLON will be attending London MCM Comic Con, which explains their tentative due date for the patch being between October 25 and 27 for Fallout: London.</p>

Like others from the region, enhanced traversal is baked into her kit. Her skill summons a drill that she can use to quickly move up cliffs or bounce onto the ground for AoE damage. Everything aside from her normal attacks scales off of her DEF, so you’ll want to build her into a tank. From unlock methods to the ideal Artifacts, here’s everything you need to know about this adorable breakdancer.</p><h2 id="h10055"><a id=""></a><strong>How to unlock Kachina for free</strong></h2><p>Like every character in <em>Genshin Impact</em>, except for the Traveler, you’ll be able to unlock Kachina through banners. She’s currently being promoted in the limited-time event banners and should be added to the standard Wanderlust Invocation banner in the future. Thankfully, you don’t have to rely solely on luck to unlock her.</p><p><strong>Playing through the recently added 5.0 Archon quest line will unlock her for free.</strong> If you’re a new player or just a little behind on the story, you can also skip ahead to play through these events. The only requirement is completing the Chapter 1 Act 3 Archon Quest first. Then you just need to open the Events Overview menu and scroll down to the “Turbo Twirly!” tab. Confirm that you want a Quick Start and you’ll be able to start the quest.</p><h2 id="h10056"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Kachina team composition</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-recommend-id="image://9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party setup screen with four characters at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party setup screen with four characters at the ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-recommend-id="image://9e94c124b74f7a4ce50e8543853e7b2f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party setup screen with four characters at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The primary role for Kachina will be a Sub-DPS, but it’s possible to build her as a Support as well. I’ll be listing the optimal choices for each aspect of her build. Starting it off is choosing the right team.</p><p><strong>Noelle and Itto are wonderful characters to fill the primary DPS role</strong>, bouncing off Kachina’s attacks with Geo Resonance. Geo can sometimes be a finicky element, which is why it helps to pair them with each other.</p><p><strong>Navia is another great option to focus on DPS.</strong> Just remember that her kit benefits from the Crystalize reaction, so she should not be included on a mono-Geo team. One of the Artifact Sets I’ll be mentioning later works best with a Rainbow team (one with multiple element types), so consider diversifying your party.</p><p>You can also place Kachina with a support and DPS pair that shares the same element. This can provide consistent Crystalize shields, which is nice to have against certain enemies or bosses. <strong>Typical pairings include Furina and Neuvillette, Shenhe and Ayaka, or Bennett and Xianling.</strong></p><p>The Natlan characters revealed so far do have unique regional mechanics and can shorten their Nightsoul Burst cooldown when multiple are paired on a team together.<strong> Mualani is a solid choice for a primary DPS, but Kinich and other Natlan characters coming in the future should work too.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-recommend-id="image://91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Weapons screen shows a girl wielding a polearm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Weapons screen shows a girl wielding a polearm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-recommend-id="image://91a8a5ef83a1f8e918e28aa2729bff97" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Weapons screen shows a girl wielding a polearm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since her DEF is so crucial for her gameplay, you’ll want to equip her with items that increase that stat. There sadly aren’t many weapons that buff DEF though, so I suggest focusing on DMG or energy regeneration for alternates.</p><p>Kachina’s best weapon is one introduced along with their region. <strong>Footprint of the Rainbow increases Base ATK and DEF, which is exactly what we want.</strong> Additionally, it also has an ability that triggers when an Elemental Skill is used, increasing DEF further for 15 seconds. It practically feels custom-made for her and you can easily craft it after a bit of grinding for materials.</p><p><strong>Another solid option is Deathmatch.</strong> Its primary effect is to increase CRIT Rate, but it will also increase ATK and DEF when 2+ enemies are nearby, or just ATK when fewer are nearby. The only catch here is that this weapon is only attainable from the battle pass.</p><p><strong>It’s a bit different, but Favonius Lance is also a great alternative option.</strong> It increases the user’s energy recharge rate and also adds a decent chance for CRIT hits to generate additional energy. The weapon is a default item included on every primary banner. This means it can technically be earned for free, as long as you have some luck.</p><h2 id="h10057"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Talents to Level Up</strong></h2><p>Both Mualani and Kachina have transformative skills that enhance their combat and make exploring a lot easier. You’ll want the skills to be active far more often than not for either one. Among the talents, here’s the order to focus on:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Elemental Skill - Go, Go Turbo Twirly!</li><li>Elemental Burst - Time to Get Serious!</li><li>Normal Attack - Cragbiter</li></ul><h2 id="h10058"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Artifacts for Kachina</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-recommend-id="image://ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-recommend-id="image://ae2b39f75a6f3d164cc19c1c4d603b76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A girl surrounded by floating items on the Artifacts screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your choice of artifacts will depend on the role you want Kachina to fill, as well as who’s on her team. Those that buff DEF are perfect, but there are some other choices to slot in.</p><p><strong>My top Artifact suggestion for Kachina is Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City.</strong> The two-piece effect regenerates elemental energy as long as a nearby party member triggers a Nightsoul Burst. Its four-piece effect activates once the user triggers an elemental reaction and can provide one or two buffs. The base buff is that nearby party members will receive a 12 percent increase in Elemental DMG for the elements involved in the reaction. If the user is in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, an additional 28 percent increase will be added as well.</p><p>Similar to Mualani and the Obsidian Codex, this artifact set has been introduced along with the Natlan region. It can be earned by completing the Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits Domain of Blessing.</p><p><strong>Next in line, and pairing very well, is Husk of Opulent Dreams.</strong> This artifact’s two-piece effect increases the DEF stat by an impressive 30 percent. The four-piece effect brings in a unique Curiosity stack mechanic, with one stack added for every Geo attack every 0.3 stacks. A stack will also be added every three seconds when the user is off-field.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/eric-adams-phone-indictment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know Aftermath isn’t a local news blog (you can check out our pals <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell Gate</a> and <a href="https://nygroove.nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Groove</a> for that), but I am simply so full of excitement over the <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/09/25/eric-adams-indicted-department-justice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indictment</a> of New York City Mayor Eric Adams that I need to shout it to the world.&nbsp;</p><p>You probably don’t live in New York City, so there’s no need to go into who Eric Adams is and why he became mayor and all the dumb shit he’s <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/04/eric-adams-scandals-lies-bad-policies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">done and said</a> since. Suffice it to say that in the last few weeks, <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/09/09/fbi-investigation-eric-adams-aides-inner-circle-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several of his closest allies have been investigated by the FBI and/or resigned</a>, and all of us who live here have been waiting for the other shoe to drop. Which it did last night, <a href="https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/best-reactions-mayor-adams-indictment-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making Twitter good again</a>.</p><p>The indictment was <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/read-the-eric-adams-indictment-here/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unsealed</a> this morning, showing that the investigation centers around claims, as Hell Gate writes, “ that Adams illegally accepted luxury travel from foreign governments, as well as illegal straw donations that resulted in him receiving more than $10 million in public matching funds for his 2021 campaign.” Adams has so far <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/full-list-democrats-calling-new-yorks-eric-adams-resign-1959546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refuted calls to resign</a> and seems to be claiming that the investigation is over him… standing up for New Yorkers too much? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway! Bits of the indictment are going around on social media, because it is very long and only politics sickos are going to read it all. One gem is this excerpt, wherein Adams claimed in an earlier investigation in 2023 that he really <em>wanted</em> to cooperate with the FBI, it’s just that he changed his phone password because of <em>how much he wanted to cooperate</em>, but then he forgot it.</p><p>The paragraph reads (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>On November 6, 2023, FBI agents executed a search warrant for the electronic devices used by ERIC ADAMS, the defendant. Although ADAMS was carrying several electronic devices, including two cellphones, he was not carrying his personal cellphone, which is the device he used to communicate about the conduct described in this indictment. When ADAMS produced his personal cellphone the next day in response to a subpoena, it was locked, such that the device required a password to open. <strong>ADAMS claimed that after he learned about the investigation into his conduct, he changed the password on November 5 2024 [sic], and increased the complexity of his password from four digits to six.</strong> <strong>ADAMS had done this, he claimed,</strong> <strong>to prevent members of his staff from inadvertently or intentionally deleting the contents of his phone because, according to ADAMS, he wished to preserve the contents of his phone due to the investigation. But, ADAMS further claimed, he had forgotten the password he had just set, and thus was unable to provide the FBI with a password that would unlock the phone.</strong></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>We’ve all been there, right?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/once-humans-prismverses-clash-scenario-launches-september-26/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-mobile-testing-begins-september-19-dlss-3-support-on-pc/">Once Human developer team</a> has revealed a new huge update for their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-apocalyptic multiplayer game</a>. This time, the update adds a brand new scenario for players to dive into, as well as new game modes. This update also brings new events to the game, as well as the new Prism Energy Mechanism, new in-game rewards, and an update to the Ranching system.</p>
<p>Prismverse's Clash is the first new Scenario to be added to the game, with a heavy focus on PvP. Players will have to choose to side with either the Rosetta or Mayfly factions as they both attempt to capture Prism Deviations and gather Prism Energy. Whoever gathers the most will decide the victor of the contest. In this scenario, players will be able to participate in GVG (Group vs. Group) battles in the huge world of Once Human. Players will be able to form battle squads and come up with tactics that can both attack or defend against the enemy factions. To gain an advantage, players can build territories, which will allow them to come up with more squad tactics. While this scenario may be lengthy, there will also be shorter scenario lengths, which will allow players to acquire resources quickly. Death penalties will be reduced, meaning players won't lose their weapons or equipment if they die in PvP combat. Additionally, any territory built will be protected, allowing them to choose where to assign their efforts.</p>
<p>During Prismverse's Clash, PvP content will be active in all map areas except for safe zones, which house the faction's base camps. If you step outside the safe zones, you may be killed, as the two factions will compete to control the Prism Deviations, including minor battles with makeshift weapons. Prism Deviations are more active during Public Crisis events, which feature 30 players all fighting for victory.</p>
<p>In addition to the Prismverse's Clash update, the Ranching system in Once Human also gained a new update. With the Ranching system, players can capture animals in the wilderness and raise them in their base. New animals have been added to this update, including Capybaras, Flamingos, and Leopards. Most importantly, animal breeding has been added to the Ranching system. Once the player has constructed the special facilities needed, they will be able to breed animals, which can lead to animals with rare color schemes.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Finally, there are free rewards in-game for returning players. To access them, you simply have to log in to the game or complete specific quests. These items are only available for a limited time.</p>

<p>The LA Thieves has just unveiled a locked-in roster for the 2025 CDL season. For the last few weeks, rumours have been circulating regarding a ‘super team’ that would be a sure shot to at least secure a chip or two in the next season. Now, the California-based organisation has made good on that reveal, unveiling a superstar team that could be our next COD Champs winner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-sheer-power">The Sheer Power</h2>



<p>LA Thieves has revealed the big-bucks line-up for the 2025 CDL season:</p>



<ul>
<li>HyDra</li>



<li>Ghosty</li>



<li>Envoy</li>



<li>Scrap</li>
</ul>



<p>Envoy and Scrap are coming across from Toronto Ultra, where the latter player has spent the entire of his career thus far. HyDra is migrating from Cloud9 (formerly the Subliners) after years in the starting roster. He’ll finally be leaving the team that helped him secure his first world championship title – which was won against Scrap, funnily enough.</p>



<p>Ghosty has been with the LA Thieves throughout the most recent season of the Call of Duty League, and it’s assumed he’ll stay in his role as IGL. This has the makings of a power roster for sure, and the raw talent in this squad is almost unimaginable. Scrap and HyDra alone represent some of the most electrifying players to make it into the CDL in recent years.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’ll likely blow our minds to learn how much Nadeshot’s LA Thieves paid to acquire this roster. In recent weeks, figures being thrown around sat at more than $700,000 for a full buyout of these players. It’s unlikely it’ll be confirmed, but perhaps one of these players will slip up on stream and mention how much they’re getting paid.</p>



<p>Will LA Thieves win more than just a chip next year in the CDL? Let us know your thoughts on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">the Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
A week after Saber Interactive promised a whole bunch of player-requested features and fixes for Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, the first of these are now here - with the sci-fi shooter's latest patch introducing "more helpful and effective" bots, private lobbies, and more.
</p>
<p>
Saber Interactive spent a fair bit of time discussing bots <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-studio-pledges-a-bunch-of-player-requested-features-and-fixes">last week</a>, acknowledging player complaints that the general ineffectiveness of teammate bots mades solo games "significantly harder". And thus Patch 3.0, which lifts various "inhibiting restrictions" during the campaign to make bots more "helpful and effective, while still not beating the game for the player".
</p>
<p>
Previous restrictions preventing bots from finishing off enemies have now been "heavily eased", for instance, and bots can now help with Gargoyle objectives and focus-firing zoanthropes when they're attacked by players. Additionally, enemy aggressiveness has been decreased on Veteran Difficulty to further improve the single-player experience, and, in order to balance out these changes, player health has been "slightly" reduced.

<p>
Elsewhere in Patch 3.0, Saber has introduced private lobbies for Operation mode, meaning players wanting to attempt an operation alone with bots or alongside one friend will no longer be forced into matchmaking with random players.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, players can now muck around in the new Sparring Arena, accessed via the Battle Barge's Launch Bay, while in Operations or Eternal War mode. Here, they'll receive weapons and grenades as if in a PvP match then have the opportunity to duke it out with their Battle-Brothers ahead of a mission.
</p>
<p>
Other notable additions include ultrawide support for PC and the option to reset custom colour presets, but Saber's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4696781406109497749?l=english">full patch notes</a> are considerably more extensive. Patch 3.0 marks the first release in Space Marine 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-promises-free-new-modes-missions-and-more">previously detailed Year One roadmap</a>, with the likes of new PvE missions, a new Lethal difficulty, new enemies, and more still to come before the end of 2024.
</p>
<p>
And if you haven't done so already, Space Marine 2 is well worth checking out. Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane called it a "spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">four star review</a>. "It's the KFC party bucket of video games," he wrote, "delightfully messy, almost certainly bad for you, and best shared with friends."

The Xbox TGS 2025 showcase was light on big announcements but did have plenty of new trailers for stuff people are excited about, including the <em>Delta</em> remake of <em>Metal Gear Sold 3: Snake Eater</em>. And, of course, it wouldn’t be an Xbox event without some Game Pass news. <br></p><p>The Microsoft event took place earlier today and ran about 45 minutes. It was a varied presentation full of gameplay footage and overdue Xbox Series X/S ports of older beloved games, like the<em> Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>even if it was light on big news overall. A rumored and much hoped for announcement of Final Fantasy XVI coming to Xbox never happened, for example. </p><p>But a bunch of other Japanese RPGs are also coming to Xbox. And though we didn’t get <em>StarCraft 3</em> and probably never will, Microsoft did share when the first two games in Blizzard’s hit RTS franchise will come to Game Pass, and it’s not far away. Here’s everything teased, revealed, and announced during the 2024 Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast. </p></div></div><div><p>We got a brand new look at the <em>Metal Gear Solid 3 </em>remake including Revolver Ocelot, Colonel Volgin, and more. The game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819">continues to look like a 1:1 replica of the original game</a></span>, but it’s great-looking nonetheless. There’s still no release date for it on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p></div><div><p>Popular anime <em>My Hero Academia</em> is getting a collab with <em>Overwatch 2</em>. That means more costumes for D.Va and others, but fans are starting to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-my-hero-academia-crossover-skins-collab-1851658361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-my-hero-academia-crossover-skins-collab-1851658361">lose patience</a></span> with all these crossover deals instead of more meaningful updates. </p></div><div><p><em>Age of Mythology Retold </em>upgraded the classic fantasy RTS with new visuals and features, but most importantly it brought the game from PC to Xbox Series X/S. An expansion featuring Chinese gods got a tease today but there’s no release date for <em>Immortal Pillars</em> yet. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="22db1a1e6a99552de71af00e81c31896" data-recommend-id="image://22db1a1e6a99552de71af00e81c31896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1023" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A guy in a suit prepares to click 60 times per minute.

The world is cel-shaded and inspired by Japanese small towns, and it mixes together a construction sim with BMX tricks and various mini-games. No release date yet. <br></p></div><div><p>I’ve been burned before on gorgeous-looking but otherwise pretty mediocre retro-style RPGs, but I’m willing to get hurt again for <em>Threads of Time</em>. The 2.5D JRPG announced during the showcase looks incredible. </p></div><div><p><em>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie </em>is an update on the colorful ball-rolling PS2 classic. It was already on Xbox but now it’s joining the Game Pass catalog for Standard and above subscribers. </p></div><div><p>Undeterred by <em>Concord</em>’s struggle, hero shooter <em>FragPunk </em>is marching ahead with a closed beta in October. It has special powers and light deckbuilding mechanics. Plus the overall art style is a mesh of realism and bubblegum comic strip. We’ll see if it’s the real deal or not as it gets closer to launch. </p></div><div><p>Producer Junzo Hosoi walked fans through what to expect from <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em>, the first game in the <em>Atelier</em> series to appear on Xbox. The new one looks like the most ambitious yet.</p></div><div><p>I’m getting major <em>Freedom Wars</em> vibes from <em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>. It’s a PVPVE third-person extraction shooter with AI companions and custom mechs. That’s an overwhelming mix but it looks dope. Today we learned the game is out January 24, 2025. </p></div><div><p>At long last, regular pets are coming to the wasteland. While <em>Fallout 76</em> players have long tried to domesticate Deathclaws, they’ll now be able to have dogs, cats, and presumably other furry companions join them in their campsites. The update is expected to arrive sometime in December. </p></div><div><p>After being MIA for a while, the<em> Suikoden I </em>and<em> II </em>remasters recently resurfaced and they look stellar. More importantly, the HD overhauls will come with fast-forward options and an optional streamlined combat mode that only requires a single button press in order to cut through all of that old-school RPG grinding. </p></div><div><p>Q-Games, best known for the<em> Pixel Junk </em>franchise, is back with a multiplayer party game that looks like 3D <em>Tetris </em>where you are the pieces. It’s out today on Xbox Series X/S and PC, and also joining Game Pass PC and Ultimate.</p></div><div><p><em>Slitterhead </em>is from the original director of <em>Silent Hill</em>, and the latest glimpse of the horror survival game showed off the game’s possession mechanic which lets players can take control of other NPCs. It’s out later this year on November 8. </p></div><div><p>This is the first I’m hearing of<em> The Starbites: Taste of Desert</em> and it has my attention. It’s a turn-based, sci-fi RPG featuring mechs and a decent art style. You rummage across a desert for junk and fight stuff. The look reminds me vaguely of <em>Mega Man Legends</em>. I’m intrigued to find out more. </p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Quest III </em>was the first game in the series to add vocations, the series’ name for a job/class system. The latest trailer revealed the HD-2D remake will add an entirely new one called Monster Wrangler that lets players learn and use enemy abilities and also scout out monsters to battle in the arena. </p></div><div><p>Every classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> is now on Xbox Series X/S. The <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster </em>collection<em>&nbsp;</em>brings the first six games to the console today, while the rest, minus <em>Final Fantasy XI</em>, <em>XVI</em>, and <em>Remake</em> and <em>Rebirth</em>, were there previously. The collection isn’t a Game Pass addition (yet), and it’s no <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> port announcement, but it’s the best Xbox fans are getting at the moment. </p></div><div><p>Square Enix also announced a bunch of <em>Mana</em> ports for Xbox. <em>Trials of Mana</em>, the remake of the third game for SNES which wasn’t localized until recently, arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass PC and Ultimate alongside the HD remaster of<em> Legend of Mana</em>, the PS1 game with a fascinating but obtuse mix of city builder and crafting sim mechanics.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
