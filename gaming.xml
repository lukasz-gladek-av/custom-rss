			<p>Per Famitsu's sales records published by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/famitsu-sales-9-1-25-9-7-25">Gematsu</a>, the PlayStation 5 has surpassed<strong> 7 million units sold in Japan</strong> as of September 7, 2025.</p>



<p>After the console hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-reaches-80-million-units-shipped/">80.3 million units shipped last month,</a> this is the latest hardware milestone reached, with an estimated 7,009,937 units sold in Japan between the PlayStation 5 Pro and the digital and physical versions of the base PlayStation 5 console.</p>



<p>It's leagues above the Xbox Series family of consoles, which have, according to the same list of Famitsu's latest numbers, sold only an estimated 682,927 units between the Xbox Series X/S, and is starting to catch up with the PlayStation 4, which has sold approximately 7,929,886 units in its lifetime.</p>



<p>The fact that PlayStation 5 is already catching up to the PS4 in the region shows how strong sales are in Japan for this current generation, though by that same token, it also shows just how strong the PlayStation 4's presence was in Japan, and how the PS5 continues to lag behind its predecessor in Japan, and across the world. And recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">price increases to the console across the globe</a> certainly won't help move units. </p>



<p>That said, when it comes to videogame console sales in Japan, PlayStation continues to be dwarfed by Nintendo and its family of consoles. The Nintendo Switch 2 has already sold an estimated 1,980,483, while the Nintendo Switch has sold an estimated 35,969,655 since 2017.</p>

            <p>Where do you go after making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">Dorfromantik</a>, the 14th <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle game</a> on PC? Unto infinity, chick. Unto infinity, and all the uranium-packed celestial masses it contains. Berlin-based Toukana Interactive are back with Star Birds - another “soft strategy” sim and laidback resource management game, in which you take charge of an avian asteroid-mining operation. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>The just-released early access build endeared itself to me instantly by having my bird captain quack like an Apple Macintosh, then sealed the deal with a procession of delightfully rotatable space boulders, some of which look like spangly Easter eggs and some of which look like handfuls of Emmental. Don’t call this a review, mind – I’ve barely played an hour, and the game won’t leave early access until at least this time next year – but I get the feeling Toukana are onto a good thing here. Another nice flourish: optional supply quests are presented as little dovecot windows from which a feathery Wesley Crusher peeks forth, waiting for you to accept their errand.

<p>An overview: Star Birds is broken into missions narrated by a cast of wisecracking astral warblers. The abundance of text dialogue is slightly stifling, for a puzzle game, but I suspect it’ll taper off beyond the initial tutorial sections. Each mission sees you parking your mothership next to a new asteroid field, and zooming on individual asteroids to build things and set up a production network. It starts with you socketing a launchpad into a crater, placing excavators on resource fields, and linking them to your launchpad with pipes to shuttle resources back to the mothership. 
</p><p>As the levels and story progress, you unlock and research new facilities, including chem labs that combine two kinds of resource into one. You’ll rarely find every resource you need for the quest at hand on any one asteroid. So you must build landing sites for rockets, and start moving resources between asteroids. All of this proceeds at a leisurely pace: no hazards, no mission timer.
</p>
<p>The UI consists of phat, pastel, pressable buttons that are begging for a touchscreen port. Pretty much every action is performed with the mouse. It feels like they’re treading a delicate line between efficiency and whimsy in terms of the controls, I must admit. I can imagine being annoyed by the act of dragging out snarls of pipework between structures, in a game with more threat or urgency, particularly because pipes can’t overlap. You'll probably have to go back and unravel them, whenever you need to alter the layout of your roids.
</p>
<p>In the context, though, I find the slight tangliness attractive. This is a factory sim that also wants to be a toy, and has so far stuck the landing. If you’re short of credits for construction, you can also pop down a buggy and drag out a path for it between piecemeal gold outcrops.
</p>
<p>I suspect <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> players might find Star Birds too fussy, next to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dorfromantik-review-pc">bucolic immediacy</a> of popping down six-sided tiles, but people who loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slipways">Slipways</a> and have at least a tolerance for ornithology puns should enjoy this. As may people who liked the vibe of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cobalt-core">Cobalt Core</a>, at the risk of setting a roguelike amongst the pigeons. You can find Star Birds on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719750/Star_Birds/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> actually have better cheat protection? Is another big Nintendo leaker getting overly zealous before the coming Thwomp stomp? Why does Ubisoft want to shove PVP multiplayer back into <em>Far Cry</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I was up until 3:00 a.m. ET last night grinding the Depths in <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>‘s new Deep of Night mode</a>. Who knew the answer to my<em> Destiny 2</em> burnout was an even more punishing loot chase that resets every 45 minutes?</p> <h2>Why are there so many leaks at Nintendo?</h2> <p>That’s what former Nintendo of America marketing staffers Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vjxo31uVog">on their latest video</a> breaking down recent rumors about the upcoming Nintendo Direct. “They really do run a pretty tight ship on the first-party side still like we were saying,” Yang says. “Like, you’ve literally got the fear of God and being fired from your job. That fear was really real at Nintendo and you know we joke around about the Nintendo ninjas, like this is actual employees at the company. That is their job to investigate leaks. They’re a team at Nintendo that gets paid to do this and they are very elite. They’re very good at their jobs and and they will solve these cases.”</p> <p>The pair said a recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-leaks-mario-re7-smash-bros-2000624779">series of leaks from a user called SwitchForce</a> reminds them of Pyoro, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772">an infamous leaker</a> who appeared to be using a source with access to the backend of Nintendo’s websites to get information early. Pyoro later leaked his own source to <em>Bloomberg</em>, failed to break any more news after Nintendo changed how its new game pages go live online, and all but disappeared from the video game leaker-verse.</p>

 <p>“We all know what happened to Pyoro,” Ellis says. “So, I think just a word of advice to SwitchForce is be careful because, you know, yes, this can be an exciting thing of like, oh my gosh, everybody’s on pins and needles for my next update. You’re on pins and needles until you get that phone call or somebody shows up at your door and you disappear.”</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> will make progress in the war on cheating</h2> <p>That’s what Activision is promising <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05-reloaded#prompts">in its latest blog post</a>. It outlines how Ricochet anti-cheat features like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 will help prevent more players from ruining matches with aim-botting and other exploits. “RICOCHET Anti-Cheat uses Remote Attestation, a process that verifies critical PC security settings directly with Microsoft, as part of its implementation of TPM 2.0,.” the company writes.</p>

 <p>It continues, “Other games may lean on Client or Local Attestation, where the system checks itself and reports back. The limitation with that method is clear: cheats can sometimes disguise or manipulate what’s being reported, effectively tricking the local system into giving a false ‘all clear.’ By contrast, Remote Attestation places the verification step with an external, trusted authority, making it exponentially harder for tampered machines to pass as legitimate.”</p> <p>Cheating will still be a thing online, but Activision says it’s getting better. “What matters, and where we’ve seen real improvement, is how quickly we adapt,” it writes. “In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, detections are faster, mitigations are stronger, and enforcement is cutting deeper into the networks that try to harm fair play. With <em>Black Ops 7</em>, hardware protections like Secure Boot and TPM 2.0 will add another layer of defense.”</p>

 <h2>Ex-Pokémon Company lawyer thinks developers will just ignore Nintendo’s latest patent</h2> <p>The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-lawsuit-patent-summon-digimon-2000624724">recently acquired another patent</a> for what sounds <a href="https://x.com/inkydojikko/status/1965804322081722834">like the auto-battling feature</a>&nbsp;from its most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvNJKIG51g8&amp;t=5">recent<em> Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em> games</a>. It comes amid the ongoing legal fight with PocketPair over <em>Palworld</em>, but could seemingly have repercussions for lots of other creature collecting games. Or maybe not. “I wish Nintendo and Pokémon good luck when the first other developer just entirely ignores this patent and, if those companies sue that developer, the developer shows decades of prior art,” former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company Don McGowan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. “This isn’t <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-now-allowed-auxiliary-mini-games-during-loading-screens">Bandai Namco with the loading screen patent</a>.”</p> <h2>A 2023 shooter finally gets a kill-cam, but not on Xbox Series S</h2> <p>Free-to-play multiplayer FPS <em>The Finals</em> has received a familiar feature nearly two years after launch, but only for the most powerful consoles (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-finals-finally-gets-a-killcam-but-not-on-xbox-series-s-ps4-and-certain-pc-builds">via <em>IGN</em></a>). “We had to calculate everything that matters: player movement, environmental destruction, object interactions in a level of data fidelity that’s hard to pull off in a Dynamism Shooter,” Embark Studios writes in <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/800">a new season 8 blog post</a>. “Then take all that info and quickly reconstruct the moment.” Microsoft usually requires feature parity between current-gen console versions, but has been bending the rules more and more. <em>The Finals</em>‘ kill-cam won’t be on PS4 either.</p>

 <h2>A tiny new update just sneaked out for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1091500/view/503961862016073928">Patch 2.31</a> has fixed AutoDrive so that cars will now drive more smoothly when taking players to their destinations. No more getting stuck behind other cars or jerking to a stop at lights. Johnny also no longer always spawns in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service. Plus, the Photo Mode is gender neutral when it comes to poses now. My favorite bug fix? The Yaiba Semimaru no longer flips over during the Motorbreath chase, which was breaking the quest.</p> <h2><em>Far Cry</em> will push multiplayer more in the future</h2> <p>That’s according to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot who recently spoke at Saudi Arabia’s New Global Sport Conference. “On<em> Far Cry</em>, it’s really to bring the multiplayer aspects more predominantly pushed so that it can also be played for a long time by players,” he said, according to <em>Game File</em>. Alongside the unannounced <em>Far Cry 7</em>, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">also reportedly been</a> working on a <em>Far Cry</em> extraction shooter spin-off. Unlike <em>Far Cry 5</em>, which had an entire map editor for multiplayer, <em>Far Cry 6</em> backed away from online PVP gameplay.</p> <p>But wait, what was Guillemot doing in Saudi Arabia to begin with? He was there to publicly reveal a Saudi-based DLC for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, among other things. Is it funded by Saudi Arabia’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">controversial Public Investment Fund</a>? Ubisoft won’t say one way or the other. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia"><em>Game File</em> notes</a> that the person on stage interviewing Guillemot said, “Well, congratulations on the deal. It sounds very exciting.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/school-shooting-gun-violence-video-games-rfk-jr-2000624665">RFK partly blames video games for school shootings just days before new ones hit the headlines</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/its-the-perfect-time-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows-2000624758">Here’s why it’s a good time to go finish <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-reviews-team-cherry-2000624674">Steam reviewers can’t believe how stingy <em>Silksong</em> is</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sword of the Faithful. <a href="https://t.co/dL9erhNJdC">pic.twitter.com/dL9erhNJdC</a></p> <p>— The Lord of the Rings (@TheRingsofPower) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRingsofPower/status/1965822642016997550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

We needed to take into account the schedules and certification needs of multiple platform holders and multiple physical distribution companies, as well as Retroware’s release schedule, which is jam-packed this fall. We considered the option of staggering the launch and releasing on some platforms before others, but in the end we decided a simultaneous release was worth preserving at all costs.”</p><p>Kankanahalli continued, “In the end, this small delay is a good thing for <em>Neon Inferno</em>. We get even more time to polish the experience and make it as amazing as possible for you, and we may get to throw in some new features and new content originally planned for post-release. <em>Neon Inferno</em> will be an even better game this way, and you will be able to feel it.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Retroware:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Taking inspiration from classic titles like <em>Contra</em> and <em>Wild Guns</em>, <em>Neon Inferno</em> splits the <a title="Genres > Action [3,026 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> into the foreground and background with a variety of enemies and bosses in levels set in a dystopian New York City of 2055.</p><!-- AD: content -->

That's because Borderlands 4 features the most seamless open-world environments in the series' history. At launch, there are four major regions: Fadefields, Terminus Range, Carcadia Burn, and Dominion. Each one is filled with countless collectibles and optional objectives.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_campaign_mission_list">Borderlands 4 campaign mission list</h2><p>Below, you can see a list of the main missions in Borderlands 4's campaign:</p><p>Intro and Fadefields arc:</p><ul><li>Guns Blazing</li><li>Recruitment Drive</li><li>Down and Outbound</li><li>A Lot to Process</li><li>One Fell Swoop</li><li>Rush the Gate</li></ul><p>Terminus Range arc:</p><ul><li>Shadow of the Mountain</li><li>Crystal Brawl</li><li>Dark Subject</li><li>His Vile Sanctum</li></ul><p>Carcadia Burn arc:</p><ul><li>Wrath of the Ripper Queen</li><li>Siege and Destroy</li><li>Unpaid Tab</li><li>Her Flaming Vision</li></ul><p>Finale and Dominion arc:</p><ul><li>Rising Action</li><li>Another Day, Another Universe</li><li>The Falling Wall</li><li>Means of Ascent</li><li>Plan Z</li><li>The Timekeeper's Order</li><li>Secrets of the Vault</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Initially, the Terminus Range and Carcadia Burn regions won't be accessible to you. However, you'll be able to venture into these areas upon completing "A Lot to Process."

Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>Points-of-interest - You can take control of various facilities, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-safehouse-locations-guide/2900-7016/" data-ref-id="2900-7016"><strong>Safehouses</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-order-silo-locations-guide/2900-7011/" data-ref-id="2900-7011"><strong>Order Silos</strong></a> that turn into fast travel points.</li><li>Hidden Vaults - If you manage to find fragments, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-unlock-vaults-kairos-regions/2900-7012/" data-ref-id="2900-7012"><strong>unlock Vaults in regions</strong></a>.</li><li>Collectibles - There are countless collectibles to gather, including Vault Symbols, Echo Logs, Lost Capsules, Electi Safes, and many more. If you're up for it, you could look for 200 Marcus Bobbleheads that are so well-hidden that they don't have tracking icons on the world map.</li><li>World Events - From time to time, you might stumble upon a World Event that's happening in a particular zone. It's easier to tackle these if you have buddies with you, but they still occur even if you're offline.</li><li>Side quests - Numerous NPCs have side quests that you can complete.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565756" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1152" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565756"></a><figcaption>Safehouses, Order Silos, Bunkers, Crawlers, and various points-of-interest dot the lands of Kairos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Extending_your_playtime__Multiplayer_shenanigans__new_characters__the_looter_shooter_grind__and_Ultimate_Vault_Hunter_mode">Extending your playtime: Multiplayer shenanigans, new characters, the looter-shooter grind, and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode</h3><p>As with other games in the series, the campaign in Borderlands 4 is just a prelude to the biggest facet that would keep you preoccupied: The endgame. Once you've finished the story, you get to try all sorts of new functions, such as weekly Big Encore and Wildcard Missions. These allow you to replay activities at a higher difficulty and with additional modifiers.</p><p>Given that this is a looter-shooter game, you can expect a non-stop grind as you amass top-tier weapons and gear pieces. You might even find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-best-firmware-mods-set-bonuses-guide/2900-7017/" data-ref-id="2900-7017"><strong>Firmware mods</strong></a> that offer amazing set bonuses.</p><p>And, of course, it's more fun to play with friends, especially once you unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. The higher the difficulty, the greater the challenge. Naturally, that means you'll earn better rewards, too. Oh, and compared to previous titles in the series, you can finally make new characters/classes at level 30, all while skipping the entirety of the campaign.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how long it takes to beat Borderlands 4. We hope you're ready for what lies ahead, because things are about to go bonkers as you blitz and blast your way through the world of Kairos.</p><p>From exploring vast frontiers to watching legendary loot rain down on you, there's a lot to keep you engaged as you continue your adventures as a Vault Hunter.

                <p>Valve's popular The International tournament for Dota 2 kicked off today in Germany, and company co-founder Gabe Newell addressed the crowd with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URUli8Pv1Vc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening remarks</a> in which he said he has grown to love the game and still plays it every day despite facing some online harassment.</p><p>"Before that first International [in 2011], I really enjoyed the game, but after The International, I loved the game. It's not just the game I love, but the community. Sure, people talk shit at me in chat and about once a week, people say, 'Hey, noob, uninstall the game and [bleeped out],' but that's really about their enthusiasm for the game and the energy that they bring. And that's why after all these years, I still play Dota every day," Newell said.</p><p>The first The International took place 14 years ago in Cologne, Germany, the same city where Gamescom is held annually.

            <p>
CD Projekt Red is still updating its sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, now releasing Patch 2.31 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The patch updates AutoDrive so vehicles drive smoothly, overtake blocking vehicles, and won't stop at traffic lights. There's also an adjustment to Photo Mode so that poses work with any gender and NPC collision has been disabled.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere there are a number of fixes and tweaks, including some specific to PC and Mac. You can see the full patch notes below.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Vehicles</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated AutoDrive. When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Johnny always spawned in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applying CrystalCoat to the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru caused its wheels to flash in different colors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Photo Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work with any gender.</li>
<li>Disabled NPC collision, which will make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision (e.g. on car hoods).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the poses didn't work for Royce.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong>
<ul>
<li>Freedom - Fixed the journal entry that appears when the player chooses not to steal the Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred."</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Fixed an issue where, after V fails to pursue and stop Semimaru and receives a text from River saying he'll contact V soon, the follow-up message never arrives.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Fixed an issue where the Yaiba Semimaru could flip over during the chase, preventing the player from entering it.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - It's no longer possible to trigger the quest if River died during The Hunt.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Players can now acquire the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru through AUTOFIXER even if they failed The Hunt, which normally unlocks the side quest where the vehicle is obtained.</li>
<li>Nitro (Youth Energy) - Fixed a game crash that could occur in certain circumstances after leaving the Yaiba showroom event.</li>
<li>Nitro (Youth Energy) - Fixed an issue where the proxy interface UI in the Yaiba showroom is cut off when the "Larger HUD Elements" setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several localization and lipsync issues in various languages.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to disable vignette. It can be found in Settings → Graphics → Basic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on PC and Mac where Ray-Traced Reflections might not display correctly when enabled under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with displaying text messages from Delamain.</li>
<li>Various fixes for fluff vendors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>PC-specific</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Path Tracing didn't activate properly in certain scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mac-specific</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing graphics presets on Mac set Screen Space Reflections to a higher setting compared to the equivalent presets on PC.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing a permanent white screen when Frame Generation is enabled while entering the braindance in The Information.</li>
<li>Selecting "Defaults" in Video Settings no longer turns HDR Mode off.</li>
<li>Fixed the inverted behavior of the "Mute Game in Background" toggle in Settings.</li>
<li>Removed the outdated "(Requires Game Restart)" disclaimer from the mouseover description of the "Disable Spatial Audio" setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the App Store version that caused the game to become stuck on the “Press Space to continue” breaching screen.</li>
<li>Various stability and performance optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Really it's remarkable CDPR is still so committed to updating the game years after release - it's better now than it's ever been.

        <p>And its director is now busy elsewhere.</p>

    </div>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Three years after Netflix announced it was turning Irrational Games' acclaimed underwater shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> into a live-action film, its producer has suggested its still some way off, confirming that work continues on its script.
</p>
<p>
The streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-turning-bioshock-into-a-live-action-film">first publicly discussed a BioShock movie back in February 2022</a>, when it was accompanied by grandiose talk of developing a whole cinematic universe around the BioShock games. After a lengthy silence, producer Roy Lee last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">confirmed plans had changed</a> and that budget cuts at Netflix meant it would now be a "much smaller" film told from a "more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project."
</p>
<p>
Another year on, and Lee is chattering again, this time offering an update on the project's progress in conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/bioshock-movie-story-game">The Direct</a>. As to why it's taking so long, he explained in part that's down to the BioShock movie having been delayed a "little bit" so the team could do "some more script work". Amid all this, director Francis Lawrence has been busy with the movie adaptation of Stephen King's The Long Walk, and he'll remain occupied helming the upcoming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. "So it's just waiting for him whenever the Hunger Games is completed," Lee added.

<p>
Additionally, Lee confirmed the BioShock movie's script is still "being worked on right now". But the hope seems to be it'll be ready by the time Sunrise on the Reaping is done. As to what the movie will focus on, Lee remains cagey, saying, "Netflix wants us to keep everything under wraps". He did, however, reveal it'll definitely be based on Irrational's first BioShock game.
</p><p>
Netflix isn't the first company to attempt a BioShock movie. Back in 2008, Universal announced its own adaptation with Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski onboard - but it never came to fruition. Explaining the project's demise in 2013, BioShock creator Ken Levine <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why">revealed publisher 2K had given him the option to cancel it</a> after Verbinski's departure - and so he did.
</p>
<p>A fourth BioSchock game, originally announced in 2019, is currently in the works at developer Cloud Chamber, but 2K recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-studio-reportedly-facing-layoffs-as-former-diablo-boss-takes-over-amid-development-turmoil">confirmed</a> it was "reducing the size of the development team" as it looks to "rework certain aspects" of the purportedly troubled project.

<p>The Switch 2 once again tops the hardware charts this week, but it's the PS5 that's really surprising us. The base model jumps up to number 2 this week, selling 22,247 units. Altogether, the three PS5 SKUs managed a total of 31,695 units sold, while the original Switch consoles totalled 24,175, so it's a comfortable victory for Sony this week. Sort of... The Switch 2 is still killing it.</p>

			<p>Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/chapter-2-free-update-and-lost-harvest-dlc-out-now/">launched</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-free-story-update-the-lost-harvest-dlc-free-trial/">major paid and free DLCs</a> for Dune: Awakening, with Chapter 2 of the game's core narrative as the free DLC available for everyone, and a standalone storyline called The Lost Harvest being the paid DLC. Both are live in the game at the time of this writing, making this week an exciting time for players who've been on Arrakis since launch earlier this year. But if you've not begun your journey on Arrakis, you can try it out this weekend with Dune: Awakening's first free weekend that's live from today, September 11, to this Monday, September 15.</p>



<p>The free update that's currently live continues the main campaign of the game, continuing the story beyond the conclusion of Act 3 and revealing more of the dark mystery that brought you to Arrakis. Other elements of the free update include being able to re-customize your character, add new customizations with new hairstyles and tattoos, new contracts, armors, more dynamic encounters, improvements to combat and exploration, and the removal of the quicksand border that blocked players from entering the Deep Desert on foot or ground vehicles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The Lost Harvest DLC adds a few more tidbits for players who purchase the DLC separately or those who bought the Season Pass or the Deluxe Edition of Dune: Awakening. Players with access to The Lost Harvest DLC get access to new ground vehicles, new building pieces, armor sets, cosmetic customizations for your base and gear, weapon skins, and a new emote.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Funcom has also released the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/dune-awakening-chapter-2-patch-notes/">patch notes</a> for the Chapter 2 update, which include all the above changes, and a slew of bug fixes and balance tweaks.</p>



<p>Right now, Dune: Awakening remains a PC-exclusive title, but if you're a console player who can't wait to jump into your own journey on Arrakis, then, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-launch-console-cross-play-sony-microsoft/">what Funcom told Wccftech at Gamescom 2025</a>, you can look forward to the game's launch on consoles at its one-year anniversary.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft workers have raised concerns with company management about <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">a deal</a> with Saudi Arabia to create a free DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> set in the country, according to a new report.</p>
<p>Announced with little fanfare - at least, as far as add-ons for pretty prominent games are concerned - on a Saturday morning last month, the free DLC is set to add a new story chapter set in 9th century AlUla later this year. AlUla is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ula">ancient oasis city and governorate in Saudi Arabia</a>, though Ubisoft's <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1959169826619875735">announcement post</a> didn't mention the country by name.</p>

<p>As detailed in this report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Game File</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot announced the DLC alongside the online reveal during a speech in Riyadh at a conference put on in conjunction with the Esports World Cup, which the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/gaming-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-call-of-duty-ronaldo-b2786237.html">Saudi government are funding</a>.</p>
<p>According to an internal Ubisoft Q&amp;A, which Game File's Stephen Totilo has published as part of his report, workers at the publisher have demanded answers from management about this partnership with Saudi Arabia. The question from a staffer about the issue specifically cited the killing of journalist <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, asking whether Ubisoft execs believed an association with the authoritarian Saudi state could have a negative effect on the company's image.</p><p>While they've publicly told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-staff-reportedly-raised-concerns-about-saudi-arabia-deal-for-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-as-company-insists-it-maintains-creative-control">IGN</a> that they have creative control over what goes into this DLC, Ubisoft reportedly wouldn't tell staff anything about how it came to be, simply stating that they don't comment on "rumours". They did however, make a distinction between the Saudi government's Public Investment Fund and Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman, the latter being <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">the Public Investment Fund's chairman</a> and the person who allegedly ordered Khashoggi's assassination. "The [PIF]'s money is not MBS's, and talking with partners who do not share our democratic values does not mean abandoning them," Ubisoft management told workers.</p>
<p>The company also defended Guillemot having travelled to Saudi Arabia in late 2024 alongside French president Emmanuel Macron to meet with Saudi politicians. That was just a "classic diplomatic tool for expanding France's influence and reach around the world", according to Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The reported partnership with Ubisoft over Mirage DLC - released at no charge, as is often the case for sizeable add-ons boasting not just new missions, but a totally fresh location to explore - is far from the only gaming-related investment the Saudi government and their associates have made in recent years. Just last week, PIF-backed "giga project" Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">bought co-ownership of fighting game tournament Evo</a>.</p>
