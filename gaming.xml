The event, which runs several times a year, gives players a chance to try out demos from a slew of in-development titles. We’ve been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest batch</a></span> to highlight some of the best from the current festival, which runs from October 14 through 21.<br></p><p>Steam Next Fest often gives us our first taste of tomorrow’s indie gems or sleeper hits. Games seen during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698">previous</a></span> Steam Next Fests this year, since released to widespread acclaim, include the religious horror title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>Indika</em></a></span>, the <em>Resident-Evil</em>-inspired <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span>, and noir parody <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669"><em>Duck Detective</em></a></span>. Here are ten from this month’s event that could very well do the same.</p></div></div><div><p>If you only have time to play one demo during Steam Next Fest, you should make it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></a></span>. The sequel to 2022’s stunning TTRPG-influenced sci-fi adventure is slated to come out in early 2025 and the demo lets you play the game’s opening hours. I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109">previewed</a></span> the same demo a few months back and came away impressed by how <em>Starward Vector </em>retains the sense of risk and reward from the first game while introducing new mechanics like the ability to manage a crew and go out on dangerous missions, as well as a break system that completely changes how the game’s dice rolls work. Fans of the first game will not want to miss out on this demo, and it’s only available until the end of Steam Next Fest so try it out while you can.</p></div><div><p>Everybody has a take on the soulslike genre, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736690/Void_Sols/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736690/Void_Sols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Void Sols</em></a></span>’ has to be one of the most unique I’ve seen yet. It’s essentially a minimalist <em>Souls </em>game that distills the tough-as-nails combat and navigation of the genre into a top-down adventure in which the protagonist and every enemy are reduced to basic shapes. While the presentation may throw you off, the core gameplay hews closely to the core pillars of the genre, so you’ll still need to memorize enemy patterns, navigate twisty environments, and level up your stats while trying not to die. So far, <em>Void Sols</em> just proves how mechanically sound the soulslike genre is, regardless of visual presentation.</p></div><div><p>What’s more American than a road trip across the country in a beat-up car? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Keep Driving</em></a></span> is all about the unique charms and troubles that come with life on the open road. Pick a crappy vehicle and set out to see the country while picking up odd jobs along the way to pay for gas and other essentials. <em>Keep Driving</em> feels like one part enthralling management sim and one part <em>Kentucky Route Zero-</em>esque pastiche of the oft-forgotten parts of the country. </p></div><div><p>Earlier this month my colleague Moises Taveras previewed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windblown</em></a></span>, the new game from <em>Dead Cells </em>developer Motion Twin, and came away impressed. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109">praised</a></span> the game’s incredibly fast-paced movement and combat which lets you zip around the isometric roguelike’s world in the blink of an eye. You can now try out the game for yourself during Steam Next Fest, and if you like what you see, you can keep the good times rolling when <em>Windblown </em>enters early access on October 24.</p></div><div><p>Perhaps the best way to describe the unique puzzler that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3083300/Proverbs/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3083300/Proverbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Proverbs</em></a></span><em> </em>is by calling it one giant game of <em>Minesweeper</em>. Inspired by Bruegel the Elder’s 1559 painting “Netherlandish Proverbs,” <em>Proverbs </em>drops you into a single giant board made up of over 54,000 individual squares. While solving the puzzle, you’ll also learn more about the painting that inspired the game (and some actual proverbs, too). This is the perfect demo to chip away at while watching TV or listening to a podcast in the background.</p></div><div><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mushroom Musume</em></a></span> you raise your mushroom daughter to be the best woman/funghi she can be, and things only get weirder from there. Part visual novel, part TTRPG, part farming sim, part roguelike, and all old-school fairytale, <em>Mushroom Musume</em> is a one-of-a-kind narrative driven game about parenthood and plants. Like fairytales of old, this game will entice you with beauty and horror in equal measure, and you’ll constantly want to know how your story will unfold. The demo for <em>Mushroom Musume </em>offers a generous taste of the game, so don’t be surprised if you fall down a rabbit hole.</p></div><div><p>Think of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940440/Are_You_Kidding_Me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940440/Are_You_Kidding_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Are You Kidding Me</em></a></span> as a cozier version of <em>WarioWare</em>. Gameplay is mostly made up of microgames that ask you to complete a number of wild tasks in a matter of seconds, but there are also a handful of characters to chat with and get to know in the game’s setting of Nowhere Space. If the combination of high-anxiety <em>WarioWare-</em>style games with laid-back character interactions sounds like a bad match, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how well it works in the game’s demo. It’s also just nice that you can get some of that <em>WarioWare </em>fun outside of a Nintendo platform.</p></div><div><p>It feels like no Steam Next Fest roundup can be truly complete without at least one retro-inspired horror game in the mix. So here’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Heartworm</em></a></span>. It’s a—say it with me now—retro-inspired horror game that bills itself as a love letter to the likes of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em>. What makes <em>Heartworm</em> stand out is its striking environmental design that always feels somewhere between a dream and reality, as well as the unique use of a camera as a weapon. This last bit clearly has ties to the game’s larger story and themes that the demo only touches on, but it’s a great teaser for a game that horror fans should keep their eyes on.</p></div><div><p>I can explain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Building Relationships</em></a></span> in simple terms but it won’t really do justice to this game’s brand of weirdness. You play as a house on an island full of other homes and structures and your goal is to fall in love. You’ll do this by rolling and jumping through the 3D world and then striking up conversations with potential matches. Also, there is fishing. I told you it was weird. Yet <em>Building Relationships</em> is also delightful, mostly thanks to some great writing that leans into the absurdity of the premise while never detracting too much from some interesting meditations on the struggle of finding love. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1846209551151849788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1846209551151849788%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> by MauroNL3 on X, it's reported that the Final Fantasy franchise has sold over 195 million units worldwide. Since September 30, 2023, the sales of the franchise have gone up by 10 million units. While this wasn't posted in any announcement made by Square Enix, it can be found in an 'about Square Enix, Inc.' message that is typically posted in press releases and on websites relating to the company or its games. In addition to the number of Final Fantasy sales increasing, it seems that the number for Dragon Quest has equally changed. Dragon Quest has now sold over 91 million units worldwide, which brings their total up by 3 million units as of September 30, 2023. Although these numbers may not be quite what Square Enix wants, it isn't exactly a bad number, either.</p>
<p>Square Enix has come out with a lot of great releases lately, including the Pixel Remasters, which includes Final Fantasy 1-6 in one purchase, as well as finally porting Final Fantasy XVI over to PC, which will have helped boost sales significantly. Despite that, Square Enix has reported their disappointment in their financial reports, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/">the games still aren't selling</a> as much as they'd like. According to their latest financial report, both Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth heavily underperformed compared to previous Final Fantasy games, which has led them to make a huge change by working to release future games on multiple platforms rather than having them as PlayStation exclusive. Rumors have been swirling for a long time that they are working on porting recent Final Fantasy games to Xbox. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshi-p-says-xbox-players-should-not-give-up-hope-of-final-fantasy-xvi/">Yoshi-P has commented on this</a>, telling Xbox users not to lose hope.</p>
<p>While Square Enix's main focus is Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest has also been a mainstay franchise. Its first release was in 1986, and the latest release was Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, which was released in December 2023. However, compared to other games in the franchise, this one didn't perform as well as it could have, receiving relatively mixed reviews. Although it didn't perform well, it still managed to sell a million copies by January 2024.</p>
<p>Games such as Dragon Quest Builders and Dragon Quest Builders 2 continue to perform incredibly well, but it's uncertain whether there are any Dragon Quest games in development at the moment, with Square Enix seemingly being focused on a new aggressive business plan which includes putting Final Fantasy onto other platforms other than just PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-first-post-launch-roadmap/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Saber Interactive and Focus Home Interactive have shared the first post-launch roadmap for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. First and foremost, the first major (and free) update is coming very soon and will add a new Lethal difficulty for the PvE cooperative Operations mode. Moreover, a new PvE Operation titled&nbsp;Termination is being introduced. Here, players will face off against the Hierophant Bio-Titan, the largest threat the Tyranid swarm has up its sleeve. The arsenal is growing larger, too, with the addition of the Neo-Volkite pistol.</p>
<p>Later this year, Season Pass owners are getting new cosmetics based on the Dark Angels Chapter. This includes exclusive new weapon skins for the Auto bolt, rifle, Plasma Pistol, and Power Sword, in addition to a full-body armor skin for the Bulwark class, a new shield, and even more cosmetics.</p>
<p>Future seasons will feature new PvE cooperative Operations, a host of additions to PvP with a new game mode and new arenas, new Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies, new weapons, a Horde mode, and other Space Marine chapter cosmetics for Gold and Ultra Edition owners via the Season Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Post-Launch Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aTR-9RYPu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in just twenty-four hours since its launch. European sales data also <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> it was the second best-selling new game in the continent this year after Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a 7 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>In all, while Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/">highly anticipated update</a> of New World has been released and is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. This is the first time that both console and PC players will be able to explore the haunting island of Aeternum, where there is a world full of danger and excitement but also plenty of opportunities for players to engage, whether it's as a solo player or grouping up with others. If you want to play the game with others, you'll have the opportunity to play with others using cross-platform online play, meaning you can team up with your friends who may be on a different platform to you.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Those who are playing New World via PC can get New World: Aeternum at no additional cost as long as you have already bought New World and the Rise of the Angry Earth, which was a PC-specific expansion. For those who are on console, you will have to purchase New World: Aeternum, as Rise of the Angry Earth was never available for those on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, as this is the first time that the game is officially on console. However, with Aeternum now being released on console, players will finally get to experience the full base game as well as the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion.</p>
<p>"Millions of players have explored Aeternum on PC, and we're thrilled to welcome even more to New World: Aeternum with the console release," said Christoph Hartmann, Vice President of Amazon Games. "We have listened to player feedback and taken the time to create an unforgettable adventure that can be enjoyed either as a solo journey or together with friends across consoles and PC. New World: Aeternum is the definitive New World experience."</p>
<p>Aeternum is a major update to the title, as players will be able to explore new raid content where you'll have to explore the Hive of the Gorgons as a 10-person raid group where you have to face off against Broodmother Medusa herself, as she tries to raise an army of Hercyne.</p>
<p>For those who are looking for content that isn't grouping up with each other but rather pitted against each other, there is new PvPvE content where players get to enter the Cursed Mists in Cutlass Keys, where it's every player for themselves as you try to obtain rare loot. However, if you die, other players have the opportunity to snatch your loot away from you and walk away victorious.</p>
<p>If you want to get stuck into this title, New World: Aeternum is available to download digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam for $59.99. If you want the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Corrupted Mauler Bear Mount and the Corrupted Soul Armor Skin, you can purchase it for $79.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-and-global-launch-timings-revealed.1010178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-pc-specs-global-launch-timings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have revealed what kind of PC specs you're going to need to run&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, as well as the global launch timings for the game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/specifications-spotlight?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on its official website</a>, EA says it's designed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>"with flexibility in mind", a philosophy that extends not only to the game's PC specs but also to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options">accessibility features</a>.</p>
<p>Two sets of specs are available, one with ray tracing enabled and the other with ray tracing disabled, in order to accommodate both high-end machines and lower-spec PCs. Hopefully, a wide range of PC gamers will be able to play <i>The Veilguard&nbsp;</i>on release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-bow.jpg?itok=iFzHgTwF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-bow.jpg?itok=eDmMdd1o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>has been designed to accommodate a fairly wide range of PCs.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a quick rundown of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>PC specs BioWare and EA announced today.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that all of these presets require at least 16GB of RAM, as well as 100GB of storage space (for which only the Minimum setting supports an HDD). You'll also need Windows 10 or 11 with 64-bit architecture and DirectX 12.</p>
<p>First up, here are the non-ray tracing presets.</p>
<h3>Minimum (1080p, 30fps, Low settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or GTX 1650, or AMD Radeon R9 290X</li>
<li>4GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1440p at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps, High settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700XT</li>
<li>8GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K at 60fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li>
<li>12GB VRAM</li>
</ul><p>Next, here are the specs you'll need if you want to play&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<h3>RT Selective (4K at 30fps or 1440p at 60fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>10GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>RT On (1440p at 30fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>10GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>RT On and Ultra RT (4K at 30fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li>
<li>12GB VRAM</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, the specs get pretty beastly the further down the preset list you go, so if you want to enjoy&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>with ray tracing, you'd better have a top-of-the-range machine (or be prepared to fork out for an upgrade).</p>
<p>EA and BioWare have also revealed the global release timings for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, so here's when you'll be able to enjoy the game depending on where you are.</p>

            <p>
In the grim darkness of the far future, you will not have to worry about getting preyed upon by rival Space Marine chapters whilst duffing up the Tyranids, for there are no plans to add a PvPvE mode to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2. 
</p>

<p>
The comments in question were delivered unto <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/space-marine-2-no-plans-for-pvpve-saber-thinks-its-a-holy-grail-of-game-design">MP1st</a>. "PvPvE is a holy grail of game design," Grigorenko told the site. "A lot of studios are trying to find it and a lot of them fail. The truth is that it's a very very difficult task. It sounds great on paper, but when you actually start trying, it becomes apparent that it's very annoying when you fight other players only to get backstabbed by an AI opponent.</p>
<p>"This is why most of the games are trying to ensure that PvP and PvE aspects don't intersect that much, i.e. AI opponents are restricted to specific places on maps, etc," he went on. "It's a complicated mode to implement that would change the experience significantly, so I'm afraid there are no plans for it."
</p>
<p>
I've been writing a fair bit about Space Marine 2 and related topics behind the scenes, but I haven't spent any time in the game's PvP, so can't really comment on the reasonableness of all this. Still, it sounds like Space Marine 2 PvP is a lot more claustrophobic than, say, an extraction shooter such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beautiful-lights-mix-of-stalker-and-hunt-showdown-is-masterfully-eerie-but-i-do-wish-it-wasnt-an-extraction-shooter">Beautiful Light</a>. Slop the PvP and PvE pots together, and I imagine the outcome would be the wrong kind of bloody mayhem. Mind you, this game <span tabindex="0">does have Chaos Space Marines in it</span>. A bit of <span tabindex="0">battle-brotherly betrayal</span> would be perfectly consistent with the plot.

Those majestic trees, those quaint little stores, the rich history, and, of course, a beautiful hotel right on the shores of the lake itself.</p><p>It all makes for a special place for the whole family. Sure, it’s easy to get overwhelmed walking the streets of Silent Hill, but don’t worry; whether you’re new in town, or enjoying a return trip for the first time in years, we’ve got tips for how to enjoy your stay to the fullest.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-recommend-id="image://f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-recommend-id="image://f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Silent HIll 2</em> has changed a great deal in the last couple of decades, veterans do still have a minor advantage when wandering through town. The general layout is the same, though many of the stores and shops are now open for business, instead of just having health drinks inexplicably sitting on their doorsteps. If you remember where specific items were, try heading out that way anyway—either there’ll be something new at that location or, in a nice, understated bit of feedback, the game will actually shift to a different camera angle highlighting that location, with an audio sting and an unnerving breathing noise, just as a little nod to the old-schoolers out there.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-recommend-id="image://210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-recommend-id="image://210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s important to come to Silent Hill well-prepared and well-hydrated as you stroll through its streets and roads. You, as an eagle-eyed traveler—one whose head might actually turn and face important items in the environment, I should add—might see a local supermarket or fast food joint, but, oh no, they’re not open! Instead of friendly fast food workers serving meals with a smile, you get leggy mannequin monsters serving pain, and <em>hopefully</em> that’s just a vertical smile where the face should be. Thankfully, the good citizens of Silent Hill are more than happy to assist fellow travelers by leaving a goodly supply of nutritional drinks and ammunition in their cars. You may need to bust out the windows to get to your supplies, but, hey, the price is right.</p><p>That doesn’t just apply to cars, though. Don’t get too precious about storefront windows and doors, either. If it’s just a pane of glass between you and some of Silent Hill’s delicious nibbles, feel free to assume the owner won’t mind if you come on in.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-recommend-id="image://91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a chair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a chair." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-recommend-id="image://91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a chair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The locals of Silent Hill take the problem of light and noise pollution very seriously when it’s dark out. Though city folk might call them a bit nosy when they come poking around in your business, the residents are just trying to keep things pleasant in this special little town. Though as an out-of-towner, sometimes a little noise is unavoidable—for your own safety and well-being, you should consider keeping your lights off and your radios off as much as possible to avoid one of your fleshy neighbors checking up on what’s causing all the commotion.</p><p>And as an added incentive for your cooperation, if you should pick up a radio and immediately turn it off before even encountering a local, there’s a trophy/achievement in it for you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-recommend-id="image://3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-recommend-id="image://3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A job worth doing is worth doing right, and that goes for anything, from grocery shopping, to building a house, to beating down an abominable fleshbeast until you start seeing white meat. But how do you really know for sure you did that last bit right, especially in a place where things have a terrible habit of coming back to life? Well, there’s a few things.</p><p>For starters, when it comes to most enemies, you’re going to have a devil of a time getting them down to begin with. Although while every enemy has their particular quirks, virtually all of them are at death’s door if you’ve gotten them off their feet. But your job’s not done yet, heavens no. You should stroll right over and make sure that enemy’s a goner by hitting them while they’re down with a melee weapon (Right Trigger by default). You’ll actually know you’re safe when you stop hitting them with melee weapons, and start stomping instead. If you’re dealing with groups, that single stomp should be your signifier that you can move on to the next problem. It’s as simple as that!*</p><p>*—except for the ones who spit acid because when those guys are down, they vomit more acid and can kill you in seconds—please don’t try to stomp them, they suck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-recommend-id="image://30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-recommend-id="image://30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Silent Hill has everything you need for some big beautiful fireworks displays launched from the various pistols, shotguns, and rifles scattered throughout the world, but a special thing just doesn’t remain special if it happens all the time. That’s why ammunition for those guns is so scarce around town.</p><p>Though it can be tricky, when faced with one of Silent Hill’s enthusiastic locals, the vast majority of conflicts can be handled with a face-to-face, hands-on conversation instead of a gun, so when a real problem presents itself with, say, the size of someone’s pyramid mask, or a pizza-loving townie decides that murder should be legal, you’ll be well-equipped to deal with it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-recommend-id="image://de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a lady." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a lady." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-recommend-id="image://de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a lady." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A stranger is just a friend you haven’t met, and Silent Hill is a great place to meet some new friends and have a great night on the town! Still, not everyone might have the same tolerance as you, and we’re not talking about tequila shots.</p><p>If you have a companion with you, it’s very possible for them to get a little too involved in your fights, and take a stray hit or two if you’re not careful. If you’re up close and personal, maybe steer the fight away from them, and be careful if they’re off to your right or left before you take a swing. If it’s a situation where a gun is involved, never fire if there’s a chance they might wind up in your way. They won’t appreciate it, we’re sure, and “one too many cocktails at Heaven’s Night” is <em>not</em> an excuse for poor gun safety.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-recommend-id="image://2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring sadly into the middle distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring sadly into the middle distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-recommend-id="image://2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring sadly into the middle distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Visitors come to Silent Hill for all kinds of reasons, and while most tourists have a perfectly pleasant experience, it’s very easy to ruin your good time and the good times of others. While veterans are well aware of the consequences of coming to town with the wrong mindset, newcomers should be aware that actions have consequences.</p><p>Doing things like, say, focusing too much on an attractive lady you just met instead of your spouse, or looking at a knife a little too intently one too many times, or not keeping a close enough eye on your physical or mental health, can all have an effect on how you leave—or don’t leave—our lovely little town. Of course, you’re always welcome back. Maybe you’ll have a different experience…<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This, Bloomberg alleged, is “putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily.”</p><p>According to the site, Bandai Namco Studios Inc. (the video game development division of Bandai Namco) has moved about 200 of its roughly 1,300 employees to expulsion rooms and nearly 100 have resigned, with more expected to leave in the coming months.</p><p>Japan has strict labor-protection laws that make it harder to cut staff than in other countries, such as the U.S. Expulsion rooms are therefore sometimes used by companies to drive staff to become so disheartened that they resign voluntarily, and thus are ineligible for severance they would normally receive had they been made redundant.</p><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Bandai Namco denied pressuring staff to leave voluntarily, but did confirm the cancelation of games in development, and revealed some employees are now waiting to work on their next project.</p><p>"Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation,” Bandai Namco said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge. There is no organization like an ‘oidashi beya’ at Bandai Namco Studios designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily."</p><p>Bloomberg reports that Bandai Namco has suffered financially in much the same way other video game companies have post-pandemic, with big losses coming from write-downs tied to game cancelations. It alleged that Bandai Namco has recently stopped development on games that feature characters from Naruto and One Piece, “as well as a project commissioned by Nintendo Co.” This mystery canceled Nintendo game was not named.</p><p>Bandai Namco Studios has for a number of years developed games for Nintendo, including exclusives <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokken-tournament">Pokkén Tournament</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokémon Snap</a>. In November 2023, Bandai Namco announced the team it had set up to do contract development for Nintendo as Bandai Namco Studio 2 &amp; Studio S, promising more to come.</p><p>On the studio’s new website, a statement read: “Bandai Namco Studio 2 &amp; Studio S has been a studio specializing in contracted development projects. We have cooperated in the development of many world-class titles, such as Super Smash Bros, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Mario Kart Tour.</p><p>“As a group of professionals who do not compromise on quality, we will continue to produce world-class titles in the future. We are looking forward to the participation of highly motivated creators.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>In a year flush with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">video-game-company layoffs</a> and restructuring, Bandai Namco has reportedly canceled several titles including games featuring One Piece and Naruto licenses. In addition to those games, there was reportedly an unnamed contract project with Nintendo that has been shuttered as well.</p><p>In a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-15/bandai-namco-begins-to-cut-headcount-after-culling-game-titles?srnd=undefined&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, coinciding with the projects being terminated, it's stated that the company is taking a traditional "Japanese approach to reduce staff and sending workers to rooms where they are given nothing to do, putting pressure on them to leave voluntarily” so they don't receive any form of severance. The method is commonly referred to as oidashibeya, meaning "expulsion room." The result has led to almost 100 resignations, but the company insists there is no such tactic in place.</p><p>"Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation," a Bandai Namco representative said. "Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge."</p><p>Over the summer, the company further shuttered its long-running Tales of the Rays mobile game and said it would take down its MMO game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-bandai-namco-cancel-western-release-for-mmo-as-service-ends-in-japan/1100-6526156/" data-ref-id="1100-6526156">Blue Protoco starting in January</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lonely-mountains-snow-riders-demo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lonely-mountains-goes-from-good-to-great-once-you-bike-1839438048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lonely Mountains: Downhill</em></a> is one of my favorite games, a mountain biking sort of racer/ sort of Zen exploration of a virtual wilderness. Developer Megagon is making a sequel, where you trade your bike for skis. There’s a demo out now, and I love it.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em></a> has the same basic premise as <em>Downhill</em>: you start at the top of a mountain and need to get to the bottom. Instead of being a Spandex-clad little person on a little bike, now you’re a snowsuit-clad little person on little skis. The crux of a run is still about navigating a changing landscape, flying off jumps, taking tight turns, and exploring off the main path to try to find the optimal–or at least the most exciting–route down. Like the first game, there are challenges that unlock new trails, like finishing in a certain time or having under a certain number of crashes.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders - Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPV7r1RY5bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Both games are fairly simple to control, though <em>Snow Riders</em> adds some new features in the form of tricks you can pull off in the air, like grabs and spins. The full game will have a multiplayer mode, which I imagine skilled players will make look very fast and fancy but which I will use to crash into everyone and ruin their runs. I was impressed by how much <em>Snow Riders</em> keeps the vibe I love from <em>Downhill</em>, one of both stress and peaceful exploration, while the snow adds an excellent new element in the form of deep powder and the lovely way your little person sinks into a drift when you crash.</p><p>I crash a lot. Despite the hours and hours I’ve put into <em>Downhill</em>, I’m not the best player, never being able to stick to my plan in a high-stakes moment, or never quite being able to react fast enough to shave those precious seconds off my time or avoid calamity. I’m less into perfecting my runs in both games than I am chasing the thrill of exploring a new area for the first time. Both games situate their camera so a path is often full of surprises, zooming in or pulling out at just the right moment to give you a careful glimpse of what’s coming next while still keeping you on your toes. Even when I'm laser-focused on my goal, or when I've done a run dozens of times, I always feel like there’s some new path or detail to discover or smash into.</p><p>I love both games’ diorama-esque design, how they’re able to paint such evocative wildernesses with their blocky art style. The sound of the snow, like the whizz of your bike in <em>Downhill</em>, gives a calming vibe to what is often a high-speed game of brutal crashes and chaos.</p><p>The demo is part of yet another round of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demos</a> that runs this week. <em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em> has a release date of 2024, which I hope is true. I will also humbly suggest that Megagon could combine both games by adding <a href="https://bikepacking.com/bikes/fat-bikes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fat bikes</a>, which is 100% a crossover I would play.</p><p><strong>Correction, 11:42am:</strong> The initial version of this article mis-stated that multiplayer was not available in the demo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, BioWare has <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1846212097400885490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared </a>the detailed PC specifications for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. As a reminder, the game runs on the Frostbite engine just like its predecessor. Here's what you'll need to play the game if you don't want to enable ray tracing.</p>

<p>As you would expect, enabling ray tracing will require a much beefier PC configuration. The really worrying part is that for the most taxing preset, RT ON plus Ultra RT, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will require a massively powerful PC (Intel Core i9 12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X, plus NVIDIA RTX 4080 or AMD RX 7900 XTX), while targeting only 30 frames per second at 4K resolution. Furthermore, the image confirms these performance targets include optional upscaling, so there's no solace to be found in that regard.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only hope for NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 owners is that BioWare only considered NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution rather than Super Resolution plus Frame Generation, which Dragon Age: The Veilguard is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to support, in these performance estimates. We'll try to ask for clarification on the matter.</p>
<p>Anyway, BioWare also talked about the console specs. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X versions of the game will offer users the choice between fidelity and performance modes, which, as usual, will target 30 or 60 FPS, respectively. The PS5 Pro version of Dragon Age: The Veilguard has many improvements beyond that, as outlined by Maciej Kurowski, BioWare Studio Technical Director:</p>
<p><em>The game's Fidelity and Performance modes will both see improvements on the hardware, including improved resolution in 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. Additionally, there will be various improved visual settings across 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance mode.</em></p>
<p><em>We have upgraded image quality thanks to Sony's new AI-based upscaler, PSSR. We’ve enabled Raytraced Ambient Occlusion (RTAO) in the 60FPS Performance mode, which previously was only available on the base PlayStation 5 with 30FPS Fidelity mode.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out on October 31. The game won't offer any preload on PC, while Xbox Series S|X users have been able to preload since yesterday, and PlayStation 5 users will get to do it from October 29 at 9 AM Pacific Time. The reason for the lack of preload on PC is that there is no Denuvo DRM in the game.</p>

Anbernic hasn’t confirmed if a 2.4GHz USB dongle is included for gaming devices that don’t natively support it, but the controller can be used with a USB-C cable if you want to skip wireless connectivity altogether.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Anbernic RG P01 doesn’t appear to include switches on the back limiting the travel of its triggers for playing FPS titles.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: YouTube</cite></p></div><p>The use of Hall effect sticks and triggers should help prolong the life of the controller, but there doesn’t appear to be switches on the back of the RG P01 limiting the travel of its triggers to improve reaction times for FPS games. The controller does include an extra pair of buttons behind its grips that can trigger preprogrammed macros when pressed individually or in sequence.</p><p>Anbernic has even included a six-axis gyroscope&nbsp;for playing Nintendo Switch games that support motion-based controls, plus RGB accent lighting around each joystick — a feature the company has recently <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-406v">started to include on some of its handhelds</a>, like the RG 406V.</p><p>We don’t yet know what the RG P01’s battery life will be, when the wireless controller will be released, or how much it will cost. The controller’s features are comparable to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo Ultimate 2C</a>. which debuted last June for $29.99, although the RG P01 includes support for more devices. If Anbernic is targeting a similar price, that advantage alone could make its first controller worth considering over 8BitDo’s budget-minded offerings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The allure of the sea-green GameBoy screen is difficult to resist. Picking up from where Pokémon left off two decades ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/letalis">Letalis</a> is a bleepy-bloopy retro RPG about wandering from town to town and doing battle with dodgy local leaders to prove your worth. But you won't be doing the fighting yourself, God no. Leave that to the squad of Roman gladiators hiding in your back pocket. </p>

<p>It's not exactly like the Pokémon battles of yore, to be fair. Fights involve up to three battlers at a time, feeling a bit more like classic Final Fantasy. And their moves are determined mostly by whatever weapons they're holding. A shield will let them block and lower the damage of an incoming attack, for example. Some weapons slash multiple opponents in a single swing. Others cause enemies to steadily bleed health, or become dazed and miss a turn. </p>
<p>All fairly classic stuff then. Standing in for the elemental types of Fire, Earth, Water, et cetera are some different warrior classes with distinct fighting styles - Bandits, Centurions, Tritons, and... a Ronin!? How the Japanese warrior ended up in a world of ancient Roman arenas, I don't know. But it's no more outlandish than a yellow rat that shoots electricity from its cheeks. There are libraries in each town that will steadily explain how each fighter stacks up against the others, but to be honest I normally need a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pokemon_Type_Chart.svg">big child-friendly chart</a> to help me out with this stuff. Luckily, the fighting screen will show the word "advantage" when you inspect an opponent to show that your current fighter will draw extra blood.  </p><p>There are other subtleties fitting of turn-based biffing. Using the same attack twice in a row will result in half the usual damage. And you can level up your brawlers by killing foes of greater rank (the flashing "evolve" animation for this slaps me in the memories). You learn all these details by wandering around the first village, chatting to the folks bobbing up and down as they stand in the street. Ah, it's just like 1999, when understanding a game meant milking every drip of dialogue you could from the wise people of your hometown. </p>
<p>There is one more blood-soaked difference. Your fighters can die outright. No precious "fainting" or life-saving escapes to the Poké hospital here (though there is a lady who will cure you on the road for some cash). The permanent deaths of your team makes things a little more hardcore (and probably a bit grindy if things go badly wrong). But your fighters also regenerate health if you put them on the bench for a fight. </p>
<p>All in all, a neat injection of nostalgia. I will say it feels weird as hell to play GameBoy style games on a giant PC screen. If you have a SteamDeck though, you're sorted. This is another little treat we've found in our recent trawls through the great Steam Next Fest lagoon. Not sure when the full game is coming out, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396200/Letalis/">play the demo now</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, an unlikely addition has joined these infamous ranks: Typhlosion. You know, the fire weasel-ish starter from <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em>.

However, those aren’t the most infamous things to come out of the entire saga. Allegedly, the files also include lore documents that have had fans reeling. If these are real, none of these stories have been released to the public officially, so they shouldn’t be considered “canon.” But, like much real-world mythology and folklore, these stories have elements that are a little fucked up if taken literally, rather than as the stuff of legend. So keep that context in mind when I tell you that there’s allegedly a story about a Typhlosion impregnating a human woman.</p><p>These mythological stories have been translated and are spreading around the internet, and cover concepts like “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Original sin</a></span>” in the <em>Pokémon </em>universe, and the relationships between humans and Pokémon. They include stories about a person who had relations with an Octillery, another who a Vigoroth seemingly impregnated after killing baby Slakoths, and a story about a Typhlosion who disguises itself as a human man, kidnaps a girl, erases her memories of her past, and has a child with her. The Typhlosion story has been the uh, breakout, of these stories, and has sent fans of the Pokémon spiraling. Now, there are hundreds of memes and art about the situation.</p><p>The problem is, it’s unclear at this time if these stories were actually on a Game Freak hard drive somewhere, or if someone’s just taking advantage of all the chaos to spread misinformation. Whether or not they’re legitimate, they have undoubtedly embedded themselves in how people will talk about Typhlosion and other Pokémon included in these tales. But assuming they are real, there seems to be a disconnect between the intention behind stories like this and how the community is reacting to them. Some <em>Pokémon </em>fans are reading them as very literal and are making claims about Game Freak’s all-ages franchise having a hidden malevolence under the surface.</p><p>If you open up a book on Greek or Norse mythology, you’ll find plenty of stories like this withinthose pantheons, such as when Loki got impregnated by a horse. Despite that undeniable similarity to real-world myths, it hasn’t stopped some folks from pearl-clutching about these types of stories as if they’re somehow problematic or intended to be pornographic in nature. The pushback against that mindset has been strong and swift.</p><p>Ultimately, whether they’re real or not is immaterial to some people at this point, as the joke has become so prevalent that <em>Pokémon </em>fans will never be able to forget it. Typhlosion somehow got the worst of it, and if you’re a long-time fan of the Gen II starter, I’m sorry for the nonsense you will get for the rest of your life. I had the Hisuian variant in my <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>party so now I know I can never post a screenshot of that team again. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
