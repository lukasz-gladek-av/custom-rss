            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fighting as a guerrilla group in the Riverlands, the Brotherhood Without Banners seeks to protect and serve the poor, downtrodden small folk of Westeros - and now, they’re making their grand appearance in <i>A Song Of Ice And Fire” Tabletop Miniatures Game</i>. We’ve previously covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-spring-2024-new-releases" rel="nofollow">some great new releases from last Spring</a>, and even further back we’ve looked at the addition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-late-2023-new-release-review" rel="nofollow">House Bolton with Late 2023 releases</a>. Now let’s dive in and see what the tenacious Brotherhood brings with our review of&nbsp;<em>A&nbsp;</em><i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i>!</p>



<p>The <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i> includes everything one player needs to jump into the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Box Contents:</p>

<ul><li>Core Rulebook</li>
	<li>Combat Unit, Attachment, Tactics, Special Rules, Siege, Mission, Objective, Reference, and Non-Combat Unit Cards</li>
	<li>Measuring Stick, Tactics Board, and Cardboard Tokens</li>
	<li>10 Brotherhood d6 Dice + 1 White d3 Die</li>
	<li>4 Movement trays</li>
	<li>54 Miniatures (4 units, 6 heroes)</li>
	<li>Flat Cardboard Terrain Pieces and Castle walls</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<h2><b>What Characters Are Included in The <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i></b><b>?</b></h2>

<p>Characters included in the <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i> include six different characters for the army. Those are: Beric Dondarrion (with a card for him as an attachment or as commander), Thoros of Myr (with a card for him as an attachment or as commander), Lem Lemoncloak (attachment), Tom Sevenstrings (attachment), Ghost of High Heart (non-combat unit), and Ravella Smallwood (non-combat unit).</p>

<h3><b>Ravella and Ghost</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-ghost-and-rowena.jpg?itok=cSTpwoVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-ghost-and-rowena.jpg?itok=GCO5vmIg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let’s start with a quick chat on the NCU’s included in this starter set. With Ravella, while I <i>love</i> to see a miniature based on this crucial but under-the-radar character, her ability to restore 2 wounds to a unit 3 times per game won’t move the needle all the much.</p>

<p>Ghost of High Heart, however, is more interesting, with her ability to influence a unit to give them +1 to morale tests and punish enemy units who destroy ranks of the unit she’s influencing (giving them Vulnerable and Weakened). You could absolutely run her to punish enemies who focus on your rather squishy Peasant Levy units.</p>

<h3><b>Tom and Lem</b></h3>

<p>Lem, one of my all-time favorite characters from the books, has the seriously powerful Battle Scars ability which allows you to give his unit, while attacking, either: Vicious, re-roll any attack dice, or roll at its highest attack die value. As you loose ranks, you gain +1 option.</p>

<h3><b>Thoros and Beric - Non-Commander Units</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-thoros-and-beric.jpg?itok=eIwLu6CP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-thoros-and-beric.jpg?itok=31eZepgf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thoros and Beric are available to either run as the commander of your army or as a character attachment, let’s take a look at the non-commander options first.</p>

<p>Thoros’s character, as you might expect, embraces his unrelenting, hard-to-kill spirit with the ability to heal 1 wound each time his unit activates (+1 wound to that if you control crown) and has the relentless ability which lets his unit perform an attack action after that unit is attacked. That’s huge!</p>

<p>Beric’s character card, Azor Ahai, gains faith tokens throughout the game which you can spend add attacking dice or get some last licks in before your unit goes down.</p>

<h3><b>Thoros and Beric - Commander Units</b></h3>

<p>For Thoros as commander, you can also gain and spend Faith tokens to make your attacks more powerful and punish panicked foes at long-range by restoring wounds to friendly foes they’re fighting.</p>

<p>For Beric as commander, he can heal as before, gains a free charge or maneuver when friendly units at Long Range are attacked, and ignores dangerous, hindering, and rough terrain keywords.</p>

<h2><b>What Units Are Included in The </b><b><i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i></b><b>?</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-peasant-levy.jpg?itok=P6is7LTz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-peasant-levy.jpg?itok=T2cPRIrx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Along with the above-mentioned characters, the <i>Song Of Ice And Fire TMG Brotherhood Without Banners Starter Set</i> also features two units of Peasant Levy, one unit of Brotherhood Archers, and one unit of Men-At-Arms. Let’s take a moment to chat about what each of these units does (or doesn’t) do well.</p>

<p>First up, the humble Peasant Levy, which cost just 4 point per unit to field. They have a fairly unimpressive 5+ attack roll, 6+ defense roll, and 6+ Morale. Not great, for sure, but their two abilities force enemies attacking them to suffer -1 to Hit, and they gain a +1 to Hit and +1 Attack Die when they attack while next to another friendly unit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-men-at-arms.jpg?itok=IfbsLe88 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/song-of-ice-and-fire-tmg-brotherhood-without-banners-starter-set-men-at-arms.jpg?itok=jCiOiWZg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the Men-At-Arms, they’re better provisioned with a 4+ hit, 4+ defense, and 6+ morale. They also hit with Critical Blows, and deal out Panicked and Weakened status effects to enemies they charge from the flank or rear.</p>

<p>And finally, there are the Brotherhood Archers, who might be some of the best ranged fighters in the game! Their Hidden Shot attack is long-range, hits on a 3+, ignores units and terrain when determining line of sight, and gains Precision and Vicious when targeting enemy flanks or rear. Add to this their ability to perform a free 3” maneuver action if no enemies are within short range, and this highly mobile unit is meant to get in and cause chaos.</p>

<p>So putting this all together, what are we really looking at with this Starter Set? I think this is a decent start to the army, but it doesn’t feel quite as cohesive as other recent new armies like the Bolton or Martell armies. But I suppose that’s the point of this army - they’re made up of deserters, small folk, anyone without a voice.</p>

<p>In that sense, I do think there’s a lot of fun flexible list-building to be done here, especially since they have a special ability that allows them to take a unit from Stark or Baratheon without it counting toward its Neutral points total. In other words, you can sneak in a unit from either of those armies, and still fill out your army with more neutral units.</p>

<p>While it doesn’t have a huge personality out of the box, there are two other unit boxes coming out that really do a lot of work rounding out this army. We’ll cover that shortly, but with the focus here on this Starter Set, the flavor is bigger than any larger army synergy.</p>

            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) are set to launch an industry-wide union of video game workers in the U.S. and Canada at this year's GDC. The United Videogame Workers-CWA (UVW-CWA) will bring together "video game artists, writers, designers, QA testers, programmers, freelancers and beyond to build worker power irrespective of studio and current job status".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The union’s mission is to not only build community and solidarity amongst video game workers, but also to build large-scale education campaigns about labor organizing in the video game industry," say the CWA. "Their first issue campaign will be around layoffs – given the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-third-of-developers-think-generative-ai-is-a-negative-for-the-games-industry-says-new-survey">1 in 10 video game developers were laid off in 2024</a>, many video game workers have been mobilized to organize. And now they can! Workers will be sharing around a petition to address the industry-wide layoffs and hope to gain widespread support while at GDC".</p>
<p>If you're attending GDC, you'll be able to pick up a zine they've put together, which includes "UVW-CWA’s mission statement, FAQs, an op-ed on direct-join unionism from CODE-CWA Senior Campaign Lead Emma Kinema, and member quotes". Otherwise, the zine will be available from the <a href="https://code-cwa.org/">CODE-CWA's website.</a></p>
<p>From the zine:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are going to draft a video game worker bill of rights, setting standards that have been glaringly absent from our craft for too long. It will address inequality in hiring, the pervasive reliance on crunch, healthcare for contractors, and protections against all manner of injustice. Armed with this bill, new organizers can activate with clarity of goal and action, cultivated by the shared knowledge of not only fellow game developers, but workers in the entire labor movement."</p></blockquote>

Steranka said, “So if there are any fears that this is going to other places that you may or may not know or may or may not trust, I hope that what I’m sharing today can help quell any of those fears.” Well, no.</p><figure id="" data-id="5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-recommend-id="image://5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-recommend-id="image://5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, all of Steranka’s assurances fail to recognize that the game is already an absolute cluster of monetization that’s only gotten worse and worse over the years.

<p>F1 25 is set to be revealed next week, that’s according to known data miner billbil-kun. In addition to the game’s full reveal date, we also know the expected release date for F1 25.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ea-sports-f1-25-on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-et-plein-dautres-infos-sur-le-prochain-jeu-de-formule-1-60060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, F1 25 will be revealed on March 26, 2025. At that time it’ll be announced that the game will release on May 30, 2025.</p>



<p>F1 25 will launch with two editions for players: Standard and a new Iconic Edition. The standard edition will cost $59,99 and release on May 30. The Iconic Edition, however, will retail for $79.99 and give three days early access starting May 27. Those with EA Play and/or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will get a 10-hour trailer of the game upon release.</p>



<p>What still isn’t known as of publishing is what else will come with the Iconic Edition of the game. It’s also currently unclear if F1 25 will be available on the last-gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Scopely confirmed that it's buying the gaming division of Niantic</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> and other hit mobile games. It was a $3.5 billion deal, and one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">largest gaming buyouts in history</a>. But for any fans who are worried about Scopely imposing certain unwanted changes on Pokemon Go, the game's senior director, Michael Steranka, wants to assure them that won't be the case.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/541768/scopely-niantic-interview-michael-steranka" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Steranka indicated that he's spent months talking with Scopely's team, and he related that they don't want to rock the boat of Pokemon Go's success. For example, he indicated that Steranka won't shift the game from a free-to-play model, or force intrusive ads into the experience.</p><p>"[Intrusive ads are] not happening in Pokemon Go--not now, not ever," said Steranka. "Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they've told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what's made this such a huge hit and a success. So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions that’s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokemon Go."</p><p>Regarding player data, Steranka reiterated that the company doesn't sell that to third parties, and offered assurances that it won't be changing that policy now or in the future. He also confirmed that Niantic's in-person events, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-fest-heads-to-paris-this-summer/1100-6529961/" data-ref-id="1100-6529961">Pokemon Go Fest</a>, will continue to be held. Steranka went on to explain that Scopely is very interested in examining why Pokemon Go remains popular, and wants to integrate some of the lessons from that into its own games.</p><p>For the immediate future, Steranka noted that he's currently planning the celebration of Pokemon Go's 10th anniversary, which will arrive in 2026.</p><p>"We've been planning on this for a long time, so I really want to make sure that next year is as big of a celebratory moment as possible for Pokemon Go," said Steranka. "And as you probably know, it's also the 30-year anniversary for Pokemon as a brand. So I think next year as a Pokemon fan, you are going to have just the best year of all time."</p><p>Fans won't have to wait that long for Pokemon's next game on Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> will arrive later this year, and Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-three-starters-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/1100-6529758/" data-ref-id="1100-6529758">unveiled a few of its starter Pokemon</a>.</p>

            <p>Shipments for Analogue's upcoming console - known as the Analogue 3D - have been delayed.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D looks like a pretty smart piece of kit, and one which allows users to play original N64 cartridges in 4K. Oh, hello nostalgia, my old friend!</p>
<p>Anyway, this console was originally available for interested patrons to preorder at the end of 2024, with a scheduled shipment window of Q1 2025. However, shipping has now been delayed, and moved to the balmy summer month of July. So, if analaysts are right, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">month after the Nintendo Switch 2 may grace our shelves</a>.  </p>

<p>But, I digress. Back to the Analogue 3D. </p>
<p>"We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience," a <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq">notice on Analogue's website reads</a>. The console's maker said if you currently have an open preorder, then no action is required.</p>
<p>"As always, if you’d like to cancel your pre-order at any time, Analogue has always had a no questions asked, 100 percent refund policy for pre-orders," the website continues.</p>

<p>"Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation: it's not only the world's first reimagining of an N64 - but the world's first 100 percent-compatible recreation of an N64," the company shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analogues-new-console-is-a-4k-n64-machine-that-uses-original-cartridges">the Analogue 3D's initial reveal last year</a>.</p>
<p>"No more incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more. For the first time, you can re-experience the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise."</p>
<p>I wonder if my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a> cartridge still works...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-should-you-play-as-naoe-or-yasuke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%93-should-you-play-as-naoe-or-yasuke.1138740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-should-you-play-as-naoe-or-yasuke/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is far from being the only entry in the series to offer multiple playable characters, but the differences between the characters have never been as big as they are in Shadows. Naoe and Yasuke are very different characters who excel at very different things, and their unique abilities determine how you should approach the many challenges the game offers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311183830_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In many ways, <strong>Naoe embodies the traditional Assassin's Creed series playstyle</strong>. Extremely agile, the shinobi from Iga is the fastest playable character, can climb on buildings and mountains with ease thanks to the grappling hook only she can use, and has every tool you may need to infiltrate enemy strongholds and remain in the shadows undetected, such as kunai for long range kills, and smoke bombs to conceal her presence. If it comes to a fight, Naoe can hold her own reasonably well but requires perfect play due to her low health, which makes her almost always a few steps away from death, especially at Expert difficulty.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250309180930_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the other hand, the second Assassin's Creed Shadows protagonist, <strong>Yasuke</strong>, is extremely <strong>good in combat</strong>. Not only does he have tons of health that allow you to make some mistakes and still survive, but he also has a lot of great combat options with amazing weapon variety - three melee and two ranged options - and plenty of Adrenaline right from the get-go that makes it easier for him to use skills. By advancing on the dedicated skill tree of each weapon type, Yasuke can become a killing machine that can even fight multiple enemies at once with extreme ease, especially with a naginata equipped. All this combat power, however, comes at a cost. Yasuke is not only much slower than Naoe but is also far less agile, meaning that using parkour is almost always not an option for him. He is meant to face enemies head-on, fully embodying the direct combat playstyle that was much the focus in Asssassin's Creed Valhalla, although he can still be stealthy by taking enemies from afar with the bow.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250310180655_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>With the two Assassin's Creed Shadows main characters featuring very different playstyles, which of the two is the better character to play the vast majority of the time? <strong>The answer to this question depends on how you want to approach the game</strong>. Playing as Naoe will allow you to play the game as if it were any of the classic Assassin's Creed games which placed great emphasis on stealth gameplay and killing enemies undetected. The vast majority of main quest missions have been designed to allow you to take full advantage of Naoe's superior parkour, making a stealth approach extremely satisfying most of the time. At the same time, given Naoe's low health, you will be forced to play slowly to avoid making mistakes, getting discovered, and then forced into an all-out battle which Naoe may have trouble surviving. Yasuke, on the other hand, can literally barge into enemy strongholds from the front entrance, take on every enemy that confronts him, and easily survive the vast majority of fights. This approach is also the fastest to clear enemy camps and strongholds, which also means you will be able to get your hands on powerful Legendary equipment more quickly using him.</p>
<p>No matter who you choose,<strong> every quest in Assassin's Creed Shadows can be completed without too much trouble at the normal difficulty settings</strong>, so don't agonize too much over which character is the best to use. Get acquainted with both of them and pick the one you have the most fun with, with the knowledge that, at times, you will be forced to use the other in specific quests.</p>

            <p>Let's be honest, when it comes to The Sims, sometimes it is quite a lot of fun to kill off various members of your community, be it by letting them get devoured by a cowplant or the always classic pool ladder removal technique (although, you now also need walls to box those Sims in).</p>
<p>So, if you are like me - and don't pretend that you aren't - you will probably be wondering what methods there will be to kill off your characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, the upcoming Sim-like from Krafton. And, the good news for us players who like to flex those Godly muscles, Inzoi has "16 different types of deaths" for players to discover.</p>

<p>"One of the biggest features of this game is death," game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim said during an Inzoi livestream (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/in-good-news-for-sim-murdering-sickos-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths/">PC Gamer</a>), acknowledging that "life comes with death".</p>
<p>So, what of those deaths? "In Inzoi you could go to the bathroom and if you slip you might die. Or if you eat some old food you might have to go to the bathroom and, again, die," the director shared.</p>
<p>"And when you fix broken-down electronics you might get electrocuted, so you need to be careful. I made the chance really low, but actually electronics can very often break down. We have 16 different types of deaths."</p>
<p>Now, some of those deaths sound very similar to deaths in EA's The Sims series, but Inzoi will have one rather unique death -  "dying from the need for recognition".</p>
<p>Said Kjun: "In the modern world you find a lot of people feel fulfilled from being recognised by others and this death reflects that. For example, in Inzoi let's say I fought with someone and that rumor spread and came back to me. I could get a text message about it, or a friend of mine could tell me about the rumor and if the rumor is negative then my need for acknowledgement can go down.</p>
<p>"And if that drops too drastically then you might die from that."</p>
<p>Inzoi's characters can also get hit by cars, so be sure to practice some road safety when out and about. "I reiterate, we have a simulation and death and this type of thing is a part of the game," Kjun concluded.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has launched the Xbox Adaptive Joystick, a companion controller that looks very similar to the Wii's Nunchuk accessory. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Nintendo's retro console will spot the same shape as the Wii Nunchuk, with two trigger buttons on the back of the device and an analogue stick on top. Four face buttons are also included.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-expands-accessibility-range-with-new-xbox-adaptive-joystick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick was announced last year</a> as a further aid to accessibility, and plugs directly into any Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S console, Windows 11 PC, or the Xbox Adaptive Controller device.

For now, the controller is being <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-joystick">sold via the Microsoft Store</a> for £25, or $30. 
</p>
<p>
"With more than 429 million players with disabilities worldwide, we know each player has unique needs and preferences for how they choose to play," Microsoft's chief accessibility officer Jenny Lay-Flurrie <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/03/18/microsoft-ability-summit-2025-accessibility-in-the-ai-era/">said in a Microsoft blog post</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox Adaptive Joystick is a singular, wired controller primarily designed to meet the needs of players with limited mobility. Its versatility helps players seamlessly incorporate it into their existing gaming setups. Built with the Gaming and Disability community who inform the development of Xbox products from the beginning. The joystick joins our family of adaptive accessories including the mouse, pen, adaptive kit and Xbox Adaptive Controller."
</p>
<p>
Buttons can be remapped via the standard Xbox Accessories app. A range of 3D-printable thumbstick topper designs are also available via the Xbox Design lab, to allow users to customise their controller further to their needs.

            <p>
Forthcoming life sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the plucky (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzois-system-specs-make-me-want-to-see-this-handsome-sims-killer-running-on-a-pocket-calculator">genAI-ridden</a>) David to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s Goliath - will cost $40 at its early access launch, the developers have announced. What's more, "all updates and DLCs will be provided for free" until the game hits 1.0, according to translated commentary from game director Hyungjun Kim. 
</p>
<p>
This is being styled as a gift unto the gamers, and another way of tempting them from the clutches of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, whose DLC packs commonly sell for full-game prices. The other way of looking at it is that of course early access "updates and DLC" should be free. The point of early access is that you're paying for an unfinished game with the expectation that it'll eventually be worth the money. Also, what's the difference between an update and a DLC? My my, Inzoi, what a can of worms you have opened.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The news arrives care of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/QkXfP9rwrm8">a global showcase</a> last night, which also breaks down the new life sim's early access development - it's launching on 28th March. We can expect four major updates this year, together with new outfits and furniture every three months. Here's an approximate rundown. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Update 1, May</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mod kit (Maya, Blender)
</p>
<p>
Changes to weight, muscle adjustment
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Update 2, August</strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Swimming &amp; pools
</p>
<p>
More resources for edit city
</p>
<p>

<p>
<strong>Update 4, December</strong>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Create a Zoi improvements
</p>
<p>
Mod updates
</p>
<p>
New outfits
</p>
<p>
Indoor temperature
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In terms of competing with The Sims, the key addition is probably that mod kit in May. InZoi will need a healthy community of tinkerers if it's to usurp the EA colossus (or perhaps just prosper alongside it - why do I insist on pitting them against each other? Why am I like this?)</p>
<p>I'm also quite interested in the ability to play a ghost - there are 16 ways a character can die in Inzoi, and if you have bad karma when you pop your clogs you'll linger on as a spectre, thwarting the birth of new Zois by, as far as I can tell, contributing to the neighbourhood population cap.
</p>
<p>
Returning to the point about the unfairness of charging for early access DLC - obviously, game development isn't that cut and dried. Perhaps a developer runs into unexpected costs that require them to slap a price tag on an early access update. Perhaps they decide they want to add a player-requested feature they haven't scoped for. Perhaps they really needed to charge more for the base early access game but didn't feel they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Still, I don't like the dilution of the early access concept here. In general, it feels increasingly like developers and publishers view early access as simply a variant of the live service game, with more purchaseables being added over time.

<p>Krafton is publishing Inzoi and feels strongly about the game’s attempt at the life-sim genre. This isn’t a case of art imitating life as Inzoi almost looks like life itself, and its system requirements on PC might make your eyes water.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> looks to follow in the steps of other life-sim hits such as The Sims, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. It allows you to escape the rigors of everyday life to create the ultimate, perfect society in virtual form. Inzoi looks to incorporate all aspects of life and roll them into one streamlined experience.</p>



<p>Developer Inzoi Studio’s creation was birthed several years ago, and it’s nearly time to be born.</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-minimum-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say “Inzoi”. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Inzoi minimum requirements let us play Inzoi—and that’s good enough for many. It sucks to miss out on a game for technical reasons, so at the very least we want to hit the minimum requirements.</p>



<p>Check out the complete list of minimum PC specs below, which is provided on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/518581441632667234?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel i5 10400</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT (6G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 2060 (6G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 40 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-medium-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi Medium Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>In between the minimum and recommended requirements are Medium settings. This is for those with better hardware than the bare minimum, but still falling short of optimal performance.</p>



<p>Here’s every Medium requirement for Inzoi. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Medium Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D / Intel i7 11700</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6600 (8G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3060 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 50 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-recommended-requirements-on-pc-0">Inzoi Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>We’re moving up to the upper tiers of requirements now. The recommended PC specs are quite powerful compared to most, but if you can meet most (if not all) of these requirements, Inzoi will look very fine.</p>



<p>Check each of these values carefully.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D / Intel i7 12700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT (16G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 60 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-high-requirements-on-pc">Inzoi High Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The High requirements—otherwise known as the best specs—are reserved for mighty rigs and heavyweight computers comprised of thousands of dollars worth of parts. A lot of top-end gear is required to meet the High requirements.</p>



<p>However, this is how to enjoy peak Inzoi performance and bring the game to life.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Inzoi High PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">Inzoi High Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 / 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D / Intel i7 14700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24G VRAM) / NVIDIA RTX 4080 (16G VRAM)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">32 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">Need 75 GB of Available Space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

Marvel video games, however, do not exist in the same universe, telling stories entirely separate and unrelated to each other. Insomniac’s Marvel’s Spider-Man games, for example, have nothing to do with Eidos-Montreal’s Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Similarly, upcoming Marvel games such as Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Marvel's Wolverine, and Marvel’s Blade, have no connective tissue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there was once an idea at Disney to create a Marvel Gaming Universe that would do for Marvel video games what the MCU went on to do for Marvel movies and TV shows. So what happened?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/_W6fCpdYs4Y?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fourth Curtain podcast</a>, host Alexander Seropian and guest Alex Irvine recalled this MGU idea, which both worked on, and revealed why it fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seropian, perhaps best known as one of the founders of Halo and Destiny developer Bungie, went on to run Disney’s video game business before leaving in 2012. Irvine was the long-running writer of Marvel games, most recently working on the world-building, dialogue, and character backstories for smash hit Marvel Rivals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing his prior work on Marvel games, Irvine discussed the scrapped MGU.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I first started working on Marvel games, there was this idea that they were going to create a Marvel gaming universe that was going to exist in the same way that the MCU did,” Irvine said. “It never really happened.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seropian then explained that the MGU was his “initiative,” but it never got funded by the higher-ups at Disney.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was at Disney, that was my initiative, ‘Hey, let’s tie these games together.’ It was pre-MCU,” Seropian said. “But it didn’t get funded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Irvine, who had worked on the iconic Halo alternate reality game (ARG) I Love Bees while at Bungie, went into some detail on how this MGU would have worked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That was so frustrating because we came up with all these great ideas about how to do it,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I was coming out of ARGs at that point and thinking, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if we had some ARG aspects?’ There would be a place where players could go that all the games touched, and we could move them back and forth from game to game. We could link in comics, we could loop in anything, we could do original stuff. And then, as Alex said, it didn’t get funded. So we made a bunch of games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why did the MGU fail to get the internal buy-in to move forward? Irvine suggested the idea became so complex it ended up putting some people at Disney off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even back then, we were trying to figure out, ‘If there’s going to be this MGU, how is it different from the comics? How is it different from the movies? How are we going to decide if it stays consistent?’ And I think some of those questions got complex enough that there were people at Disney who didn’t really want to deal with them,” Irvine explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fun to imagine what might have been had the MGU idea got the funding it needed to become a reality. Perhaps if it had, Insomniac’s Spider-Man games would have existed in the same universe as Square Enix’s ill-fated Marvel's Avengers and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, with characters from each game making cameo appearances across the titles or the stories all building towards some epic Endgame-style event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, there are questions over Insomniac's Marvel's Wolverine game. Will it be set within the same universe as Marvel's Spider-Man? Could Spider-Man or any other character from those games end up making a cameo in Wolverine in some way?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, the MGU goes down as yet another scrapped video game idea. Although, perhaps in another universe somewhere, it is a reality…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>What's the pettiest reason you began to distance yourself from an old friend? I once casually suggested to a mate that I found toast more filling than bread, which prompted them to bang on for far too long about how I was actually wrong, since the act of toasting necessarily diminishes the structure of bread or somesuch. I'm not sure whether that's true and I don't care. I was speaking my truth about toast and you undermined it. Jog on, toast denier.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s new Ghoul Within update is 18.9 GB, which may well conclusively prove that searing ghoulification actually ends up with the victim weighing more than they did previously. I wish I'd known this at the time of my yeasty bust-up, because I'd have probably tried to make the same argument about toast. We might have stayed mates then. Maybe we could have played Fallout 76 together? Why, that's the subject of this very <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/">Steam blog</a>! Incredible.</p>

<p>Your journey to "Ghoulification" begins with a new questline named "Leap Of Faith" in the Savage Divide. Do that, and you'll be able to transform into a Ghoul, complete with 30 new perks and two new abilities. Glow increases your maximum health depending on how radiated you are, and Feral confers combat buffs and penalties depending on how many drugs you've eaten.</p>
<p>Being a Ghoul will negatively affect your interactions with factions like the Brotherhood Of Steel and lock you out of certain questlines. If you're starting to feel isolated, you can either don a disguise or reverse your ghoul-hood altogether. This is permanent, though. If you want to become a ghoul once again, you'll need to cough up 1000 atoms - about £8/$10.</p>
<p>Alongside a new Level 50 Character Boost and a new event starting April 29th - "The Big Bloom" - the patch notes also detail a host of balancing tweaks. I'm particularly fond of the helpful mundanity in "adjusted some Perk names for better alphabetical sorting". The game's also 75% off on Steam right now, in case you aren't saving for the rumoured imminent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-official-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-will-release-as-soon-as-next-month-claims-report">Oblivion remake</a>. It's… actually only slightly more expensive than that ghoul reversal charge. Love to be a fan of videogames in 2025. Probably just play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">Skyblivion</a>, innit. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The quest in question is called “Leap of Faith”, which takes players into a new section of the Savage Divide. Here, players will find new characters who will help them transform. Completing the questline will allow players to fully transform into a ghoul and use abilities like Glow and Feral. They will also have access to 30 new Ghoul-exclusive <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/24uIqswESsK1aunG5a2oyS/fallout-76-ghoul-within-release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">perks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players need to be at level 50 to undergo this transformation, and after becoming a Ghoul in Fallout 76, they need to watch out for some things. Factions like Brotherhood of Steel and others will be hostile towards Ghouls, so players will have to disguise themselves with new costumes that they receive from Jaye, a new NPC. This disguise will allow players to interact with blocked content they may find when playing a Ghoul.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, your transformation into a Ghoul in Fallout 76 is not final, and players can become Human again. To do so, you must return to the character selection screen. However, once you become a human, you cannot transform into a Ghoul again, as the questline for the Leap of Faith cannot be replayed. If you still wish to return to the Ghoul life, you can purchase a Ghoul Retransformation from the character screen for 1,000 Atoms.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, Palworld developer Pocketpair&nbsp;<span><a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> update 0.5, which adds</span>&nbsp;major features like cross-play between all platforms, a Photo Mode, and increased storage.</p>
<p><em>▼New Content</em><br>
<em>・Crossplay!</em><br>
<em>⤷ Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>・Global Palbox</em><br>
<em>⤷ Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</em></p>
<p><em>・Dimensional Pal Storage</em><br>
<em>⤷ A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.</em></p>

<p><em>・Drafting Table</em><br>
<em>⤷ Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!</em></p>
<p>There's also the addition of dedicated servers for the Mac version of Palworld, as well as plenty of balance adjustments and tweaks, bug fixes, and UI improvements. However, the team also said that dedicated servers for the PlayStation 5 version aren't currently available, though they are working on adding support in the future.</p>
<p>After last year's explosive launch of the game, its success has slowed down, although it still reached the incredible number of 32 million players earlier this year. However, Pocketpair's plans got a big wrench stuck in them when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a lawsuit for patent infringement. Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John Buckley talked at GDC 2025 (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-came-as-a-shock-to-pocketpair-because-patent-infringement-was-something-that-no-one-even-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Gamesradar</a>) about how shocking it was for the studio to find this out:</p>
<p><em>This obviously came as a shock to us. I think it came as a shock to a lot of people because it's alleged patent infringement, which is something that no one even considered, and it's something that we're still hashing out basically. It didn't feel good, obviously. We were pretty vocal before Palworld released that we did legal checks before the game released, and they were all cleared - in Japan. So obviously, when the lawsuit was announced, we were all like, 'What?'</em></p>
<p><em>And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts, and they said, 'what's going on,' and that's when we discovered it was patents that they were going for. Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan, so a pretty depressing day, a lot of people kind of head-down walking home in the rain. It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version. We were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show. Obviously, we had to kind of scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that. But yeah, the short answer is it did not feel good.</em></p>

<p>Palworld’s highly anticipated cross-play update is now live, adding additional features, adjustments and other changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After today’s update, Palworld players can play with friends across any platform, thanks to the new cross-play feature. The Global Palbox has also been added, allowing the storage of Pal data and the transfer of Pals between worlds. A new storage system called Dimensional Pal Storage provides players with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox. Guild members can access this box, which can also be used as personal storage.</p>



<p>Apart from cross-play and world transfer for Pals, Palworld has some cosmetic and photo mode changes for the game in the new update. The new cosmetic armour system is essentially a transmog system, allowing players to equip armour cosmetically at the Antique Dresser without affecting any stats. Moreover, the photo mode is now accessible through the Pal Command Wheel, and players can combine low-rarity blueprints to make high-rarity ones. Lastly, Mac has dedicated servers now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, Palworld has made specific adjustments, like connecting pieces of a roof or foundation, which will automatically align, and players can now sit on chairs and cushions. There are some balance adjustments, like summoned raid bosses cannot damage other bases and adjustments to the NPC rewards. Players interested in these adjustments, the new UI changes, and bug fixes can check out the full <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1902195801461514742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">patch notes here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pocketpair also confirmed that dedicated servers for the PS5 version of Palworld are currently unavailable. The devs are working towards adding support and releasing this feature in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-devs-were-shocked-by-nintendos-patent-infringement-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘came as a shock’</a> to the devs. Also, Pocketpair publishing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-publishing-warn-not-more-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has warned players</a> not to expect more Palworld.

            <p>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", as developer Larian moves away from the series.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> released towards the end of 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">became a smashing success for Dungeons and Dragons owner Hasbro as well as Larian</a>. The game won scores of praise (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">and awards</a>) across the world, and last year Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents were up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent in 2024 over 2023</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this heady success, Larian is moving on from Baldur's Gate, and has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>. So, where does that leave the future of Baldur's Gate? Well, there are plenty of others who are "very interested" in Baldur's Gate, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub has said.</p>

<p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," Ayoub told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">IGN</a> during this week's GDC event in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now, while the wording of "in pretty short order" certainly sounds promising, this doesn't mean we are about to suddenly get Baldur's Gate 4. In fact, Hasbro isn't "in a hurry" for that particular game.</p>
<p>"That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things," Ayoub explained, with the publication adding the exec said he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but it will take some time.</p>
<p>As for other Hasbro Dungeons and Dragons games, Ayoub said he is "never one to shy down from a challenge". After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">there are several other</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">D&amp;D-based games in the works</a>, and in November Hasbro announced following the success of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business">yet another Dungeons &amp; Dragons game was in production</a>.</p>
<p>"I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher," Ayoub closed.</p>

			<p>Earlier this week, 4A Games <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/3/16/metro-15th-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a new blog post</a> on its official website to celebrate the Metro franchise's 15th anniversary. Following up on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sdk-released-next-metro-influenced-by-russian-invasion-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier statement from a couple of years back</a>, the development team openly said that the next installment will be much darker because of the Ukraine-Russia War:</p>
<p><em>In 2022, a full-scale Russian invasion changed how we wanted to tell the story of the next Metro game. As art became life for many of our developers in Ukraine, we drew from that lived experience to create an even darker story, those themes already present in Metro becoming ever-more apparent and important. As conflict, the struggle for power, the horrors of tyranny, and the price of freedom have become part of our lives over the past 3+ years, we are still living and working during this wartime, and that inevitably shapes the games we make.</em></p>
<p><em>Metro has always had a hard-hitting, political, anti-war, and often emotional story - and you can be sure these themes will continue thanks to our ongoing collaboration with franchise creator, author, and activist Dmitry Glukhovsky. Dmitry has always <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-writer-is-on-russias-wanted-list-for-his-anti-war-stance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoken out against the war in Ukraine from the start</a> – a courageous decision for any russian, that has seen him <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-series-author-dmitry-glukhovsky-prison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced to jail (in absentia)</a> - and we are proud to have him as a friend and co-creator as we tell this next, and never more relevant chapter of Metro together. Rest assured, you are in for quite the ride.</em></p>
<p>The development team also shared an update on their current status. 4A Games is now composed of over 200 members, 150 of whom are still in Kyiv, while the rest are located in the studio's headquarters in Sliema, Malta. Besides Metro, 4A Games is also working on an unannounced intellectual property.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian developers are inevitably still impacted by the war, and as such, they asked fans to manage expectations when it comes to the reveal of the next Metro: it will be ready when it's ready. Indeed, it's already been over six years since the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metro-exodus-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro Exodus</a>, and it sounds like we'll have to wait a while yet before we hear anything concrete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fans can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Quimera</a>, a sci-fi first-person shooter game in development at Reburn, formerly 4A Games Ukraine and now completely independent of 4A Games.</p>

That and a multitude of smaller tweaks and fixes.

<p>
Witness the crossplaying in the below trailer, in which a base-vandalising Astegon gets its bell rung by a group of visitors presumably running foreign hardware. That'll learn 'em to step on my Lamballs.

Legal fisticuffs with Nintendo and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> updates aside, Pocketpair have recently gotten into games publishing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">Their first collaboration is an untitled horror game from Surgent Studios</a>, the people behind Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU. The move into publishing doubles as a spiritual dividend for Palworld players who now look with horror upon their sprawling empires of Pokélike slaves. Rest easy, ye fretful caPaltalists - your blood money is being used to fund a new generation of indie games.

    <blockquote><cite>Good Ol' Auto says:</cite> This is also regarding cosmetics, but it's more curiosity about the purely aesthetic more than anything important: how "restricted" are the looks of the characters so far when it comes to the gear they can get? Does Naoe get something more armored-looking or is she limited to ninja-like attire? Same for Yasuke (but not as much, because he's already quite armored up and it's mostly having the characters clad in armor that I'm curious/hopeful about. Having Naoe in some Tomoe Gozen-like attire would be cool, even if not necessarily a gamebreaker).</blockquote>
<p>I don't recall any big armour for Naoe - it doesn't reflect her movement or her nimbleness in battle. Her gear is mostly shinobi-themed, with some battle-ready kosodes, as well as some cool Assassin robes. Headgear includes hoods and headbands. I discovered a great Noh mask the other night, but it's a bit creepy for general wear. 
</p>
<p>Yasuke has some slightly-less chunky gear - there's a Japanese pirate set for him - but he's supposed to be dressed like a tank. All of that said, you can hide all their gear and have both of them fighting in their undies if you'd prefer.</p>

<p>Shadows' version of Japan is comparatively grounded, and also - as mentioned below - does not have you fighting creatures. None of its story threads focus on mythological elements.
</p>
<p>More as Easter eggs, there are <span tabindex="0">a couple of mythical animals you can spot and paint pictures of</span>.</p>

<p>This is Ubisoft Quebec, which previously led development on Syndicate and Odyssey. (Montreal, for reference, led Origins and Valhalla.) No sign of the story creator coming back yet, but it is early days, and that was a very late addition to Odyssey.</p>

      <p>Microtransactions and gear</p>
    <blockquote><cite>Czekolada says:</cite> What about microtransactions? Given how valhalla had more paid equipment sets in their in-game store than you could get within base game itself (+expacs!) I expect shadows to be as bad in this regard. Especially now,that the gear seems to have it's own stats instead of just perks (which was asinine for ubisoft to do in valhalla anyway)</blockquote>
<p>There are four armour sets in the premium shop at launch - none of which are tempting to me in any way, cosmetically or for their perks. (I have bought the occaisonal thing in an Assassin's Creed game before, but typically just mounts.) It is very ignorable.
</p>
<p>Valhalla definitely had a gear problem. Getting rid of being able to dismantle gear meant that game scaled the amount of gear too far back. Shadows uses the Odyssey system, where you're swapping better gear pretty regularly then dismantling older stuff for resources, which you can put towards upgrading the Legendary gear sets you keep and upgrade. And as mentioned below, transmog works like Odyssey too.</p>

<p>I was waiting for this question too - and I'm sorry I haven't played more of that list to make a proper judgement! Comparing it to how other Assassin's Creed games have treated their own time periods/source material, this is probably the most grounded/sensible take yet, while never seeming dry. And I think it's more of a looker than Tsushima.</p>

      <p>Random encounters and transmog</p>
    <blockquote><cite>Good Ol' Auto says:</cite> This is a bit silly of a question, but are there random events as you explore? How interactable is the settlement you're given? And most importantly, how is the fashion game? Is transmog as good as it was in Odyssey, or is it more like Valhalla's restrictive take on it? And do we get similar customization to the latter in the game letting us change Naoe's and Yasuke's hairstyles?</blockquote>
<p>Good questions all! Yes, there are often random events by the side of the road - people with small stories to share, problems to quickly solve, or bandits lying in wait. You're rewarded for interacting with these by gaining intel on a nearby activity/merchant/treasure you're yet to find, or with an extra scout to send out that season. Useful!</p>
<p>The settlement is fairly interactive. Every time I go back, several people want to say hello - and this definitely helps flesh out your companion characters, who otherwise only get a couple of missions of screentime. I'd encourage going back as often as you can of your own accord - the game does not force you back there after every story arc like Valhalla.</p>
<p>Transmog is the Odyssey system. It's a lot of fun, and lets you junk your old gear fast. There's some great armour options, but no hairstyles/beard styles... yet.</p></div>

    <blockquote><cite>Lurker86 says:</cite> Are there any enemies who you can't stealth kill because their level is too high? That was a big turn off in Odyssey for me.</blockquote><p>

By default yes, but there's setting you can turn on in the game's options if you'd prefer insta-kills from the start (and you also unlock this naturally late game).

      <p>Level gating and grinding</p>
    <blockquote><cite>Raziel says:</cite> How level-gated is the main game? Did you find yourself having to do side-quests (or grind even) to reach that level or does it pace well with the story?</blockquote>
<p>Several folk asked about this yesterday too - thanks for your questions <strong>November02</strong>, <strong>eze2g</strong> and <strong>MrZappa</strong>. </p>
<p>After the game's prologue, the map opens out and you can travel anywhere. Enemies have a base difficulty in each region which then syncs with yours as you level up, so you're never going anywhere that's a cakewalk. You can generally tackle areas and equip gear about five levels higher than yours.</p>
<p>There's definitely a structure to the game - you'll discover/be encouraged to go after some of the main targets before others. But there's not a strict order within that, and I never found myself having to grind in order to move on, or because I was unable to do anything else before being a higher level. </p></div>

<p>My understanding is there will be a launch update to fix some minor bugs (ones I haven't really seen - it's already very smooth). Currently the game is on version 1.0.0 for me.</p>

<p>I'm guessing you mean snakes! (Could be slow worms.) I can confirm Shadows' total snake count is: zero.</p>
<p>For my fellow vegetarians, one small thing I liked about Shadows is it never forces you to hunt/kill animals. The game's world is teeming with life - but it's there to be observed and painted!</p>

    <blockquote><cite>themightyant says:</cite> - New Eurogamer feature? 
- How long did it take you to finish the game? and did you do much of the side quests?
- Did you find side quests and exploration worthwhile?</blockquote>
<p>New Eurogamer feature/old Assassin's Creed fan - hello :)</p>
<p>It took me 55 hours to hit the credits, completing the main story, all companion sidequests and the epilogue quests for both Naoe and Yasuke. That's the real meat of it all, though of course completionists have more to do. (Hello again.)</p>
<p>Exploration is a big part of the fun of the game. I found it far more rewarding, not least because Shadows' world is so visually stunning. Anything to do with Naoe/Yasuke's personal stories are great and very worth doing. Companion characters are a mixed bag, and not essential.</p></div>

<p>As a long-term Assassin's Creed fan, stealth is my go-to as well. As a percentage of the game's full run-time, it's not often Shadows forces you to play as one character over another - and as Yasuke much less than Naoe, who gets the game's lengthy prologue pretty much to herself. </p>

            <p>A year and a bit on from its monumental debut which saw the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' game surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> now has crossplay.</p>
<p>The update went live today across platforms, with developer Pocketpair proclaiming "the wait is over". Crossplay was included in a roadmap laid out by the developer back in January, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Palworld team outlined its plans for the game's second year</a>. At this time, however, no release date was mentioned.</p>
<p>Other new bells and whistles added with today's update include a new storage system, dedicated servers for those playing on Mac, and a photo mode.</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, the Palworld studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time">currently building an "ending scenario" for the game</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">an upcoming Terraria crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier this week Pocketpair discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">moment it discovered Nintendo had launched legal action against its Pokémon-style game</a>, calling it "a very depressing day".</p></div>

<p>Recently, Snail Games USA revealed a new trailer for ARK: Aquatica, an all-new expansion coming to ARK: Survival Ascended. The chief developer behind the series, Studio Wildcard, distanced itself from the project on social media by directing fans to Snail Games, and it’s clear why.</p>



<p>The published trailer was little more than a gen-AI showcase, except for a few seconds of gameplay at the start of the video. It’s glaringly obvious and it has drawn blowback from fans online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-naturally">Naturally</h2>



<p>The one-minute trailer that announces ARK: Aquatica is studded with blatant gen-AI footage, and even the most uneducated eye can look at it and know something is wrong:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ARK: Aquatica Official Trailer GDC 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2eCWWaCzwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The entire contents of the trailer reveal <strong>nothing </strong>about the expansion. It’s just a visual reel that shows janky AI characters exploring some kind of water-themed underworld. In one sequence, a character fires a harpoon gun, and it’s so bizarre it’s a wonder this thing managed to pass muster at Snail Games.</p>



<p>What’s worse is it isn’t even <strong>good </strong>gen-AI content. I’ve seen better and more accurate renditions in Snapchat filters. From a cursory glance beneath the video, I failed to find a single positive comment about the trailer. When I checked, more than 1,000 comments were ripping the AI-generated content to shreds.</p>



<p>Per the description of the DLC, ARK: Aquatica will have players taking their ‘survival to the deep blue with new creatures, mechanics, and dangers lurking below.’</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Wildcard Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-next-major-expansion-set-scene-ark-2/">revealed ARK: Lost Colony</a>, the first major expansion for ARK: Survival Ascended that will help bridge the gap between ARK and ARK 2, which still doesn’t have a release date.</p>



<p>Are you miffed by the use of gen-AI in the trailer for ARK: Aquatica? Let me know in the comments.</p>
