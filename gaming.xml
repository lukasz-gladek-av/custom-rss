<p>Return to the garden later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PopCap's highly addictive tower defence series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is making a return on the Switch and Switch 2 later this month.</p>
<p>Before you return to the garden in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, there's a new gameplay trailer you might want to check out. It showcases the Switch 2 GameShare feature, which allows you and a friend to enjoy Local Co-Op or PvP together.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the fine print in the trailer, the Switch 2 system must initiate the GameShare session. And users who receive software via GameShare can only play this software during the session it was shared.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b4736719262f"><a title="Plants vs Zombies Replanted" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b4736719262f/plants-vs-zombies-replanted.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the 'Replanted' version of the original Plants vs. Zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cult classic, Plants vs. Zombies, returns in glorious HD! After years in Crazy Dave’s attic, the original battle between Plants and Zombies is back—bigger, brighter and crazier than ever before. Revisit the epic backyard standoffs you remember, but this time with new levels, fresh twists, and 15 years of never-before-seen franchise history at your fingertips. Relive the glory days of Peashooters, Sunflowers, and brain-hungry chaos. Rejoin the ultimate garden defense and experience the backyard brawl that started a phenomenon—now back for a new era!"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-are-going-for-pennies-the-new-airpods-pro-can%E2%80%99t-compete-at-full-price.1322428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and finally added AI features that Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have had for nearly a year now. Samsung got ahead with AI features in its Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which launched way back and still remain at the top of their game. From a value perspective, they’re even more compelling now with this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">post-Prime Day deal on Amazon that drops them to a record low of $172, down from their usual $249 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>AI integration goes beyond marketing buzzwords</strong> and actually improves your listening experience in practical ways. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro use machine learning to analyze your ear canal shape and ambient noise conditions, then automatically adjust sound output to optimize audio quality for your specific situation. This means the earbuds adapt when you move from a quiet office to a loud street, or when you switch from music to podcasts, adjusting EQ and volume levels on the fly. The real-time translation feature lets you have conversations across language barriers with audio playing directly in your ears as someone speaks in another language. This AI capability <strong>transforms these earbuds into a communication tool rather than just an audio device</strong>.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation That Really Works</h2>
<p>The<strong> active noise canceling system incorporates multiple microphones</strong> that cancel out external noise over the full frequency spectrum. Rumble from motors or HVAC is cancelled out very effectively, while mid-level noise such as voice conversations and typing on the keyboard drop into the background. The adaptive ANC modulates the level depending on where you are so you’re not draining the battery with full cancellation when you’re already sitting in silence. Ambient sound mode does the opposite, streaming external sounds in over the microphones so you hear announcements, traffic, or brisk conversations without removing the earbuds.</p>



<p>Samsung reworked the fit around the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro based on complaints from previous iterations. The new blade design with tilted nozzles fit deeper into the ear canal with more even pressure distribution. It makes a difference during exercises, commutes or marathon listening sessions where ill-fitting earbuds will fall out or make uncomfortable pressure points. The <strong>IP57 rating also means dust and water resistance</strong>&nbsp;so you won’t harm them by sweating during exercise or getting caught in the rain. The protective coverage even extends to immersion under up to one meter’s depth of water for 30 minutes, although you won’t be swimming with them.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is improved by dual-driver construction</strong> that decouples the low frequency from the mid and high frequency response. The low end is covered by a specialized woofer and the high end and midrange by a specialized tweeter. The decoupling makes for clearer sound with better detail compared to single-driver earbuds that are not capable of accurately playing the full frequency response.</p>
<p>Battery life is around six hours with ANC enabled and around eight hours with ANC disabled. The <strong>charging case adds around 20 hours or so</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll have enough time before you’ll want to recharge. Fast charging will give you around an hour’s play from five minutes’ charging if time is extremely limited. The Amazon Exclusive version comes with a two-year warranty rather than the one-year coverage you get otherwise, so you have even greater assurance for your pound.</p>
<p>The all-time low price makes the earbuds an extremely smart purchase this time.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are set to go live on October 29, along with a special series-themed video.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil franchise has been delivering the scares since 1996. With the 30th anniversary coming next year, a new entry, Resident Evil Requiem, is releasing on February 27th, 2026. From what we’ve seen (and played), it looks to capitalize on what makes the series iconic: terrifying creatures and survival skills. If you cannot wait to return to Raccoon City, like I am, we know know when pre-orders will start. Plus, we’ll get an extra special video to go along with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-special-video-requiem-pre-orders-to-release-on-october-29th">Resident Evil Special Video, Requiem Pre-Orders To Release On October 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The nightmare begins soon. <br>Resident Evil Requiem pre-orders will start on October 29th, US time. Plus, we'll be releasing a video celebrating the Resident Evil franchise at the same time (note: no new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay will be shown). Keep an eye out.… <a href="https://t.co/M8ssS8PJsS">pic.twitter.com/M8ssS8PJsS</a></p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Capcom has announced that pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem will go live on October 29th, 2025. No specifics were given as for what time that will be other than “US time”. In addition, a special video celebrating the Resident Evil series will premiere on October 29th as well. Unfortunately for fans hoping to see more Requiem gameplay, Capcom confirmed that no new footage will be shown.</p>



<p>However, for the optimists in the room, it doesn’t confirm that nothing new from the series will be shown. Rumors of a remake of Resident Evil 0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a>, and Code Veronica have made the rounds for a while. Perhaps we could see a reveal for one of those titles during the video? Furthermore, the film adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/"> Evil</a>, directed by Weapon’s Zach Cregger is currently in production. Maybe we’ll see some footage or principal photography? We’ll just have to wait and see on October 29th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackerys-1500w-power-station-is-cheaper-than-during-prime-day-looks-like-amazons-selling-at-cost-2000634122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery%E2%80%99s-1500w-power-station-is-cheaper-than-during-prime-day-looks-like-amazon%E2%80%99s-selling-at-cost.1322410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Prime Big Deal Day took place from October 7th through October 8th, and Amazon doubled down from July’s Prime Day by cutting the price to all-time lows on nearly all product lines. The Jackery Explorer 1000 portable power station dropped to an all-time low during the sales event and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">remains at that same $429 price point, down from the $799 price point consumers will pay until existing stock is sold out</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This product has been the <strong>category’s number one bestseller on Amazon</strong> since the first day of the month. Power outages, camping excursions, tailgating parties and even emergency planning all have one thing in common: the need for good backup electricity that doesn’t come from noisy gas-based generators. The Jackery product addresses this very same issue by delivering clean, silent power that you can tote around with one hand and enjoy indoors without hassle from fumes nor carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The Explorer 1000 stores a 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery capacity into an amazingly <strong>small package weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. That capability translates into tangible runtime in the real world: you’ll power a mini-fridge for around 10 hours, power a CPAP machine overnight over multiple nights, sustain laptops and cellphones for multiple days, or power LED lights for an extended time. With<strong> the 1,500W continuous AC output but 3,000W surge peak</strong>, this power station supports appliances drawing much power during startups such as refrigerators, portable air conditioners, or electric kettles.</p>



<h2>Speeding Up Charges and Lasting Batteries That Alter the Equation</h2>
<p>The <strong>fast charging for one hour is quite impressive</strong> and is only accessed by activating the emergency charging mode from the Jackery app. It is ideal when you are aware bad weather is imminent or you want to quickly get it topped up before you leave. The standard charging mode will take 1.7 hours for full charging that is something the manufacturers made deliberate for the best preservation of long-term battery health. The slow charging decreases the strain on the cell from the battery, giving them an extended lifespan.</p>



<p>LiFePO4 batteries are the key to this power station’s longevity: Unlike standard lithium-ion batteries that degrade relatively quickly, LiFePO4 chemistry maintains over 70% of original capacity even after 4,000 charge cycles. In practical terms, if you fully charge and discharge this power station once per week, <strong>it’ll still perform well after a decade of use</strong>.</p>
<p>The port assortment accomodates the majority of general devices and setups. <strong>Three pure sine AC outlets</strong> supply clean power safe for sensitive electronics such as laptops, medical equipment, and digital-control-enabled modern appliances.<strong> Two USB-C ports supply up to 100W PD fast charging</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll be able to charge contemporary laptops at full speed without the need for heavy power adapters. One is relegated to older devices, with the <strong>DC car port supporting 12V accessories</strong>.</p>
<p>The Jackery app adds smart controls that actually improve the user experience: You can switch between charging modes, monitor battery levels and power draw in real time, and <strong>activate the 30dB quiet overnight charging mode</strong> when noise matters. Energy efficiency mode adjusts output to reduce waste when powering low-draw devices. The integrated LED lights provide emergency illumination without draining your phone’s battery.</p>
<p>Coming in at $429, this Jackery Explorer 1000 brings serious power capacity, and decade-spanning battery longevity all for almost half the going price.</p>

<p>Are you looking to play PowerWash Simulator 2 in early access? Are you hoping for any chance to jump in as soon as possible?</p>



<p>With the first game being a surprise hit, PowerWash Simulator 2 is looking to be another rewarding experience, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time with more friends</a>.</p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about any potential PowerWash Simulator 2 early access.</p>

<p><strong>No, there is no early access period in PowerWash Simulator 2. The game’s full release is set for October 23, which is when everyone will be able to access the game.</strong></p>



<p>The original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator</a> was released into early access, in the way that it did not have its 1.0 release until much later, but that is not the case with the sequel. All content in PowerWash Simulator 2 can be considered the game’s full launch, with any future maps likely coming via DLC packs, like the first game saw.</p>



<p>It is not necessarily surprising that there is no early access for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. Typically, only very large games offer that kind of benefit for buying a deluxe edition or something like that. With a smaller, but still anticipated, game like this, that doesn’t happen much.</p>



<p>With that said, it is nice to see the game have a full 1.0 release so soon after the release date announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-a-demo">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have a Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there is a demo available for download for PowerWash Simulator 2, but it is only available on Steam. There is no demo for the game on Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, at least as of this writing.</strong></p>



<p>In the demo, you get a look at the early portion of the game, with two jobs available: Removal Van and Public Facility. You can also walk around your home base and see how this new area will be in the full game.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with the demo only available on Steam, console players are left out of the early fun. There is always a chance that these storefronts will get access to the demo before the game releases, but as of now, there is no indication that it is happening.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-is-quietly-selling-its-qc-headphones-at-a-new-record-low-after-prime-day-to-clear-out-stock.1322389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s October answer to the summer Prime Day event (Prime Big Deal Day) just wrapped up but some of the best deals are still hanging around. The <strong>Bose QuietComfort headphones</strong> are a perfect example, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">now sitting at a record low of $199, down from their usual $349 price</a>. These are the most popular premium noise-canceling headphones in the world for a reason: they solve the problem of trying to focus, relax, or enjoy music in noisy environments better than almost anything else on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphones’ active noise cancellation does what the name suggests – canceling out noise – <strong>by using microphones to listen for external noise and then creating countering sound waves to eliminate the noise</strong>. This all occurs in real time so background noise such as engine rumble, air flow from the air conditioning or background chatter all get greatly alleviated. Bose overlays this with passive noise isolation from the over-ear design itself where the cushy earcup cushions form an actual physical seal around the ears. The active-passive noise reduction mixture makes that classic <em>“quiet bubble”</em> result that makes the headphones so desirable among travelers and remote workers.</p>
<h2>Comfort Engineering That Makes All-Day Wear Actually Possible</h2>
<p>The earcup cushions incorporate soft materials that wrap around your ears without applying too much force and <strong>distributes weight evenly so you don’t feel any pressure points</strong>. The cushioned headband keeps the headphones firmly in place during movement but doesn’t develop that ill-fitting clamp sensation causing headaches after an hour. The design for comfort is important because these headphones <strong>provide up to 24 hours of battery power from one charging</strong>. That’s multiple intercontinental flights, some workweeks, or an infinite number of daily commutes before you have to recharge them. Should you unexpectedly run low, 15 minutes of charging provides 2.5 hours of subsequent playtime which is enough to get you through the rest of your trip or workweek.</p>



<p>Two modes for listening give you the choice depending on the circumstances: <em>Quiet Mode</em> engages full noise cancellation as much as possible, ideal when you’re working or sleeping on a trip. <em>Aware Mode</em> does the reverse and uses external microphones to feed external sounds so you’ll hear announcements or traffic without having to lift the headphones.</p>



<p>The high-fidelity audio reproduction provides <strong>excellent sound throughout the frequency spectrum</strong> with the EQ settings in the Bose app allowing you to tailor the bass, midrange, and treble to suit. Some users desire booming bass for dance/electronica, while others want well-balanced reproduction for classical or jazz. The app puts the settings in your hand so the same headphones suit varied genres and individual taste.</p>
<p>The multipoint Bluetooth connectivity allows you to <strong>connect to multiple devices at the same time</strong>&nbsp;so the headphones remain connected to laptop and phone. If you receive an incoming call on the phone while you’re streaming something on the laptop, the headphones will automatically switch to the phone without needing you to manually detach from one device and connect to the other.</p>
<p>The packaged audio cable with the in-line microphone gives you the option of going wired when you don’t have access to Bluetooth or when the battery dies. This is the kind of feature that is actually useful on outdated airplane entertainment sets or where wireless connectivity is not an option. At $199, you get flagship-level noise cancellation and excellent battery life all at close to half the full price.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> hasn’t officially been announced for Switch 2 yet but a new leaked retailer listing all but confirms it. It’ll be the second big open-world blockbuster to arrive on the new Nintendo console from Ubisoft following <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ arrival&nbsp;back in September</a>.</p> <p>Like that sci-fi stealth adventure, the “physical” version of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">a game key card</a>. That shouldn’t be too surprising considering <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1976767268764705115">its size</a> on every other platform is over 100GB. The <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867">Auchan listing</a> that leaked the apparent port doesn’t confirm a release date or price, though it seems a good guess it will be $70 and potentially arrive before the end of the year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows (Switch 2 Key Card) listed at a retailer <a href="https://t.co/P1tsWNMBBm">https://t.co/P1tsWNMBBm</a> <a href="https://t.co/h9E10PoNHN">pic.twitter.com/h9E10PoNHN</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1976762547958423703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is one of the most visually impressive games on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and it’ll be interesting to see if Ubisoft can get it looking anywhere near as good on Switch 2. The port of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> included ray-tracing and other current-gen features, making it a decent version of the 2024 mercenary sim.</p> <p>Other big third-party ports for the Switch 2 are still MIA. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> won’t arrive until early 2026. <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t even have a release date yet. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> was recently indefinitely delayed despite originally being due out earlier this month. So far at least, the Switch 2 seems in a good position to get a surprising number of last-gen and current-gen blockbusters. It’s just taking a bit longer than some might have hoped.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-legendary-drop-rate-bosses-patch-notes-nerf-2000634114</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-player-kills-3-000-bosses-to-discover-disappointingly-low-legendary-drop-rate.1322368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two ways to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">approach <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em></a>. One is as a colorful sci-fi comic book sandbox where people say entertaining stuff as you shoot things in the face. The other is as a claw-game lottery to be mathematically solved, with players optimizing strategies to earn prizes as efficiently as possible. Both of those things can be fun! The magic of a great loot shooter is in making those two approaches feel like one and the same.</p> <p>One player decided to go full tilt in the numbers direction and Excel the shit out of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s loot RNG. The result after 3,000 boss kills, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o0q032/bl4_drop_rate_data_3000_kills/">published on the subreddit in a color-coded spreadsheet for all to see</a>, was a legendary drop rate that felt surprisingly stingy at just 5 percent. They want Gearbox to increase it.</p>

 <p>“I think 10 percent is the sweet spot for dedicated items for two reasons,”&nbsp; the player, who goes by Siphonicfir, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">told<em> IGN</em></a>.&nbsp; “One reason is precedent, as that was the drop rate in <em>Borderlands 2</em>. I think that game is widely regarded as the best game in the franchise, and I am almost certain the community thinks it was the best game for farming. Ten percent created a perfect balance where a drop always feels special, but you never go too long without one.”</p>

   <p>That might feel purely like vibes talking, but Siphonicfir points out that while a 5-percent drop rate means you’re averaging one Legendary drop every 20 boss kills, the far end of the range means there are players out there going a lot longer without getting anything meaningful, especially if they’re trying to farm specific pieces of equipment.</p>

 <p>They explained further:</p> <blockquote><p>For example in my data the longest cold streak was when I farmed Fractis. It took 96 runs to get a single UAV grenade to drop. The odds of not getting the item 96 consecutive times at a 5 percent drop rate are about 1 in 137. In stark contrast, at a 10 percent drop chance, the odds of going cold for 96 trials in a row are just 1 in 24,703. Going from 5 percent to 10 percent isn’t just doubling the chance, it’s reducing the worst possible outlier outcomes by a factor of 180. Those outcomes make people give up or quit due to frustration and should be limited as much as possible. An increase to 10% would make a world of difference in limiting the most egregious outlier scenarios.</p></blockquote> <p>Time will tell if the developers at Gearbox end up agreeing with Siphonicfir’s logic. It’s easier to make a game more generous than it is to turn off the reward spigot, so studios have an incentive to wait and see before course correcting too far in favor of showering players with extra loot.</p>

 <h2>Nerfs and mod warnings</h2> <p>In the meantime, Gearbox is trying to get some weapon balancing issues sorted <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708">ahead of future content updates</a>. Some players have been running around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GONnYPDIHq0">one-shotting bosses</a> for a few weeks now, and that little festival of unintended build consequences is coming to an end. The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">October 9 patch notes</a> detailed a litany of changes, including a big buff to Hellwalker base damage and pistol reworks. Assault rifles are supposed to <a href="https://x.com/grantkao/status/1975989364258897947">get some love</a> a little later on, too. But clock is ticking on those broken builds too, with some big nerfs slated for the mid-October patch.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear.</p> <p>— Graeme Timmins (@ProdigyXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976485366384210394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Small update this week before a larger one next week,” creative director Graeme Timmins posted on X. “There will be some changes next week to specific gear and those unintended interactions.” He explained the team’s reasoning in response to criticism from some fans of nerfs in a non-competitive, mostly single-player game. “We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear,” Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976485366384210394">wrote</a> back.</p> <p>Also, beware of some of those popular mods floating around for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC. One of them lets players skip all of the dialogue in the game, a feature fans are requesting be added in an official update at some point to make it easier to keep grinding through the campaign. Easier said than done, according to the development team. “I’d be cautious using this mod; skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable,” Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976079573768138920">posted on X</a>. Skip the writing and performance teams’ hard work at your own peril!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> may have officially wrapped up, but Amazon isn’t done surprising us just yet. The retailer is keeping the momentum going through the weekend with some unexpected deals that are actually getting better. Case in point: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">Bose TV speaker has dropped to a record low of $199, down from its regular $279 price tag</a>. Even better? This <strong>deal isn’t locked behind Prime membership</strong> anymore, so everyone can grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve been struggling to hear dialogue in your favorite shows or constantly reaching for the remote to adjust volume during movies, this compact soundbar addresses exactly that problem. <strong>Bose built this speaker specifically to make voices clearer and more distinct</strong>&nbsp;which means no more missing crucial plot points or asking “what did they say?” every five minutes.</p>
<p>Measuring slightly <strong>over 2 inches in height and 23.38 inches wide by 4.02 inches deep</strong>, this soundbar sits unobtrusively in front of most TVs without obscuring the screen or seeming cumbersome. The black finish blends seamlessly with any living room décor but if counter space is limited, you can wall-mount the device using separately purchased brackets. What makes this soundbar actually worth the money is the<strong> dual full-range drivers located at an angle to develop the wider soundstage</strong>. Rather than having audio blasted directly at you in one flat plane, the angled drivers reflect the sound around your room for a naturally immersive experience that better reflects the way we actually perceive things in the real world.</p>



<h2>Good Clear Dialogue That Finally Does the Hype Justice</h2>
<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier: You’ll pair the soundbar with the TV using the provided optical audio cable or an HDMI-ARC cable (the latter is sold separately). In minutes, you’re finished. The system has <strong>three input options total to work with: HDMI, optical, and auxiliary</strong> so you have versatility depending on what ports are open on your TV. Connected, the provided remote control provides you with access to an optional dialogue mode that further highlights speech clarity. There’s also an optional bass boost mode when you need the low-end kick for action scenes or music.</p>



<p>Talking about music, this soundbar also functions as an <strong>external Bluetooth speaker</strong>. The smartphone, tablet, or laptop can be paired to play podcasts, playlists, or audiobooks directly from the Bose system. The auto-connect function comes in handy: when you have paired the device, the device will auto-connect when the power is switched on.</p>
<p>At $199 post Prime Day, you’re getting Bose’s name for audio quality at an affordable price point for anyone fed up with constantly adjusting their TV’s volume. This weekend deal is the lowest price we’ve ever seen on this model which makes this the perfect moment finally to upgrade the audio you watch on TV.</p>

If you've reached the Old Fort objective point, you've gone too far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4583367-emberstrike2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4583367" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4583367-emberstrike2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4583367"></a><figcaption>Operation Ember Strike tag 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4583367-emberstrike2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">#2 - Pushing up the center of the valley, you'll pass through a small village and then cross a river.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In hindsight, the emergence of our modern, engagement bait-based world was inevitable. But of all the possible lenses through which to view the progression from a quainter, kinder internet to today’s sinkhole for eyeballs, I’d never considered the map game as pioneered by the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> series. On the latest Aftermath Hours, our guest makes a convincing argument that these things moved in tandem.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ckunzelman.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Kunzelman</a> of the <a href="https://rangedtouch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranged Touch podcast network</a>, who has a book about<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/everything-is-permitted-on-assassin-s-creed-cameron-kunzelman/f0a99fbf424cdff4?ean=9781517914943&amp;next=t&amp;aid=84774&amp;listref=buy-cmrn-s-book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Everything Is Permitted</em></a>, coming out next month. We discuss how the series has evolved over the years, with each sequel and spinoff essentially functioning as an argument in favor of the series’ continued existence. Highlights include: why <em>Brotherhood </em>was weird and kinda bad, how Ubisoft portrayed itself in its own book about<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>’s legacy, and the origin of the series’ entire Assassins vs Templars conflict (the first chunk of just one book).&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to modern <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>-related matters: This week, news broke that Ubisoft <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-reconstruction-era-klansmen-cancelled-kkk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a Reconstruction-era AC game</a> that would’ve starred a freed slave, citing the current political climate and backlash to Yasuke, a Black samurai in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. This after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly accepted funding from Saudi Arabia</a> to develop a new DLC for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>. Says a lot about where the company’s priorities lie! Finally, we adapt the Bible’s Old Testament into a <em>WarioWare</em>-like minigame collection.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can also adapt the New Testament into a series of minigames.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Cameron:</strong> [There’s this idea of] the more you’re spending minutes with our thing, the less you’re spending minutes with other things. The <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and Ubisoft games in general are a really interesting canary in the coalmine for that, alongside mobile gaming. Because that’s everything now. There’s a reason that Netflix currently talks about second-screen content, right? Their belief is that you’re not even looking at it. It’s a thing for you to be listening to and half paying attention to while you’re on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft is thinking through this stuff. If you read those investor reports and you kinda pay attention to the way they talk about themselves, they want to capture that whole minute. They want to be demonstrating that people are putting all their effort and time and thought into that. And that goes all the way back to map design, to the map game. That’s the early indicator of “We’re gonna give you so much to do. There’s gonna be so many icons, and you’re gonna feel so good about completing those things.”</p><p>Luke, you were talking about this: That’s the <em>Brotherhood </em>innovation, right? “I’m gonna feel good by clearing this section of the map.” But it’s in order to eat your time. It’s in order to pull you into the orbit of the device. What’s great about <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> as a franchise – and why I wrote a book about the franchise – is that you can watch it happen, beat by beat. You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today.</p><p>The games industry of 2007 to now is a different universe. We have continuity of people and companies and whatever, but anyone who was around back then remembers: It’s just a radically different universe. The video game franchise is one of the really cool ways that we can trace that and watch that transformation happen.&nbsp;</p><p>And my hope is that on the academic side and anyone who wants to do this, my hope is that writing a book on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise helps open the door to other people writing about things like this. I desperately want to read the <em>Halo </em>franchise book. Because it allows you to do the same thing, but in a different way. How has multiplayer changed? How has the relationship between studios and their ownership companies changed? How has the relationship between companies and IP changed?</p><p>If you follow the way the map game kind of operates and changes and moves, you get to watch the whole industry change around it from that initial kernel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>People often look at <em>Origins </em>as this very pivotal game in the series in terms of narrative and setting and overall structure. People say “Oh, it’s the first real open-world one.” But if <em>Valhalla </em>was the first game where they were actively tracking engagement metrics, <em>Origins </em>was the first one to bring in that “We want to keep you in this game” stuff. They’d make you log in through UPlay, and they’d keep offering skins, and they’d want you to keep buying stuff in the game, and they’d keep offering updates and little storylines. Six months, nine months later, they’d want you playing the same game.&nbsp;</p><p>So based on what you’re saying, that maybe makes <em>Origins </em>the most pivotal game in the franchise’s history. Fans will look at it in terms of its structure, but economically and design-wise, it’s clearly the most important. It’s almost like a clean BC/AD break between what came before and what’s happening now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cameron:</strong> I think you’re exactly right. When I mention <em>Valhalla</em>, it’s certainly not the first place that they’re highlighting those numbers and talking about engagement. I do think it starts with the beginning of the Leila/Hassan games. There’s something interesting that you make a new trilogy with a new economic model foregrounded underneath it. I think all of that starts with <em>Origins </em>and probably starts earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>But by the time you get to <em>Valhalla</em>, it’s such a major part of the self-narration of Ubisoft and of the franchise. I think the reason for that is that <em>Valhalla </em>broke $1 billion in revenue – or at least, that’s what Ubisoft claimed. So I think Valhalla gets highlighted by them so much because it demonstrates the thing they started with <em>Origins </em>has reached its apex with a three or four year-long support cycle on it that had daily content and weekly content associated with it that’s demonstrating not only a drip feed of stuff, but a firehose of stuff that is monetizable at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s a fascinating game. The thing that’s tricky about writing a book like this is, every game in the franchise could support 250 pages of serious writing about it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> When thousands of people worked on anything, it can support one book if not more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cameron:</strong> And thousands of people who have strong opinions and are willing to ping off each other. Each game is kind of an argument for why<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> should exist. There’s a real diligence to pulling those things apart.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Capcom Cup 12, with its finals scheduled for March of next year, is set to be the first pay-per-view livestream for a major <em>Street Fighter</em> tournament. On Friday, however, the Japanese publisher might change how much it charges players to watch it. That’s in response to <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340">a furious backlash</a> from fans and competitive pros alike to what would be a controversial milestone for professional esports.</p> <p>“Currently, we are considering price adjustments for the paid live viewing,” Capcom announced on X earlier today, according to the platforms’ auto-translation. “We plan to make another announcement regarding the pricing of live viewing tickets, as well as the background and intent behind it, by late October.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">＜カプコンeSportsイベント 有料チケットに関するお知らせ＞<br>本日より「CAPCOM CUP 12」「ストリートファイターリーグ: ワールドチャンピオンシップ 2025」の国技館の会場観戦チケットの抽選販売受付を開始いたします。</p> <p>▼詳しくはこちら▼<a href="https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf">https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf</a>…</p> <p>— CAPCOM eSports (@CAPCOM_eSports) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAPCOM_eSports/status/1976528542889545892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While fans can pay to attend the tournament live in-person, they’ll also have to pay to watch it live online. Right now the ticket price is $40 for two days of matches. That’s as much as it currently costs to buy <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. While some fans are against Capcom charging at all, others might be satisfied if the publisher simply lowers the price, or rolls the ticketing into a broader package that also includes in-game cosmetics.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s retreat comes a week after S<em>treet Fighter 6</em> director Takayuki Nakayama confirmed on social media that the development team was not consulted about the pay-per-view pricing for the more than $1 million prize pool event. “It may sound strange, but it’s true,” he <a href="https://x.com/takaNakayama/status/1973626143187280262">wrote</a>. “Revenue targets and assigned tasks differ fundamentally by department. Even the development team was surprised by this announcement. (At least Matsumoto and I were shocked at the venue). That said, since this matter occurred within the same company, we are currently discussing it. We apologize for any concern this may have caused.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For example, the initiatives we implemented in the previous title. That was a proposal from the development team—it was tough but fun.<br>Since then, the organization has grown significantly, and various departments have been established.<br>My main responsibilities now are improving…</p> <p>— TAKA-nakayama (@takaNakayama) <a href="https://twitter.com/takaNakayama/status/1973633016691040448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He also confirmed that there was no discussions about including tickets for the livestream in add-on content for the game, like a World Championship costume set. Nakayama even added that he’d delete his post if he got “scolded at work” for it. That clearly hasn’t happened.</p> <p>“We kindly ask for your patience until then,” Capcom told fans today. “We sincerely appreciate your continued support for Capcom eSports events.”</p>

Instead of prompting his viewers to throw money at the screen, he’s instead urging folks to donate to charity. “There are so many better options for your money,” he said.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/there-are-so-many-better-options-for-your-money-popular-streamer-turns-off-all-donation-tells-fans-to-give-to-charity/">first reported by <i>VGC</i></a>, White has posted a video announcing that he’s shut off user-donated monetization on his YouTube channel, and saying that he’d shut off Twitch subs as well if he could. “I would say toodle-oo, give it a strong slap on the ass, tell it good game and goodbye.” But apparently it’s harder than that. Still, he stressed that money spent on his stream could be put to better use:</p> <p>There are so many good charities doing extremely good work that could be benefited greatly from your contribution. Like maybe you’d want to donate to a charity that’s doing extremely important work in Gaza. That would be a significantly better use of that money than donating it to me.</p>

<p>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is the game’s latest Halloween event, bringing with it a new game mode, skins, and more content in a new season update.</p>



<p>While Overwatch was dealing with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/almost-half-of-players-who-quit-overwatch-jumped-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of players due to Marvel Rivals</a> about a year ago, the game has been making a resurgence with some great content updates, and this looks to be the latest.</p>



<p>Here is when the Haunted Masquerade starts in Overwatch 2 and all the content you can expect in it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade">When is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The new Stadium additions. Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade Halloween event in Overwatch 2 begins on Tuesday, October 14, alongside the update to Season 19.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24232473/beware-a-haunted-masquerade-begins-in-season-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Season 19 in Overwatch 2</a> brings a bunch of Halloween content, like the Haunted Masquerade and the return of Junkenstein’s Revenge, as well as a mythic hero skin for Lifeweaver and a mythic weapon skin for Kiriko. For the first time, Junkrat will also receive a mythic hero skin when the midseason update happens in November.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-stadium-a-round-based-competitive-mode-that-borrows-from-deadlock-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Stadium mode</a> is getting three more heroes added to the mix in Hazard, Torbjorn, and Sojourn. Stadium is also getting a new shop item called gadgets that will help to turn the tide in your favor for battle.</p>



<p>Outside of that, you can expect the usual rotation of new skins and bundles in the shop themed around archangels and spirits.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-overwatch-2-haunted-masquerade-mode">What is the Overwatch 2 Haunted Masquerade Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Be sure to have friends wear each other’s masks for a boost! Image by Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Haunted Masquerade in Overwatch 2 is a limited-time mode that allows players to first select the hero they want to play and then choose a mask of a different hero in the spawn room to gain a special ability for that match.</strong></p>



<p>After you select your mask, your hero will instantly get a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-adds-ability-altering-perks-brings-back-loot-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small perk power-up</a>. For example, putting on a Genji mask will give whatever hero you are playing a double jump, or Reaper’s mask will heal you slightly as you deal damage to enemies.</p>



<p>That’s not all, though, as masks have a little extra surprise if you and a team member select lore-appropriate heroes. For example, if your team has Mei and Juno and they have each other’s masks, their ultimates will combine, bringing in an Orbital Ray boost to your teammates, while also having Blizzard freeze enemies in range.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-crossover-release-date-all-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2</a> Halloween event looks to be a chaotic arcade mode that you and your friends can play throughout October. Be sure to experiment with the masks that work best for your chosen heroes and have fun out there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Here's what's up and down this week (October 10).</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-where-to-buy-2025">Mega Evolution</a> has kicked off with a bang thanks to its base set releasing in the US recently, and it's single card market is doing some strange things right now. One things for sure, the majority of the top chase cards in this set are getting more affordable by the day. It seems that day one stock is getting better across the board, with The Pokémon Company seemingly printing newer sets into oblivion. The long term effects remain to be seen, but more cards being printed means less damage to your pocket.</p><p id="mega-evolution-crashers-and-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers">TL:DR; Mega Evolution Crashers and Climbers This Week</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gold Hyper Rare cards are the highest value cards in this set, with Mega Gardevoir ex (187/132) doubling in price compared to market value and Mega Lucario ex (188/132) kicking off high and currently settling at an insane $650 for the time being. There's some supprising Illustration Rare price rises in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution</a> too, with Helioptile (143/132) rising by 33.6% recently thanks to it's gorgeous artwork. <br>One thing is clear with Mega Evolution, Pokémon trainers and collectors aren't giving in to FOMO. Being able to wait for sealed product and chase cards vs. buying it straight at launch can be a money burner, and it looks like this sentiment is finally sinking in at this point in Pokémania 2025. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-37-1760099343193.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/ao65eY?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex – 188/132</a> is currently going for $650 near mint, which is nearly $70 below it's current market value of $719.37. Whilst it's only a 9.7% drop, it's still a great saving right now and a sign that Gold Hyper Rare cards may settle at or below $600 mark throughout the Mega Evolution era of Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mega Brave is a heaby hitter for 270 damage, but can't be used again next turn, so that's something to pull out when you're backed into a corner or need one more knock out. I'd much rather use Mega Lucario ex for energy recycling and building out the rest of my bench whilst dealing a solid 130 damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aADVd0?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 178/132</a> is currently the highest valued Secret Art Rare at around $313, which is lower than the current market value of $317.08. That might not sound like a big deal, but these small dips can lead to big crashers and could indicate a price correction over the coming weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overflowing Wishes is great for getting Psychic energy to your benched Pokémon quickly, and it's artwork is classicly gorgeous. This is 100% a Pokémon card that would look amazing slabbed or in a chase card binder for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DbX2?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Latias ex – 181/132</a> is currently valued at a much more modest $168.05, which is around $11 lower than it's current market value. Again it looks like the fandom are looking towards Gold Hyper Rare cards rather than SIRs in this era, but for me the artwork on this card wins out against the Hyper Rares floating around in this set. Mega Latias' speed and strength is captured perfectly in this artwork. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Strafe move takes this a step further by causing 40 damage and performing a switch out with a benched Pokémon, perfect for chipping away at opposing Pokémon early game, especially low HP ones. If you follow the switching strategy, Illusory Impulse discards all energy from Mega Latias and deals 300 damage when it counts. Cool or what?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd07?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">My boy Mega Venusaur ex (177/132)</a> is giving out crashing energy by dropping around 6.2% to $217.97, but that's still a respectable value for an SIR. However, Mega Venusair is a very playable card, with Solar Transfer allowing trainers to move around grass energy during their turn, which is a fantastic ability and works well with Meganium from the same set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jungle Dump is both a hillarious move name and a cracking move, allowing to deal 240 damage and healing 30 damage from Mega Venusaur ex. That's why I love Venusaur, it's an absolute troll and always has a long game strategy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QrApdG?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Kangaskhan ex (182/132) SIR</a> is also begginign its decent, running in at $91.48 compared to it's current market value of $94.20. The thing is, Kangaskhan doesn't have a massive following, so naturally it's pricing is going to reflect that. It's not very playable either thanks to trainers relying on coin flips for its main offensive move, however, Run Errand allows trainers to draw two cards per turn which is a bonus.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/feature-image-35-1760099499572.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpB5?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Gardevoir ex – 187/132 Hyper Gold Rare</a> is currently doubling its market value at $600, which is frankly insane. It would however line up up with the other gold hyper rare in the set which is currently going for $650, which makes more sense. It is a ridiculously rare card all things considered, so this level of pricing just weeks after release isn't that much of a suprise. Whilst it's Overflowing Wishes and Mega Symphonia moves are cool, it's value is purely based of the regal presentation and rarity of this Gold Hyper Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aXVdDx?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Helioptile – 143/132</a> is moving at a strong pace for an Illustration Rare. It's gorgeous artwork is the main draw here, and it's clearly warrants it's 50.6% climb to $8.90. It's a good idea to snap this one up before it gets higher, it's still a great price for an in-demand Illustration Rare. It's not got the best moved for a basic Pokémon, so this price hike is all about looks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMnne?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Lucario ex (179/132) SIR</a> is my top chase card of Mega Evolution just because it features Mega Lucario and Mega Venusaur in battle, two of my favorite Pokémon. It's gone up to $330, which is a rise of 14% from its $289.45 current market value. Something tells me i'm not the only one desperate for this chase card in my collection. Although I can't see anyone using this particular card in a deck, even though Mega Lucario's Mega Brave and Aura Jab moveset is a corker. Once again, this is all about looks, and the artwork here is spot on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z31bbq?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur (113/132)</a> comes in it's stunning Illustration Rare format and a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx77m?object_uuid=c4756107-e52d-45b2-b718-a2e69349dce9&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution promo stamp alternative</a>. The stamped card can be found as a bonus in upgraded booster boxes, and is commanding around $5 more in value right now, which is just a few dollars over it's market value. It's early days for both of these cards, but given Bulbasaurs popularity and the stunning floral and trippy artwork on display here, this is 100% a card to keep an eye on and buy now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Here’s everything you need to know, from Play Boosters to a Commander Deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorders In A Half Shell</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably imagine, there are more products coming than you can shake a Bo Staff at launching on March 6, with pre-release a week prior from February 27 to March 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The foundation, as expected, is Play Boosters, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEDJ3?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon has a box for $209.70 right now</u></a>. If that price changes you’ll be refunded the difference, but history tells us that a box of thirty packs will start to get cheaper shortly after launch (just look at Spider-Man).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also grab the now-customary booster bundle, which includes a promo card, a series of nine Play Boosters, a storage box and a spindown life counter. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gj3JG?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>That’s $69.99 right now</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Less clear pricing-wise are Collector Boosters. As with any set, these are where you’ll find the high-value cards, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD1oB?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon doesn’t have a price on these yet</u></a>, nor for <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrV7e?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>a box of them</u></a>. Expect them to be <em>expensive, </em>though, with an MSRP of $37.99 each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New this time is a Pizza Bundle, which includes 9 Play Boosters, 1 Collector Booster, 25 non-foil Pizza lands (yes, really), five foil Pizza lands, 2 foil promo cards, and a spindown life counter. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8vO4?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon has this for $99.99</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Draft Night, a new boxed product making its debut in January’s Lorwyn, is also included. It has a bunch of packs (twelve in total) to play sealed draft, and a Collector Booster for the winner to take home. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YMdJn?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s $119.99 at Amazon</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Is Getting A Commander Deck</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Commander players can expect a return to precon decks… but just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being absent since Edge of Eternities, there’s a new precon coming, which is a five-color deck called Turtle Power!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-commander-decklist" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wizards has the decklist live now</u></a>, but the big focus is on teamwork, so you can have a pair of Heroes in a Half Shell to be your Commanders. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrVpN?object_uuid=659cf812-d0ab-427d-8d3f-fbd1c599b676&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>It’s currently up for preorder at $69.99</u></a>, but expect it to climb.

As noted in the video below, several members of the gaming community took part in the search, but college students "Emily" and "Super Gamer Omega Clank" were credited for finding a Sony Ericsson W880i that had a working copy of Clone Home. Breaking the phone's encryption was the most difficult step, but their efforts paid off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZx2Exgd8TI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tZx2Exgd8TI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The title of the game refers to a pair of digital clones of Ratchet and Clank who team up with their counterparts in the real world to foil the plans of Vox, the returning nemesis from Going Mobile. The digital Ratchet and Clank exist in a video game within the game, and the real version of that duo are also transported into the game around halfway through the story.</p><p>It's believed that Clone Alone was briefly online by mistake before being pulled down. The preserved copy is fully playable, but it's unclear why Clone Home wasn't released. The Golden Bolt believes it was over a possible legal dispute between Sony and Handheld Games, the developer of Going Mobile. He also notes that Clone Home was likely developed by JavaGround, rather than Handheld Games.</p><p>This isn't the only surprise that fans of the Ratchet &amp; Clank franchise had in 2025. Earlier this year, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart senior designer Grant Parker revealed that he placed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-dev-reveals-hidden-minigame-no-one-found/1100-6532404/" data-ref-id="1100-6532404">a hidden minigame in the title</a>. Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-pc-port-confirmed-out-in-july/1100-6514495/" data-ref-id="1100-6514495">Rift Apart was ported to PC in 2023</a>, there's no word on when or if another sequel will follow.</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6 is finally live and available around the globe, and it's clear that players were looking forward to it. Not just because the beta saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/">hundreds of thousands of players on Steam alone</a> (and likely millions when adding consoles to the mix), do nothing but play Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">during the beta period</a>, but because when it launched today, servers immediately hit capacity.</p>



<p>Players were immediately shuffled into a queue system, though thankfully, we've not seen reports of players having to wait a lengthy amount of time to jump in, and the concurrent player count on Steam soared beyond the beta, hitting a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">peak of 747,440 players per SteamDB</a> shortly after launch. At the time of this writing, it remains above 700K and has stayed there since hitting that peak.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6 SteamDB charts on launch day, October 10, 2025.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even with a queue system kicking in right away, the fact that players aren't waiting extraordinarily long seems to be thanks to the fact that EA and Battlefield Studios were prepared for this. Earlier today the studio warned that a queue system would be implemented to help keep things running smoothly, and so far, it seems to have worked.</p>

The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gaming-chair-elgato-herman-miller-embrace-elgato-2000634072</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/finally-a-gaming-chair-i-don%E2%80%99t-have-to-be-embarrassed-by.1322218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stuff for gamers tends to look…ridiculous. You’ve got all these sharp angles, and don’t get me started on the constant need to shove RBG LEDs into friggin’ everything. Well, in stark contrast to that trend,&nbsp; Elgato, makers of the Stream Deck, various capture cards, and other kit for streaming setups, has a new chair that looks almost too normal. And for a decent chair that’ll last you? It ain’t sitting at too terrible of a price.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798127/elgato-embrace-gaming-chair">As spotted by <i>The Verge</i></a>, Elgato’s new chair, the “Embrace,” comes in at $500 bucks and will be shipping this holiday season. It comes with all the design elements that make gaming chairs decent to sit in. For hours. Without moving. Staring at the screen with little urge to get up beyond necessary biological impulses.</p>

 <p>As Tom Warren at <i>The Verge </i>states, the Embrace seems to be going up against Herman Miller’s “<a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/gaming-chairs/embody-gaming-chair/100160889.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100160889">Embody</a>” chair which, I’ll be honest, has a touch more personality with its color options. I’m really into the white and purple theme. Elegant, not overbearing. But wow, that thing costs almost $2,000. I’m sure it’ll save me back problems down the line, but if I’m spending that kinda money and it’s not for rent, it’s almost certainly for something completely irresponsible. Plus, do I want to be that girl who spent two grand on a chair?</p>

 <p>I’ve had the same rando-brand chair I bought on Amazon for like five years now. It cost $300, and has held up through my many fits of punching the arm rests while listening to Gojira or some other crazy shit. If I do decide upon the Embrace as my next gaming chair, I’ll be sure to let you know if you can beat the hell out of it. And how comfy it is.</p> <p>But seriously! Like even just a two-tone color option would have added at least some personality without making me feel like I need to hide it if I bring a guy over or something.</p>

                <p>One of the nice perks of EA Play and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (which includes EA Play) are 10-hour trials for new releases from EA. It's a good way to try a game before dropping money on buying it. But the free trials are not available for <em>every </em>EA game, including the just-launched Battlefield 6.</p><p>The game launched today, October 10, and has no free trial, a spokesperson for EA confirmed to GameSpot. This is somewhat unusual, as many EA games do offer 10-hour free trials. The last entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-will-have-a-10-hour-trial-for-game-pass-and-ea-play-subscribers/1100-6497656/" data-ref-id="1100-6497656">Battlefield 2042, had a free 10-hour trial for Game Pass and EA Play members, too.</a> But EA does not guarantee a free 10-hour trial for all games with EA Play. The fine print states that only "select" games get these trials.</p>

<p>From Z-A and beyond</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Not content with <em>only</em> releasing a new mainline game and tickets to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">upcoming pop-up store</a> in October, The Pokémon Company is bringing even more monster-catching content to the UK in the coming weeks with a new series of the <strong>Pokémon Horizons</strong> anime.</p>
<p>Part one of the third season, subtitled 'Rising Hope', will arrive on BBC iPlayer on <strong>27th October</strong>, with more episodes following in the future. Those in the US will have to wait a little longer before it makes its regional debut on Netflix on 6th January 2026.</p>
<p>Here's an official synopsis of what we can expect from this third season:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been one year since the events in Laqua left the Rising Volt Tacklers without a leader and a way forward, but a mysterious pink mist that harms Pokémon spurs Liko and Roy into action! Both Trainers have gained confidence and strength alongside their Pokémon, including Roy’s newest friend, a yellow Lucario capable of Mega Evolution. They’re joined by Dot, an intel-gathering expert, and Ult, a brash young Trainer who considers Roy his rival. Determined to rebuild the Rising Volt Tacklers and fulfill a promise made in Laqua, Liko, Roy, and friends are training harder than ever as they take on the Explorers and forge a new path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If all of that means nothing to you, then you can catch up on seasons one and two on iPlayer right now to work out what's going down with Liko, Roy and the gang.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> arrives before all that, with both the Switch 1 and Switch 2 versions launching next week on 16th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yōtei is undoubtedly the biggest PlayStation exclusive of 2025. Sure, there was also Death Stranding 2, but Kojima's franchise is quite a bit more niche, despite the Hollywood stars, compared to the mainstream appeal attained by Ghost of Yōtei's predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set new PS4 first-party sales records when it launched in 2020</a>.</p>



<p>It's early days still, but the new open-world action/adventure game developed by Sucker Punch Productions seems to be selling almost as quickly as the previous franchise entry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the first sales estimates</a>, despite an unfavorable comparison with the PS4 install base and the COVID-19-induced stay-at-home mandates. The game is also just as great as Tsushima. I dove deeply into my 60-hour experience with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Wccftech's official review</a>, which rated the game 8.8 out of 10. </p>



<p>That was all the more reason to be excited when we learned about the opportunity to interview the actor behind Lord Saito, the iconic main villain of Ghost of Yōtei and leader of the Yōtei Six: Feodor Chin. The American actor has a long track record with videogames (his credits in the industry started all the way with the original World of Warcraft) and was also featured as Lord Adachi in Ghost of Tsushima. Furthermore, Chin has appeared on recent TV shows like Secret Level, Love, Death &amp; Robots, and Marvel Zombies.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Feodor Chin (Photo credit: Diana Ragland)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First of all, Feodor, thank you for being here with us. I've noticed that you have done a lot of work for television as well, TV series and stuff like that, so I wanted to ask you if you'd like to tell us a bit about the differences in your work when you're voicing a character for a game compared to voicing a character for a TV show, for example.</strong></p>



<p>Well, I believe that, regardless of the medium, you know, the approach is always the same, how you approach a character. I think your job as an actor is to serve the writer and to serve the story, and so that's always going to be the same, but I think to me the major difference is that for television or film, the viewer is a largely passive kind of audience, but for video games, the player is an active participant. Because of that, for you as the actor, I think at times it means your performance, while still always grounded in reality, I think it can and even needs to be made dialed up a little bit, because you want to engage the player, and so that to me would be the major difference between acting for television and film and as opposed to a video.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so gaming characters need to be more intense, is that it?</strong></p>



<p>Maybe. I guess intensity might be one way to put it, but I think it's just maybe more actively engaged. Sometimes, you're actually instructing or commanding the player to do something, and so that requires a little more than you might ordinarily put in the delivery.</p>



<p><strong>Interesting. Are you a gamer?</strong></p>



<p>Definitely. I don't know if I'd call myself a gamer, but I do enjoy video games like just about anybody. I think it's mostly because I'm not great at them. You know, my hand-eye coordination has never been fantastic, but I certainly enjoy playing a game or two, but usually on easy difficulty. To me, it's supposed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience. I just don't understand why you would want to have frustration in your relaxing times, but yeah, I do enjoy playing video games for sure.</p>



<p><strong>Specifically regarding the Ghost series, I know that before Ghost of Yōtei, you were also in Ghost of Tsushima, right?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, that's right.</p>



<p><strong>Did you play either of these games?</strong></p>



<p>I did. Well, Sony was kind enough to give the cast a free download. If you recall, I think that Ghost of Tsushima really came out at maybe the perfect time. It was kind of right at the start of COVID-19, and so everyone was at home. I had nothing but time on my hands, and I must admit that for about a month, I made my wife a Tsushima widow, because I was just playing just all day long for about a month there until I finally finished it. I remember getting to the end and not wanting to kill Khotun Khan because I didn't want the game to end.</p>



<p>It was just a terrific game, and I'm not just saying that cause I was in it. I think it's actually just a really fun game and perfect for the kind of player that I am. Like I said, on easy mode, I just, you know, went around. I really enjoyed the stealth kills, like coming up behind somebody and just slitting their throat.</p>

<p><strong>Yeah, they're great games for sure. With Ghost of Yōtei, you'll have an extra motivation not to finish the game because then you'd have to kill yourself, right?</strong></p>



<p>That's right! *laughs*</p>



<p><strong>Seriously, though, compared to the first game where you played Lord Adachi, Lord Saito is obviously a very different character. Can you go into how you played these roles in the two games?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. Well, certainly with Lord Adachi, he had this great reputation of being the finest swordsman in all of Japan. He was presented as this real badass, and then, you know, no spoilers because it happens immediately, and it's been about five years, but yeah, he just gets killed immediately, and it may be in the most disgraceful way possible.</p>



<p>Certainly, the big difference is that Lord Saito lives for a while longer and has a lot more to do, that's for sure. Aside from that, it's always a great time to play a bad guy, the villain and final boss. As far as acting, you never want to judge a character. True villains never think of themselves as the bad guys. Their motivations and their actions are perfectly justified in their minds, and you just have to figure out what those are for you so you can play them honestly.</p>



<p><strong>For the whole game, Atsu is like, I need to kill Lord Saito, I have to kill this kind of demon that killed my family, but as you say, of course, from his perspective, he was just doing what was right after Atsu's father had left his retinue.</strong></p>



<p>Absolutely. I think they really are, Lord Saito and Atsu, kind of two sides of the same coin, because they have similar motivations. They're kind of motivated by revenge and so it's an interesting dichotomy between the two characters.</p>



<p><strong>During the final battle in Ghost of Yotei, </strong><strong>Lord Saito</strong> - <strong>you - even said something like, we are the same.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah.</p>



<p><strong>I guess the difference is that in the end, Atsu lets go of all that rage.</strong></p>



<p>She does, and I think that's an important lesson. You don't want to be consumed by your need for revenge.</p>



<p><strong>Well said. I also wanted to ask: what was the process for your work like? Did you work remotely or in a studio?</strong></p>



<p>No, that was all in the studio, certainly. We did the cinematics at the Santa Monica studio, a full motion capture session, which is always fun. You get in the suit and you have the props and whatnot, you get to run around. We didn't do any real sword fighting, but there was certainly a little bit of stage fighting kind of stuff, and that's always a good time. And then the video sessions, those were all done in the studio as well.</p>

<p><strong>Was it the same for Ghost of Tsushima before COVID?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, that was also all in person. I wasn't involved with the Ghost of Tsushima DLC (Iki Island). I think maybe that one might have been remote.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. I see that you also have credits for many other games, such as Overwatch 2 and others. Are you looking forward to working on more videogame characters in the future after Ghost of Yōtei?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, always. In particular, I've really grown to enjoy doing motion capture. It's certainly challenging at first, but I think now I really, really enjoy it. Motion capture stretches you as an actor, but yeah, I am always open to more games, especially now that they're so cinematic. They're the new movies, really.</p>



<p><strong>I just have a final question. I guess this is a bit more of a controversial topic, but also very interesting. What do you think about the usage of AI in your line of work? Can it be used somehow, or should it be banned outright?</strong></p>



<p>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings. I certainly don't know enough about the technology to say for certain, but to me, when it comes to games or movies or television or any kind of media, I think what audiences and what gamers want, what they are reacting to is this human connection that they feel either with the voice actors or other players, and that's something that I don't think AI could ever replace because it's other human beings looking for a human connection. That's what it's all about.</p>



<p><strong>AI can mimic a voice pretty well these days, but it definitely doesn't have the range of expressions.</strong></p>



<p>It doesn't have the humanity for sure, and I think that's what really affects people in these performances.</p>



<p><strong>Absolutely. Congratulations on your outstanding performance as Lord Saito and thank you for your time.</strong></p>
