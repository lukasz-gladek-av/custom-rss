<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156621/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>We’re making this a trend now, huh? It’s never long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> makes its way onto the scene. Such was the case back in 2017 with the launch of the original Switch, when a worldwide release of 2014’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/puyo_puyo_tetris">Puyo Puyo Tetris</a> (which released on Wii U and 3DS in Japan) served as one of the very first games available for Nintendo's then-fledgling hybrid.</p>
<p>It was arguably a ‘right place, right time’ moment for the crossover franchise, appealing to casual Tetris fans, puzzle game die-hards, and the massive influx of players just looking for more things to play on their shiny new system. Crucially, it helped reintroduce Puyo Puyo to the wider global market after a lengthy hiatus from localising the franchise.</p>
<p>Now, it seems Sega is aiming to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/puyo-puyo-tetris-2s">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</a> — an enhanced port of 2020’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a> — as one of the very first games available for Switch 2. Unfortunately, some bizarre choices within and surrounding this release prevent it from shining as bright as previous entries.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156619/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S takes the sequel that once more mashed the worlds of Puyo Puyo and Tetris and tosses in a handful of new features, many of which are designed to take advantage of Switch 2’s new functionality. That sounds like a pretty solid grab on paper, but a deeper dive into what’s <em>actually</em> new this time around leaves this re-release feeling unjustified.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/puyo_puyo_tetris_2">Switch review of Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>, Scully found it to be a worthy sequel crammed with ways to experience the titular two giants of the falling-block puzzle genre. That’s all still true in this version, which retains the original’s wealth of modes, unlockables, customisability options, and more. Whether it’s a simple alternating battle between Puyo Puyo and Tetris, a mode where miniscule Puyos drop from the sky, a fast-paced race to clear 40 rows in Tetris, or Skill Battles that completely change the game by introducing light RPG elements and abilities, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S does an excellent job keeping that simplistic core gameplay loop fresh and varied.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156613/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its replayability is bolstered by the Adventure Mode, which offers up a light-hearted story featuring the Puyo Puyo cast and a bunch of levels to chew through, as well as its multiplayer modes, which turn it into quite the entertaining party game for the right crowd.</p>
<p>In contrast to all of that juicy returning content, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S adds just a single new mode: Puyo Tetris Doubles. This introduces 2v2 battles to the mix, in which each team must control and drop two Puyos or Tetriminos simultaneously on the same board. Critically, your pieces have collision physics with one another, meaning you need to carefully coordinate with your partner to stay out of each other’s way and drop the pieces in the right places.</p>
<p>It’s a solid addition that can lead to some fun multiplayer chaos, as you desperately beg your friend to please, <em>please</em>, get their annoying square block out of the way so you can nail a T-spin in just the right place.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156617/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of that said, Puyo Tetris Doubles mode feels like a small addition to the greater scheme of the game. This sentiment only grows stronger when considering that the mode is limited to a select number of game styles (Versus, Party, and Fusion) and that you absolutely need other players for it to be any fun at all. While Puyo Tetris Doubles can be played with CPU partners and opponents, you’ll be banging your head against a wall trying to wordlessly coordinate with the AI. As such, single-player gamers are effectively left out in the cold when it comes to just about any substantial new content in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S.</p>
<p>Outside of the one new multiplayer-centric mode, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is pretty light on enhancements. The game certainly looks better on the new hardware, with a resolution bump to keep things looking nice and crisp, and it runs buttery smooth. This version also adds native GameShare and GameChat support, letting you share your copy of the game wirelessly and online with friends.</p>
<p>Then, there’s the incorporation of the Switch 2’s new camera and mouse mode abilities. Players can use a connected camera to superimpose their face on various parts of the board during gameplay — a fun, if ultimately superfluous, little addition.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156618/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I don’t have anything as kind to say about the new mouse controls, which feel genuinely awful and imprecise for Puyo Puyo and Tetris gameplay compared to traditional gamepad input. Your mileage may vary, but it feels distressingly reminiscent of the shoehorned touch and waggle gimmicks that plagued the DS and Wii days. The only saving grace in my eyes is that it’s purely an optional input method and can be viewed as a weird little novelty.</p>
<p>And, well…that’s it. Aside from a few other minute adjustments to the experience, the features outlined above are really the only new things available in Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. The game feels like it was just <em>slightly</em> updated and tweaked for release on Switch 2 compared to its Switch incarnation, which makes Sega’s release and pricing strategy for this title all the more baffling.</p>
<p>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S continues Sega’s frustrating trend of not offering any sort of upgrade path for its Switch 2 games. Just as with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</a>, you’ll need to purchase the Switch 2 version of the game at full price, even if you own a copy on Switch 1. There may be some reason to do that for the other aforementioned titles, which see substantial performance bumps on Switch 2, but that’s not the case for Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S. This new version is barely any different from the original release and offers <em>very</em> little to anyone who played Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 the first time around.</p>
<figure><a title="Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156614/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even beyond the egregious pricing strategy, dividing Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S from its non-enhanced counterpart feels like a misstep that could seriously affect the longevity of this game from a multiplayer perspective. There’s no crossplay between the titles, which means that the online experience and player base are even further segmented than before. In the days immediately after launch, I tried multiple times to find any online matches and failed to find an opponent every single time. That could potentially improve as more people dive into the Switch 2 ecosystem in the days ahead, but it feels like a dark omen for this version’s community and future.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>More than most, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S is a tough release to put a score on. Under no circumstances is it a bad game — in fact, it’s a pretty darn decent game that’s filled to the brim with modes and features to tide puzzle lovers over for the long haul. However, that has everything to do with the solid skeleton of the original Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 and barely anything to do with the minimal additions made to this Switch 2 re-release.</p>
<p>For newcomers to the series or those who missed its original release, there’s plenty of fun to be had here. For fans who already have the original version on Switch, I struggle to think of a greater waste of Switch 2 gaming funds than this.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-hinokami-chronicles-2-dancing-with-daki<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a <i>Demon Slayer</i>&nbsp;sicko like me, you absolutely can't wait for the next anime movie to drop. Until then, at least, we can look forward to&nbsp;<em>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2,&nbsp;</em>the video game adaptation of the manga and anime.</p>



<h2>Into the Entertainment District</h2>

<p>At this point in the story, we're entering the Entertainment District arc, and that's where my demo at Summer Game Fest 2025 began. The fight against Upper Moon 6, Daki, has already started, and we're thrown right into the action.</p>

<p>If you played the first&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="496fe62d-e74e-4fdd-9a7c-99a72525c475" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-hinokami-chronicles-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hinokami Chronicles</em></a>, you'll be right at home with this sequel. Though it's been several years since the previous game, combat does feel largely the same across the board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Essentially, if the combat clicked with you in the original, it should be just as fun in&nbsp;<em>Hinokami Chronicles 2</em>. It doesn't seem like many changes, if any at all, were made, but then again, did it need to? It's an action-packed, hack-and-slash type of game that doesn't aim to reinvent the wheel.</p>



<p>Combat is focused on one-on-one battles. I got to fight Daki while playing as Tanjiro. In the manga and anime, this is a compelling showdown, as Tanjiro faces his first Upper Moon.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Tanjiro is more than competent enough to stand on his own two feet while he buys time for his friends -- those being Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui, his three wives (yes, three), Inosuke, and of course, Zenitsu.</p>



<h2>Inosuke's Mad Dash</h2>

<p>After a brief battle with Daki, we switch perspectives to Inosuke. The fight with Inosuke takes place before the first one, weirdly enough, so we get to see Daki in her creepy ribbon form after Inosuke roots out her presense.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this sequence, mostly because Inosuke could barge through the brothel and break doors and other various items spread around the area. It was actually quite satisfying, and the feedback on the controller was great here.</p>



<p>The fight with Daki as Inosuke was also par for the course, but it was cool to see her as a ribbon and also fight with Zenitsu and Tengen's wives as support.</p>

<p>The final fight of my demo, that being against a powered up Daki, was more frantic than I imagined. The previous two battles were pretty simple, but Daki was much more aggressive here.&nbsp;A SEGA representative told me this was by design. It makes sense, too; the stakes of the story are much higher now and&nbsp;<em>Demon Slayer</em>&nbsp;is firing all cylinders now that Tanjiro has to take down the Upper Six.&nbsp;</p>





<p>I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the Entertainment District arc (one of the best in the manga and anime), but I'm lukewarm on the others. The following two arcs are my least favorite of the entire series, and I don't know if having it in game form will make those any better.</p>

<p>Swordsmith Village arc is action-packed, sure, but the villains aren't as interesting, and the two Hashira making an appearance don't stack up to the previous ones we've seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's not at all developer CyberConnect2's fault, and I'll be interested in knowing how they make the slower, more mundane moments of the follow arcs into something more exciting. Time will tell, as&nbsp;<em>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2&nbsp;</em>launches this year on August 5.</p>

<p>Or, if that simply wasn't on the table, free for the first year. Or free with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. It's painfully obvious to everybody but Nintendo that paywalling this specific software further behind the already-pricey console is a mistake.</p>
<p>And it's a real shame that more people won't experience it, because it makes you feel good about your sizeable investment in the hardware. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> is a peaceful, in-depth exploration of the system, taking you around and inside the device, its controllers, and peripherals (some sold separately - more on that later), and highlighting its various features and novelties. This is the platform holder celebrating and deep-diving into its tech in a way that feels both unusual but also <em>very</em> Nintendo.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156644/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, the granular tech focus here is a necessity. Switch 2, by its nature, is an iteration on a theme, so if you're going to charge a hefty sum for something superficially 'the same but bigger', what better way than to highlight <em>every single</em> upgrade in a fun, demo-filled game of hide-and-seek that breaks it all down?</p>
<p>And the devs really do break it <em>all</em> down. You'll be running around capacitors, over circuit boards, batteries, and myriad chips and components that appear to be modelled extremely faithfully. This is Nintendo tearing down its hardware virtually so you don't have to, and being remarkably frank in some regards. There are various examples of 'we did our best' while discussing the challenges faced with, for instance, dispersing heat and optimising battery longevity. There's no console-wars chest-beating here; it's all very self-effacing. It's essentially an Iwata Asks/Ask the Developer interview in game form.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156646/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game itself takes the form of an explorative, isometric walking-sim affair. You control a person jogging (or running if you hold down 'B') around an oversized Switch 2 and accessories propped up and exhibited across an enormous park. Or are you tiny and the Switch normal-sized? It's never made clear, but hot Welcome Tour lore aside, you run around the virtual gear while the real-life gear throws novel audio-visual and haptic feedback at you. It's a particularly great showcase for HD rumble 2 - I only hope that devs take the time to implement it properly in other games.</p>
<p>Stamp Rally plinths pop up when you approach components and gate progress between areas. So, to get to the main console, you have to locate 18 stamps on the left Joy-Con, and so on. Simple enough, though some less obvious ones do present a challenge, usually when the button or port is on the inaccessible underside and you're hunting for the plinth.</p>
<p>Then there are the minigames, with multiple variations of the same game grouped on little exhibits across the hardware. It's all very 'Switch 2 Experience' for anybody who attended those pre-launch events. There are over 50 games and beating them earns medals to unlock harder variants.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156645/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some, naturally, are better than others. The Mouse Mode ones are <em>generally</em> more challenging and/or frustrating. Removing stains with a paint scraper was much harder on my leg or the arm of the sofa than on a table (where I donned the Joy-Con straps and got the medals first try); my lap or a cushion worked fine with other games, though. If you do hit a wall with one, just move on. You're able to instantly warp to anything you've visited by hitting 'X' to bring up the menu and selecting it, a real godsend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, you'll be hunting floating pixels, shooting balloons, colouring within the lines, guessing the angle of the kickstand - all sorts. Only one minigame — Breaststroke: Floaty Frustration — is outright bad (it lives up to its name), and while there's nothing here you're likely to fire up again once you've completed the game, they're all effective at demonstrating the possibilities of your shiny new console.</p>
<p>On that theme, and beyond the realm of proper 'games', 14 tech demos highlight neat functions and features, letting you test the noise reduction qualities of the built-in microphone, make the Joy-Con emit sound effects, and plenty more. The 3D Sound demo with the helicopter is a particular highlight, but they're all fun to mess around with. My kids absolutely loved sawing logs, shaking maracas, and hearing themselves with robot voices. The HDR demo didn't wow me, but these are cool toys to play with. Who wouldn't want to rev a motorbike with a Joy-Con?</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156641/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond <em>that</em>, dozens of info desks contain multiple-choice quizzes testing your knowledge of nearby Insight boards. It's here where Nintendo goes into detail about the hows and whys of design, and in all honesty, it's incredibly interesting for anybody with a penchant for gaming hardware.</p>
<p>The light-hearted quiz questions aren't taxing if you're paying any attention whatsoever to the slides, though it's fun to imagine a world where 'Love' or 'Glue' hold the Joy-Con on. They do get progressively more challenging as you journey inside the console, but there's typically one comedy answer, two vague possibilities, and the obvious correct one. Get a question wrong and the relevant Insight board is flagged, so you can quickly swot up and repeat.</p>
<p>Burning through Insights for review isn't the best way to digest them, and they got repetitive towards the end. One named 'Games Use Electricity' isn't as blindingly obvious as it sounds, but the title made me guffaw. You're not obliged to do any of the quiz stuff, either, and along the way there's lost property to find, some charming NPC writing, cute moments as you skate across the screen, and a bunch of nostalgic nods to Nintendo history.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156633/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are also some smirk-worthy 'purely for reference' disclaimers when they show animations of the Joy-Con being wrenched from the console and other non-sanctioned actions, but Welcome Tour feels like Nintendo being refreshingly open and surprisingly confident. I can't imagine any other platform holder going into this sort of forensic detail for fear of a red-ring-level embarrassment down the line. It might even help allay fears about another Joy-Con drift debacle this gen, as the new mechanisms feature very prominently here.</p>
<p>There's an assuredness in inviting this kind of scrutiny; an admirable pride in the work. "I can't believe they're showing us as much as they are," says one of the milling NPCs, and I can only agree. It's a quality product.</p>
<p>And a surprisingly lengthy one. Due to the weird 10-day delay before playtime data is shown on your profile, I can't say exactly how many hours I've spent opening everything and getting nearly all the medals, but it's got to be seven or eight (and at least one of those was spent on the nightmare dual-mouse UFO bullet hell/star collection minigame). There are 12 'areas' in all, going from the top of the left Joy-Con into the system itself via the dock, the Joy-Con grip and straps, and even peripherals that don't come with the system - specifically the Camera, the Pro Controller, and the Joy-Con wheels.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156639/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don't own those things? You can still earn 'fast-track medals' from them via a cute little SOS trick, so progress isn't gated behind them. However, access to a handful of minigames and demos <em>are</em> effectively blocked if you don't have the requisite gear (the Camera, a pad which has the 'GL'/'GR' buttons, and a 4K TV).</p>
<p>For me, it's nothing to get too upset about — there's so much else to be getting on with, and what's the alternative? Remove those experiences entirely? — but it's <em>another</em> straw on the camel's back if you're already irritated by the cost. It also highlights another unavoidable aspect of Welcome Tour: as well as being part instruction manual, part demo, it's also an ad for those lovely accessories you <em>didn't</em> pick up. Yet.</p>
<p>There's an undeniable allure to seeing pristine hardware at this resolution, too, without the skin cells and dust particles and pet hairs and assorted household detritus that attaches itself the moment you remove the packaging. Welcome Tour is deliciously, fetishistically sterile, with gorgeous specular highlights on the logos as you run across them, close-ups of glistening ports and shiny sticks. It tickles the same zones as Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/astro_bot">Astro Bot</a> in some ways, though this is much more of a museum piece.</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156635/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It does a fantastic job of highlighting the design chops and consideration that goes into every aspect of Nintendo's products, from the 0.05mm height adjustments to individual face buttons to the minuscule tab on a single foot of the dock that means it will slide (rather than topple over) if you accidentally yank it with a cable connected.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Welcome Tour is modestly priced ($9.99 / £7.99), too, despite the wider economic context surrounding Switch 2's launch and the general upset over pricing across the industry which makes charging for it feel like the last straw. For your buck, there's a surprising amount of bang, though.</p>
<p>So, one more time, then: <em>This 100% should have been a pack-in.</em> But the software itself? It's great.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Welcome Tour is a calming, surprisingly engaging hardware exhibition with a handful of cool minigames, a trove of interesting info, and some neat demos that showcase exactly what the little system can do. It makes you feel good about buying the thing, which makes the platform holder's decision <em>not</em> to bundle it with the console utterly baffling. Featuring expensive add-ons you might not own also won't impress anyone who's indignant that the company wants another 10 bucks for this.</p>
<p>That aside, it's an undeniably fine demonstration of Nintendo's thoughtful design approach. It's cute, it's fun, and it's a shame the whole pack-in argument overshadows the delightful software. Anyone interested in tech, design, or Nintendo in general should check it out immediately.</p></section>

<p>A teaser popped up prematurely on Focus Entertainment's Threads account before it was quickly deleted… if not quite quickly enough for someone to grab a copy of it first and post it to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1l5sfjf/a_plague_tale_spinoff_probably_leaked/">reddit</a>, of course.</p>

<p>As for what it shows? Well, not much. At just 15 seconds long, you can blink and see it, but it's officially called Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy. It appears to show what may well be a prequel based on Sophia.</p>
<p>It's slated to arrive in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series. It's possible it'll pop up again in this evening's Xbox Games Showcase. Just try and feign surprise.</p>

            <p>As part of IGN Live, Sandfall Interactive has unveiled the opening 10 minutes of an all-new documentary following the team as it developed and released Clair Obscur: 33 Expedition.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-premieres-the-first-10-minutes-of-the-games-documentary-at-ign-live-2025">exclusive clip</a> shows the documentary starts at the end, with Sandfall developers counting down the seconds to the moment its inaugural game went live. It then rewinds to the beginning, introducing us to the development team, the motion capture actors, and the story behind the game.</p>

<p>There is no release date as yet for the documentary, as it's currently a work-in-progress. However, the ten-minute taster offers a great insight into what to expect, including the revelation that that delightful moment between Monoco and Verso was entirely improvised.</p>
<p>Jennifer English (Maelle), Ben Starr (Verso), Shala Nyx (Sciel), Kirsty Rider (Lune), Rich Keeble (Monoco), and Maxence Cazorla (Esquie) also joined the IGN Live stage to talk about their work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>"We were all really excited," English said. "We weren't as stressed as the developers were, but I was dead nervous about it because we put all our love and heart into it and hope it pays off - and thankfully it did."</p>
<p>"You can do whatever you do in the studio, but then it stops being yours. You don't know what it’s going to become," Ben Starr added. "There are so many circumstances that go into the release of a game, and I felt, personally, there was a huge amount of pressure. It's a game I wanted to be good for the team because they had put so much work into it, and because we didn't just come into it, we were an additional part of it."</p>
<p>Sciel actor Shala Nyx also explained how their character has resonated so deeply with players.</p>
<p>"It's so cinematic. It's just so wonderful to be the voice and body of a character that is so rich and has so much emotional depth," Nyx said.</p>
<p>"I've had so many people reach out to me about how my character has helped them with their depression and helped them with their mental health. It's so ephemeral and every moment is so rich, and that's a testament to the writing."</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur review</a>.</p>
<p>On its first day, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 sold 500,000 copies. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">Within three days, the game had hit a million copies sold</a>. Then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">33 days after its release on 28th May, the game has reached 3.3 million sales across PC and console</a>. "We couldn't make that up," said a social post sharing the news.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Miyamoto doesn't even get a "special thanks"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fans Have Noticed Someone's Name Is Missing From Mario Kart World's Credits 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0139ff4fd04ab/fans-have-noticed-someones-name-is-missing-from-mario-kart-worlds-credits-1.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the most famous video game designers the world has ever seen and is responsible for giving us classic franchises such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-super-mario-games-of-all-time">Super Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-zelda-games-of-all-time">Zelda</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-pikmin-games">Pikmin</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-star-fox-games-of-all-time">Star Fox</a>.</p>
<p>One of his most critically and commercially successful creations is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">Mario Kart</a>, a series that has sold in excess of 189 million copies worldwide since its inception in 1992 with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a>.</p>
<p>However, it has been noted that his name is completely absent from the credits for the latest entry in the franchise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>:</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Miyamoto hasn't been credited in a Mario Kart game—his name is also missing from the smartphone release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>—but this is the first mainline instalment which doesn't appear to have had any input from the legendary designer.</p>
<p>You may recall that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-shigeru-miyamoto-apparently-isnt-credited-in-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">his name didn't feature</a> in last year's Zelda game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, either.</p>
<p>On one level, this isn't all that surprising; Miyamoto has shifted into an advisory role with a wider scope in recent years, as befits his senior standing within Nintendo. However, it does feel odd not to see his name appear in the credits, even as a "special thanks".</p>
<p>Were you expecting to see Miyamoto's name in the game's credits? Let us know with a comment below. And if you're interested in seeing those credits for yourself (as seen when you complete the Special Cup), check out this video:</p>

		<p>Myrkur Games has revealed its debut title Echoes of the End, which is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Set in the world of Aema, players take on the role Ryn who is a described as vestige that has access to magical abilities and is a warrior. In this story, she is on a mission to save her brother from an empire on the edge of war.</p>
<p><iframe title="Echoes of the End - Announcement Trailer [PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gR3A76lA_7w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer of Echoes of the End, Ryn is not alone in her adventure. She is joined by a scholar named Abram Finlay who is chronicling the journey while also giving Ryn a helping hand from time to time. As they journey across Aema they could unearth a conspiracy that would upend the world order. The trailer shows that there are Wards that seem to protect the land, but they are at risk of being destroyed. There is some gameplay which shows Ryn using her powers in combat along with a sword to fight soldiers, monsters, animals, and bosses that all pose a threat to her mission and to Abram.</p>
<p>A confirmed release date for Echoes of the End is yet to be announced.</p>

Over the past few days, the Xbox PC app has started showing Xbox console games inside the library. While you can’t install games like the original <em>Alan Wake</em> for Xbox 360, it shows up if you own it as part of the “My PC Games” list inside the Xbox PC app.</p><p>I don’t believe this is a simple bug, but more the result of Microsoft’s plans to more closely combine its Xbox and Windows stores. I wrote about this effort in March, <a href="http://unify Windows and Xbox towards a universal library of Xbox and PC games">when I revealed in <em>Notepad</em></a> that Microsoft is working with Asus on a Project Kennan handheld. “It’s part of a larger effort from Microsoft to unify Windows and Xbox towards a universal library of Xbox and PC games,” I wrote at the time.</p><p>This effort also involves enabling Steam and Epic Games Store games to be visible in the Xbox PC app library. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">Microsoft accidentally revealed mockup images</a> showing Steam games in the Xbox PC library earlier this year, and at the time sources familiar with the company’s plans told me Microsoft was working on an Xbox app update that will show every game you have installed on your PC.</p><p>Microsoft has also been working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">making the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a> over the past year, and it has recently started referring to its Xbox PC app as simply “Xbox PC.” This new branding first showed up in Microsoft’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">announcement</a> of <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, and a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETCpWo0A0i0">gameplay trailer</a> for <em>MIO: Memories In Orbit</em> also shows off the Xbox PC branding and logo that we’re going to see whenever Microsoft wants to let PC players know the game is available on its Microsoft Store.</p><div><p>Microsoft is also combining ‘<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the best of Xbox and Windows together</a>’ for handhelds, in changes that we should see later this year. Microsoft is in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/676258/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-steamos-notepad">desperate need of a response to SteamOS</a>, particularly as PC makers like Lenovo are starting to put SteamOS on their own handheld gaming PCs.</p></div><p>All of these Xbox PC changes and the handheld work means we’re probably close to seeing exactly how Microsoft lists additional games in the Xbox PC app. The big question will be whether Xbox console games will actually be playable on PC, and Microsoft may need to leverage its cloud infrastructure for that unless it has an emulation breakthrough ready to finally make the dream of playing old Xbox games on PC a reality.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A non-Switch 2 game?!? Variety, my friends, is the spice of Nintendo Life...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>A goofy life sim set in a physics-based sandbox, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wobbly_life">Wobbly Life</a> by RubberBandGames is an entertaining amalgam of open-world adventure and indie party games. With its cartoonish tone and compulsive gameplay, it's clearly targeting younger players, but buckets of charm make it just as enjoyable for adults.</p>
<p>You play as a hapless Wobbler who is unceremoniously kicked out of their home by Grandma. Told to stop playing video games, get a job, and buy a house, your character is nothing if not relatable.</p>
<p>The whole island and its surrounding biomes are open to you from the beginning. Navigating this vast space and becoming a successful Wobbler forms the core loop of the game's World mode.</p>
<p>To earn enough money to become a homeowner and appease your overbearing grandma, you'll need to take on a variety of part-time jobs scattered across the map. Some of these are simple, like picking up taxi fares within a generous time limit. Others are a calculated test of patience and precision.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156455/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You start small, by picking up odd jobs around the neighbourhood. The first of these tasks is to fetch jelly from the supermarket and deliver it to a neighbour. Simple enough, right? The challenge becomes apparent when you realise that every inhabitant on this island is a stiff, humanoid blob. Lugging that tutorial jelly around quickly becomes a lesson in the game’s unpredictable movement.</p>
<p>Your Wobbler animates with the same awkward, floppy physics as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a> contestant, which makes even mounting a small pavement something that needs prior calculation. Every task on Wobbly Island is subject to the janky hobble of your character and the erratic motion of the objects they manipulate.</p>
<p>Each of your Wobbler’s arms is controlled by the left and right triggers. Holding in the triggers will thrust an appendage out and stick onto any surface they make contact with. Most tasks require you to grab and transport items to specific locations, demanding careful coordination. Certain jobs, such as the hamburger chef, introduce an extra layer of challenge by requiring quick, responsive management of your grip and the momentum of ingredients.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/5021/embed @ 1749376800 -->
<p>It takes some getting used to, and much of the game’s comedy stems from fumbling through this process. Wobbler arms stick to any surface, resulting in awkward accidents, like trying to pick up a well-caught fish, only to realise you're fused to the floor.</p>
<p>While the game is perfectly playable solo, most of its mechanics and minigames are clearly designed to be tackled as part of a group. Many of the part-time jobs involve driving around with some form of cargo, from pizzas to nuclear waste. Doing this alone is often laborious, and sometimes outright impossible. Earning money and taking on jobs with others transforms irritation into entertainment.</p>
<p>The multi-stage nature of the minigames demands self-organisation and stress management, much like in popular friendship destroyers <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/overcooked_all_you_can_eat">Overcooked</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/moving_out">Moving Out</a>. There's splitscreen local co-op for up to four players and all modes can be played online, so there’s plenty of ways to live that wobbly life together.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156457/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing alongside others makes earning money a breeze. If you all work together, some of the more difficult jobs — like firefighter or paramedic — get a lot easier to manage. It's a shame that fishing is the best money earner in the early game, because it's also the most sedate and requires little cooperation.</p>
<p>Outside of the impressive open world, which is jam-packed with secrets and activities — not least the endless clothing combos and pets — there's an arcade that pits Wobblers against each other in three competitive modes. Hide and Seek is self-explanatory, while Trash Zone has Wobblers competing to throw garbage into a compactor. The best arcade title is Wobble Run, which is a thinly veiled copy of Fall Guys. These modes are a worthy distraction when you get tired of the Island rat race.</p>
<p>Capping off the arcade suite is Sandbox mode, which places Wobblers in an open arena with the freedom to experiment with the game's assets. The near-endless possibilities offered here should vastly increase the longevity of this game beyond its other modes.</p>
<figure><a title="Wobbly Life Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156448/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One small caveat emerges when playing with a full local party: Joy-Con control. Wrestling with the deliberately stiff and erratic physics on the smaller controller is a physically demanding experience. Little ones will be fine, but adults with full-sized appendages should expect some cramp.</p>
<p>Other than that small physical niggle, Wobbly Life is lighthearted fun for all ages. There is so much to do in the open world, including a bonkers story mode and a wealth of customisation options. Pile on a bunch of other ways to play and this is a generous package wrapped up in a silly bow.</p>
<p>It can be a bit of a slog when played solo, but this game is clearly designed from the ground up to be enjoyed with friends and family. Pro tip: If you're the type of player who gets tired of your bickering party, just hit the ragdoll button and go limp. Let them carry you for a change.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Wobbly Life isn't doing anything new with the physics-based party genre, but it offers tons of content and a great time for all ages. The arcade and sandbox modes will keep you coming back long after life on Wobbly Island gets boring.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We're back this Sunday afternoon to cover the summer Xbox Games Showcase live. The show begins at 6pm UK time (7pm CEST/ 1pm EDT/10am PDT) and our updates will appear automatically below. You can also leave comments and chat along with us while watching the stream. You know the drill.</p>
<p>What do we expect? Firstly, note that this is a combined showcase so the general Xbox part of the show will happen first before we move to an Outer Worlds 2-specific broadcast after. We don't know how long either part of the show will last.</p>
<p>Microsoft hasn't given us any indication of games, either, but we expect to see more of the delayed Fable 4 - maybe a detailed look at gameplay - as well as another look at last year's announced games Perfect Dark (the reboot) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>. I wonder whether we'll also finally see more of Rare's long-in-development - perhaps lost-in-development - fantastical forest game Everwild, which was originally announced in 2019. Microsoft went on the record earlier this year to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Everwild is still in development and getting the time it needs</a>.</p>
<p>Gears of War: E-Day will probably emerge like a burrowing locust swarm, at some point, and perhaps we'll see more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inxiles-clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-rpg-which-owes-a-lot-to-bioshock-infinite">inXile's BioShock-like Clockwork Revolution</a>. We may hear more about what Double Fine is up to, now it's owned by Microsoft, and - whisper it - there's talk Bethesda might drop the big one, Elder Scrolls 6. Work a Halo announcement in there from 343 and this could be a big show.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> kicked off last week with a State of Play broadcast from Sony, then springboarded on Friday with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-june-2025-everything-announced">the Opening Showcase</a>, which brought a ninth Resident Evil game, among other things. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wholesome-direct-2025-everything-announced-at-the-cosy-indie-showcase">the Wholesome Direct</a>, which we rounded up for you, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/day-of-the-devs-2025-everything-announced-in-the-big-indie-showcase">Day of the Devs</a>, which we rounded up too. Look for a Future Game Show roundup soon.</p>
<p>See you at 6pm?</p><figure>

Hello and happy Sunday to everyone. We could be in for an exciting show later on. What are you hoping to see?
</p>
<p>
I wonder if there'll be any disruption to the show because of the protests taking place in downtown LA. The National Guard are expected to arrive there at some point. Chris Tapsell is there for us and says things are getting a bit weird. Fingers crossed he's okay.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes-dreamcast">Last week</a>, we hopped over to the Dreamcast and took a look at three different covers for <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/marvel_vs_capcom_2_new_age_of_heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a>. While there was a decent spread of votes, it was the Japanese variant that walked away with the win, taking 55% of the vote and leaving North America and Europe with the remaining 31% and 14%, respectively.</p>
<p>We wanted to do something vaguely related to the Switch 2-shaped elephant in the room this time, but we've covered just about every launch title in previous Brawls. Then it hit us. A Nintendo console launching with a <strong>Street Fighter</strong> game?

<p>Sure, some of you might be tucking into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on Switch 2 this weekend, but we're thinking about the <em>last time</em> the series graced a Nintendo launch line-up as we take a look at the 3DS' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Europe and North America opted for very similar designs on this one, so it's a good old-fashioned face-off against the Japanese variant. Let's meet the fighters, shall we?</p>

<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America / Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/99a6e64f48892/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12890-super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition">Capcom / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The North American / European design is pretty badass, we'll admit. Ryu takes centre stage, naturally, but we like how the rest of the roster extends out behind him, each reimagined in an almost hand-sketched art style. The sepia tones are throwing us off a little bit, but we're suckers for a giant floating head in the sky, and this design has three of 'em!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6b989477c851/super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/12890-super-street-fighter-iv-3d-edition">Capcom / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese artwork goes for something slightly different. The hand-drawn aesthetic has been dialled up a couple of notches, though the previous roster has been replaced with close-ups of Ryu, Chun-Li and Akuma, while Juri and Guile loom in the background. It's a little less cohesive than the last design, but we like the action poses.</p>

			<p>During the Future Game Show stream, Owlcat Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-kingmaker-review-carving-your-own-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-depth-beyond-all-measure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>) delivered the surprise announcement of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn. This is going to be the studio's first stab at third-person action RPG, and it takes place in the beloved sci-fi universe created by Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck.</p>
<p>This is a story-driven sci-fi action RPG in which you play a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and caught up in a conspiracy that spans the entire solar system and is beyond your control, the player must adapt and survive by taking command of the most advanced ship in the solar system.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn lets players create and customize their character, who can be an Earther, a Martian, or a Belter. They'll then lead a crew of specialists against escalating threats, political pressure, and a relentless enemy. Owlcat promises that every decision will matter.</p>
<p>The player's companions are more than just mission assets: they are individuals with their own histories and allegiances. Some chase redemption, while others hide their truths. Over time, relationships with them will flourish or deteriorate depending on the player's choices and leadership style.</p>
<p>Combat is based on cover-focused gunplay and abilities. Two companions accompany the player on missions, while others will provide support from a distance by disabling systems or drawing the enemies' attention. The player can issue real-time commands to adapt quickly to survive the myriad threats.</p>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will allow fans to visit iconic locations from the books and TV show, such as Ganymede, Ceres, Mars, and Luna. They'll walk through ruined habitats and political strongholds mired in unease and tension. Talking to the locals can help uncover secrets. Owlcat also teased that there may be familiar faces or voices, hinting at some of the main cast from the original story making an appearance.</p>

		<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is the RPG rendition of the hit The Expanse TV and book series that we’ve all been waiting for. Coming from Owlcat Games, this is a story-driven RPG with third person tactical action gameplay that… well, the comparisons with Mass Effect are inevitable, aren’t they?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Best known for their CRPGs <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/21/pathfinder-kingmaker-definitive-edition-review/">Pathfinder: Kingmaker</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/01/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-beta-brings-crpg-goodness-to-the-grimdark-future/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>, Owlcat is shifting gears for their adaptation of The Expanse. While the first three quarters of the announcement trailer are a lavishly rendered cinematic, the final section shows snippets of pre-alpha gameplay to give an indication of what to expect.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting:</p>

<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series. You can choose to be from Earth and Mars, or be a Belter. You will need to use different skills in combat and outside of it. In combat, the action will be that of a third person shooter but with tactical elements as you will need to use tactical items and the skills of your crew to get the upper hand. The crew will be incredibly important to the story and the way events can unfold. Each person you pick up has their own goals, motivations, and history to unpick, which you may discover while living together on the ship, which is called Gemini. Uncovering the layers of your crew and the secrets of the wider Expanse universe, and by doing so the paths that open to you can and will change.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that The Expanse has been adapted to video games – that would be the 2023 Telltale game – but it is a fitting return to the sci-fi world’s roots. Ty Franck – one half of the writing duo behind the pen-name James S.A. Corey – famously conceived of the setting first as a setting for an MMORPG and then a tabletop RPG, running a test game with a group of friends that eventually became the basis for the first novel’s story. It’s always nice when things come right back around, isn’t it?</p>
<p>There are four versions of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn including the standard edition, the deluxe edition, the Miller’s Pack, and the Collector’s edition. What is worth noting is that the game will not be getting a physical release. The standard edition is priced at $49.99 which includes the game, an early adopter item and a Discord role.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition ($59.99) – </strong>All standard edition items plus name in credits, Miller’s OPA Heavy armour, and UN Spec Ops assault rifle.</li>
<li><strong>Miller’s Pack ($79.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All standard and deluxe items plus digital Artbook, digital soundtrack, Hall of Fame, Miller’s Casual outfit, Miller’s revolver, exclusive beta access.</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Edition ($249.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All the items from the other editions plus a physical Gemini ship model, a physical Gemini medallion, printed artbook, three embroidered patches, and stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

<figure><a title="Splatoon 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bae9f7be2982/splatoon-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has gone to the extent of providing a series of free upgrades for select Switch titles on the Switch 2, and it's even rolled out updates for other first-party games, but it seems one other title might need a look.</p>
<p>According to reports, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> community has discovered a new bug in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> on Switch 2 – allowing squid kids to "squid roll" on "any surface, regardless of if it is inked in your colour". This was originally shared by a user known as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/diolass.bsky.social/post/3lqyctc7ylk2e">'Diolass' on Bluesky</a>, who described it as "game-breaking" on the competitive front.</p><p><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12euqklsg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3qjATCE2dk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>While it's not clear why exactly this is happening, dataminer 'OatmealDome' speculates it "might be an issue with Switch 1 GPU emulation/translation since Splatoon games have had issues with ink detection in unofficial emulators due to bugs in their GPU emulation".</p>
<p>Switch 2 backward compatibility obviously still has some issues, with Nintendo officially releasing a list of games with issues and titles in the process of being fixed. Even some apps like YouTube aren't available at launch.</p>
<p>If we hear about any updates or patches for Splatoon 3 on the Switch 2, we'll let you know. How are you finding this series on Nintendo's new system so far? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>Retro game collections are all the rage nowadays and following in the footsteps of classic mascots like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy</a> are now Joe and Mac.</p>
<p>This new package, officially titled <strong>Joe &amp; Mac Retro Collection</strong>, is slightly different as it's a Kickstarter project scheduled to go live on <strong>10th June</strong> (aka next week) and is expected to release later this year digitally on multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>It will contain the following three 16-bit Super Nintendo releases from Data East:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac">Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Ninja</em> (<em>ジョーとマック 戦え原始人</em>) is a Run &amp; Gun platformer that follows the titular Joe &amp; Mac as they fight through 12 hellish levels using prehistoric (but not just) tools and weapons. While the game was censored when it came out in the West, the Retro Collection also includes the original Japanese version!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/congos_caper">Congo's Caper</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Congo's Caper</em> (<em>戦え原始人2 ルーキーの冒険</em>) is a side-scrolling Action platformer centered around Congo, a half-human, half-monkey boy looking to rescue his girlfriend from a demon through 35 varied levels."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/joe_and_mac_2_lost_in_the_tropics">Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Joe &amp; Mac: Lost in the Tropics</em> (<em>ジョーアンドマック戦え原始人3主役はやっぱり</em>) adds a light roleplaying aspect to the series. While the goal is still to defeat cavemen and dinosaurs, players can court and wed their Stone Age girlfriend, and even have a child with her!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, this collection is comprised of games released here in the West in the early 90s (1991 - 1995) as well as the "uncensored" Japanese versions.</p>
<p>There'll also be "multiple new features" including quality-of-life improvements like the ability to rewind gameplay, save states, customisable aspect ratios, a CRT filter, local co-op for Joe &amp; Mac 1 and 2, and "cool new visuals and merchandise" to go with this Kickstarter.</p>
<p>This campaign is led by G-Mode, Red Art Games and their "award-winning internal studio" Red Art Studios. If you're curious to revisit this prehistoric franchise there are also multiple options on the Switch, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/snes/joe_and_mac">Nintendo's Switch Online Classics</a> game library.</p>

The future of Xbox is uncertain, but the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, scheduled for Sunday, June 8, should give us an idea of what's coming soon from Microsoft's first-party studios and its partners.</p><p>The showcase, which streams a couple days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>, will have a Direct presentation devoted to Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming RPG The Outer Worlds 2 immediately following it. Previous Xbox summer showcases in 2023 and 2024 have featured extended looks at Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, respectively, as closers.</p><h2>How to watch the Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExsVDr2CU40" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExsVDr2CU40" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>You can stream the Xbox Games Showcase and the following Direct for The Outer Worlds 2 on GameSpot's YouTube, as well as the official Xbox </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a><span> pages. Bethesda is also hosting the presentation on its </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/Bethesda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span> and </span><a href="http://twitch.tv/Bethesda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a><span> channels, as is Obsidian Entertainment on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/ObsidianEnt" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span>.

The Outer Worlds 2 Direct starts immediately after the showcase concludes. Microsoft has not specified the duration of the presentation, but previous Xbox showcases have typically lasted around an hour, followed by a 30- to 45-minute Direct for a featured game.</p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>1 PM ET</li><li>6 PM BST</li><li>3 AM AET (June 9)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Besides The Outer Worlds 2, the Xbox team hasn't explicitly mentioned any other titles that will appear in the showcase. However, the studios under the Microsoft Gaming umbrella have several anticipated titles in development that we are aware of, which we could see this year.</p><p>Previous showcases have given us peeks at Gears of War: E-Day and a Perfect Dark reboot, and this showcase would be a perfect opportunity to reveal launch dates for both. And while the new Fable game from Playground Games was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">pushed back to 2026</a>, the showcase could still provide us with some new gameplay footage.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-soon/1100-6531706/" data-ref-id="1100-6531706">getting a free update this summer</a>, so it's also possible that studio Ninja Theory will detail when it drops and what's included. The highly acclaimed Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is also getting story DLC this year, titled The Order of Giants, so it would be unsurprising to see a trailer and release date for it at this showcase.</p><p>On the Activision Blizzard side, there still hasn't been an official announcement on what this year's Call of Duty game will be, though it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">rumored to be a new Black Ops game</a> set in the future--a reveal could come at the showcase.</p>

"So, when brainstorming what we could do to make that really fun and exciting, we knew it would be great to go to some of the Sega IP worlds, but we also wanted to go to other IP worlds and really surprise people with that second lap. As we got to thinking about what worlds be fun to explore, we really thought Minecraft and its characters could be very fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has a very interesting three-lap formula thats starts with a pretty standard first lap. However, the racer in first place will then get to pick a new world everyone will race through via Travel Rings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The three Lap formula is really good for racers," Iizuka said. "It's really easy to understand, and we wanted to make things new and fresh so you're not just racing around the same place over and over again. And that was where the idea of the Travel Ring formed, which is to bring you somewhere new and unknown in that second lap. That's not all, as we wanted to keep the surprise and the racing really fresh and fun, so we added in some surprises for the third lap too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We then shifted our conversation to items, and Iizuka shared that he loved that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is paying homage to Sonic Racing games with the addition of the Rocket Punch item and Team Sonic Racing with Wisp items, but he did admit that his favorite item in this new game is the Monster Truck power-up that "lets you turn your vehicle into a monster truck and just run over everyone in front of you."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot more to look forward to in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds when it is released on September 25, 2025, including the return of Sonic Riders' hoverboards, the ability for any character to ride in any vehicle, racing up to 12 players online, and even the most-welcome of features in cross-play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of different platforms, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. And yes, even though it may arrive a bit after, Switch 2 players will also soon be able to hit the road with the over 23 racers featured in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-the-first-preview">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds preview</a> and everything else you need to know about <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

<p>In case you're wondering if it will make a return, Nintendo has already flagged this in its backward compatibility tests, noting how the issue with YouTube is "being investigated".

<p>YouTube asks Switch 2 users to "stay tuned" for updates, so for now, you're going to have to go without this popular video app on your Switch 2.

This includes Niconico, ABEMA, Hulu, Crunchyroll and InkyPen.</p>
<p>YouTube originally made its debut on the Switch eShop as a free app in 2018 and was also previously available for the Wii U, 3DS and Wii.</p>

<p>She was also the voice of Toad</p>

<figure><a title="Princess Peach: Showtime!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f4e42c306f2f9/princess-peach-showtime.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2023 marked a new era for the character, with the legendary voice actor Charles Martinet officially replaced by Kevin Afghani as Mario. It led to questions at the time about what other voices might be swapped out in the future.</p>
<p>While Peach's voice actor Samatha Kelly returned in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> the following year, it seems she's now been replaced after 18 years. This also includes her role as Toad. According to a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/">post on her Instagram</a> account, the voice actor found out yesterday after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> had been released.</p><p><figure data-videoid="MZ5pbSbsoJA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MZ5pbSbsoJA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed41ed20lkvyoh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>819k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ5pbSbsoJA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Samantha Kelly:</strong> "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I’m sad that it’s over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever. Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles. I’m grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love #princesspeach #toad"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Kelly was in the role for nearly two decades (and voiced various other Mario characters during this time) her departure has obviously been far less public than Charles Martinet, who was given an official send-off by Nintendo and crowed the title of "Mario Ambassador" – going on to promote the character at events.</p>
<p>In some other news, it appears Takashi Nagasako is also reportedly no longer voicing Donkey Kong after 20 years. You can see the latest Mario voice actor update in <a href="https://youtu.be/gyHq-wRvmds?si=-6M4eE5mwCU_csyB&amp;t=47">Mario Kart World's credits</a>.</p>

<p>"Mario Kart World is going to move a lot of Switch 2"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has the most graphical horsepower we've ever seen in the history of the Mario Kart series, and if you're eager to know the exact details about how this game is performing on the Switch 2, Digital Foundry has now delivered its tech review.</p>
<p>In the Switch 2's portable and tabletop mode, racers can expect a resolution of 1080p in handheld and 1440p in docked play:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"TV image quality is generally fine...holding up well on a 4K television set from a typical viewing distance. Docked mode also gets a touch of post-process image treatment to adjust the 1440p resolution...handheld mode fairs a bit better though, despite its lower pixel count. There's no anti-aliasing of any kind here, so the 1080p pixel count maps perfectly onto the 1080p Switch 2 display."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In contrast. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> was 1080p docked and 720p in portable mode. This results in World looking a "lot cleaner" even if it is still imperfect.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance, Digital Foundry found its experience to be "faultless" - with the frame rate locked at 60fps in the content tested, although photo mode drops the experience to 30fps. On the portable front, it's believed to run at the same frame rate as its docked counterpart.</p>
<p>The team also tested out the split screen as well as the GameChat functionality and found there weren't any performance concerns to the player experience. Regarding load times, these were also "fairly speedy" on the system's internal storage and comparable to a lot of current-generation titles.</p>
<p>HDR is also a nice addition and while it looks decent on TVs, don't expect much from the LCD panel in portable mode. All up, though, Digital Foundry sums up this next-generation entry as a "tremendous accomplishment" and is seriously impressed by the scope of what's been achieved here in terms of the massive open-world scale with very few compromises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Visually speaking, World offers some beautiful sights with key rendering advances over prior Mario Kart games, though a lot of rendering power has gone into making the open world work. It's really the incredible quality of Nintendo's artistry that stands out the most here...plus it packs good resolution and frame rate metrics in portable and docked play without the low internal resolutions that typify a lot of early Switch 2 software."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

It’s putting the power of building into the hands of players.” He said that a general thought for the approach to MindsEye included “pushing it towards people who want to make games.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked how they will curate these builds for other players to best find them, he explained “At launch, we will curate and pick the cream of the crop on a featured menu.” However, he added, “Eventually, we want players to choose what they want. We don’t want to dictate eventually how you earn money in the game or how you decide to play the game.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The building tool that will be used by players was also used by those making the game, with Benzies saying “A lot of what you see now was built within the tool. A lot of the ambience… Anything we could build using the tool we would.” He also noted, “Our next game, we’ll use it more.” At the same time, he promised “Every tool we use to build the game we’ll give to players so they can use.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Benzies indicated they had grand plans for MindsEye follow ups, stating “The MindsEye story, it’s a small part of a very big story that we intend to tell over however many years it takes.” He compared the larger world they were formulating to something like Star Wars, in that “We have many stories that take place over different time periods in the same universe.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game director also noted that “multiplayer will come at the end of this year and then we have a huge multiplayer world add on that will come next year.”  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Circling back to the user generated content, Benzies said he was excited to see what becomes of it because he thinks when you give the tools to the public, they’ll often find “More interesting ways to use the tools and almost hack the tools."</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> features the opening of the game, where you find some big fuzzy creatures and herd them out of the city toward the wilderness. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Herdling - Future Games Show &amp; Demo Trailer | PS5 Games" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inu5LAIyR0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The game calls them "Calicorns," which feels like a pretty good name: they are sort of calico-patterned, and they have big curly horns. They'll run from you or ignore you at first, but once you tame them, you can give them a name and add them to your herd. To steer them, you have to stand behind them and encourage them in the direction you want them to go. I found it a little clunky to get my head around--by continuously holding your controller trigger you can guide them toward a waypoint, but you have to move to the right to move them left, and vice versa. It works, though; the movement really feels like <em>herding</em>, as opposed to just having some companions who follow you around. You have to be aware of where you want the herd to go, not just where <em>you</em> want to go, and make sure you're not guiding them into rocks or dead ends. (I felt terrible when I did this.)</p><p>You can make your herd stop, walk slowly, or run, and they can also help you push things to progress and solve the demo's light puzzles. But mostly, you just encourage your furry guys along as the dismal city gives way to beautiful countryside and a mountain looms enticingly in the distance. You follow railroad tracks and cross streams, and your Calicorns make huffing sounds and wag their goat tails, and you can feed them fruit and pet them as all of you amble along. Even with the ability to run short distances, the demo feels slow in a lovely way; there's no real rushing your herd, and taking corners or moving them precisely requires you to scurry around them like a little human sheepdog so you can all keep heading toward those mountains.</p><p>I could imagine the pace grating a bit in the full game, but there were glimpses of a narrative, and mysterious objects I found, that make me suspect there'll be more to do than wander. The demo trailer shows your herd getting into some trouble with a giant bird; I will positively die if anything bad happens to my precious pettable children, even after spending only a half an hour with them. <em>Herdling</em> has a release date of this summer. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

Players must guide them to safety and will benefit from their help in puzzles. The trick will frequently be getting the calicorns from A to B without losing any to narrow passageways, train tracks, and other (sometimes deadly) obstacles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPaS2fmFEAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KPaS2fmFEAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">I played an early portion of the game at PAX West last year and have since been anticipating it hitting me like a ton of bricks when it arrives in full--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-love-for-incredibly-sad-games-has-me-very-excited-for-herdling/1100-6529824/">in a bittersweet way that I appreciate, mind you</a>. It's going to be sad, no doubt, but if there <em>is</em> a way to play it without losing any furry friends, you can bet I'll be trying to find it. It reminds me of Journey in that the objective is a mountain far off in the distance, and getting there is a road trip of beautiful music to listen to and sights to see.</p><p dir="ltr">You can download the free Herdling demo here. It's unclear if the demo will stay on Steam or disappear after a time, so if you're interested, don't hesitate. Herdling comes to Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5 this summer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/survival-horror-holstin-gets-new-trailer-and-2-hour-long-demo-revealed-during-future-games-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Sonka's psychological survival horror game Holstin just got a brand new trailer during the Future Games Show, along with the news that a new, 2-hour-long demo is available for players to try, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235430/Holstin/">right now</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous demos that have been available on Steam, which focused on specific mechanics in Holstin, this new demo is just the first two hours of the game for players to try, and get the full opening experience.</p>
<p>Holstin is a Resident Evil, Silent Hill-inspired horror game that uses 2XD rendering, allowing the team to "<em>seamlessly shift between multiple perspectives in real-time, lit, fully 3D pixel environments,</em>" according to a press release. Set in 1990s Poland, in a lakeside town called Jeziorne-Kolonia, you&nbsp;play as Tomasz, one of the last remaining locals who hasn't yet turned into an ooze-riddled creature.</p>
<p><iframe title="Holstin: Jeziorne-Kolonia Demo Shadow Drop | Summer Game Fest Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0O3ofy7-iFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Holstin is currently planned to be released on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and PC, with a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonkagames/holstin">Kickstarter campaign</a> planned to launch later in 2025 to help the development team get the game over the finish line.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of indie horror games break through into the main gaming conversation in the last few years, with games like Signalis, Crow Country, and Mouthwashing becoming indie-darlings for horror fans, all of them leaning into pixel art and a slightly more retro-look-and-feel to enhance the scares they have waiting for players.</p>
<p>Holstin looks like it could be the next game on that list, if the horror is able to deliver when it launches in the hopefully near future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gearbox-says-take-two-does-not-use-spyware-in-its-games-as-borderlands-review-bombing-continues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox Software has published a statement regarding the controversy surrounding changes to parent company Take-Two’s Terms of Service and fears that many Borderlands games now contain “spyware.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/49520/discussions/0/598528766295202095/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>directly on Steam</u></a>, where outcry has materialized in the form of review-bombing campaigns for all major Borderlands titles, the statement’s aim is to address concerns while “maintaining transparency and confidence with the community.” That means tackling two key talking points that have taken over the Borderlands fanbase for months, including fears of spyware and modding crackdowns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox makes its stance clear from the get-go: “Take-Two does not use spyware in its games.” While there are instances data will be collected, Gearbox doesn’t want players to fear that their private information is always up for grabs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two identifies these practices in its Privacy Policy to provide transparency to players and comply with its legal obligations,” Gearbox’s Steam statement says. “Take-Two collects this information to deliver its services to players, including to protect the game environment and player experience. You can read more about this in the Privacy Policy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement continues: “For example, player and device identifiers are collected in part to ensure the game is compatible with each player’s media, platform or website browser type. It allows us to better understand how players play games, and to personalize the user experience (like having usernames show up!). Account credentials are collected from users who choose to create accounts with Take-Two and its labels.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear if Gearbox’s explanation of Take-Two’s Terms of Service will be enough to calm those who took up arms after the agreement was altered back in February. Meanwhile, the studio’s explanation for its stance on the modding scene is fairly straightforward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Take-Two’s Terms of Service prohibit mods that allow users to gain an unfair advantage, negatively impact the ability of other users to enjoy the game as intended, or allow users to gain access to content that the user is not entitled to,” the statement clarifies. “We do this to protect the integrity of the game experience for all users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a direct response to fears that the modding community could face repercussions for any kind of modding activity, as Gearbox says Take-Two’s primary concern lies with cheaters who could dampen the experience for other players. The statement goes as far as to say Gearbox’s parent company “generally does not seek to take action against mods that are single-player only, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of its labels and third parties.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Uproar began around May of this year when fans caught wind that Take-Two had updated its terms of service, affecting many of its existing titles. Rumor that the company was preying on user data quickly caught fire, resulting in a movement that saw the Recent Reviews sections for Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands 3 tank into the “Mostly Negative” and “Overwhelmingly Negative” zones. While concerns subsided for the back half of May, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-2-goes-free-to-keep-on-steam-where-recent-eula-changes-have-sparked-a-mostly-negative-user-review-rating-across-the-entire-franchise"><u>fears kicked up once again when Borderlands 2 was made free to keep</u></a> (for a limited time) on June 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, the Borderlands series’ Recent Reviews on Steam remain firmly in the red. Meanwhile, Gearbox is working to deliver <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><u>Borderlands 4</u></a> this September. You can check out the latest news as well as a bit of gameplay by reading up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-state-of-play-april-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at its April 2025 State of Play presentation</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.
