<p>Including multiple fixes for Mega Dimension</p>

<figure data-uuid="c7c6076c5421f"><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7c6076c5421f/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has received its first update of the year today for the Switch and Switch 2. When you download it, your copy will be updated to Version 2.0.1.</p>
<p>It focuses on some adjustments for obtaining certain items (including an increase to the maximum number of Mega Shards) and also applies a whole bunch of fixes to previously confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_legends_z-a_mega_dimension">Mega Dimension</a> expansion issues.</p>
<p>Here's the rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A: Ver. 2.0.1 (Released January 21, 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Adjustments Applied for Obtaining Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When purchasing Berries from a food stall, you can now purchase multiple Berries at once.</li>
<li>After beginning the story of the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> DLC, you will be able purchase Berries from the clerk at Nouveau Café’s Truck No. 3.</li>
<li>The maximum number of Mega Shards you can carry has been increased from 999 to 9,999.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Applied for the Following Confirmed Issues Related to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> Content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When using moves in certain pockets of hyperspace, Pokémon may sometimes have faced a different direction from the intended target.</li>
<li>There were cases in which the weather remained sunny and did not change.</li>
<li>Shiny Pokémon obtained prior to the release of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Mega Dimension</em> may not have been registered to the Mega Evolution Pokédex, even if their Mega Stones were obtained after becoming available in the DLC.</li>
<li>During missions, images from unrelated scenes may occasionally have been displayed.</li>
<li>Players may not have been able to complete side mission 188 “Start Special Scanning!” even after earning the maximum number of survey points. (Players who are already experiencing this issue should be able to progress after entering and exiting hyperspace.)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>In case you missed it, the Mega Dimension expansion DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A released at the end of last year. Unfortunately, it didn't exactly live up to our expectations here at Nintendo Life, with repetitive Hyperspace dimensions and bland level design, but it's still hard to resist the lure of an expanded Pokédex.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a> remake will no longer see the light of day after the company announced a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">major organisational restructure</a> this week.</p>
<p>Alongside this news, the team working on the game has issued a message explaining the reason behind this "difficult decision". Although the project had "real potential", it seems the developer was unable to reach a certain "level of quality" that would meet player expectations.</p>
<p>And while Ubisoft is done with this particular project, it doesn't necessarily mean it's leaving the Prince of Persia universe or legacy behind. Here's the message via social media (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/01/prince-of-persia-remake-team-shares-final-message-following-games-cancellation">thanks for the heads up, Pure Xbox</a>):</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97frwxhko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the Prince of Persia community, we want to share this with you directly.</p>
<p>We've made the difficult decision to stop development on Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake. We know this is deeply disappointing. The game carries enormous meaning for fans and for the team who worked on it.</p>
<p>While the project had real potential, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn't want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia as a universe and legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we're stepping away from the franchise.</p>
<p>Thank you for your passion, patience, and love for Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>- The Prince of Persia Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we've already highlighted, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">new operating model will focus on five "creative houses"</a>, which are responsible for key franchises. CH4 will work on narrative adventures, and listed here is the Prince of Persia series, alongside IP such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyond_good_and_evil_20th_anniversary_edition">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a>.</p>
<p>So, the Prince of Persia series is back on ice for now, but it could still return at some point in the future, in some way or form. If you are eager to experience <em>something</em> in this series, you could always try out the excellent roguelite sidescroller <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, which was released on the eShop late last year.</p>
<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake was originally announced at an Ubisoft Forward event in 2020 and suffered multiple delays up until its cancellation.</p>

In their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/solinfonat.bsky.social/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z" rel="nofollow">post</a> they call the reorganization plan "disastrous announcements" citing the cost-cutting plan, cancellation of projects, and end of remote working. They also issued demands for what they want for the employees:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e7737b53e138805cdc82eae6fa08c9855">The end of the cost-cutting plan,</li><li data-list-item-id="e44ef8cd911974bea45cf873a69c267e9">Maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions,</li><li data-list-item-id="eec8f920725ed9fbd9fd1977e4b4738c7">Decent pay raises this year.</li></ul><p>They go onto state that this is merely their initial reaction, and that they are discussing other strikes, presumably for longer periods or at other Ubisoft studios in France.</p><blockquote><p>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games.</p></blockquote><p>This is the latest bit of difficulty for Ubisoft who is attempting to rebuild following some difficult fiscal periods. Only a couple days ago former <em>Assassin's Creed</em> boss Marc-Alexis Côté announced he was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-assassins-creed-boss-suing-ubisoft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="da42bb57-e4f1-4a65-91eb-9ce61dfcfee5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suing Ubisoft </a>for over $1.3m following his 'constructive dismissal', which caused him to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">leave the company in October of 2025</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That was tied to their organization into 'creative houses' which seems to have been partially done to get investment in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Vantage Studios</a>, which will be managing Ubisoft's largest three IPs: <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>.

<p>The co-lead designer of Starfield is sharing his thoughts on the problems the game encountered.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann, once known for his work on the Elder Scrolls series for Bethesda, was also co-lead designer of Starfield. Now, he’s discussing some of the difficulties the team faced during the production and development of Starfield and comparing them to his work on The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p>







<h2 id="h-kuhlmann-feels-starfield-failed-to-come-together-as-a-cohesive-game">Kuhlmann Feels Starfield Failed to Come Together as a Cohesive Game</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/skyrims-co-lead-designer-says-starfields-main-problem-is-that-it-never-fully-cohered-as-a-game-it-was-a-releasable-game-but-it-wasnt-the-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer</a>, Kurt Kuhlmann explained that, when the game released, he felt it was a good game and suitable for release, but not a great one. He mentions that within Bethesda, some were surprised the game failed to win over players.</p>



<p>One advantage Starfield had was its smoother launch compared to Fallout 76, and Kuhlmann says that difference is why Bethesda gave it so much development time.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When it came out, I thought it was a good game,” says Kuhlmann. “It was a releasable game, but it wasn’t the best.… </p>



<p>“We had tried to take this huge leap into this new genre with all these new systems and things … I don’t know that you should expect that if you jump into the space combat genre that you’re going to be better or as good as games that just do that, and have maybe been doing it for multiple iterations, right? Like, it was good enough. It wasn’t, like, embarrassing.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann also recently discussed his decision to leave Bethesda and his vision for the sixth Elder Scrolls game. Those interested can read his comments on how Star Wars would have influenced the game’s direction at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-loremaster-says-tes6-could-have-taken-star-wars-inspired-turn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-movie-remake-theater-release-january-2026-1851784778"><em>Return to Silent Hill,</em></a> a live-action film adaptation of Konami’s beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, hits theaters later this week. Early reviews for the horror flick are as scary as any monster from the games.</p> <p>First announced in 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-silent-hill-pyramid-head-first-look-1851482793"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> releases on January 23. It isn’t connected to the past two <em>Silent Hill</em> movies, even though it was directed by the first film’s Christophe Gans, and is instead a loose adaptation of the PS2-era survival horror classic<em> Silent Hill 2.</em> Marketing for this film has been minimal to say the least, partially because it seems the executives involved realized it wasn’t great back when it wrapped filming in 2023, and the movie is only seeing the light of day after that recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well. But after the delay and the lack of marketing, perhaps this is a very good horror film? Nope. Doesn’t seem like it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661969"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661969">©Rotten Tomatoes / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">As of January 21, there are 15 reviews for <em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> on critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. And the new movie has an abysmal seven percent Tomatometer score. For those not familiar with Rotten Tomatoes, that ain’t a great score. In fact, if this seven percent score holds, <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/worst-movies-of-all-time/"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will go down as one of the worst-reviewed movies ever</a>. Yikes.</p>

 <p>The general consensus from critics is that while parts of <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> look great, the film is a boring, sloppy, confusing, and (perhaps worst of all for the genre) not-very-scary movie about a main character that is hard to relate to and who seems more confused than terrified.</p>  <p>“This powerful survival horror story has been turned into an ugly, laughable adaptation that proves that maybe we should’ve never gone back to Silent Hill,” said Ross Bonaime over at <em>Collider</em>.</p>

 <p>“Christophe Gans’s film does away with all the psychosexual nuance of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>,” claims Justin Clark at <em>Slant Magazine.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I found the experience difficult to sit through and nonsensical from moment to moment, with its confounding story and shoddy CGI matched only by its lack of entertainment value,” said critic Brian Eggert.</p>

 <p>At the moment, there is only one non-rotten score, from Dominic Baez at the <em>Seattle Times</em>, and it doesn’t read like a loving endorsement of the movie. Instead, it seems like Baez found most of the movie bad, but enjoyed the ending. The end credits are apparently very “stylish.” When critics are praising your credits and not much else, that’s a bad sign.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Three classic Far Cry games are now officially playable at 60 frames per second, thanks to a new update on January 21.</p>



<p>A trailer for Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, which received a 60FPS update, had previously surfaced, and the team behind the game teased similar updates for Far Cry Primal and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. Now, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4MfNeJwzHOgosbS4JfJZ39/3-far-cry-classics-now-run-at-60fps-on-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft has announced that </a>updates enabling all three games to run at 60FPS are available on all current-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Additionally, all three games are heavily discounted on the PlayStation Store until February 4. Far Cry 3 and Far Cry Primal (Apex Edition) are 75% off, while Blood Dragon is 60% off.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Far Cry 3, Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry Primal will now run at 60 frames per second (FPS) on PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series X|S, thanks to a slate of free updates delivered today. As chaos erupts in the Rook Islands, the dystopian future of 2007, and across the Stone Age, the updated frame rate gives players a smoother experience and allows the beautiful (or desolate) locations to shine all the brighter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to being available for purchase, all three titles are playable on PC with Ubisoft+, on Xbox via Ubisoft+ Premium or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and on PlayStation through PlayStation Plus Premium or Extra.</p>

    <p><span>Wrestling star Kenny Omega revealed as motion capture actor.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Street Fighter 6 [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a></em> downloadable content character Alex will launch on March 17, <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,647 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> announced. <a title="Genres > Wrestling [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/wrestling">Wrestling</a> star Kenny Omega is the motion capture actor behind Alex’s signature moves. <span id="more-1020231"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>Alex kicked off his fighting career as the protagonist of <em>Street Fighter III: New Generation</em> in 1997. Since then, his brash disposition has earned him the moniker The Man with No Allies whenever he steps into the ring. After more time refining his technique, Alex has added a new stance, over 10 throws, and new moves that transition seamlessly into one another to make him a fighting force whether he’s in the ring or on the streets.</p><p>As shown in the gameplay trailer, Alex’s fierce wrestling techniques include:</p><ul><li><strong>Flash Axe</strong> – A rapid attack with light and medium options. The light version is a great combo ender whereas the medium can transition into Prowler Stance upon hit.</li><li><strong>Flash Chop</strong> – When this bodacious heavy strike hits on the ground, the opponent will be opened up to a follow-up grab like Power Bomb or Oblique Stomp for some wicked damage. The <a title="Games > OD [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/od">OD</a> version allows Alex to transition to Prowler Stance on hit.</li><li><strong>Aerial Knee Smash</strong> – A fantastic anti-air technique as Alex jumps into the air and slams his opponent into the ground with his knee.</li><li><strong>Power Bomb</strong> – Alex’s signature move comes with light, medium, and heavy variations, which all deal the same damage while offering other unique benefits.</li><li><strong>Prowler Stance</strong> – Alex forfeits the ability to block while in this stance, but gains 11 different follow-up options to mix-up his opponent. For example, if you land Sweep Combination (Target Combo), Hyper Takedown (Throw), or Dangerous Armbar (Throw) on a Punish Counter, they’ll transition into Flying Suplex, Death Valley Bomb, and Spiral DDT respectively.</li><li><strong>Raging Spear</strong> – Alex’s Level 1 Super Art has him spring forward with a devastating tackle. This move is invincible on start-up to both strikes and throws and can also be used in combos.</li><li><strong>Sledgecross Hammer</strong> – Alex’s Level 2 Super Art crushes opponents with a devastating lariat that can wall splat if it hits an airborne opponent and has some invincibility from projectiles.</li><li><strong>Omega Wing Buster</strong> – Alex has another Level 2 Super Art following a successful OD Power Drop where Alex can transition into Omega Wing Buster. If this move looks familiar it might be because wrestling superstar Kenny Omega performed this move’s motion capture for Alex!</li><li><strong>The Final Prison</strong> – Alex’s Level 3 Super Art The Final Prison has four different animations! The wrestler chokes the opponent out with a series of phenomenal grappling moves. There’s the normal Level 3 version, the Level 3 version that results in a K.O., the normal CA version, and a CA version that ends in a K.O.</li></ul><p>Alex will be unlocked and ready to throw down for players who own or purchase the Year 3 Character Pass or Year 3 Ultimate Pass on March 17. Alex’s Outfit 1 reflects his role as the Dark Devil of the ring, while Outfit 2 reflects a more classic look from <em>Street Fighter III</em>. Stay tuned for the full release of Alex’s theme song “GO! ALEX! Hope is Born!” composed by anime song super band JAM Project, which can be heard in the gameplay trailer.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
You ever accidentally find out that you're the sovereign of an entire nation as dictated by a prophecy even though you're technically just random nobody, and so you wind-up being the one to have to make all the decisions about how your nation is run? No? Well, that's fine, but if you'd like that to be you, I'll introduce you to Sovereign Tower, a management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you send off your knights of the round table to deal with all manner of quests.
</p>
<p>
From the devs behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rally-point-the-wonderful-vibes-of-aetheris-are-a-hint-about-its-design-goals">Aetheris</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2447980/Crown_Gambit/">Crown Gambit</a>, Sovereign Crown is a funny little game (I've had a taste of it through its demo on <a href="https://wildwits.itch.io/sovereign-tower">itch.io</a>, which you can try out for yourself). It's not quite like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, but it bears some similarities. In your throne room, you attend to the requests of your people, neighbouring nations, and prospective knights, having to make careful decisions about the quests offered by the first two. These range from a stinky jester too terrified by a goose terrorising the local baths, or a blacksmith who's misplaced her hammer.

<p>
When a quest is accepted, you can then send off one of your knights to attempt to complete it, each with their own unique stats (and personalities) that may be better suited to more tasks than others. One knight is an ostentatious bellend who constantly shimmers gold, another is a nervous, accident prone woman, and the other just kind of straight up a goth, but medievally so, all of which are differently socially awkward in a charming way. There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek, sarcastic, irreverent humour to be found here, sold all the better by an art direction that you kind easily find in some French comic book you've never heard of that's just absolutely gorgeous.
</p>
<p>
You also don't have all that long to wait for it! As it's slated for an August release later this year, which is quite nifty. While you wait, you can also wishlist it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113940/Sovereign_Tower/">here</a>.

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that one of Ubisoft’s longest in-development projects, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived Ubisoft’s latest round of project cancellations.</p>







<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 continues to make headlines as the longest-in-development title ever, having been in development since its reveal on May 30, 2008, with a total of 6445 days at the time of writing, or, for those who hate math,&nbsp;17 years, 7 months, and 22 days. </p>



<p>However, the current version of the game has been in development since around 2017, which still means a good 8-9 years of development.</p>



<p>Regardless of records and long-ass development timelines, though, Ubisoft still thinks that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has something to give. Despite the recent restructuring that has seen six games cancelled, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, sources tell Insider Gaming that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in active development, at least for the time being.</p>



<p>In 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 saw significant changes</a> with Ubisoft Montpellier being under investigation “over an unprecedented number of developers experiencing burnout and going on sick leave.”</p>



<p>According to sources, constant changes, pushbacks, and the lengthy development time have likely cost Ubisoft $500+ million in development costs. But, at least for the time being, Ubisoft feels like it’s a cost that is justified.</p>







<div><p>As for when Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 will release, it’s anyone’s guess, but it’s possible the game still won’t be seen for a number of years.</p><p>What do you think of Beyond Good and Evil 2 still being in development after so long? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p></div>

<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog team has unveiled a new audio drama that leans into a noir-inspired atmosphere.</p>



<p>On January 20, the Sonic the Hedgehog YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/BftIr01R0uU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released a trailer</a> for a new audio drama titled “The Chaotix Casefiles,” launching on January 27 on various podcast platforms. The series centers on Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee, who run the Chaotix Detective Agency. The series also teases appearances from Sonic and Dr. Eggman.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of Sonic the Hedgehog has been thrust into a not-so-dark, not-so-stormy, hard-boiled detective story that probably nobody saw coming. This show has it all. Massive mystery, investigative intrigue, and saxophone. Lots and lots of saxophone.</p>



<p>Follow Sonic and the intrepid Chaotix Detective Agency as they take on their biggest case yet. This high-flying, action-packed adventure will take them across the world, fighting for every clue they can find. It’s one heck of a tale. Which is good, because this story might be the only thing that can save their lives.</p>



<p>All will be revealed in Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles. Coming soon to wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

<h2 id="h-sonic-the-hedgehog-is-celebrating-its-35th-anniversary">Sonic the Hedgehog is Celebrating its 35th Anniversary</h2>



<p>The brand management team behind the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise kicked off the year with a trailer revealing that 2021 would be a big celebration of the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog’s debut on the Sega Genesis in 1991. It appears that this audio drama is the first of much more content to come.</p>



<div><p>As for the Chaotix Detective Agency, the Chaotix first appeared on the Sega 32X in a game helmed by Knuckles the Echidna in 1994. However, beginning with Sonic Heroes in 2004, the trio began making more regular appearances as fan-favorite auxiliary characters in the series.</p><p>Now, they’re getting their own hard-boiled spotlight in this upcoming podcast, beginning January 27.</p></div>

<p>On January 20, 2026, Nintendo shadow-dropped a free update to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns originally launched on the Nintendo Wii over a decade ago, was later ported to the Nintendo 3DS, and an updated version of the game arrived on the original Nintendo Switch in early 2025. However, the new free update went live this week, adding new game modes, enhanced visuals, and a new playable character. </p>







<h2 id="h-dixie-kong-finally-arrives-in-donkey-kong-country-returns">Dixie Kong Finally Arrives in Donkey Kong Country Returns</h2>



<p>When Donkey Kong Country Returns first arrived on the Nintendo Wii in 2010, it was heralded as a return to the glory days of the Donkey Kong series on the Super Nintendo. However, while Diddy Kong was originally a playable sidekick, Dixie Kong was absent from the games until Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was released on the Nintendo Wii U.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/a-free-update-is-out-now-waitaminute-is-that-dixie-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Now, the new free update</a> to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for the Nintendo Switch family of consoles adds a playable Dixie Kong for the first time. Instead of using Diddy’s jetpack to fly through the air, players will be able to use Dixie Kong’s Helicopter Spin.</p>



<p>Additionally, the free update boasts enhanced visuals and resolution, as well as faster load times, specifically for the Nintendo Switch 2. GameShare is also supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing players to play with a friend who doesn’t have the game via a local wireless connection. There’s also a new Turbo Attack Mode that serves as a time trial.</p>







<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-s-moment-in-the-sun">Donkey Kong’s Moment in the Sun</h2>



<p>Ever since the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo’s oldest mascot and the leader of the bunch, Donkey Kong, has been back front and center in the first year of the new Switch. Donkey Kong Bananza was the first standout 3D platformer of the new console, featuring DK’s redesign and the return of King K. Rool.</p>



<p>DK is also featured in Mario Kart World and is slated to be a major focal point of the campaign mode in Mario Tennis Fever. That game is slated to feature<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-unveils-new-features-and-characters-in-mario-tennis-fever-gameplay-overview-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> the largest roster in series history</a>. Learn more about that here. While players are still await news of the next major Mario game, there’s plenty of Donkey Kong to hold Nintendo fans over.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-sees-surge-of-negative-steam-reviews-thanks-to-its-baffling-new-map-full-of-bottomless-pits</link>
            <guid>1412551</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign's DLC, The Forsaken Hollows, has been out for a month and a half now, which means players have had plenty of time to get used to its two new Nightfarers, two new end bosses, and numerous new night bosses. But one element of the new content that everyone is still really struggling with, even after weeks of practice: the new DLC map. It's really difficult, <em>really</em> confusing, and seemingly no one likes it that much, leading to a rash of negative Steam reviews and a lot of failed runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new map is technically not even a new <em>map</em>, though it may as well be. It's a Shifting Earth event, meaning it may or may not be active at any given time when you're playing a DLC boss, with other options being the default map or one of four other Shifting Earths available. However, unlike the other Shifting Earth events, which only transform one part of the map significantly, the Great Hollow shifting earth essentially is a totally different area. <em>Nothing</em> is the same. There's no castle at the center, no ravine running down the middle, no lake in the south or cliffs up north.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, the Great Hollow is centered around a giant crystal in the middle which seems to have crashlanded, splitting the land around it into broken up cliffs separated into multiple levels. Built into and scattered around the cliffs and canyons are various ruins full of enemies, alongside the more familiar structures such as churches, forts, and mines. The actual in-game map of the Great Hollow has multiple levels with different points of interest on each level, and it's necessary to use the game's spirit springs carefully to fall down to lower levels and shoot back up to higher ones so you can actually get around effectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the Great Hollow's center crystal contains a major buff for the party that can be seriously clutch for a round's final boss fights. But in order to obtain it, you need to find and break several smaller, colored crystals scattered around the map, whose locations change on each attempt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why is this causing everyone so much pain? Well, for one, because of the multi-level map, it's far more difficult to tell at a glance what route you should take on a given run. Normally, as you're flying into a new game, you'll pop the map open and give it a brief scan, mentally planning out a route that will ideally give your team a few extra flasks, a mine for a smithing stone, and a gradually more challenging line of boss encounters so you can collect runes and weapons and level up. In the Great Hollow, there are so many different vertical levels to account for, plus multiple map levels to swap between, that it's even more difficult to route a run and make a plan that will actually see your team effectively get stronger over the course of two nights. And that's only exacerbated by the need to account for breaking crystals as you go, without knowing where they're going to end up until the second day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by far the worst thing about Great Hollow is the giant, gaping chasm running through the middle of it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Elden Ring, Nightreign doesn't have fall damage. This was a big point of difference in gameplay style when it first launched, as Nightreign encourages players to sprint across maps, leap off ledges, and even climb up the sides of cliffs. Elden Ring, by contrast, favors a somewhat slower, more cautious playstyle. So over the last year, a lot of Elden Ring players have slowly adjusted to Nightreign's rhythm of running and jumping without a lot of hesitancy, and by and large, that's worked out well for them, because there really aren't many places where falling in Nightreign is dangerous. You can technically fall off the outside edge of the map, and the Crater Shifting Earth does have a big lava pit that's not great to fall into, but both of those are fairly simple to avoid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Great Hollow, by contrast, has a death pit running down parts of the middle of the map, and it's <em>annoyingly hard to see.</em> Because of how the ledges are positioned, it's easy to look over a ledge, think you're good to jump down, and end up falling to your death. What's worse, for some reason Nightreign doesn't treat death falls the same way it treats deaths to enemies. If an enemy kills you, you just spawn back at the last Grace you tapped, and your leftover Runes are either dropped near where you died or picked up by a nearby enemy. But when you fall, Nightreign will seemingly randomly drop you somewhere along a ledge near your death point, which could be above, below, or across from where you jumped off. But then it leaves your Runes back on the ledge where you started. Which means it's possible (and even likely) that you'll spawn on a far ledge, with your Runes somewhere behind you across a death pit, and no easy route back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whew! All this is to say that the Great Hollow, while aesthetically beautiful and thematically cool, is kind of a pain in the neck, and Steam reviewers are trying to let FromSoftware know. While Elden Ring: Nightreign itself has mostly positive reviews, Forsaken Hollows is currently sitting at Mostly Negative reviews for the last 30 days, with only 30% of 1,347 reviews this past month being positive. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The new map is poorly designed, overly difficult and boring," reads one review from today. "Takes forever to traverse, interesting points of interest are often too deep into the edge of the map to get through completely, boss battle tower is a damage-sponge time-wasting chore. New dlc pois in new and old map are full of enemy encounters designed to cheese you like it's darksouls. Spend hours learning and memorizing crystal locations from youtube videos just so you can try to not lose in a bad map. Underground ruins filled with a dozen rot kindred that homing one shot you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another reads: "The characters and bosses are great but the new "map" is absolutely horrible and is ruining the experience of the game as a whole."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And a third: "Love the bosses and new classes but the new map is just trash. There was Zero NEED to add gaps in the map to kill YOU. You might as well add fall damage to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That map is NOT FUN!!! It's a freaking chore. I avoided it completely until I am forced to play it to compete certain story lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I am now forced to spend hours memorising the bloody thing because you will literally end up locations you cannot get out because the only bridge is light years away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An otherwise great DLC ruined by this nonsense map. EITHER GET RID OF THE MAP, MAKE IT OPTIONAL OR COVER THE GIANT HOLES."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also spotted a recent positive review that simply read, "the new map is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible but everything's so good."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everyone hates the map, and some FromSoftware fans are pointing out that this may be a bit of a skill issue. A recent Reddit thread about the Steam reviews states, "The more I play, the more I feel like it was fantastically designed." And the replies themselves seem divided between acknowledging its flaws and celebrating what they love about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who spent last night falling into chasms on this map, I can see both points here. Great Hollow really is beautiful and unique, requiring a very different gameplay flow and better team coordination so you don't all end up separated and confused. But it's pretty challenging to learn, and the only way to learn really is to fail at it a lot. After already putting over 100 hours into Nightreign, I'm not having the best time simultaneously trying to learn all the new bosses, two new characters, <em>and</em> the new map simultaneously - though, I guess you could argue, that's just the FromSoftware experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Probably a fix for where the game places you after you fall, and maybe a little bit more clarity on the minimap would solve some of this. We'll keep an eye out for a Nightreign patch to address it. But in the meantime, just keep practicing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time Nightreign players have used Steam reviews to express their displeasure. Last November, a wave of review bombs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-by-end-of-march-2026-as-frustrated-players-leave-negative-steam-reviews">complained about the lack of DLC content</a>, just weeks before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-its-first-dlc-next-month">Forsaken Hollows was announced and released</a>. A <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1032-buffs-all-the-worst-nightfarers">more recent patch last week</a> has given some of the Nightfarers who were struggling much-needed buffs.

            <title><![CDATA[Following Layoffs And Cancellations, Ubisoft Announces More Layoffs And Cancellations]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-layoffs-prince-of-persia-remake-canceled/</link>
            <guid>1412542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We’ve just crested the hill of 2026’s third week, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-halifax-closed-weeks-after-unionizing-cwa-canada/"><u>once</u></a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/meta-ubisoft-unity-layoffs-2026/"><u>again</u></a>, it’s time for another helping of dire Ubisoft news. Making previous weeks’ layoffs look like mere throat clearing, the company today announced a “major organizational, operational and portfolio reset” that will result in more layoffs, as well as delays and cancellations – most prominently of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554?ref=aftermath.site"><u>long-embattled <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake</u></a>, which is now dust in the wind. But on the bright side, we’re also getting something no one asked for: a greater investment in "player-facing Generative AI.” Oh, and more live service swings from the publisher that has repeatedly failed to get out of its own way with <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutdown-studio-closure-layoffs/"><u>games like <em>XDefiant</em></u></a><em> </em>and <em>Skull and Bones</em>.</p><p>In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a release published today</u></a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot – who remains in charge despite demonstrably no longer being the man for the job – announced the formation of five “creative houses” that will each focus on specific genres and series. These sound significantly more self-contained than the global, multi-studio efforts that defined Ubisoft’s previous era. They will break down as follows:</p><blockquote>- CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands; Brands: <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Rainbow Six</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences; Brands including <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences; Brands including <em>For Honor</em>, <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, <em>Brawlhalla</em>, <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes; Brands including <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>, <em>Prince of Persia</em>, <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></blockquote><blockquote>- CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games. Brands including <em>Just Dance</em>,<em> Idle Miner Tycoon</em>, <em>Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>,<em> Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno</em>, Hasbro</blockquote><p>Each creative house will have “end-to-end responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy)” and “will also be financially accountable, both in terms of [profit and loss] and cash generation.” Ubisoft believes this still-convoluted-sounding structure will “sharpen strategic focus, reinforce execution discipline, and ensure that investment decisions will be taken closer to where value is created.” I guess we’ll see!</p><p>Vantage, you’ll remember, was formed last year in conjunction with Tencent, from which Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796?ref=aftermath.site"><u>received a $1.25 billion bailout</u></a>. One of its co-CEOs is Guillemot’s son, who is <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot/"><u>definitely not a nepo baby</u></a>. All of this reshuffling will come at a steep cost – to people who are not part of the Guillemot family, of course.</p><p>“To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization,” Guillemot wrote. “We will discontinue several projects currently in development and provide additional time to certain games, to ensure enhanced quality and maximize long term value. We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group. While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.”</p><p>A total of six games have been canceled, including <em>Prince of Persia</em> and four unannounced games, three of which were new IP. Definitely a sign of a company with <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea/"><u>a bright, bold future</u></a> ahead of it! Four new IPs remain in development, while seven games have been delayed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not clear yet how many people will be laid off – in addition to those who already lost their jobs earlier this month – but the damage will likely be significant. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3mcxcxiwki22r?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Game File’s Stephen Totilo pointed out</u></a>, a previous €300 million cost reduction plan has resulted in a total headcount decline of over 3,000 at Ubisoft. Now the company is planning for €200 million more in cuts by March 2028.&nbsp;</p><p>Employees who manage to dodge the scythe might still end up leaving of (what could charitably be called) their own accord, as Ubisoft is also largely putting an end to remote work.</p><p>“To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days,” Ubisoft wrote. “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.”</p><p>Game workers at other companies have referred to this approach as a form of “<a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs/"><u>soft layoff</u></a>” that disproportionately targets disabled and immunocompromised people, but maybe things will be different at Ubisoft, a company that has repeatedly <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ai-teammates-im-so-tired/"><u>stepped on rakes</u></a> while trying to follow the rest of the industry. That in mind, I’d like to close out with a selection of recent headlines about Ubisoft.

            <guid>1412539</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Three of game studio That's No Moon's co-founders are suing another co-founder for allegedly hijacking the company’s website domain name—taking the website offline and disabling employee access to email accounts, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/985076973/That-s-No-Moon-Ex-CEO-Hijacked-Domain-Other-Founders-Say-In-Lawsuit-via-Aftermath?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a new lawsuit</u></a>.</p><p>Tina Kowalewski, Taylor Kurosaki, and Nick Kononelos filed a complaint against co-founder and former CEO Michael Mumbauer on Tuesday in a California court. That's No Moon, which was founded in 2020 by veterans of Infinity Ward, Naughty Dog, and other AAA studios, said in its complaint that Mumbauer is looking to "cripple" the studio after being fired in 2022. "[Mumbauer]—resentful about his termination—has waged a harassment campaign that has included threatening a TNM executive and their family and sporadic but persistent efforts to cripple TNM's business."</p><p>Mumbauer, according to the complaint, purchased the domain name, and several others, when the studio was founded; it said both parties agreed these would be controlled by the studio. Mumbauer allegedly still has access to the domains, and That's No Moon said he took control over the website on Jan. 6, disabled the studio's access, and turned off employees’ ability to email external addresses. The team was locked out for two days as a four-person IT team worked to get the services back online.&nbsp;</p><p>On the public-facing side, the website briefly redirected to the Travel Switzerland page, according to the complaint. That's No Moon's lawyers said the co-founders sent Mumbauer a letter on Jan. 7 demanding he "relinquish his unauthorized access." That's when, according to the compliant, the website started redirecting to a GoDaddy Auction site, where the domain was priced at $6,666,666; That's No Moon remarked in the complaint: "A number that [Mumbauer] may well have selected for its Satanic connotation."</p><p>As of Wednesday, Aftermath was able to access a public-facing That's No Moon website using both the original domain and the new one. That's No Moon did not respond to Aftermath's request for comment by time of publishing.</p><p>"Business partners, gamers, and employee candidates were left wondering whether TNM had simply shut down, or whether the company had fired executives who were suddenly unreachable by e-mail," lawyers wrote in the complaint. That's No Moon also said in the complaint that the email lockout interrupted communications with HR providers, "resulting in missed payroll reminders and invoices."</p><p>That's No Moon immediately created a new domain (ThatsNoMoon.co) and moved its website over, per the complaint. This whole debacle, allegedly, cost the company more than $1 million in January—and, as of the complaint's filing on Tuesday, Mumbauer allegedly still has control over the domain. That's why the studio is asking to get back access and for damages related to the costs of the new domains and other harm. Per the complaint, the original domain names cost around $2,836, which That's No Moon said it reimbursed Mumbauer for.</p><p>That's No Moon fired Mumbauer in 2022, it said, because he "leaked confidential and sensitive information to the media and to competitors." After leaving That's No Moon, Mumbauer allegedly denied requests from the That's No Moon IT team to hand over the domain access. The company tried to get access from an arbitrator in 2023, but was denied because of a lack of trademark registrations.</p><p>Lawyers said Mumbauer had been harassing the company and its executives for years, and that they and their families "fear for their safety." From the complaint:</p><p><em>Following his termination from TNM in 2022, Defendant posted disruptive comments on social media alluding to the company and team members. He threatened litigation against TNM over fabricated claims about his termination. Even more significantly, he threatened a member of the TNM leadership team whom he blames for his departure through text messages. In one instance, Defendant texted the executive, “This is not going to end well for you. Trust me.” Defendant has continued to send threatening texts as late as last year—over three years after his termination. On information and belief, Defendant used an unknown phone number to contact the executive on April 24, 2025, texting, “Hope your family is well. They deserve all the stability you can provide Brute,” followed by a winking emoji. Moreover, Defendant revealed TNM’s confidential business information on multiple different occasions, violating the NDA he had signed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p><p>The charges listed as part of this lawsuit are trademark infringement, cybersquatting, computer fraud, conversion, trespass to chattels, and breach of contract. That's No Moon also asked a judge for a temporary restraining order to prevent Mumbauer from continued access to the domains.</p><p>Mumbauer has not responded to Aftermath's request for comment. Mumbauer said, in an email to That's No Moon attorney Amit Rana published as part of the lawsuit, that he intends to file "a wrongful termination countersuit and will be seeking extensive damages."</p><p>That's No Moon was founded in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-smilegate-poured-usd100m-into-thats-no-moon-and-its-aaa-veterans?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and formally announced in 2021</u></a>. It billed itself as a triple A studio from veteran developers from studios like Infinity Ward, Bungie, Sony Santa Monica, and Naughty Dog developers. That's No Moon hasn't yet announced its first game, but has said the game is led by creative director Taylor Kurosaki and game director Jacob Minkoff. South Korean publisher Smilegate invested $100 million into the company, That's No Moon announced in 2021. The company said, in its announcement in 2021, that it hoped to reach 100 employees by 2022. It’s listed as having 51 to 200 employees <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/thats-no-moon-entertainment/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>on LinkedIn</u></a> and, though it’s been publicly quiet for several years, appears to be hiring.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>This story has been updated to include additional details.</p>

A new Kickstarter will transform your Switch 2 dock into an old-school GameCube. And two people who worked on <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> argue about what’s to blame for modern VFX looking dull and lifeless.

 <h2>No online multiplayer for <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of all the previous Lego games, the new<em> Lego Batman</em> won’t have online co-op. “Fans of all generations will be able to enjoy the game solo or team up with a friend or family member through two-player local couch cooperative gameplay only,” <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">reads the FAQ</a> (via <a href="https://primagames.com/featured/lego-batmans-new-game-once-again-skips-online-co-op">Prima Games</a>).</p> <h2>Turn your Switch 2 into a GameCube</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battle Dock coming soon! <a href="https://t.co/hRdu7zI6IV">pic.twitter.com/hRdu7zI6IV</a></p> <p>— Retro Fighters (@retrofightersco) <a href="https://twitter.com/retrofightersco/status/2013382477923111083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A new dock <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/battledock-for-switch-2">on Kickstarter</a> promises to do exactly that.

<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is his final game</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="11af1244f7a70"><a title="Samus" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/11af1244f7a70/samus.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Kensuke Tanabe, veteran producer at Nintendo who became known for his work on the <strong>Metroid Prime</strong> series, has reportedly announced his retirement.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">VGC</a>, Tanabe's announcement comes via an interview with the Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/">Nintendo Dream</a>, which has been uploaded online by a user on <a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574">Weibo</a>. Tanabe states that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> was to be his final game at the company, with his protégé producer Risa Tabata succeeding him should another Prime game be made in the future.</p>
<p>Tabata's first game with Nintendo was, coincidentally, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a> on the GameCube. She has since worked as an assistant producer on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/paper_mario_color_splash">Paper Mario: Color Splash</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">The Thousand-Year Door</a> on Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cewgixph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As for Tanabe, he reportedly states in the interview that he had wanted to create a Metroid title focused on Samus and Sylux since dropping subtle hints in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3: Corruption</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/metroid_prime_federation_force">Federation Force</a>. Realising that Prime 4: Beyond might be his last shot to do this, he decided to make it the first entry in the Sylux saga.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I envisioned Sylux as a dark, resentful villain who resorts to underhanded tactics. After this game, Samus would realize that a direct confrontation with him is inevitable – she must defeat him completely.</p>
<p>“That’s why the final showdown between Sylux and Samus remains unfinished. However, completing this game took far longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tanabe leaves behind a remarkable legacy at Nintendo. His first game with the company was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> in 1987 during which he served as director. Since then, he's transitioned into one of the most prominent producers at the company, working on everything from <strong>Luigi's Mansion</strong> to <strong>WarioWare</strong> and beyond, and we're certain he will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Thanks for everything, Tanabe-san.</p>

This is probably the umpteenth time I've said I'm not someone who plays many shooters, but here I am saying it again, because an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> has rocked up that has clocked my interest. It's called Firestarters, an arena shooter that's a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a>, and looks like good, bloody fun.
</p>
<p>
To start with, the setting. Set some time in the future, everyone's favourite livestreamed event is known as STEEL, a "gladiator bloodsport owned and operated by the nation's most notorious crime syndicate." You play as former street delinquent Kera who has to fight for her friends' freedom and to make up for her own past mistakes in said bloodsport. Classic protag stuff!

<p>
Mechanically, the shooting looks to be exactly what you'd expect from an FPS, there's guns, you point 'em at some enemies, bada bing, bada boom. There are a few guns available by the looks of things, like dual wielding pistols, a shotgunny thing, and also a not-a-gun-but-a-baseball bat, which can deflect bad guy bullets. The real fun comes from the skate park adjacent level design that sees the arenas dotted with ramps, half-pipes, and grind spots for you to enact some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> roller skating shenanigans on, all while trying to take down the androids you're fighting.
</p><p>
In between matches the story itself is relayed through visual novel style cutscenes, with an appropriately animey look to them. There are two disclaimers I'm thrilled to see in the about section too, one being that no generative AI tools were used to make it ("This game is a specialty product hand-crafted by humans," it notes), and that "This game does not promote smoking or the use of cigarettes. It's only cool when anime girls do it." So true, developer Studio Kerosene.
</p>
<p>
No release date attached to this one apart from sometime this year, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3733710/FIRESTARTERS/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

<p>For a lot of the games I’ve written about in the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/carsgames/">C:\ArsGames</a> series, I’ve come to the conclusion that the games hold up pretty well, despite their age—<em>Master of Orion II</em>, <em>Jill of the Jungle</em>, and <em>Wing Commander Privateer</em>, for example. Each of those have flaws that show now more than ever, but I still had a blast revisiting each of them.</p>
<p>This time I’d like to write about one that I think doesn’t hold up quite as well for me: For the first time in almost 30 years, I revisited the original<em> Tomb Raider</em> via 2024’s <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Ftomb_raider_i_to_iii_remastered"><em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em></a> collection.</p>
<p>You might be thinking this is going to be a dunk on the work done on the remaster, but that’s not the case, because the core issue with playing 1996’s <em>Tomb Raider</em> in 2026 is actually unsolvable, no matter how much care is put into a remaster.</p>
<h2>The age of tank controls</h2>
<p><em>Tomb Raider</em> was part of the first wave of multiplatform games with fully 3D gameplay, releasing the same year as similarly groundbreaking 3D titles <em>Super Mario 64</em> and <em>Quake</em>. I think you could make a pretty compelling case that most of the modern AAA games industry can trace its lineage in some way back to those three titles.</p>
<p>Because it was the beginning of mass-market 3D games (yes, I know other, more niche 3D games existed before), there were no established best practices for things like the controls or the camera.</p>
<p><em>Tomb Raider</em> opted for a modality that was common for a few years before it was replaced by clearly better solutions: what we now call “tank controls,” where forward or back moves the character forward or back, but hitting left or right turns the character on its axis in place without moving.</p>


<p>The way it works is naturally intuitive enough, which is part of why it was so popular early on. But the industry has moved on because it’s frustratingly sluggish and clunky. I loved <em>Tomb Raider</em>‘s level design and atmosphere, and the designers did about as good a job as they could designing around the limitations of the controls for most of the combat sequences. But ultimately, there was enough combat that the sluggishness of this input method significantly detracted from my enjoyment.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In 1996, I had little to compare it to, and the novelty of these vertically stacked 3D levels played from a third-person perspective was powerful enough that I had no complaints. But after 30 years of new ideas and iteration, the industry’s designers have solved all the problems this game has with controls.</p>
<p>That’s why the studio behind the remaster tried including an alternative modern control scheme. Unfortunately, that doesn’t work for <em>Tomb Raider</em> at all.</p>
<h2><em>Prince of Persia</em> and grids</h2>
<p>When work started on the original <em>Tomb Raider</em>, its developers are said to have had a specific cocktail of influences in mind: They wanted to combine the truly 3D navigable environments they had seen in the groundbreaking <em>Ultima Underworld </em>and&nbsp;the polygonal characters from <em>Virtua Fighter</em>, with gameplay inspired by the 1989 Jordan Mechner classic <em>Prince of Persia</em>.</p>
<p>If you’ve played <em>Prince of Persia</em>, you know the platforming in that game is both precise and challenging. To make jumps, you had to carefully position yourself before launching—one step forward, one step back, until you reached the perfect starting point.</p>
<p>The same goes for <em>Tomb Raider</em>. In fact, the entire game—all the puzzles, layouts, and platforming challenges—adheres to a strict <a href="https://lifeandtimes.games/episodes/files/7">grid system</a>. Players can predict exactly how far protagonist Lara Croft will jump based on where they are on that grid. They can count steps to position themselves, and it’s basically required if you want to consistently navigate the game’s complex and precise jumping sequences without frustration.</p>
<p>Using the game’s original tank controls, you could step forward or backward in predictable ways, or side step, jump to the side, jump forward, jump backward, and so on, with specific numbers of presses on the arrow keys. The entire game was built around this principle.</p>
<p>As frustrating as tank controls are to a modern player, there was an exquisite elegance to this.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The remaster’s modern controls option works more like <em>Tomb Raider Legends</em> from the 2000s, and it’s that general approach that has become standard in almost all modern third-person 3D games.</p>
<p>They feel so much nicer and more responsive to a modern player who has been trained on that for the past two decades, even if that player is someone like me who did play the original games with tank controls back in the day. That short window of three to five years of muscle memory and comfort based on tank controls has been completely overwritten by more than 20 years with what the modern control scheme offers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the flexible modern controls lose almost all connection to that elegant grid system. What used to be a precise process—for example, “X steps forward, X steps to the left, then a backflip from exactly this spot"—is now a guessing game of feeling things out. And the platforming sequences aren’t designed with that in mind. As a result, the combat feels a lot better with modern controls, but just about everything else is much more frustrating than before.</p>

<h2>Embracing <em>Tomb Raider</em></h2>
<p>I’m not the first to observe this about the remaster; reviewers and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1dkqpli/new_article_about_the_gridbased_design_in_the/">Reddit dwellers</a> debated this at length when this release happened two years ago. But I hadn’t gotten to playing the remasters—or revisiting <em>Tomb Raider</em> at all since the ’90s—until I decided to try it out for C:\ArsGames.</p>
<p><em>Tomb Raider</em> is still worth revisiting, but it is frustrating to leave behind 20 years of muscle memory to return to a previous paradigm that ended up being an evolutionary dead end.</p>
<p>The more time you put into it, the more natural the tank controls feel, but without the wow factor of groundbreaking new 3D gameplay, it’s harder to put up with.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Tellingly, <em>Tomb Raider</em> has already gotten a complete remake (distinct from this remaster) once, and another one is coming. Both radically reinvent the gameplay and seem to turn away from the grid system that made the original what it was. Many modern players won’t put up with the tank controls, but not being willing to embrace those means you simply can’t experience <em>Tomb Raider</em> as it was originally intended.</p>


<p>And again, I’m not knocking the work done on this remaster. Fittingly, it was made by Aspyr, the same studio that ported the original games to the Mac in the ’90s. (For a few years, they absolutely dominated the Mac game market with their Windows-to-Mac ports.) They’re still porting games to Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android today—notably, they did all the <em>Civilization VI</em> ports—as well as remasters of classics for modern platforms.</p>
<p>There’s no version of the modern controls that would truly work from this game, so it’s not an execution issue, and I actually think that <em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em> is possibly Aspyr’s most well-crafted work.</p>
<p>The remaster includes the ability to flip between classic graphics and a more contemporary look that I think does a great job of walking the line between honoring the ’90s original and looking nice to 2020s eyes. They even hired Timur “XProger” Gagiev, a developer known for work on <em>Tomb Raider</em> open source engine OpenLara, to be the remaster’s technical director.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider franchise is about to enter a new era (controversially) under Embracer Group and Amazon Games; it remains to be seen whether it will be a good one. But if you want to go back to where it all started, I recommend grabbing this remaster (<a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Ftomb_raider_i_to_iii_remastered">available on GOG</a> and other storefronts, as well as on consoles) instead of playing the original release. Just stick with the tank controls, and I hope you adapt back to them more easily than I did!</p>

			<p>Last week, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">announced that it had cast <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> to play <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Shortly after that, it confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> would be playing <strong>Sif</strong> in the series</a>, which gave us more of an insight into how the show is approaching the God of War story. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that <strong>Max Parker</strong> will play <strong>Heimdall</strong>, giving us a bit more insight into the show's story. But it seems that a report from <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qenyu0/potential_god_of_war_tv_casting_leaks/">Reddit</a>, that correctly identified Parker and Palmer's casting, could also be correct about the casting choices for the show's version of <strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mimir</strong>.</p>



<p>Parker is the latest actor to join the cast of the God of War TV series, and knowing that he'll be playing Heimdall further confirms what Palmer's casting as Sif already indicated, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be leaning on characters not introduced in the games until <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> to tell this new version of Kratos and Atreus' story.</p>



<p>Which means we likely have more than a few casting announcements yet to come, since we'll likely also get an appearance from characters introduced in Ragnarok like <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Tyr</strong>. There's also still characters from <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> that have yet to be cast, including <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, but if NerdBot is correct, the next announcements we're likely to see will be the casting for Thor and Mimir.</p>



<p>For Thor, the proposed choice is <strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll likely recognzie from the hit Apple TV+ show, <strong>Severance</strong>, while for Mimir, it seems that Amazon doesn't want to fix what isn't broken, as the NerdBot report claims that <strong></strong><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as Mimir for the show.</p>



<p>Even though NerdBot's report was correct about Parker and Palmer's casting ahead of their reveal, you should still take its other picks with a grain of salt. That said, they're not outlandish or bad picks by any stretch, and in fact make a lot sense, which makes them even easier to believe. Still, it's not official, which is why this is still tagged as a just a rumor for now.</p>



<p>With the show reportedly set <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">to start filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, if that's still the case then we'll likely see official confirmations of more casting decisions soon. While none of these choices have been off the mark so far, the cast from both God of War (2018) and Ragnarok are all stellar performers. Hopefully, Alastair Duncan isn't the only cast member who gets to play their role in both.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">Despite the performance issues, annoying jokes, and bugs</a>, I’m still playing and enjoying <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>. I’m currently working on my second full playthrough with my wife, who is also a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan, and we’re having a great time. Mostly. Everything is going fine right up until we encounter another damn loot capsule. These things are the worst part of the game and are so bad that they truly baffle me.</p> <p>As you explore the open world of<a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-reviews-gearbox-randy-pitchford-2000634014"><em> Borderlands 4,</em></a> you’ll find side activities and quests to complete. Some of these are elaborate, but other stuff is as simple as killing a specific target or activating a safehouse. One of these supposedly simple and fun little side activities involves Loot Capsules. These are small pods that you can stumble upon and then have to carry back to the nearest safehouse to unlock. Doing so opens the capsule, and you get some loot. Sounds fine, right? Wrong!</p>

 <p>In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> Gearbox created a new mechanic that lets you pick up objects while fighting. This is used in various ways in the looter shooter, and most of the time, it is a nice way to spice up a combat encounter or make solving a puzzle just a bit more interesting. But when you hold something in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you can’t mantle or climb up a ladder, drive your hover bike, aim down your sights, throw grenades, or fast travel with that object. It greatly limits your toolbox, and that’s fine when it’s used sparingly as a momentary wrinkle you have to contend with.</p> <p>Yet that isn’t the case with Loot Capsules, which sometimes require you to walk a very long distance back to the “closest” HQ to get your reward. And you have to walk it. You can’t use your cool bike. You just run back on foot, unable to take most shortcuts because you can’t even use your sick grapple hook when holding an item. It is so fucking tedious. If you get attacked by enemies and have to fight your way out, you’d better hope that nothing happens that dislodges that capsule from your hand, or you could be searching around desperately for it in a moment. Has this happened to me? Yes, why do you think I’m writing this blog? And when you finally get to your HQ, you might have to solve some platforming puzzle that even involves tossing the damn loot pod across gaps. If it lands in an area you can’t enter, like a bottomless gorge that kills you, then it respawns back where you found it. Congratulations, you get to do it all over again.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Gearbox | <em>Go to hell, Claptrap</em></figcaption></figure> <p>Oh, and every time you pick it up, Claptrap starts talking. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes, he’ll talk over himself. And there are only so many lines. And they go on and on. I don’t even hate <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/borderlands-claptraps-new-robot-revolution">Claptrap</a> like a lot of people do, but I quickly reached my breaking point after just a few capsules.</p>

 <p>These damn capsules annoy me so much, and I deal with them so often that I’ve started to overthink how they even work. In a sci-fi universe that lets me digitize dozens of guns and store them on my person easily, why the fuck can’t I just store the capsule, too? Why must I lug it back? Why can’t I collect it like all the various shields, guns, and other loot I stuff into my digital trousers with no issue? Who thought this was fun? I’d love to chat with them because I’m genuinely curious how this was left in the game. Truly, it baffles me.</p> <p>Here’s the funniest part about all of this: I’d be fine with the bullshit and the capsules if the reward was worth it. In my experience, this is never the case. I’ve opened close to two dozen of these things or more while playing alone and with friends. I’ve never gotten a single legendary weapon. Never. It’s usually the same crappy loot you often find in random chests, which don’t require a tenth of the effort to open. I’ve talked to friends about it and they’ve reported the same thing: Worthless loot that you trash the second you see it.</p>

 <p>At this point, I’ve started to ignore them when playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> alone. And when I do pick one up, I just gnash my teeth the whole time as I hear the same damn Claptrap line again. At least I enjoy the rest of the game. Mostly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I was listening to a surprisingly combative interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan yesterday and amidst all the usual, expected stuff--like his general AI delusions and bizarre evasion of the question "what video game are you playing right now?"--I was struck by one response in particular, about subscription costs.</p><figure><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview?utm_content=buffer84bd2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social"><div><p>Gamers will learn to love AI, says Razer CEO</p><p>Razer’s Min-Liang Tan on AI backlash, partnering with Grok, and the future of gaming.</p><p><span>Nilay Patel</span></p></div></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview?utm_content=buffer84bd2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social"><u>Asked by The Verge's Nilay Patel whether he truly sees value in subscribing to AI platforms</u></a>, Tan says he sees value in all kinds of subscriptions. Here's a transcript of the part I'm talking about:</p><blockquote><strong>Patel: Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tan:</strong> I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Because you’re a billionaire, right?</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Sure.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I’m just saying.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?</strong></blockquote><blockquote>So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.</blockquote><p>"Because you’re a billionaire" has stuck with me. Tan is one of many billionaires at the vanguard of the AI push, empty men whose only reference point and purpose in life is seemingly to make a line go up for as long as possible. And that push, as it stands, is almost entirely reliant on platforms like ChatGPT and Grok going from free, idle curiosities<a href="https://www.getmonetizely.com/blogs/the-subprime-ai-crisis-how-ed-zitrons-warning-reveals-the-path-to-sustainable-aisaas-pricing?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>to something millions of people pay a substantial amount of money for every month</u></a>.</p><p>I am not a billionaire, but I am a guy reliant on people paying a monthly subscription for something people used to get for free, and let me tell you: good luck guys. At its height in the 2010s, I was writing for an audience at Kotaku that could number between 20-30 million people every month. I am now co-founder of a website that, asking for $7 in return for video game blogs, has 5000 paying subscribers (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">thank you everyone</a>!).</p><p>That math works out for me because I am a normal person with normal person obligations like bills and groceries.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/why-everybody-is-losing-money-on-ai/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>It absolutely does not work out for companies that are on the hook for billions in data centre and loans</u></a>, let alone<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>lawsuits and licensing disputes</u></a>. To even entertain the thought that the AI bubble could be propped up in any way by subscription costs, let alone commit your entire business model to it,<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-percent-chatgpt-users-pay?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>is insane to a normal person</u></a>!</p><p>But these aren't normal people. They're billionaires. And hearing Tan say "I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it", oblivious to what subscription costs (and fatigue) means to the average person on the street, made me think of this famous (if you're into basketball) line from Dwyane Wade's wife Gabrielle Union, where she explains how the multi-millionaire former pro athlete had no idea how much milk cost when he retired:</p><figure><blockquote>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bsjtqz/wades_wife_gabrielle_union_says_he_doesnt_know/?ref=aftermath.site">Wade's wife Gabrielle Union says he doesn't know how much milk costs or what happens at car washes: "He has no idea how much milk costs. He's like 'what is that, like $20?'"</a><br> by
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deadskin/?ref=aftermath.site">u/deadskin</a> in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/?ref=aftermath.site">nba</a>
</blockquote>
</figure><p>That's a cute story!<a href="https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/40205465/dwyane-wade-inspired-daughter-unveils-new-transgender-youth-support-community?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Dwyane Wade seems like a nice guy</u></a>, and I'm sure he now knows exactly how much milk costs. He was not, like Tan, a billionaire entirely divorced from the common human experience, trying to force a lake-boiling, job-displacing plagiarism machine on the world against its collective wishes.</p><p>There are a lot of ideas going around right now about how we can best curb the power of the billionaire class. Capping personal incomes, increasing taxes and tighter regulation of the share markets are all good places to start, but maybe I can add another one on top (they'd have to do this as well as pay more tax): every person who earns over 999 million has to spend a year stuck with the rest of us, doing what amounts to community service, in so much as it forces them to be part of a <em>community</em>. They have to draw from a median salary, pay a mortgage, feed kids, commute to work and navigate the healthcare system, without their billions or associated support network to bail them out.</p><p>Let's see what dipshits like Tan think about subscription costs for AI slop when $20 is three hours' work. If that job hasn't been replaced with AI already.</p>

		<p>There was a brief period of time where the most charitable thing you could say about the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/01/eight-things-that-look-more-like-sonic-than-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie/">Sonic the Hedgehog movie was that Sonic had a face for radio</a>, and maybe that feeling has stuck with the blue blur, because he’s about to feature in the new audio drama Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BftIr01R0uU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A collaboration between Sega and Realm, The Chaotix Casefiles will debut on 27th January 2026. It sees Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee of the Chaotix Detective Agency looking to solve a grand mystery. This will lean on classic detective radio dramas for inspiration.</p>
<p>One of the great things about this is that it will feature a bunch of the regular cast members from the video games, including Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, Keith Silverstein as Vector the Crocodile, Matthew Mercer as Espio the Chameleon, Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Charmy Bee, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this story has been put together by director,&nbsp;Ian Jones-Quartey (OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes, Steven Universe), lead writer Dan Jolley (Transformers, Dying Light, Superman), and a writers’ room with Ian Flynn and Evan Stanley, who have come from the Sonic franchise. Then there’s new music from two-time Grammy and Tony award-winning composer Charlie Rosen, leader of the 8-Bit Big Band. The production team also brings over thirty years of combined Sonic game development experience to the series.</p>

<p>Realm has been exploring this particular avenue with a number of other adaptations into audio series and podcasts, including Harley Quinn and The Joker: Sound Mind, DC High Volume: Batman, and Star Trek: Khan.</p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles is an exciting milestone for the Sonic franchise, allowing SEGA to expand the Sonic universe with a completely new medium,” said Ryan Hamlyn, Senior Director, SEGA Lore &amp; Creative Strategy. “We combined the appeal of a noir detective drama with Sonic’s fun and action-packed style, creating a fresh story that’s both true to the Sonic series and new to fans. Thanks to our collaboration with Realm, listeners can look forward to this immersive mystery adventure anywhere they get their podcasts.”</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with the innovative team at SEGA that oversees Sonic and has successfully expanded the story world in so many ways over the last five years. I can’t wait for fans to be able to dive into the world of the Chaotix Detective Agency – they’re in for an action-packed, sound rich adventure.” said Molly Barton, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Realm.</p>
