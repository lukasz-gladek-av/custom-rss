<p>Ever been in a position where two people are really going at each other, hurling pointed jabs and insults back and forth, and you're stuck in the middle? Well then, perhaps you'll empathise with the enemies in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/archons">Archons</a>, a twin-stick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like where you control two characters at once, and attacks bounce between them automatically as they move about the arena. I gave the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> demo a quick whirl today, and after a couple of swift attempts (I died horribly fast), I realised this could become a bit of a danger to my free time, so I've put it away for now.</p>

<p>Archons doesn't try to hide its influences. The developer very clearly asked themselves one day: what if you took Vampire Survivors, and substituted the main character for two High Templar from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>? Also, each character is independently controlled by one gamepad stick, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like a gimmick, and it is. But it also feels nicely put together. The attacks are punchy and precise, the chaos is pretty, and I could always tell what was happening on-screen despite the oodles of juicy bugs flinging themselves at me the whole time. Best of all though, every single attack is synced up to the music. Goddamn, I love it when things are synced up to the music.</p><p>It certainly requires a lot more active thought than the far simpler Vampire Survivors. My first attempts to split my attention between both my archons at once were laughably blunderous. It feels like a muscle I'd have to work out often before it becomes second nature. That also means Archons will likely never recapture the same popularity as the granddaddy of this fledgling sub-genre. It's simply far easier to reach those dopamine highs in Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>That's fine with me though, because I'm pretty much done with Vampire Survivors, and I'm glad games are cropping up which offer their own spin. I imagine for a lot of people, the added finnickiness of Archons flies in the face of why people play these fairly mindless Survivor-likes. But it hits just right for me. I like that you have to be a lot more thoughtful and focused in Archons if you want to survive more than a minute or two.</p>
<p>If you want to give Archons a go, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3192850/Archons_Demo/">check out its demo on Steam</a>. I just played it one more time, and survived for 10 minutes, finally dying to the boss of the first area. If you survive longer than that (or beat the boss), you're officially better at video games than me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nepos Games are the two-person studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebuchadnezzar">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, which Nate Crowley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nebuchadnezzar-is-two-thirds-of-the-perfect-historical-city-builder">called</a> "two thirds of an outstanding historical city builder". They've just informed me they're making a new building sim called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/county-of-fortune">County Of Fortune</a>, out in Q4 2025. It ain't a city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a>, though. In fact, it claims to have murdered the city builder in cold blood, which is unfortunate, because I was really looking forward to a round of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> later. 
</p>
<p>
"The city-builder is dead, long live the county-builder," declares the press release, brandishing the husk of SimCity over its head. OK, I'll bite - what's a county-builder then? Well, it's sort of several city-builders having an argument. In County Of Fortune, you seed and grow a number of settlements side by side, then manage their economic and social relations. In other words, it's a game that appears to simulate the phenomenon of culture clash. I'm not sure all this amounts to the wholesale death of a genre, but it's certainly intriguing. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3204330/County_of_Fortune/">Steam page</a>, and here's a trailer.

<p>
"In County of Fortune, you're not just managing a single city, but an entire county," the press release continues. "The game focuses on the bigger picture: managing multiple settlements and their development, overseeing logistics, and making sure resources flow effectively across your region without worrying about individual buildings.
</p><p>
"Furthermore, as your county expands, unique cultural traits will emerge, based on the characteristics you cultivate in each settlement," it continues. "These traits influence how your communities develop, making each region or even village in the county unique. And it also brings interesting interactions between settlements and even between their leaders."
</p>
<p>
My thoroughly piqued interest is heightened by the discovery that the game is set in (procedurally generated) England, made up of towns like Winchelsea and Chipping Campden that sound like they've been AI hallucinated based on episodes of I'm Alan Partridge, but then you fire up the Googlebox and my word, there <em>is</em> such a place as Chipping Campden. No, there really is! It's in Gloucestershire. 
</p>
<p>
If you're from Chipping Campden, don't get chippy - I've got nothing but good things to say about Gloucestershire, home of the Witcombe Music Festival. It's not like you're from Cheshire. The only things I know about Cheshire are that it consists of cheese and cats and is on the other side of stinking, sewage-drinking Manchester. And don't get me started about Cumberland. They share a border with my own county of birth, North Yorkshire, and we have never forgiven them for allying with the Picts in, er, I think it was 300 AD.
</p>
<p>
As all this hopefully indicates, I can see how a game based around understanding and manipulating the relationships between villages and counties could be entertaining, perhaps even radical. The builder/management genre is vast, mind you, and it's likely something similar has been attempted before.</p><p>I am hungry for specifics. What kinds of social organisation or leadership style will the game support? How extreme will the disparities be - could we end up in a situation reminiscent of Ursula Le Guin's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>, with villages of anarchists and capitalists treating each other like alien planets? Is warfare a feature? 
</p>
<p>
The press release will not say. It merely concludes that "we believe County of Fortune will resonate with players looking for something new in the genre - a deep, adaptive experience that challenges them to plan across the entire map, rather than focusing on individual cities." Fine, keep your secrets. But please, enough killing of genres. That's the kind of thing they get up to in Cheshire, when they're not making cats out of cheese.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/megalopolis-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Megalopolis </em>has a lot of mind and more on its shoulders. It is the presumptive capstone to Francis Ford Coppola’s 60-year career in film, the showpiece for which he has traded his long-running wine business, an 85-year-old’s sincere message of hope for the future of this world, and–unexpectedly, tragically–a dedication to Coppola’s late wife and collaborator of 61 years, Eleanor. It’s hard not to be moved by that dedication as the credits roll. But there’s also a brief pang: of all the films Coppola could have dedicated to her memory, <em>Megalopolis </em>is the one offered in tribute, a deeply silly paean to traditional virtues and structures, comforting itself that in the face of seemingly terminal decline and advancing evil, love will save us. “Dover Beach” but self-financed to the tune of 120 million dollars and featuring a scene where Aubrey Plaza plays a character named Wow Platinum who gets eaten out by Shia LeBeouf.</p><p>There is perhaps nothing quite so ominous about the opening minutes of <em>Megalopolis </em>than its clear debt to <em>The Fountainhead, </em>and specifically King Vidor’s misguided 1949 adaptation starring a thoroughly out-of-his-element Gary Cooper as Rand’s great hero, Howard Roark. Coppola’s equivalent is Adam Driver’s Cesar Catilina, shown here bestriding the skyline like an Olympian god before heroically dynamiting public housing.</p><p>Catilina, a polymath architect and engineer, has discovered a marvelous new material, megalon, that will enable him to build an urban utopia–a megalopolis, if you will–thanks to megalon’s power to resist and even reverse entropy, outlive the doomed decadence of his New Rome. (New Rome standing in here for New York, apparently in an alternate timeline where Tinto Brass’s <em>Caligula </em>remade American culture so thoroughly that forty years later the hottest thing going is still two girls with Roman maiden perms making out on top of a limo.) Megalon enables new architectural forms, like towering buildings that grow from the land like sequoias and coral, and incredible experiments in urban mobility like… moving walkways and escalators. But it is also the stuff of the gods, a sticking plaster for the body and spirit that can restore a shattered body and mind to perfect health.</p><figure></figure><p>Who would fight against re-founding society on the basis of megalon? Catilina’s adversary, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), the mayor of New Rome, who is rooted in the material present in contrast with Catilina’s focus on the immortal future. He is a well-meaning but overmatched functionary: late in the film, his daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) sees him not as a powerful ruler but a man mired in quicksand filling his office, blissfully doing paperwork at a desk that is canted downward like the deck of a sinking ship.</p><p>Julia becomes the chief point of contention between the two men, as she falls in love with Catilina right after he tells her what a vapid piece of crap she is. Here we must give credit to <em>The Last Jedi:</em> it recognized that Adam Driver or no, this is not the play. But here, Julia is a high-spirited woman-child who lets herself be guided by Catilina and in return functions as his muse. Grimly, the thing that breaks through their impasse is when she spies a child’s playset in Catilina’s office and he encourages her to play with it herself, awakening her to the beauty of his vision while revealing that she is sufficiently elevated to understand the future he seeks to build.</p><p>But Julia discovers that far from being a man of the future, Catilina’s eyes are locked on the past. In this he faintly echoes Coppola’s version of George S. Patton, another lonely visionary alternately inspired and haunted by what he sees through the veil of history: a world of Roman and Carthaginian triumphs and the glorious, pitiful dead baking in the Mediterranean sun. As the forces of reaction line up against Catilina and his brilliant creations, I was reminded most strongly of <em>Tucker: A Man and His Dream</em>, a movie I’d forgotten Coppola directed, where a lone auto designer finds himself the enemy of his industry because he dares to build the kind of better, safer car that Detroit loathes. </p><figure></figure><p>That film, more modest in its goals, was a more persuasive portrait of a capable dreamer with all the forces of malicious complacency and greed aligned against him–in part because his dream was easy to understand. Catilina’s vision of megalon and megalopolises is juvenile in its principles and its specifics: he is going to build a great, 15-minute city with moving walkways and buildings that look like Krypton by way of Hudson Yards’ Vessel. But the city doesn’t really matter, Catilina hastens to assure Julia and the audience at one point. What matters is the conversation <em>about </em>the city. At the climax of the film, Catilina wins the people over with a direct address from atop a coral-like prominence in his model megalopolis, intoning that what we need is a great debate about the future, in which all take part. It’s a prayer for democratization and civility from a character who seized control of the public square and public space and remade it in his image, but who thinks in opening the comments section he is saving civilization.</p><p>Driver and Esposito are good enough performers to make horrendous material almost workmanlike if they fully commit, and indeed, they prove a pair of sirens who lured Coppola away from the salvation of a rewrite. A good moment, suggestive of a better picture, arrives when Julia attempts to bring Catilina and Cicero together over a family meal. Catilina decides to engage the old man in a debate. His opening salvo sounds neat enough, and Cicero smiles appreciatively at the gesture before informing Catilina that he’s misidentified who he is quoting. “Mis-quoting, actually,” Cicero adds with a condescending little smile, before offering a rebuttal from Marcus Aurelius. For a moment the characters have the gravitas the film so often struggles to attain. If you have the option of putting Driver, Esposito, Emmanuel and Kathryn Hunter (playing Cicero’s wife) around a table to hash out their litany of issues, couldn’t that be 80% of the picture? Shouldn’t it be? You wonder how much better it might have been if the film had given free rein to its Shakespearean impulses rather than settling for quotation and pastiche.&nbsp;</p><p>But the intellectual pretense of <em>Megalopolis </em>is just that. The characters have so little to actually say. They just keep quoting Aurelius, the Roman philosopher-king who became so fashionable in recent decades, especially among the super-rich of Silicon Valley. Immediately you can see why Coppola fared so much better with <em>The Godfather</em>. Puzo’s novel had Machiavelli and Caesar and Augustine lurking in the background of every scene, but he knew it’s better if instead of quoting them a character just pulls out a gun and whacks somebody. Adapting him, Coppola threw out most of the speeches in the book and trusted filmmaking and acting to get the thrust across. With <em>Megalopolis</em>, it’s the opposite. When the character's have an idea, it feels like to get it across they have to sneak glances at copies of <em>Bartlett’s</em> between shots.</p><figure></figure><p>Coppola’s love for the material is evident. <em>Megalopolis </em>is bursting at the seams trying to fit in all the bits of moviemaking he adores. The element of Coppola’s filmmaking that I think is most satisfying here is that frequently and unashamedly works with the kinds of shots and sets that defined the silver screen filmmaking that the death of the studio system and the arrival of Coppola’s generation helped consign to history. If so much of <em>Megalopolis </em>is going to be filmed on soundstages with digital mattes, the scenes might as well evoke old movie sets: Catalina’s office is dressed and redressed to be a lavish Art Deco study, a cozy floating nest, and a bustling dream factory. An evening drive through the city takes on an otherworldly cast using reverse projection, the characters seeming to drive through a movie playing outside their windows.&nbsp;</p>

It was pulled so damn hard that Sony wiped it from their web pages and literally deleted it from the scant few customers’ accounts, as if trying to salt the earth from which it had once grown. It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.</p><p>So why, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to <em>SteamDB</em></a></span>, is <em>Concord</em> still regularly being updated, most recently on October 10?</p><p>The game is no longer available on Steam, and with the servers shut down, it’s not possible for anyone who <em>did</em> buy a copy to play any more. Not that this really interrupted many people’s schedules, given the multiplayer shooter somehow never managed more than a miniscule 697 playing at the same time. For context, at the time of writing, <em>Dune Awakening</em>, a game that <em>isn’t out until next year</em>, saw a peak of 696 people playing in the last 24 hours, while 2013's barely-known racing sim <em>rFactor 2 </em>saw 698. <em>Concord</em> was a AAA first-party Sony game released alongside an international advertising campaign. It’s <em>bemusing</em>.</p><h2 id="h199471"><a id=""></a>Someone, somewhere, is still playing <em>Concord</em></h2><p>Yet, someone, somewhere is still tweaking at its code. In fact, some people are still playing it. Admittedly only two of them in the last 24 hours, but five people were playing at once on October 5. They, logic dictates, can only be people from within Firewalk Studios, the in-house Sony development team who made the game.</p><p>Does this confirm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony’s vague allusion toward one day reviving the game</a></span>? It’s not impossible, obviously, and you can bet your teeth there are people at Sony in very expensive suits asking other people in very expensive suits how they can possible claw back some of the better part of half a billion dollars. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sonys-failed-shooter-concord-has-been-updated-dozens-of-times-on-steam-in-october-and-im-starting-to-feel-a-comeback/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/sonys-failed-shooter-concord-has-been-updated-dozens-of-times-on-steam-in-october-and-im-starting-to-feel-a-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> certainly seems to be more optimistic about this possibility.</p><p>My take is slightly different. I think there’s an office inside Firewalk’s Bellevue, Washington headquarters that’s been abandoned since the closure of the game. There’s still paperwork on various desks, a few small plushies hanging from the side of a monitor yet to be reclaimed, and a collection of old coffee mugs now growing mould. The lights haven’t been switched on for weeks, and there’s one ceiling tile hanging loose that no one’s pushed back into place. But if you were to walk past the glass doors of that room at 2 a.m., you would see the faint, blue light of a single monitor, casting its gloom on a hunched individual, a hoodie pulled up over their head, tapping away at the keyboard between furtive glances toward the door.</p><p>That’s Dave. Dave cannot let <em>Concord </em>go, no matter what is bosses have told him. Dave is going to save his game, you’ll see.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>GSC Game World, developers of Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, have confirmed that the game will run at 30 fps on the Xbox Series S at launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/stalker-2-interview-xbox-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-dlc-expansions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, the developers revealed that Stalker 2 will ‘stick to 30 fps’ for the Xbox Series S. On the Series X, the game runs at 60 fps, dropping to 55 at times. In some situations, the developers hit the 60 fps mark for the Series S, but the consistency did not match the likes of the Series X. However, GSC is “looking to get a performance mode for Xbox Series S, to get it to 60 FPS”, and they think “it’s possible”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers initially thought it would be “impossible” to release Stalker 2 for the Xbox Series S due to the game’s mechanics and “huge amount of things.” However, after they started optimizing, using Unreal Engine’s features for steaming information, and squeezing up “every megabyte from every piece of system content,” things began to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers added that, after optimizing Stalker 2 for the Xbox Series S, they believe any game can reach the platform’s “memory limits.” At the same time, they understand that not every developer has the time and resources to optimize. But GSC’s optimization efforts have also helped the PC build for the game, “making it a lot more performant.” Due to that, Stalker 2 has “quite low minimum PC requirements for a modern game.”</p>

                <p>During a Gamescom Asia panel, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden spoke about the current state of the gaming industry and how the disappearance of AA studios had contributed to a "collapse of creativity" in modern games. Layden explained how the rise in development costs had led to studios placing a stronger emphasis on post-launch monetization plans and following trends to remain risk-adverse.</p><p>"You didn't worry so much about the end piece, for better or for worse. Of course back then you didn't make a game for millions [of] dollars. So your risk tolerance was fairly high, Layden said (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shawn-layden-aa-is-gone-and-thats-a-threat-to-the-ecosystem-going-forward" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>). "Today, the entry costs for making a AAA game is in triple-digit millions now. I think, naturally, risk tolerance drops. And you're [looking] at sequels, you're looking at copycats, because the finance guys who draw the line say, 'Well, if Fortnite made this much money in this amount of time, my Fortnite knockoff can make this in that amount of time.' We're seeing a collapse of creativity in games today [with] studio consolidation and the high cost of production."</p>

<p>Layden added that while the quality of indie games had risen, the AA space that had been dominated by companies like Interplay, Gremlin, Ocean, and THQ has seemingly vanished. With the options being either indie games or AAA blockbusters, Layden believes that this is a dangerous situation for the gaming industry to be in right now.</p><p>"Now if we can just get a bit more interest and excitement and exposure for these lower-budget, but super-creative and super-unusual [types] of games. I'd like to see more of that. Because if we're just going to rely on the blockbusters to get us through, I think that's a death sentence," Layden said.</p><p>This isn't the first time that Layden has been vocal about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">game development costs have become unsustainable</a>, as back in 2020, he mentioned how the AAA industry needed to return to making more 12- to 15-hour games. Looking at PlayStation's performance this year, there might be some truth to those words as the company's big new live-service shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">Concord was taken offline shortly after launch</a>, while its new platformer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-is-the-best-reviewed-game-of-the-year-so-far/1100-6526323/" data-ref-id="1100-6526323">Astro Bot received an overwhelmingly positive reception</a>. While the sales numbers for Astro Bot haven't been revealed yet, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-sold-about-25000-copies-and-should-have-launched-as-a-free-game-analysts-say/1100-6526227/" data-ref-id="1100-6526227">it's likely far more than that of Concord</a>, given the circumstances.</p><p>Another example of a game with a strong single-player identity finding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-says-game-can-succeed-without-selling-absurd-number-of-units/1100-6526907/" data-ref-id="1100-6526907">commercial and critical success would be Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a>, as Saber Interactive chief creative officer Tim Willits recently spoke about how the game can succeed without needing to hit absurdly high sales figures.</p>

Well, if I knew exactly what it was and how to execute it, Disney would probably have hired me already to team up with Dave Filoni.

She's the sheriff of a small town called Wayfar. She's old, grizzled, and has a secret past with the Hutt Cartel harassing the town. She's also a Weequay, a species first seen in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi, one of many </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberForeheadAliens">rubber-forehead aliens</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> populating the posse of the slug gangster Jabba the Hutt.</span></p><div data-component="blockquote"><blockquote><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A brief diversion here: The Weequay are unfortunately one of many alien species first introduced on Tatooine that draws on tropes and stereotypes from pulp cinema. Tatooine is a simultaneous cinematic ode to Wild West films, pulpy adventures set in the Middle East, and the dreary Kansas farm of The Wizard of Oz. In Return of the Jedi, the Weequay are among a sea of dark-skinned alien goons inspired by the tropes of pulp cinema that first intimidate, then are killed off by, the predominantly white cast.</span></span></p></blockquote></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Weequay have been expanded since then in various spinoffs and licensed stories, the most beloved being the fabulous backstabbing space pirate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hondo_Ohnaka">Hondo Ohnaka</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If the year were 1986, she'd be a revelation. But in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, she is not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her flaws begin with her visual design and run right through how she interacts with the player. Ubisoft's artists seemed to have been given limited technical boundaries in their character design choices, so she and many other "experts" the players aren't that visually distinct from regular NPCs. At a distance you can clearly she fits the cowboy archetype, but her appearance only stands out at a close distance—and even then, she's not that distinctive from other generic Weequay that fill out the game.</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis, via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She's a familiar sheriff archetype, but she's a spiky-faced alien. "Familiar but with a twist" in theory, but "familiar but familiar" in practice if you consider how audiences are probably used to spikey-faced aliens like her across many mediums. It doesn't help that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is stuffed to the gills with Star Wars aliens made more "human" by their fluent grasp of English.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her story arc, unfortunately, also feels "familiar but familiar." As mentioned, Wayfar is being harassed by gangsters demanding its impoverished residents pay them money. She and the player character Kay Vess fend off a pair of raids by the bandits, the kind we've seen time and time again in films like High Noon. My heart dropped as the first of these setpieces stepped through the familiar tropes. The town is empty. The sheriff ventures onto the main street. The gangsters ride in. Everyone's hands drift to their guns. Then she quickdraws, blasts them dead, and gameplay begins as more rush in. "Familiar, but familiar" strikes again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sequence plays out similarly later on, when Quint teaches the player how to improve their own quickdraw ability, Adrenaline Rush (which works like the quickdraw ability from Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption series).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft Massive unfortunately undercut its own "high noon" scenes by giving the player a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>far better</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> experience with Adrenaline Rush, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a great example of "familiar, but with a twist." Ubisoft did a fantastic job bringing in rapid camera swings and making it the core combat while racing on a speeder bike. It's dynamic, punchy, and far more interesting to do than watch it play out in a cutscene.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the player's time with Quint, unfortunately, is stuck in the same gunslinging tropes. Her relationship to the Hutt Cartel is also dulled by the fact that the player can become very good friends with the Hutt Cartel, meaning they're no worse than the sheriff, who's remorseful about her time as a hired killer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the familiar tropes of the Wild West sheriff are meant to be juiced up with that Star Wars alien vibe—but just making her a Weequay isn't enough to stop her from blending into the gorgeous backgrounds of the Great Chott Salt Flat.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ND-5 is a droid like no other">ND-5 is a droid like no other</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All right you've eaten your vegetables and now it's time for dessert. And that dessert is ND-5, a BX-series droid commando (first seen in the Star Wars: Clone Wars animated series) assigned to Kay by gangster Jaylen Vrax. The second he walked onscreen, my spouse exclaimed—and this is a word-for-word quote—"Why does he have a slutty waist?!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yes, as you may have heard, ND-5 has joined the ranks of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-outlaw-ubisoft-hot-droid-video-game-1850545405">attractive robots in the video game canon.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> He's a character that shows where Ubisoft Massive does succeed with "familiar, but with a twist." What makes ND-5 work is that he bridges the familiarity gap across Star Wars and other stories—he's not just a familiar archetype shaped by Star Wars, he's a Star Wars archetype shaped by other influences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ND-5 is a "familiar" character in adventure stories, in that he's the brooding, gravelly-voiced muscle assigned to the heroine whose cold exterior hides a comforting core. Some stories might cast him as a romantic interest, but this one only allows the player to lust after him from the other side of the screen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "twist" is that he's a droid. But then he's "familiar" again, because he's a droid the audience has likely seen before. Even if you don't know about the BX-series commandos (they were introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, seen in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but never depicted in any films or live-action shows), he's close enough in design to the comic relief B1 battle droids introduced in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace to strike that sense of recognition. There's something potent about taking a character design designed to evoke comedy and gently nudging it towards brooding gruffness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>are</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> familiar with BX commandos, "familiar but with a twist" strikes again. BX droids are often depicted as hunched forward with slim profiles. ND-5 stands tall and wears a trench coat that gives him artificially broad shoulders. The coat standing open also casts a contrasting silhouette for his body, which draws the eye to the uh, "slutty waist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And let's not beat around the bush, his always-open coat and scars across his chest look vaguely inspired by a romance novel cover. A familiar look made fresh on this droid's body.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The trend continues with his role in the story. Because he's a machine bound by a restraining bolt, his relationship with Kay takes a different relationship than if it were human. He repeatedly rejects Kay's offers to help him reclaim his independence, at one point telling her emphatically, "I am not broken."</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Except when he says it, you can't help but feel he might mean the opposite. Actor Jay Rincon really put some grit into that line. It's only made all the more heartbreaking by an encounter with a dying (deactivating?) BX droid commando in a sidequest that unveils more of ND-5's backstory. While the gravel-voiced droid explains the history of the Clone Wars and his time fighting in it, the dying droid repeatedly begs for help finishing its mission, repeating the words "I am broken" over and over again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These droids, who the player might have known to be villains, are given a shred of sympathy by portraying them through the eyes of a character who wouldn't have her own preconceptions of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">ND-5's twists are familiar, and what's familiar is also a twist. The philosophy works here because traits from one category also fit inside the other. His mishmash of references gives players the freedom to forget what they expected from the character and plenty of room to take him as he is.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Don't just rely on &quot;familiar but different&quot;">Don't just rely on "familiar but different"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I documented a number of other positive and negative "familiar but with a twist" examples across </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(shoutout to the developers behind the quest "The Heavy," you know what you did), but Quint and ND-5 make for great compare-and-contrasts. It's also worth playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in close proximity, just to see how Respawn Entertainment's swing at the series produces feels far more fresh in the same setting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Familiar but with a twist" is a common "pillar" you'll find in many game design documents. It's a quick way to explain your game to financiers and investors, and it can help developers think outside the box when conceiving game mechanics, character design, art environments, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're not careful, the phrase can put you back inside the box you hoped to escape.</span></p><p>Image by Bryant Francis via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What would be better would be to search for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>specifics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in how you blend familiar concepts. I cracked open the art book for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, and found references to paintings by Lawrence alma-Tadema's paintings, illustrations from LIFE Magazine by Chesley Bonstell, and the '60s TV show Swiss Family Robinson. You can trace a line from the referenced art to images in the film itself, and all those specifics tell us more about the power of Star Wars than the fabled monomyth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All apologies to Gerighty but "familiar, with a twist" is not the "X factor" I've been trying to name. I am thus cursed again to cast out in search of the words that will capture why I keep coming back to the world's most corporate-friendly franchise that sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.starwars.com/series/andor">reaches right into my soul</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other times </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.starwars.com/series/star-wars-ahsoka">makes me want to tear my hair out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Unity has today launched its new engine globally, Unity 6, which its CEO wants "at the heart of game development for years to come".</p>
<p>The company promises its new suite of tools will allow for quicker and more efficient game development, with a focus on "end-to-end multiplayer workflows", tools for targeting mobile web, and "new graphics capabilities" to boost CPU performance.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a tough time for Unity as it aims to turn around its reputation with developers after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-reveals-plans-to-charge-per-game-install-drawing-criticism-from-development-community">controversial Runtime Fee debacle</a>.</p>

<p>That fee was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developers-react-to-astonishing-scumbag-move-of-unitys-new-install-charge">heavily criticised by game developers</a> and then, last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-cancels-controversial-fees-to-use-its-game-engine-tools-a-year-after-introduction">cancelled entirely</a>.</p>
<p>With that cancellation, CEO Matt Bromberg described the company's aim of "democratising game development" by allowing games to be built by anyone. "I’ve been able to connect with many of you over the last three months, and I’ve heard time and time again that you want a strong Unity, and understand that price increases are a necessary part of what enables us to invest in moving gaming forward. But those increases needn’t come in a novel and controversial new form," he said.</p>
<p>Unity 6 has been "built, tested and refined in partnership with developers from all over the world", with the company committed to long-term support.</p>
<p>"We are relentlessly focused on delivering tools to help game developers build games more quickly and efficiently while also facilitating innovation," said Bromberg. "We're going to do everything we can to ensure that Unity 6 is at the heart of game development for years to come."</p><p>Unity has also released resources to show off the new toolset's capabilities. That includes the conceptual cinematic demo Time Ghost, you can watch for yourself above, as well as two playable demos: mobile game <a href="https://unity.com/demos/fantasy-kingdom">Fantasy Kingdom</a> and cross-platform multiplayer game <a href="https://unity.com/demos/megacity-competitive-action-sample">Megacity Metro</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">Unity also began the year with a round of layoffs</a>, eliminating around 25 percent of its workforce as part of a "company reset".</p>
<p>Interestingly, there's no mention of AI in Unity's initial announcement, despite the fact it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-6-engine-will-launch-next-year-with-expansion-of-responsibly-sourced-ai-tools">previously stated Unity 6 would arrive with "responsibly sourced" AI tools</a>. </p>
<p>In a report earlier this year, Unity claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62 percent of studios are using AI</a> at some point during game development, with animation as the primary use case.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/temtem-swarm-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Crema has announced the&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, with the&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em>spinoff set to release next month.</p>
<p>Per a Steam post, the game will arrive via Steam Early Access on November 13th, and it'll cost you just $9.99, although it'll be cheaper in Poland and Brazil due to the way regional Steam pricing works.</p>
<p>Perhaps somewhat unusually for an Early Access release, Crema also says it doesn't intend to raise&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm</em>'s price at any stage, although it does "reserve the right to adjust the price at a later date" following particularly significant updates or extra content.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temtem-swarm-early-access-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=0DBVbiAk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temtem-swarm-early-access-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=b8Ee1Xtg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>officially brings its creature-collecting bullet heaven chaos in November.</figcaption></figure><p>In its announcement post, Crema goes into detail regarding why it's chosen to release&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>in Early Access.</p>
<p>The studio acknowledges that "Early Access games have a bad rep sometimes" (although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-rest-for-wicked-ceo-early-access-comments">not from certain sectors of the industry</a>), but goes on to say that Early Access is a good model for the bullet heaven genre "because of all the fine-tuning and tweaking".</p>
<p>Crema says that in order to "refine gameplay, balance the world, and ensure&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>is the most exciting and engaging it can be", Early Access is a necessary step.</p>
<p>As Crema itself points out, it's already enjoyed a successful Early Access launch with the release of creature-collecting RPG&nbsp;<em>Temtem&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-like-temtem-release-date-set-for-january-2020">back in January 2020</a>, which the developer says "demonstrated our commitment to community-driven development".</p>

<p>According to Crema,&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>will be in Early Access for "around a year", during which it will be refined and tweaked in order to incorporate player feedback and add all of the content the devs have planned for it.</p>
<p>When the Early Access launch rolls around,&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em>will offer a solo mode and co-op support for two or three players, as well as a number of playable Temtem creatures, maps, and bosses to fight.</p>
<p>More will be added over the course of&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm</em>'s development, and you can read more about what exactly Crema has planned for&nbsp;<em>Temtem: Swarm&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2510960/view/4512135723845292087" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the original Steam post</a>.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-shutting-down-following-square-enix-cease-and-desist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VGC report</a>&nbsp;(which cites a message sent on the archive's Discord server), the owners of Accord's Library were contacted by Square Enix's legal department recently.</p>
<p>That contact resulted in what the archive's owners call "some private communication", and based on "the outlined requirements" of that communication, the site is shutting down permanently on October 31st.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/accords-library-square-enix-yoko-taro.jpg?itok=JzdmA-Qs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/accords-library-square-enix-yoko-taro.jpg?itok=iiOfk69Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Accord's Library is an exhaustive Yoko Taro resource, but it's shutting down soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Per the VGC report, Accord's Library's moderators are "sad [they] have to go", but they say they "also must respect the wishes of the [Square Enix] legal team".</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Yoko Taro, he's the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Drakengard&nbsp;</em>franchises, serving as game director on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>(and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-replicant-release-date-and-editions-announced">its remaster</a>) and PlatinumGames' followup&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/nier-automata"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down">now-defunct</a> mobile spinoff&nbsp;<em>Nier Reincarnation</em>.</p>
<p>As a creative force, he's well-known for his unconventional approach to game design; the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise is itself technically a distant sequel to&nbsp;<em>Drakengard</em>, taking place after one of the first&nbsp;<em>Drakengard</em>&nbsp;games' myriad endings.</p>
<p>Taro is also known for his eccentric public persona; he routinely wears a comically oversized mask of&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>pseudo-mascot Emil&nbsp;for interviews and presentations, and he's previously expressed a dislike of being photographed as well.</p>

<p>While it's quite often more the MO of companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-2d-receives-cease-and-desist">like Nintendo</a> to issue cease and desist orders, Square Enix has handed out its fair share of them as well, perhaps most notably to fan projects like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Resurrection</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this likely spells the permanent end of Accord's Library; given the nature of the project, it's unlikely the site could return in some other form. Still, one never knows. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Join us right here to watch this today's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, which kicks off this evening at 6pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
If you're over the pond, that's 10am Pacific, or 1pm Eastern time. What do you mean you're supposed to be working?!
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has promised a "no-fluff, all-games broadcast" lasting 25 minutes, featuring games coming to Xbox consoles, PC and Game Pass. Specifically, these are games made by third-parties - not Xbox itself - so there will be no Fable or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> here.
</p>
<p>
Instead, we're expecting a proper look (and a release date) for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>'s Control-themed Lake House expansion, plus a fresh dive into Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. Dark fantasy action game Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will also feature, alongside other, unspecified "world premieres".

			<p id="ogozdf">In early 2004, the world was shaking it like a Polaroid picture, flocking to theaters to see what was going to happen with all those hobbits, and wondering if that Tom Brady guy was something special. Meanwhile, a few folks around the world were inventing the web as we know it now: A world-shaking social network was brewing in a Harvard dorm room. A Google employee was dreaming up the future of email in their spare time. The coolest cellphone of all time was just about to drop. The internet was still a niche activity, but that was about to change — and fast.</p><p id="LFbBoj">In so many ways, the digital world in which we now all live was created 20 years ago. Google went public and began to ascend to rule the web. Facebook, Gmail, Firefox, Flickr, and Digg all launched — the year Web 2.0 became the web. “Blog” and “the long tail” were on no one’s radar before 2004, and since then, they’ve been everywhere. The United States went through a contentious election, a bunch of sequels dominated the box office, and Apple launched a new product that looked very cool but was ultimately eclipsed by a better product a year later. Okay, some things never change.</p><p id="jnd666">Every year is a big year in tech, of course, but 2004 was an especially big one. And <em>The Verge </em>didn’t exist yet! So, this week, we’ll have stories on the best and most important gadgets and platforms that launched that year and pieces about the cultural events that still affect the way we live now. Basically, we’re going to blog like it’s 2004.</p><p id="DmGA3g"><em>Want to talk about our stories, your memories, and all your raddest photos from the early aughts? </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24270606/2004-week-tech-internet-gadgets-phones-pop-culture?showComments=1"><em>Come hang here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

			<p>Following BioWare's release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-heavy-pc-specs-and-no-denuvo-confirmation-ps5-pro-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed Dragon Age: The Veilguard PC system requirements</a>, some players might be worried whether they'll be able to play the game smoothly on their configurations.</p>
<p>Thankfully, NVIDIA has announced today that the game will be available for cloud streaming via the GeForce NOW platform from day one. Moreover, they have also announced a limited time offer to get the game for free if you purchase a six-month GFN subscription for the Ultimate tier.</p>
<p>Considering that the game is otherwise priced at $59.99, that would reduce the cost of the six-month GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription from $100 to $40, provided you were interested in buying Dragon Age: The Veilguard to begin with. The offer is valid starting today until October 30, the day before the game's launch.</p>
<p>GFN Ultimate subscribers will also be able to experience the game at its best, playing at 4K HDR with NVIDIA DLSS 3, NVIDIA Reflex, and ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/retrorealms-ash-vs-evil-dead-review-fist-full-of-boomstick<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> feels like a throwback to the nascent days of the 1990s. A video game tie-in to a famous movie property packed with familiar imagery compressed into 16-bit sprites. Much like the best of those titles, it's an experience that is better than expected but still has a questionable price tag for the content provided.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-shotgun-blast.jpg?itok=_hPaJ7H5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-shotgun-blast.jpg?itok=tvlXqsWu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Name's Ash. Housewares.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> Review – Klaatu Barada Necktie</h2>
<p>As the name implies, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is based on the bloody horror comedy series. Ash Williams, boomstick enthusiast and slayer of evil is caught in a conundrum. An all-powerful eldritch horror from beyond mortal ken, known as The Overlord, has stolen the Necronomicon.</p>
<p>Using this forbidden tome of ancient power, The Overlord plans on plunging the world into a living nightmare filled with demons and death. Thankfully, Ash is still the same braggadocious, hard-drinking, chainsaw-wielding badass who is no stranger to carving up monsters.</p>
<p><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is an arcade platformer. You'll alternate between navigating dangerous platforms, fighting demons and deadites, and picking up collectibles along the way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-nightmare-world.jpg?itok=KqmQTd7c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-nightmare-world.jpg?itok=ECnXqBD1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just another day in the life, huh Ash?</figcaption></figure><p>Ash's moveset is familiar and functional. You have a melee attack, a <em>Ducktales</em>-esque plunging attack, a dodge roll, and a chargeable shotgun blast attack. There are consumable weapons you can pick up to help in a fight like kandarian daggers, nail guns, and oil lanterns. Ash even has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mega-man-zero-zx-legacy-collection-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mega Man</em></a> wall kick, letting him scale up narrow passageways with ease.</p>
<p><em>Retrorealms Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> has some light RPG elements. Killing enemies and finding hidden collectibles earns you cash which you can spend on certain upgrades. These include health and ammo upgrades and new moves like a spinning slash or a rising uppercut.</p>
<p>Lastly, the game has a unique selling point with the nightmare realm. At the push of a button, you can temporarily switch to a nightmare version of the level. This contains tougher enemies as well as hidden passages and platforms that can lead to hidden rewards. Those rewards include three Necronomicon pages tucked away in each level, and special golden tickets. Golden tickets can be spent to unlock special 3D props from the <em>Evil Dead</em> series. If you want to find everything, you will need to be quick and careful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-boss-fight-jump-scare.jpg?itok=LNcXRtgR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-ash-boss-fight-jump-scare.jpg?itok=k9daauMX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This jumpscare got a laugh out of me.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> Review – Good? Bad? I'm The Guy With The Gun</h2>
<p>If you're a big fan of the <em>Evil Dead</em> series, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is a nostalgic treat. The dialogue perfectly emulates Ash Williams' B-movie charm. The game is packed full of locations, characters, and boss fights from the Starz series. For example, Ash's healing items are his “Pink F” cocktails and levels end by getting into Ash's iconic ride, The Delta. There are even enemies based on the goofy deadite puppets.</p>
<p>It's the kind of fan service that helps gloss over the game's tissue-thin plot. In arcade fashion, you just hop from location to location with bosses popping up because The Overlord summoned them. For a game based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/evil-deadthe-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Evil Dead</em></a>, that campy, “don't think about it too hard” energy works for the experience, but it does make the story feel light and frivolous.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the visual presentation is spot on. Wayforward continues its stellar reputation of detailed, expressive sprite animation in this game. Every character moves fluidly and gracefully. Areas are packed with background gags and colorful pop. Also, as befits something based on a Sam Raimi property, fights end in ludicrous explosions of pixelated blood and gore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-shopping-mart-level.jpg?itok=9r5IG81b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-shopping-mart-level.jpg?itok=-UnaD8od 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guess who gets to supervise you blockheads tonight?</figcaption></figure><p>As for the level design, it is brisk and breezy. The nightmare world mechanic introduces some light exploration, risk, and reward. There's a decent mix of verticality, environmental hazards, and enemy variety to make each section a solid challenge.</p>
<p>The difficulty curve can be annoying. There are sections of the game that can feel patently unfair about halfway through. Medusa head enemies. Precision platforming challenges over deadly spike traps. Monster closet ambushes. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Exacerbating these frustrations is the game's lack of checkpoints. There is a single checkpoint in each level, and unless you pumped all of your resources into health upgrades, you may see certain gauntlets more often than others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-eligos-boss-fight.jpg?itok=-Qdd7oU_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-eligos-boss-fight.jpg?itok=qd4iB1w8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hey look, it's that guy from that show.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, if you strictly care about content by volume with your purchases, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> may ask too much for too little. I ended up rolling credits while getting most of the collectibles after about 75 minutes of gameplay. For a price tag of $24.99, that can be a bit steep, even for retro arcade fans.</p>
<p>But, these issues aren't exactly dealbreakers. Since the game is trying to emulate an old arcade game, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> encourages replayability. In addition to finding all of the hidden tickets and Necronomicon pages, the game has a scoring system. If you enjoy doing no-hit runs or speed runs, this game can go from a one-hour experience to a five-hour experience easily. Just know what you're getting into before checking out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-michael-myers-boss-fight.jpg?itok=XX-_XKem 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-ash-vs.-evil-dead-michael-myers-boss-fight.jpg?itok=1-uY1UJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to see how this goes down? It'll cost you.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> Review – Did Someone Say Crossover?</h2>
<p>I must also mention that <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is just one game in the <em>Retrorealms</em> series. Furthermore, if you purchase other games in the Retrorealms line, you can play as different characters in those different arcade titles. If you own <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> and <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em>, that means you can play through Haddonfield with Ash or stab up deadites as Michael Myers.</p>
<p>This applies, to downloadable characters as well. For <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em>, you can play as Kelly Maxwell. Aside from some dialogue changes and sprite animation, her playstyle is similar to Ash's. She's mostly there for completionists.</p>
<p>The idea of mixing and matching horror icons in these different arcade games is a nice conceit, but I am concerned it prioritizes fan service over gameplay polish. While I enjoyed my time with <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em>, it's the kind of light experience that I don't think will be livened up with other replayable characters. And if other titles are similarly priced, it may be the wrong kind of horrifying for the player base.</p>

<p>If you're a horror fan who is content with a short runtime and a dubious pricetag, <em>Retrorealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead</em> is a bloody Halloween treat. But like any sugary Halloween treat, it's one you should savor, lest you end up with a stomachache and buyer's remorse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/retrorealms-halloween-review-familiar-shape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> is an uncanny experience. It invokes the old trend of 1990s movie tie-in games. Ones that vaguely use the framework of its source material for a pixel-art arcade platformer. Given the convoluted nonsense of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halloween-games-unreal-engine-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Halloween</em></a> franchise, it isn't the strangest thing to happen, but it may ask a bit upfront with its price tag.</p>
<h2><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> Review –&nbsp; A Thing of Evil</h2>
<p>Much like other games in the series, <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> involves a sinister plot by an eldritch horror called The Overlord. The Overlord wants to pull the human world into the world of nightmares. To that end, he will need a champion to cleave a path of carnage, blood, and terror through the world. So he has selected the iconic Shape himself: Michael Myers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-overlord-screenshot.jpg?itok=NpXbLdop 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-overlord-screenshot.jpg?itok=Hh2N0GZq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This will totally not bite him in the ass. Totally. Probably.</figcaption></figure><p>To ensure the Haddonfield killer listens, The Overlord has taken something precious to him: the tombstone of his sister Judith. Of course, nothing good ever comes from someone trying to control or guide Michael Myers. Thus begins a bloody massacre through the local town spread across five levels.</p>
<p>Myers' move list is familiar to other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/retrorealms-ash-vs-evil-dead-review-fist-full-of-boomstick" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Retrorealms</em></a> protagonists. You have a simple attack, a short-range teleport, and a wall kick. Myers can also pick up consumable weapons such as pitchforks, sickles, and bloody fire axes to stun and kill enemies at range. Lastly, Myers' has a chargeable dashing slash that lets him cover short distances.</p>
<p>The level design continues the series' nightmare world gimmick, adding a light level of exploration. At any point in a level, you can teleport to a darker, more twisted version of the level with harder enemies and alternate paths. Alternate paths filled with collectible Jack-O-Lanterns and Golden Tickets. Golden Tickets that can be exchanged for collectible 3D exhibit pieces from the <em>Halloween</em> series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-nightmare-world-screenshot.jpg?itok=4sWE4AYJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-nightmare-world-screenshot.jpg?itok=sGXR_-Dc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thank you convenient conveyor belts.</figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetically, <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> has a lot going for it. The sprite animation looks great. There's a great synth soundtrack, including a funky remix of the iconic <em>Halloween</em> theme song.</p>
<p>The shoestring plot contains boss fights and cameos from franchise characters. A personal highlight is a double boss fight with Laurie Strode and Doctor Loomis. You collect candy corn as part of the game's light RPG elements between levels. The game even has item placements inside innocent civilians you need to stab.</p>
<p>If you want to feel like Michael Myers in an arcade platformer, this looks and sounds the part.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-spike-trap.jpg?itok=MDKtv8EN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-spike-trap.jpg?itok=NMuD_zvK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Easy....eeaaasyy....</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> Review – Evil Dies Tonight</h2>
<p>What keeps <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> from being a perfect marriage of retro gameplay and movie license are small but annoying issues. Aside from consumables, Michael doesn't have a long-range option. His dash attack can be interrupted by enemy projectiles. This becomes a problem when enemies start chucking acid and explosive vials. Worse still, it's a problem exacerbated by multiple demon eye enemies firing eye beams in the nightmare world sections</p>
<p>Michael Myers feels a bit stiffer compared to other <em>Retrorealms</em> characters. There's a slight delay in his teleport dash, making it difficult to pull off in the thick of a fight. In addition, his standard knife attack is lacking in reach. Pair this with some other annoying game design decisions: constantly spawning flying enemies and monster closets, and there is more frustration than joy in this arcade throwback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-ghost-boss-fight.jpg?itok=f6sz_PfC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/retrorealms-halloween-ghost-boss-fight.jpg?itok=X1yd5vSg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They say the past haunts us, but this is ridiculous.</figcaption></figure><p>Part of this may come down to the limitations of the movie license. Outside of the Mark of Thorn, <em>Halloween</em> doesn't dabble in supernatural elements. It's just a masked killer and his next victim. That elegant simplicity works well in something like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/behaviour-red-hook-purchase" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dead By Daylight</em></a> but can lead to creative issues in a retro platformer. Because of this, the game leans more on its original demon monsters to pick up the slack and ends up clashing with Michael Myers' appeal.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean <em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> is a complete waste of time. There are setpieces and boss fights that work wonderfully here. But when you are charging $24.99 for a game with a run time of just over an hour with expectations of replaying it, these little moments can add up significantly.</p>

Alright, let's see if I can stumble through this.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Retrorealms: Halloween</em> gets the look and sound of its source material down, but stumbles in spots with its retro platforming gameplay. Coupled with a steep asking price and its horror-themed experience that is more trick than treat.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-88278" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial summary released yesterday</a>, Don't Nod reiterated that the studio has had a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024">pretty trying time</a> so far this year, once again pointing to the underperformance of first-half releases&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>&nbsp;</em>as motivating factors.</p>
<p>That release also confirms that "up to 69 jobs" may be at risk in what the studio is calling a "reorganization project to safeguard its competitiveness in an increasingly demanding and competitive ecosystem", but STJV isn't happy with this announcement or the way it was made to employees.</p>

<p>According to STJV, Don't Nod workers' representatives were informed about the layoffs in a meeting yesterday. They "were not told in advance about the meeting's topic", and they also weren't provided with "any documents and information" prior to the meeting.</p>
<p>STJV says Don't Nod employees have been raising alarms about the company's situation for over a year, and that former HR head Matthieu Hoffman described layoffs as "unimaginable" (STJV's quote, not Hoffman's) in summer, just three months before yesterday's announcement.</p>
<p>The union also says that Don't Nod management is hiding its "failures" and "inconsistent decisions" behind "excuses" like the state of the economy and the competitive nature of the gaming industry.</p>

<p>The union calls for "a social movement like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">the one currently happening at Ubisoft</a>", calling on Don't Nod employees to "mobilize to save their jobs and working conditions". Strong words indeed. We'll have to wait and see if they bear fruit.</p>

<p>CL4L has clinched the NA LCQ ahead of the BLAST R6 Montreal Major and will be the first non-pro team to appear at a Rainbow Six Siege Major in <strong>five years</strong>. This remarkable achievement comes with a helping of disappointment for other teams, namely C9 Beastcoast, the underdog side that won the BLAST R6 Manchester Major in May.</p>



<p>CL4L eliminated C9BC, OXG, and Wildcard on their way to Montreal. From their respective bedrooms and remote setups, Beeno, Packer, Atom, Gity, and Tristan slammed T1 teams into the dust to secure this memorable achievement.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-believe">Believe</h2>



<p>CL4L is a non-professional side made up of mostly professional players, but some haven’t even graced a Pro League before hitting the qualification spot for a BLAST R6 Major. It could be the journey of a lifetime if the team can win big in Montreal next month, but that’s a <strong>huge </strong>ask.</p>



<p>The recent qualification matches that CL4L put out in the NA LCQ were nothing short of electrifying:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The BLAST R6 Montreal Major is a $750,000 tournament that’s set to unfold between November 7 – 17, and so far, some big hitters have qualified:</p>



<ul>
<li>Team BDS</li>



<li>Team Secret</li>



<li>DarkZero Esports</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>w7m Esports</li>



<li>Team Liquid</li>
</ul>



<p>A few teams are still yet to find their place in the tournament, but in the coming days, all will be settled.</p>



<p>CL4L making the cut is nothing short of staggering. The team is so rudimentary it doesn’t have any social media profiles or pages on platforms like Liquipedia, it’s just a few guys teaming up to play Rainbow Six Siege together, and ruling the roost while doing so. In Montreal, 20 teams will walk in – will CL4L walk out with a trophy?</p>



<p>Let us know your expectations for CL4L on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has not been approved for release in Kuwait. At this time, the title will not be available for release in region. As a result, all preorders in Kuwait will be cancelled and refunded to the original point of purchase. We remain hopeful that local authorities will reconsider, and allow players in Kuwait to enjoy this all-new experience in the Black Ops series.</blockquote><p>Activision failed to explain the reason for Black Ops 6’s Kuwait ban, but it probably had something to do with its setting.

        <p>In <em>Taboo Trial</em>, combat lies at the heart of the game. However, the enemies aren’t traditional <a title="Genres > RPG [16,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> monsters or creatures but rather an array of mechanical constructs. This unique twist adds a fresh and innovative feel to the game. Players must master combat skills and display courage as they continually engage in battles against mechanical foes to defend the Nordic mythological world.</p><p>One notable aspect of the combat system is that it requires not only quick reflexes but also the strategic use of items and abilities. Items dropped during combat play a crucial role—players can purchase various upgrades in shop rooms or obtain in-game boosts such as Valkyrie blessings and rune enhancements. These upgrades not only increase combat strength but also add layers of strategy to the gameplay, making players even more immersed in the game’s world.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Taboo-Trial-PS5_10-17-24_001.jpeg"></a></figure><p><strong>Rich Battle <a title="Genres > Strategy [199 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a></strong></p><p>In <em>Taboo Trial</em>, defeating monsters may cause them to drop gold, which can be used to purchase various enhancements, boosting your character’s abilities.

These rings drop upon the first defeat of the boss at each difficulty level, providing players with more choices and strategies. This system encourages players to attempt challenges at different difficulty levels to unlock interesting items, leading to more diverse combat experiences.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Taboo-Trial-PS5_10-17-24_002.jpeg"></a></figure><p><strong>Character Bonding and Game Enjoyment</strong></p><p>In <em>Taboo Trial</em>, players are not only tasked with battling mechanical creations but also building relationships with various Valkyries.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 - Campaign Intel Drop Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The exact reason why Kuwait did not approve Black Ops 6 for release is unknown. However, some speculate it has to do with the portrayal of the Middle East given that Black Ops 6's campaign focuses on the Gulf War. Saddam Hussein has been featured in advertisements for Black Ops 6, and many believe the campaign could feature the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait that kicked off the Gulf War.</p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pakistan-bans-black-ops-ii-medal-of-honor-warfighter/1100-6402835/" data-ref-id="1100-6402835">Black Ops 2 was banned in Pakistan</a> after store owners raised concerns that the game depicts the country as a training ground for terrorism.</p><p>Activision could theoretically edit or censor Black Ops 6 to appease local authorities in Kuwait, and there is precedent for this. Activision previously <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/No_Russian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed the "No Russian" mission from Modern Warfare 2</a> to appease authorities in Russia, while <a href="https://censorship.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_World_at_War" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World at War's Nazi references were removed for the game's German release.</a> Whether or not Activision will edit or adjust Black Ops 6 for Kuwait is unknown.</p><p>Some developers refuse to compromise on their vision and opt to straight-up cancel a game for a specific region if a country's ratings board denies a game for release. For example, Krafton opted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-canceled-in-japan-to-avoid-censoring-content/1100-6508674/" data-ref-id="1100-6508674">cancel The Callisto Protocol's release in Japan</a>, saying it was unwilling to edit the game for creative reasons. Other studios have found fun and creative ways to get around local rules. For example, South Park: The Stick of Truth was censored in Australia and Germany due to scenes involving anal-probing, abortion, and swastikas. During certain censored scenes an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/south-park-rpg-censorship-feels-like-a-double-standard-co-creator-says/1100-6418167/" data-ref-id="1100-6418167"> image of a statute making a face-palming gesture appears</a>, along with text describing what you would have seen in the uncut version. In Australia, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-uses-crying-koala-picture-to-circumvent-australian-censors/1100-6416827/" data-ref-id="1100-6416827">the game used an image of a crying koala during the probing scene</a>, leaving it up to the players' imagination.</p><p>Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-launch-times-detailed/1100-6527163/" data-ref-id="1100-6527163">launches on October 25</a>, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">will be available on Game Pass at launch</a>.

It was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-launches-this-november-on-nintendo-switch">released on Switch in 2022</a>, and, more recently, the game was said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-movie-enters-development-at-amazon-studios-dwayne-johnson-may-star">getting a film adaptation</a>, with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson involved. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has hit a big sales milestone, and the game managed to achieve said milestone in just a few days.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001019.000050711.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;managed to rack up a million sales by October 11th, which is just three days after the game's launch on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>The fact that&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is a console exclusive, with an Xbox port <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around a year away at least</a>, arguably makes that milestone more impressive. Here's hoping this leads Konami to think about making more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>games in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=75oyakmx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=QJxWSG76 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pyramid Head wants to know if you've gone out and bought&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>yet.</figcaption></figure><p>The one million figure combines physical shipments and digital sales, although Konami doesn't say how those two are weighted, so we don't know whether the digital or physical version of the game has proven more popular.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, it's a reimagining of the 2001 survival horror classic developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team.</p>
<p>Although it remains fairly faithful to the original game's story, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake shifts the action to a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>-style over-the-shoulder perspective and expands the world too, allowing you to explore more areas of the titular town.</p>
<p>Naturally, the visuals and overall presentation have been improved as well, and the remake also adds new cutscenes to expand the story a little, so this is a more substantial remake than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed"><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em></a>, for instance.</p>

<p>It's a good time for remakes of survival horror classics from the 2000s. Yesterday, Capcom announced that its&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m">surpassed eight million sales</a>, a pretty impressive figure in itself (although one that still pales in comparison to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million">mighty&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>).</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-ops-6-cross-platform-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Ops 6 is 2024’s Call of Duty release, and it has been a long time coming. Activision has put a lot of money and effort into producing and marketing this stellar title, and fans worldwide were excited about it from the moment the first trailers aired. In this modern, ever-connected world, gamers everywhere have one key question: ‘Is Black Ops 6 cross-platform?’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-crossplay">Is Black Ops 6 Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6, like every Call of Duty game since 2019, is fully cross-platform compatible. That means that if you have a PlayStation 5, nothing is stopping you from joining forces with your friends, even if one is on Xbox Series X and the other is on PC. </p>



<p>Modern Call of Duty games are linked more by a centralised Activision-backed account system than they are by individual platform identity networks. That means that regardless of your platform, you’ll be matched up with players on other formats. That of course does bring about a fair share of problems.</p>



<p>It means as a console player, you could be matched with PC players – and some gamers <strong>fear that</strong>. It’s no big secret that PC players have access to more sophisticated cheats, which is a massive issue with the Call of Duty ecosystem.</p>



<p>But fear not – you can <strong>turn off crossplay in Black Ops 6</strong> in the in-game menu. That’ll lock you to matchmaking exclusively with others on your format of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-cross-progression">Is Black Ops 6 Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>As Call of Duty accounts link up across platforms, you’ll be able to enjoy unhindered cross-progression elements on Black Ops 6. That means that if you have the game on PC and want to switch over to a PlayStation 5 copy, nothing is stopping you from logging in on the other device, recovering your process, and carrying on where you left off.</p>



<p>It’s a neat and seamless system that players love.</p>
