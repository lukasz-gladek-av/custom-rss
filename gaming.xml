<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91bf859864489/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the Switch 2 has broken sales records in the US — just last month, Nintendo's upgraded hybrid console reportedly hit an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">"all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware"</a>. And now, Circana's Mat Piscatella has more data to back up that info.</p>
<p>Sharing the stats on Bluesky, not only is the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in the US <em>ever</em>, but the launch also helped boost video game spending in the US to an all-time June high.</p>
<p>Spending on industry products increased by 22% in June 2025 compared to last year, which is a huge boost. And while the year's overall spending is still slightly behind 2024's (just by 2%), things are looking up thanks to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Originally, we knew the console had sold 1.1 million units in its opening week, but by the month's end, that climbed to 1.6 million units. As a reminder, we know the console has sold over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days</a>, so with the extra 5 million, console sales are already over 4 million.</p>
<p>Hardware spending has increased by 249% compared to last June — to $978 million — another record-setting month for sales, surpassing the previous record of $608 million in June 2008.</p>

<p>In terms of game sales, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was the third best-selling game of the month, right behind Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Elden Ring: Nightreign. However, Nintendo doesn't include digital sales in this data, so if we had to guess, Mario Kart World is <em>possibly</em> number one. Digital sales have boomed in recent years, after all.</p>
<p>In terms of Nintendo games, the Switch 2's line-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a> all made the top ten, with other titles that got free Switch 2 upgrades or paid Switch 2 Editions also making up most of the rest of the list.</p>
<p>There's no stopping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, though!</p>

<p>So, the Switch 2 is doing incredibly well, then! We'll likely hear more on sales figures at Nintendo's next financial briefing, which is due in August.</p>

			<p>The Outer Worlds 2, the second entry in the series developed by Obsidian Entertainment launching this year on PC and consoles, won't be Microsoft's first $80 game, as the game's price has been reduced ahead of its release in a few months.</p>



<p>In a new message shared today, developer Obisidian Entertainment confirmed that the game's price has been revised to $69.99 instead of $79.99. Considering the series is a relatively recent one without a massive following, pricing The Outer Worlds 2 at $80 was a really weird decision that might have impacted the game's sales significantly.</p>







<p>The last we saw of The Outer Worlds 2 was last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with a trailer providing an overview of the story which also confirmed the game's release date, and a more in-depth Direct presentation that provided some additional information on the game's mechanics. Judging from the footage seen so far, the new entry in the series is setting out to expand its predecessor's mechanics considerably, which should result in a game more enjoyable than its predecessor, which left something to be desired in the moment-to-moment gameplay, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">review.</a></p>



<p>"<em>The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.</em>"</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Developer Julian LeFay, a key cog in the early days of Bethesda and the development of classic Elder Scrolls RPGs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-arena">Arena</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall">Daggerfall</a>, has died. His passing was announced by OnceLost Games, the studio he co-founded in 2019, and follows a years-long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>LeFay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens">stepped away from his most recent development post</a> as technical director at OnceLost, where he'd been working on Daggerfall-inspired RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wayward-realms">The Wayward Realms</a> alongside fellow Bethesda veteran Ted Peterson, last week. OnceLost revealed at the time that this was due to his cancer worsening, writing that LeFay's doctors had informed them "his time with us is limited".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement on LeFay's passing aged 59, the studio's team wrote that the Danish-born developer "was not just a colleague - he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today" and praised his "unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve".</p>
<p>"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms," they added, "Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspire us all."</p> <div>

<p>LeFay joined Bethesda as a programmer in 1987, and was a key influence on many other RPGs through his work on Elder Scrolls. He was programming lead on Arena and Battlespire, project leader on 1996's legendary Daggerfall, and is credited on The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>. According to Peterson, his name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YhxCkF09Y">was also an inspiration</a> for Tamriel's god of wisdom and logic, Julianos.</p>
<p>LeFay also served as director and chief programmer on Bethesda's The Terminator and follow-up The Terminator 2029 back in those early days. He largely disappeared from the spotlight after leaving Bethesda, working on various projects including some with Sega, before being dragged back in via an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLGi5RK8V8">interview with YouTuber Ian Phoenix in 2017</a>, which snowballed into LeFay and Peterson deciding to team back up on an RPG that'd be a worthy successor to the likes of Daggerfall.</p>
<p>That led to OnceLost's founding in 2019 and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">Kickstarter for The Wayward Realms</a>. As Peterson and the studio's staff wrote when they revealed LeFay had stepped away from work on the game, their plan is to keep on developing their RPG in a fashion that matches his vision for it.</p>
<p>Thanks to LeFay for all of his contributions to the medium and all the best to those he leaves behind.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">1.6 million units were sold during its launch month in the U.S., and 82% of buyers also got Mario Kart World.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> debuted in June to become the fastest-selling hardware ever in the U.S., shooting spending on games to new monthly records, according to the monthly report from Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spending on hardware was up a whopping 249% year-over-year thanks to the console's debut, reaching $978 million and greatly surpassing the previous monthly record from June 2008 of $608 million. In total, the Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. during its launch month, beating the PlayStation 4's previous sales record of 1.1 million units in November of 2013. Unshockingly, it was the best-selling console of the month both in terms of units and dollar sales.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across both Nintendo Switch platforms, Switch 2-exclusive Mario Kart World was unshockingly the best-selling game of the month, followed by Cyberpunk 2077 and Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, both of which launched alongside the new console. In fourth and fifth place respectively were Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild, followed by Street Fighter 6, Mario Kart 8, Hogwarts Legacy, Bravely Default's remaster, and Minecraft. Because Nintendo doesn't share digital sales numbers with Circana, this chart may be missing some big sellers. For instance, we learned today that <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/deltarune-topped-switch-2-digital-charts-in-june-while-mario-kart-world-dominated-in-active-players/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deltarune topped Switch 2 charts in digital sales in June</a>, but with no physical edition and the game only costing $25, it's missing from the dollar sales ranking entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So does all this Nintendo Switch 2 success mean it's on track to outsell the Nintendo Switch 1? I asked Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, and this is what he told me:</p><blockquote>What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch. Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well lifetime (PS2 only sold 400k in its launch month) while others with big launches ended up not doing as well lifetime. Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market.</blockquote><blockquote>But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Across all platforms, Elden Ring: Nightreign was the best-selling game of the month for the second month in a row, followed by debut titles Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Mario Kart World. Those numbers don't include Nintendo digital sales of Mario Kart World, and they also don't include physical hardware bundles, meaning Mario Kart World will likely have performed significantly better than is indicated here. Per analysis by Circana's Mat Piscatella, 82% of Nintendo Switch 2 buyers in June purchased Mario Kart World either via a standalone sale, or as part of a bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma debuted at No.10. Stellar Blade ranked No.5 on the overall charts and was the second best-selling game on PlayStation thanks to its debut on the platform last month. And while Final Fantasy XVI didn't crack the overall top 20, it was the fourth best-selling game on Xbox, also thanks to its release on the platform in June. Overall, content spending in June was up 6% year-over-year, largely driven by Switch 2 game sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Accessories spending also set a new June record of $293 million, in no small part due to sales of the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. It was the best-selling accessory of the month and has a 32% attach rate with Nintendo Switch 2 hardware.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">June 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Elden Ring: Nightreign</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (NEW)</li><li>Mario Kart World (NEW)*</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Stellar Blade</li><li>Forza Horizon 5</li><li>MLB: The Show 25*</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grant Theft Auto V</li><li>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</li><li>Split Fiction</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Remastered</li><li>Star Wars: Battlefront II (2017)</li><li>Cyberpunk 2077*</li><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li><li>WWE 2K25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

Set in two eras—the decaying future and 1980s Poland—players are plunged into a world inspired by the real Krakow district—Nowa Huta, where survival means bending time itself. You play as a Traveler, an agent of the mysterious Collective, emerging from a dystopian future to dive back into time and extract people before they perish in the apocalypse. As you explore a world on the brink of annihilation, you’ll encounter grotesque enemies known as the Orphans.</p><p><strong>Don’t Let Them Merge</strong></p><p>The new gameplay trailer reveals intense survival moments inside the Orphans’ nest, offering a closer look at these terrifying creatures. Orphans are twisted, body-horror monstrosities born from humanity’s darkest nightmares. The trailer showcases their behavior—exceptionally aggressive and relentless—turning every encounter into a desperate fight for survival. Most importantly, players must prevent them from merging. As previously shown, defeated enemies must be burned immediately. If not, they risk being absorbed by other foes, triggering a merge that creates an even stronger and faster enemy. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Exploring the Twisted Realms of the New Dawn</strong></p><p>Additionally, the exciting new trailer reveals part of the story of a mysterious Predecessor—Traveler ND 3500—and their cryptic travel log. Players will journey through unsettling post-apocalyptic environments inspired by the existing Polish district—Nowa Huta, where decaying Brutalist architecture is warped and twisted by reality-bending anomalies.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,940 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,557 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,714 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this fall.</p><p>Watch the footage below.</p><h2><span>Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase</span></h2><p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Sector A-0 Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iW4EcsG_Deg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/cronos-the-new-dawn-sector-a-0-gameplay]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bethesda veteran Julian LeFay, sometimes referred to as the 'father of Elder Scrolls' thanks to his pioneering work on the legendary fantasy RPG series, has died aged 59.
</p>
<p>
The news follows developer OnceLost Games' announcement last week that LeFay, who had previously been diagnosed with cancer, would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-veteran-julian-lefay-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-departs-game-development-due-to-cancer">stepping back from game development</a> to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones".
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and oversaw the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall in his role as chief engineer. He departed the company in 1998, briefly returning for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, then pursued various other ventures before setting up OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls veterans Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
LeFay's departure from The Wayward Realms project was announced last week in a video addressed to fans, where it was revealed he'd been "fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years" and didn't "have very much time left". Now, OnceLost has confirmed LeFay's death in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oncelostgames.bsky.social/post/3lum4pyp3cs2e">message shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of Julian LeFay, our beloved technical director and co-founder of OnceLost Games," the studio wrote. "Julian LeFay was not just a colleague, he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today," it continued, highlighting his work on numerous classic games. "His pioneering work established the foundation for open-world RPGs and influenced countless developers and games that followed."
</p>
<p>
"At OnceLost Games, Julian was one of the masterminds behind The Wayward Realms, bringing decades of expertise and an unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve. His technical brilliance, creative vision, and dedication to player agency have been the driving forces behind our ambitious project.
</p>
<p>
"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms. Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspires us all."
</p>
<p>
Acknowledging the questions fans and Kickstarter backers might now have regarding the future of The Wayward Realms, OnceLost wrote that despite the "immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry", LeFay's "technical frameworks, design philosophises, and direction have all been carefully documented and shared with our team", and that it was "more committed than ever to bringing The Wayward Realms to life exactly as Julian intended it".
</p>
<p>
"Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," OnceLost concluded. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. Julian's legacy will live on in every realm, every quest, and every moment of wonder that players will experience in The Wayward Realms."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-beat-the-ps4-to-become-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history.1251036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now the fastest-selling piece of video game hardware in the US in the video game industry's history. With 1.6 million units sold in the US according to Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella, it decisively crushed the previous record holder, the PlayStation 4, which sold 1.1 million units in its debut.</p>







<p>Since the Nintendo Switch 2 launched last month, we've seen multiple reports about how it is selling like hotcakes around the world, including in the United States. Just four days from launch, the Switch 2 had reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units sold around the world</a>. It was selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast as the original Nintendo Switch</a> in when it launched in 2017, and it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">breaking records for US sales in its first week</a>. </p>



<p>With Piscatella's report for June 2025, he confirms the Switch 2 is solidly in first place, and also shows how impactful the console's launch was on the video game industry for the month, with hardware spending going up <strong>249%</strong> compared to June 2024. It should also not come as a surprise that the Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling bit of video game hardware in the US for the month in terms of units and in dollars, beating the PlayStation 5 for the month. That said, the PS5 is still the best-selling piece of hardware for 2025 in both categories, though it'll be interesting to see if that changes before the year is out.</p>



<p>Another significant part of the Switch 2's blockbuster launch is that 82% of people who bought a Nintendo Switch 2 in the US in June also bought <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>, either through the Switch 2 bundle or as a physical game separate from the console. The second-best-selling game for Nintendo platforms last month was Cyberpunk 2077, followed by Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma in third, then The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rounding out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively. </p>







<p>Leaving Switch 2 territory for a bit, other notable aspects of the June 2025 sales charts for the US video game industry are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> continuing to sell strongly, making its way into the top-10 best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far at the number eight spot, and being the top-selling premium game in the US for June 2025. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> found itself behind Nightreign in the number two spot on the sales charts for June 2025, and has yet to crack the top-20 best-selling games of the year so far in the US. Zooming in to platform-specific sales charts however shows Death Stranding 2 on the top of the charts for PlayStation 5 game sales in the US.</p>



<p>Lastly, Stellar Blade is the other notable entry on the sales charts, jumping up to second place on the PC sales charts and from 185th place to fifth place on the overall sales charts for June 2025, thanks to its launch on PC. Like everything else though, it still found itself looking up at Nightreign in first place.</p>



<p>All that said, the Nintendo Switch 2 dominating the charts is probably the most unsurprising event in 2025. What's exciting about watching the console now is seeing just how far it goes. We're not yet certain as to how many units were sold globally in June, though reports from earlier in the month put it at surpassing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-likely-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-june/">5 million</a>. Marketing analysis firm <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">DFC Intelligence has the Switch 2 selling 16 million units</a> before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At this rate, it feels like the Switch 2 will almost certainly reach those heights.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for June, and it looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco can continue their celebrations from last month.</p>

<p>In May, multiplayer spinoff experiment&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/may-gaming-sales-data-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow">topped the charts</a>, and despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June</a>, it hit the number one spot on the all-format chart for last month as well, according to the ever-reliable <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't manage to scrape second place, either; that honor went to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, a particularly impressive achievement given that Hideo Kojima's latest is only available on PS5.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>did come in third, though.</p>

<p>Second place still goes to <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i>, and&nbsp;Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>brings up third, which may come as something of a balm to the studio following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">disappointing Q1 financial results</a>.</p>

<p>In hardware terms, June 2025 set a new record for hardware spending by Circana's reckoning, beating out previous record-holder 2008. Spending hit $978m in June, bolstered by the release of the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The console managed to sell 1.6 million units in June in the US, breaking records for launch month unit sales and shattering the previous record set by Sony's PlayStation 4, which hit 1.1 million units in November 2013.</p>

            <p>PC gaming mouse 'n' keeb manufacturers Endgame Gear have admitted to and apologised for unknowingly spreading malware, after an infected version of the OP1w 4k v2’s Configuration Tool software was left available to download from their website.</p>
<p>After Reddit user Admirable-Raccoon597 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EndGameGear/comments/1m29q06/security_alert_endgame_gears_op1w_4k_v2/">raised the alarm</a>, having installed the Configuration Tool and found the malware hiding inside, German tech site <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/malware-in-official-mouse-software-endgame-gears-op1w-4k-v2-tool-infected-with-xred-rat/">Igor’s Lab</a> confirmed that the publically available application had been compromised for at least two weeks. Endgame Gear have since replaced the dirty software with an apparently safe version, and today <a href="https://www.endgamegear.com/security-update">shared a post</a> admitting the oversight – though claimed no sensitive data was stolen via the server infrastructure that was hosting it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We became aware of this situation involving one of our product pages through online discussions," the statement reads. "Following this, we initiated an internal review to better understand the circumstances and address any potential issues. A clean version of the affected file was immediately published as soon as we identified the situation.</p>
<p>"Importantly, access to our file servers was not compromised, and no customer data was accessible or affected on our servers at any time." </p>
<p>The post adds that the company "sincerely regret this incident and deeply apologise for any concern or inconvenience it may have caused. For Endgame Gear, the security and trust of our customers are paramount. We are fully committed to continuously improving our security protocols to prevent such events from occurring again."</p>
<p>The malware in question, Xred, is a particularly nasty strain: it’s a remote access trojan (RAT) that, if allowed to propagate through a PC system, would allow an attacker to take control and do all kinds of unsavoury things, from nicking passwords and spying through webcams to replacing RPS with PC Gamer in your browser bookmarks. Truly heinous stuff. Luckily it’s also known to Internet security suites, so most firewalls should pick it up – though Admirable-Raccoon597’s post doesn’t mention being warned before executing the infected software.</p>
<p>It’s also not terribly reassuring that Endgame Gear’s statement neglects to identify the breach that saw their innocuous mouse utility fouled by Xred in the first place. The company has at least implemented a variety of additional anti-malware measures, though without users knowing that the specific hole has been plugged, they may have some trouble earning back trust, even if no personal details were pinched from the hosting servers directly.</p>
<p>If you own an OP1w 4k v2 and downloaded its Configuration Tool between June 26th and July 9th, do follow the steps in Endgame Gear’s post to identify and remove any trojany files. Because, yeesh. The worst thing <em>my</em> mouse does to me is blink its lights for no reason, and that still runs me ragged; if it started letting crims seize control of my PC, one of my windows would spontaneously develop a visibly mouse-shaped hole.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-peripheral-makers-deeply-apologise-for-hosting-malware-in-their-mouse-software-by-accident]]></content:encoded>

<p>Anyone looking to buy a physical copy of Borderlands 4 for Switch 2 will also have to clear some space on the console, as Pitchford suggested that it might be sold as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">Game-Key Card</a>. "It's a big game. There will be a download, even for physical copies," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947722574122901838" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford wrote</a>.</p><p>Game-Key Cards essentially turn the Switch 2 cartridge into an authentication key to enable the download of the game directly to the console. It's worth noting that Game-Key Cards aren't tied to your Nintendo account, as they can be used be shared with friends or sold to another person.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will also be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and the game will launch earlier for those platforms on September 12. As its release date draws closer, Gearbox has begun sharing more details on the game's playable characters--like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailers-introduce-latest-siren-character-show-off-necromancer-abilities/1100-6533123/" data-ref-id="1100-6533123">new Siren named Vex</a>--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-over-200-bobblehead-collectibles-but-good-luck-getting-all-of-them/1100-6533163/" data-ref-id="1100-6533163">hundreds of collectibles</a> that you <em>probably</em> won't find, and an option to finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-introduces-its-best-feature-yet-a-claptrap-volume-slider/1100-6532865/" data-ref-id="1100-6532865">make Claptrap shut up</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Greedfall developer Spiders has laid off most of the animation team, according to Lead Animator Erwan Perrin, who wrote the following message <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/erwan-perrin_hey-weve-recently-been-informed-that-activity-7353013917415079936-aKPM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Hey! We’ve recently been informed that, like most of the Industry, Spiders Games will proceed a layoff plan and sadly most of the Animation and Rig team will be affected …If you're looking for some talented and passionated Paris based Animator or a Rig Artist, hit me up.</em></p>



<p>It is unfortunately only the latest instance of a seemingly unending wave of layoffs, from the largest companies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB Games San Diego</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA laying off between 300 and 400 employees including at Respawn and Codemasters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft shutting down The Initiative</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceling the new MMO in development at ZeniMax Online Studios</a>) to mid-sized ones like <a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">Supermassive</a> and now Spiders, too.</p>



<p>Greedfall 2: The Dying World hasn't done well since <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world-releases-september-24-in-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its launch in early access</a>, that's for sure. The game 'peaked' at 375 concurrent players on Steam, but it is barely being played at this point, with yesterday's daily peak registered at a mere 10 players. User reviews are also very negative—the total sits at 55%, but the recent reviews are even lower rated (40%).</p>



<p>One of the main sticking points for most of the community and, indeed, the undersigned, is the combat system, which was changed from the real-time action of the first Greedfall to a tab-targeting-like combat reminiscent of Dragon Age: Origins or MMOs like World of Warcraft. Spiders has since taken steps to improve the feel of the combat through better animations and sounds, but the core remained the same, and it definitely <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt very dated</a>. It's a shame, as the first Greedfall <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a fun and well-made action RPG</a> that warranted a proper sequel.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-ios-return-in-uk-uncertain-thanks-to-cma-decisions-epic-says.1250982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has revealed that it doesn't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will be returning to the iOS platform in the UK, following the release of two CMA (Competition &amp; Markets Authority) roadmaps regarding Google and Apple's mobile platforms.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s "return to iOS in the UK is now uncertain" thanks to the CMA's decisions, and that it "can't bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in the UK this year (if ever)".</p>

<p>For context, the CMA laid out roadmaps for market status investigations into&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f8ab528f29c99778a7455/Roadmap__Google_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f893cf2ecaeb756d0e1e6/Roadmap__Apple_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple</a> respectively today, and in both cases, requiring the two companies to allow developers to point users to other app stores and payment methods falls under measures the authority "will consider from the first half of 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=y8MSz1g- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=znU19HRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s UK iOS return is now "uncertain", according to Epic.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic calls this a "missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolized market". It's a decision that's contradictory to one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">recently made by the European Commission</a>, which saw Apple slapped with a&nbsp;€500 million fine and forced to&nbsp;"inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>According to Epic, Apple and Google must be "completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment" if "years of malicious compliance...and no genuine restoration of market competition" are to be avoided.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on your iPhone or iPad in the UK, then it looks like you're going to have a long while to wait; the earliest you can likely expect to play the game on your device is 2026, but it could take even longer than that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=-iSH76Ef 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=LorB1MCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Epic has some strong words for the UK's CMA today.</figcaption></figure><p>For years now, Epic has been embroiled in legal battles with both Apple and Google over allowing alternate payment systems and storefronts on the two companies' Android and iOS operating systems.</p>

<p>The fight began back in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">launched a sale</a>&nbsp;that promised discounts if players used the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio's proprietary payment system.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was removed from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> as a result, and Epic sued both companies, kicking off the ongoing legal struggle.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're not in the UK, your iOS&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>prospects might be a bit rosier; in May, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">restored to the US App Store</a>, and of course, <em>Fortnite</em> is also available on Android via the Epic Games Store. If you're in the UK, though, you'll just have to wait for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's giving you the chance to drive a ridiculously rare car, plus two other gorgeous vehicles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_5317833.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>website, update 1.61 will either land today or tomorrow depending on where you are. It's set to arrive tonight at 10pm Pacific, so that's 1am Eastern or 6am GMT tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, the game's latest patch will be bringing three cars for you to drive, but there's a special addition in update 1.61 in the form of the '05 NISMO R34 GT-R Z-tune. If you're a rare car aficionado, you'll probably know what that means.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=SjBHE0wW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=BdAsE9FZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s latest update adds a legendary car.</figcaption></figure><p>The story behind this one is pretty special. You can see a full breakdown in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/gran-turismo-7-update-1-61-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this PlayStation Blog post</a>, but essentially, only 19 Z-tunes were made, and they're all constructed from stripped-down used cars with high-spec part replacements.</p>

<p>As well as the Z-tune, you can also expect to drive the '22 Honda N-ONE RS, a kei passenger car with front-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual transmission. It's a light, breezy vehicle with plenty of modern accouterments to keep you happy.</p>

<p>Finally in this update, the '22 Nissan Qashqai Tekna 190 2wd e-Power is a hybrid machine that features a revolutionary (no pun intended) electric-generating engine. The aim was to improve on previous models' emissions, a goal Nissan clearly reckons it's achieved.</p>

<p>You can see these cars in action right here in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 trailer. It's not very long, but it does give a sense of what these beasts are like on the track.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 is due to land today at 10pm Pacific, or tomorrow at 1am Eastern/6am GMT. You can grab&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5 and PS4</a>.</p>

            <p>
Bad news everybody, I think I have discovered the game that is going to stop you doing anything else today. Witness the verminous splendour of turn-based puzzler Rat King, in which you simultaneously control two rodents who are exploring two different dungeons in splitscreen. I know, I know – to lose one rat in a dungeon may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two looks like carelessness. But there is method to the madness. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Each questing squealer shares the same health bar, but faces a different 5x5 square room layout and enemy spawning patterns. As such, they will inevitably end up out of synch - one rat lodged in the corner of a room, for example, while the other fends off beetles in the middle. You need to work out the sequence of moves that keeps both rats alive, while scooping up coins to spend on items at shops, and guiding the varmints to the staircase to the next floor. 
</p>
<p>
It’s immediately engrossing, and it layers up very satisfyingly. Each rat can move between the rooms of its particular dungeon without waiting for the other, allowing you to effectively "reshuffle" one half of the screen when you can’t see a way to avoid damage. One obvious way to get your skavens in synch is to line them up against parallel walls, but if you bounce off surfaces repeatedly you’ll waken a vengeful ghost.</p>
<p>The ghosts are a lovely wordless characterisation of a soft design constraint. The basic idea is just to punish you for brute-forcing the simultaneous-move mechanic, but also, it makes sense that rapping on the walls of catacombs would rouse their resident spectres.
</p>
<p>
Items can be very helpful, though they only apply to the screen half in which they’re collected. There’s an ice cube that freezes a room’s enemies in place, for example, and a purple swirly that spins one rat’s control inputs around, allowing for more flexible movement as long as you don’t confuse yourself. 
</p>
<p>
The latter item makes the game feel like a lockpicking minigame in an Elder Scrolls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but the correct reference here is Michael Brough’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/868-hack">868-Hack</a>, which stole the luncheons and sleeping hours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-works-and-why-betting-on-yourself-in-868-hack">many</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/priceless-play-2nd-november-2018">RPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/868-hack-review-pc">scribes</a> in times of yore. I haven’t played many "broughlikes", or at least, not knowingly, but Rat King already feels like a classic of the form.  I’ve only scraped the skin, I’m sure. <a href="https://torcado.itch.io/rat-king">Find it on Itch.io</a>.

It’s loaded from a separate menu and doesn’t overlap with the base game at all, and is missing things from it like Pro Rules and record tracking. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, meanwhile, remains unchanged from its Switch 1 version. </p><p>Plant writes, “<em>Jamboree TV</em> runs in 1440p docked, but <em>Jamboree</em> is 1080p docked and still a noticeable 720p handheld.” There are no mouse controls added to the base game either. </p><p>That seems like a big missed opportunity, and the <em>Jamboree TV</em> section doesn’t sound substantial enough to make up for it.

There’s probably a world out there where Nintendo combined <em>Jamboree TV </em>and <em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> into a single pack-in that came free with the console and showcased all of its new features. But that’s not the one we’re living in. Here’s what other reviews are saying:</p><h2 id="h594"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-upgrade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inverse</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> All in all, the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> isn’t the value add that it was for both the open-world Zelda games. The majority of the new minigames are fun, and the novelty of a first-party release that uses all of the new console’s bells and whistles will provide you with some fleeting entertainment. But spending an additional $20 for a few tricks and half-baked modes doesn’t make this party any better than it was the first time around. —Trone Dowd</p></blockquote><h2 id="h595"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MyNintendo</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> While the base game of Super Mario Party Jamboree remains a must-have, the Jamboree TV expansion for Switch 2 is take it or leave it. For the price, the new Carnival Coaster mode and mouse minigames are a fun time, and the new rulesets for Mario Party are a welcome inclusion. Alas, Bowser Live struggles to make good use of the camera and microphone, CameraPlay is only worth it if you have friends or family to play with online, and the increased resolution is not supported with any of the original side modes. Just one new game board would have added so much value, but Jamboree TV doesn’t even have that. —nintendojam</p></blockquote><h2 id="h596"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Speaking of which, Jamboree TV adds two great rulesets to try out alongside the original that put fun spins on the classic dice-rolling action. The first is Tag-Team Rules, which pits two teams of two against each other. Every player still takes their own turn, but each pair shares the same pool of stars, coins, and items, so you need to work together on every decision to come out on top. It’s a fun way to shake up the traditional format and it builds even further upon the strategic foundation of the base game. — Logan Plant</p></blockquote><h2 id="h597"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present. Super Mario Party Jamboree now stands as a robust party game that makes up for its shortcomings in sheer variety. Sure, Carnival Coaster isn’t something I’ll want to play for an hour at a time, but it works as one small attraction in a larger amusement park. I hope that its successor puts a bit more work into the best rides of the bunch, because there’s a whole playground of potential here. — Giovanni Colantonio﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h598"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Although the overall quality of the additions is inconsistent – especially if you don’t have ideal room conditions for the Switch 2 camera – the introduction of mouse controls and faster-paced modes, in particular, undoubtedly elevates an already great game. Whether that’s worth the $20 / £17 upgrade for existing Jamboree owners, though, will very much depend on how much you love Mario Party. —Andy Robinson</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-reviews-boards-modes-1851786773]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tolkien’s Middle-earth has captured the imagination of fantasy fans worldwide ever since The Hobbit was published in 1937. And although Peter Jackson is the film director who successfully brought the books to life on the big screen, you might be surprised to learn Middle-earth also has a rich video game history that goes back decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The earliest video game adaptation was created in 1982 by Beam Software, which developed a text-adventure game based on The Hobbit. The game was a huge hit and went on to sell over 500,000 units in Europe, despite middling reviews from critics. Such is the power of Tolkien’s works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In total, there are over 50 video games based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien that span numerous genres, like action-adventure, RPG, strategy, and more. As we prepare for another new Tolkien game just on the horizon, we’ve gone through this long history and chosen the 11 best Lord of the Rings games ever made.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Lord of the Rings Video Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">11. The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The legal rights to adapt The Lord of the Rings into video games are almost as complicated as Middle-earth’s lore itself. In the early 2000s, Tolkien’s literary works and Peter Jackson’s film adaptations were treated separately, with Vivendi and Tolkien Enterprises owning the rights to adapt the books for games, while EA owned the rights to adapt Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings movies. In 2009, Warner Bros. was able to bring together both movie and book rights and, at long last, develop games that incorporated story elements from both the literary and cinematic worlds of Tolkien.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/25/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north-review">The Lord of the Rings: War in the North</a> is the first Middle-earth game to feature story and design elements from both books and films. This hack-and-slash RPG stars a trio of original characters: The Ranger Eradan, the Dwarf Farin, and the Elf Andriel, each with their unique playstyle. The trio goes on a journey parallel to the events of the film trilogy after they’re enlisted by Aragorn to help the Fellowship, all while Frodo makes his way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. While the combat is generally considered enjoyable, albeit typical of its time, the real draw is that Lord of the Rings fans get to role-play as self-insert friends of Aragorn during the iconic events of the Peter Jackson movies.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. The Lord of the Rings Online</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since 2007, thousands of players have ventured into the many regions of Middle-earth itself thanks to the extensive digital world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/12/the-lord-of-the-rings-online-shadows-of-angmar-review">The Lord of the Rings Online</a>. While certainly not as popular as other MMORPGs like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy 14, Lord of the Rings Online has cultivated a dedicated player base thanks to the way it brings the world of Tolkien to life, allowing players to explore the far corners of Eriador, Rhovanion, Gondor, and Mordor. A visit to The Lord of the Rings: Online can even be considered essential for any Lord of the Rings fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Create a unique character and travel around Middle-earth during the events of The War of the Ring and undertake quests and raids crafted after events from the novels. What’s more, the game is still going strong after 18 years, with the most recent expansion, Legacy of Morgoth, released in late 2024. It also remains the only Lord of the Rings MMORPG, and will remain so for the foreseeable, especially after Amazon canceled its own planned Lord of the Rings MMORPG in 2021.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Lego The Hobbit</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">TT Games, formerly Traveller’s Tales, has transformed beloved franchises into wildly popular, comedic adventure Lego games for years. Lego The Hobbit follows the same formula that made the studio’s Star Wars and Harry Potter games such beloved hits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A zany re-telling of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/lego-the-hobbit-review">Peter Jackson’s Hobbit movies</a> built of plastic bricks, players can adventure through the events of the trilogy’s first two films, An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug (the third film, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, had not yet hit theaters.) You can unlock and play as dozens of different Hobbit movie characters in this humorous adventure, which splices plenty of great skits and sight gags into an otherwise pretty faithful (if heavily condensed) recreation of the movies. Expect to battle goblins, ride barrels, and steal from a colossal dragon. But as enjoyable as this all is, just know there is a better Tolkien movie trilogy with a better Lego adaptation slightly further down this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA Los Angeles launched a series of real-time strategy games based on Middle-earth in 2004, during the height of the genre’s popularity. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/12/04/the-lord-of-the-rings-battle-for-middle-earth">The Battle for Middle-earth</a> is rooted in the tried-and-tested Command &amp; Conquer formula: you take command of either the forces of Gondor or Mordor, establish a base by building unique structures and units, and then send out an army that will fight a war to determine the fate of Middle-earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle for Middle-Earth was a critical and commercial success when it was released,  thanks to its satisfying single-player story mode that included separate, complete campaigns for both Gondor and Mordor. Many praised the way it perfectly translated the world of Middle-earth to the RTS genre, and EA LA would go on to one-up their achievements with a far superior sequel that you’ll also find in this list.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings is the kind of property that allows for all kinds of adaptations. RTS? Sure! MMORPG? Absolutely. How about a Final Fantasy-esque turn-based RPG? Surprisingly, also yes –  you’ve found your way to The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Criticized for being maybe <em>too</em> inspired by Final Fantasy 10, right down to having a similar battle menu, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/02/lord-of-the-rings-the-third-age-3">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</a> nevertheless combines a familiar, turn-based combat system and class-based party system with the world of The Lord of the Rings.  The result is a satisfying RPG that has become an enduring fan-favorite. The Third Age, like War in the North, is set parallel to the events of the Peter Jackson films, with players taking on the role of characters who are hot on the trail of the Fellowship. Along the way, you visit many of the same locations that appear in the film trilogy, and battle familiar foes like the Balrog. There are even moments where you can temporarily team up with members of the Fellowship itself in battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not the most original game on this list, but  The Third Age is a great way to feel like a part of The Lord of the Rings movies without simply playing as Aragorn, Gandalf, or Frodo.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth 2</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA LA followed up their Tolkien RTS with a superior sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/03/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii-review">The Battle for Middle-earth 2</a>. Like the first game, you can choose between a Good or Evil single-player campaign. The former’s story is centered on the Elf Glorfindel, who allies himself with the Dwarves to defend Rivendell from Sauron. Meanwhile, in the Evil campaign, Sauron sends his commander, the Mouth of Sauron, and the Nazguls to invade the North.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to the first game, players raise armies consisting of infantry, bowmen, pikemen, cavalry, and siege machines and command them using characters from The Lord of the Rings. The sequel also adds even more factions, including Goblins, Dwarves, and Elves, for a total of six factions. It’s the better game of the two Battle for Middle-earths by far, but sadly, neither is available to buy today thanks to EA losing the Lord of the Rings licence, and even owners of the old physical editions cannot battle online as online servers were shuttered in 2010.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Lego The Lord of the Rings</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the Hobbit game we’ve previously spoken about, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/26/lego-the-lord-of-the-rings-review">Lego The Lord of the Rings</a> is TT’s brickified adaptation of the original trilogy of movies directed by Peter Jackson. And if you’re only going to play one of them, this is the one you <em>want</em> to play. You can play as any of the 80+ available characters in Lego form, from Frodo and Aragorn to Lurtz and Tom Bombadil, all while running, jumping, and building your way through the events of the superior Tolkien film trilogy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lego games usually live or die depending on which popular franchise they're adapting, and TT had a great foundation in the vast, varied world of The Lord of the Rings. There’s something particularly charming about seeing Middle-earth brought to life in Lego form, which makes it  easy to recommend to any fan. Do you like The Lord of the Rings? Do you like Legos? Do you like fun platformers? Boom, one of the best Lord of the Rings games ever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back during the era of official movie tie-ins in the early 2000s, , EA published a couple of hack-and-slash games based on The Lord of the Rings films where you took control of members of the Fellowship and made your way through the key events, leaving a pile of orc corpses in your wake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Gauntlet-like gameplay suited the fantasy swords-and-sorcery battles of The Lord of the Rings well, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/04/lord-of-the-rings-return-of-the-king-review">The Return of the King</a> was especially notable for its inclusion of local co-op, allowing you to form your own mini-Fellowship and go through the adventure together. Using actual scenes from the Peter Jackson movie to serve as cutscenes (a benefit unlocked thanks to the PS2’s DVD drive) and gameplay that captured the scale of the films’ battles, Return of the King was head and shoulders above many official tie-in games released at this time. But it didn’t quite beat its own predecessor… </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/21/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-2">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a> and The Return of the King are very similar games built on the same hack-and-slash foundations, and so your favorite of the two is largely up to personal preference. Which scene from the movies do you most want to experience? For our money, the Helm’s Deep level in The Two Towers is among the very best moments in any Lord of the Rings video game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, you’ll find many of The Two Towers’ key moments re-created here (as well as a few from The Fellowship of the Ring, too.) But the real joy is found in taking control of  one of the members of the Fellowship themselves. Whether it’s the hack-and-slash sword combat of Aragorn, the speedy ranged bow attacks of Legolas, or the heavy axe swings of Gimli, The Two Towers’ combo-heavy combat felt as good as any action game released in the early 2000s. Throw in amazing visuals taken straight from the movies, and The Two Towers is a standard-bearer for official movie tie-in games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Middle-earth: Shadow of War</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, complications around the rights to The Lord of the Rings have led to a variety of restrictions. The Middle-earth: Shadow games, though, were developed during a time when Warner Bros. had the rights to both Tolkien’s works and Peter Jackson’s movies, which meant developer Monolith Productions was able to take inspiration from the wider universe detailed in the <em>legendarium</em>, the lore bible that The Lord of the Rings is built on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/05/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review">Shadow of War</a>, the second game in the series, goes to some unusual places because of that freedom. It involves figures like Shelob (here depicted as a woman, rather than a spider, because of lore reasons) and the never-before-seen Entwives, and ties protagonist Talion’s fate directly into the story of the Ringwraiths. Shadow of War’s overly complicated story, with its convoluted attempts to tie its world to the movies, is the reason why many have the sequel ranked below its predecessor when it comes to Monolith’s two Middle-earth games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But story isn’t everything. Shadow of War features a much larger, more varied world than its scorched brown predecessor, allowing you to explore more of Middle-earth. The same fantastic combat and, of course, the Nemesis system, all return from the first game, but they’re bolstered by a fortress siege system that captures the epic scale of iconic battles such as Helm’s Deep (albeit you’re fighting alongside an amassed army of brainwashed orcs, rather than men and elves.) All this helps skyrocket Shadow of War towards the top of our rankings, beaten only by its fantastic predecessor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> sees the Gondorian Ranger Talion bond with the wraith of Celebrimbor, the elf who unwittingly aided Sauron forge the Rings of Power. Together, they go on a journey through the depths of Mordor to get revenge on Sauron’s generals who murdered Talion’s family. With fewer ties to the movies than in the sequel, Shadow of War, Shadow of Mordor tells a more cohesive story of revenge in Middle-earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the true star of Shadow of Mordor is Monolith’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-warner-bros-shut-down-shadow-of-mordor-developer-monolith-and-canceled-wonder-woman-fans-lament-the-wasted-potential-of-its-nemesis-system">patented Nemesis system</a>. Every Orc in Shadow of Mordor is unique to your playthrough, each given a random design, traits, and name. But beyond just procedurally generating an army of unique foes for you to kill, the Nemesis System shifts and changes each Uruk’s relationship with both you and their peers depending on how you interact with them. If one kills you in combat, for example, they will get promoted for their valiant deed and will bring up their victory the next time you encounter them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system, combined with the satisfying, Batman Arkham-style combat and a story that isn’t just a retread of Peter Jackson’s movies, easily makes Shadow of Mordor our favorite Lord of the Rings game of all time. Sadly, Monolith Productions was shut down in 2025, and so we’ll likely never see another Shadow game, nor the Nemesis System again. And so the two Middle-earth games serve as a proud legacy for this departed studio.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a new line of The Lord of the Rings movies on their way, as well as the ongoing Rings of Power TV show on Prime Video, there will likely be even more Tolkien games coming in the future. Next up is the cozy game Tales of the Shire from Fictions and Weta Workshop, which will deliver an entirely different video game take on Tolkien’s world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-11-best-lord-of-the-rings-video-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve played over 120 hours of Super Mario Party Jamboree since I reviewed it on Nintendo Switch last October. I loved it from the jump – giving it a 9 in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>original review</u></a> – and it’s continued to be a top choice on game nights with family and friends. So I was thrilled when Nintendo revealed that this would be one of the first Switch 1 games to get a Switch 2 expansion, thinking an upgraded version with great mouse control minigames and interesting new ways to party would be a total slam dunk. Unfortunately, Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is just as sloppy as its overly wordy title, with a handful of problems stemming from the frustrating decision to completely separate its new and old content. The fantastic base game is still hidden underneath a pile of annoying choices, but it’s tough to recommend the Switch 2 Edition as the clear, definitive version of the best Mario Party there’s ever been. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into the major differences between Jamboree on Switch 1 and Switch 2, I highly recommend you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review"><u>check out my original review from last year</u></a> if you’re looking for in-depth thoughts on the base game, because it all holds true. Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still an amazing time, with fantastic boards and items that emphasize strategy more than ever before, a great selection of minigames that features returning classics and new favorites, and a gorgeous presentation and attention to detail that elevate the whole package. I’ve been playing Mario Party pretty much my entire life, and now that I’ve had it for almost a year, I can definitively say that Jamboree is my favorite entry in the series. If you don’t own it at all, I can’t recommend the Switch 1 version enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, with that all said, that doesn’t mean the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is worth the upgrade. This new version is essentially an <em>entirely unaltered port</em> of the Switch 1 release with the Jamboree TV expansion glued on. When you first boot it up, the menu will look familiar to anyone who’s played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review"><u>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury</u></a>: You select between Super Mario Party Jamboree (complete with a Switch 1 icon in the top left, indicating this is just the old game and nothing more, not even a resolution bump) and Jamboree TV, which displays a Switch 2 icon and actually makes use of the new tech. The difference between this and 3D World’s expanded version, however, is that 3D World and Bowser’s Fury are wholly unique games that make sense to separate, while these two share a majority of their content but differ in strange, limiting ways. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mouse, Camera, Action!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV is where all of the new minigames and modes that take advantage of the Switch 2’s hardware live. The clear highlight is the set of 14 new minigames that use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls. Switch 2’s mouse controls may not be comfortable for extended periods of time, but they work super well in the context of a 45-second Mario Party minigame, and I was surprised by how much I loved the entire lineup. Highlights include Stuffie Stacker, where you work with a partner to build the tallest tower possible out of blocks and Yoshi plushies, and the chaotic Goomba Scoopas, where you drive a snow plow to frantically shove piles of Goombas into your team’s gate. Playing with mouse controls means everyone has to use a single Switch 2 Joy-Con instead of a pair or a Pro Controller, but with the improved, larger design over the original Joy-Con, it feels like less of a concession and more of a legitimate option this time. Every mouse minigame is 2v2, which adds a ton of variety to the lineup of team games that appear in Mario Party mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, Jamboree TV adds two great rulesets to try out alongside the original that put fun spins on the classic dice-rolling action. The first is Tag-Team Rules, which pits two teams of two against each other. Every player still takes their own turn, but each pair shares the same pool of stars, coins, and items, so you need to work together on every decision to come out on top. It’s a fun way to shake up the traditional format and it builds even further upon the strategic foundation of the base game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jamboree TV's clear highlight is the new minigames that use mouse controls.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also love the new Frenzy Rules as a fast-paced way to fit a whole game of Mario Party in without it taking upwards of 90 minutes. Frenzy games only last five turns – or roughly 30 minutes – and each player starts out with 50 coins, a Double Dice, and even a star. Every roll and minigame feels crucial when you only have five turns to set yourself apart from the pack, and this is an exciting mode I never knew I wanted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it’s a shame Jamboree TV doesn’t add any new boards to the mix, instead focusing on side modes that are pretty forgettable. Carnival Coaster is a cooperative mode where you use mouse controls in an on-rails shooter, completing team minigames as you go to add more time to the clock. I play Mario Party to compete, not cooperate, and it starts to feel repetitive after just a couple of runs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bowser Live uses the Switch 2’s built-in microphone and optional camera in an attempt to put <em>you </em>into the game. You enter Bowser’s lair and pop out of a warp pipe and – if you have a camera plugged in – see a live image of yourself. You then compete in completely controller-free minigames where you stack Goombas on your head or just literally scream into the microphone as loud as you can to score points.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve known since the days of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/04/03/wario-ware-snapped-review"><u>WarioWare: Snapped!</u></a> that minigames control better with an actual controller than with a camera or microphone, and Bowser Live doesn’t do anything to change that truth. A microphone minigame where you clap to the beat, for example, is so much less precise than the Donkey Konga minigame where you do the same thing but with actual buttons. As a result, the appeal wears off after just a couple of minutes, and at my most cynical, it feels like a tacked-on mode designed to sell Switch 2 cameras and nothing more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV in general makes use of the Switch 2’s ability to use a camera, as live feeds of you and your friends’ faces are visible throughout the party – although you don’t need a camera to access these modes and can play everything but Bowser Live without missing out on any content. I guess it’s a nice novelty and kids might like seeing themselves or their parents on the TV, but it’s not something I ever see myself using outside of testing it for this review.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A Tale of Two Parties</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though some of the new content is worthwhile, things get really frustrating when you consider <em>how </em>Jamboree and Jamboree TV split up their content. As I mentioned, the Jamboree side of the fence is a straight port of the Switch 1 game, which means there’s no mouse control minigames, camera functionality, or option to do the Frenzy and Tag-Team Rules. That wouldn’t be a problem if the Jamboree TV side of things was an outright replacement and included everything Jamboree has to offer, but it’s inexplicably missing a ton of content from the Switch 1 side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jamboree TV completely lacks Pro Rules, which was one of Jamboree’s best additions. It reduces luck and focuses on strategy, and I praised it in my original review. Here, it’s <em>only </em>available on the Switch 1 side, and so are all of Jamboree’s original side modes – that’s Koopathlon, Bowser Kaboom Squad, Paratroopa Flight School, Toad’s Item Factory, Rhythm Kitchen, the single-player campaign Party Planning Trek, and every mode in Minigame Bay besides Free Play. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Mario Party</h3><p>I reviewed Super Mario Party Jamboree, and it's my new favorite in the series. Here's my ranking of all 18 games -- that's a lot of parties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">More importantly, Jamboree TV lacks all of Jamboree’s achievements, customization, and unlockables. In the Switch 1 version, you have to earn Party Points to buy additional stickers and finish achievements to unlock three of the boards, but Jamboree TV just gives you everything right from the start, taking away the fun sense of progression and incentive to play single-player that I really valued. It also means if you’re buying this new on Switch 2, you’ll have everything unlocked in Jamboree TV, but nothing unlocked in Jamboree, which is just odd. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s stranger is that these two sides don’t talk to each other whatsoever: If you’re playing Jamboree TV and do something that would normally earn you an achievement over in Jamboree, nothing happens and the Switch 1 version doesn’t recognize it at all when you return there until you do it again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another example is minigame records. My group and I love to chase high scores in minigames – whether in Free Play or during a Mario Party game itself – but Jamboree TV doesn’t track records <em>at all. </em>Did you get a new crazy high score on the button-mashing Domination? Switch 1 Jamboree will congratulate you with the iconic “New Record!” sound effect and display that score until someone else beats it, while Switch 2’s Jamboree TV won’t track it anywhere.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>More than half of this is an unchanged Switch 1 game with zero performance updates. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even worse, the Switch 1 side didn’t receive <em>any </em>performance or resolution updates to take advantage of the new hardware. Jamboree TV runs in 1440p docked, but Jamboree is 1080p docked and still a noticeable <em>720p </em>handheld, which was the maximum resolution of the Switch 1 screen. Nintendo is charging $80 for the Switch 2 Edition at launch, when more than half of it is quite literally an unchanged Switch 1 game. And while it’s only $20 for the upgrade if you already own it, I’m still not sure that’s worth the compromised way this expansion works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you want to play Pro Rules with the enhanced resolution? It’s simply not possible. How about include the mouse control minigames while still working toward achievements? You can’t do that, either. It also takes so long to swap between the two versions that you’re better off just closing the software altogether and rebooting: the staff credits roll <em>every time </em>you leave TV, but at least they’re skippable. One of my favorite things about Jamboree is how many choices it gives you to make your Mario Party experience exactly what you want it to be, but Jamboree + Jamboree TV has entirely lost that graceful design just nine months later unless you only stick to the unaltered base game, which defeats the entire purpose of upgrading. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review]]></content:encoded>

For a start, we have coders now! So, we needed a name that instead reflects what’s always been at the heart of the games themselves: the imperfect feel of old technology and the lasting impact of a story that stays with you long after the credits roll.”</p><p>Screen Burn Interactive aims to capture that spirit, comparing “the ghost of an image burned into an old CRT screen,” to the memory of a game forever imprinted on your mind.</p><p>Development on <em>Silent Hill: Townfall</em> remains underway with <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,128 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami</a> and <a title="Companies > Annapurna Interactive [182 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/annapurna-interactive">Annapurna Interactive</a>.
