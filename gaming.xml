			<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been a long time coming. Despite the clamouring of their fan base, Ubisoft held off for years on giving the people what they want, an Assassin’s Creed game set in feudal Japan. Then, after finally announcing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, the game was delayed at the last minute… and then delayed again. Thankfully the wait is over, the latest entry in the Assassin’s Creed franchise is finally here, and it is utterly resolutely brilliant. Indeed, it might just be the best game in the storied series to date and Ubisoft’s best game in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Launch Cinematic TV Ad" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zxtJFdnMo7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off, how do you like your Assassin’s Creed? If you prefer the stealth-focused and closed environment approach of the early games in the franchise, then Shadows is likely not for you. If, on the other hand, your preference is the open-word action RPG approach established by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review/">Assassin’s Creed Origins</a>, then you’ll find that Shadows is the epic culmination of everything you enjoyed since Bayek’s Ancient Egyptian adventure. Though, after the first eight hours or so of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this wasn’t the case.</p>


<p>Shadows is a slow starter, and while the drawn-out opening is full of great emotional beats and outstanding character performances, setting-up protagonist Naoe’s quest for vengeance, it is distinctly lacking in open-world activities and gameplay variety. When you’re not watching its admittedly very beautiful cut scenes, you’ll spend your time travelling from village to village murdering people, with a distinctive lack of tools and abilities to make it interesting to do so. During this opening section of the game, the limited areas of Japan you visit feel sparse, empty, as if something is missing. That something is Yasuke, and by the time the African Samurai strides into the game everything clicks, the open world reveals itself, activities and encounters fill the environment, the gameplay evolves, and finally Assassin’s Creed Shadows kicks into gear.</p>


<p>Yasuke plays in a completely different way to any protagonist in Assassin’s Creed history. He’s an unstoppable tank, like Batman from the Arkham series, as if the Doom Slayer was lifted from Hell and plonked into feudal Japan. Clad in robust armour, Yasuke shrugs off most attacks, smashing through opponent’s defences to complete a strike, even if it means taking some damage on the way. Later, Yasuke’s extensive skill tree can be harnessed to allow him to reclaim health from attacking, but in the early going you’ll be too busy grinning with glee as the mighty samurai boots an unwitting thug, sending them careening with rag-doll hilarity through the wall of a nearby temple. Combat is punchy and reliably structured around parries and dodges to expose an enemy to counter attack. Nothing groundbreaking here, but eminently satisfying, and I found myself playing as Yasuke far more than I thought I would, just to throw it down with another Daimyo or two.</p>
<p>Of course, many will lean towards playing as Naoe first and foremost, as she fulfils that more traditional role of the Assassin’s Creed avatar with stealth and athleticism. That means all your expected tropes, with free running, flipping, and leap of faith-falling aplenty. The extra time in development has clearly served Shadows well, as, for once, the free-running works perfectly. No more accidentally leaping off cliffs, Naoe goes where you want her to go, when you want her to go there, with smooth and precise animation. That’s not to say that this Shinobi doesn’t bring anything new to the table. Crawling through low cover is now an option, as is swinging on a grappling hook, allowing for different approaches on a target to be carried out – Yasuke simply can’t access rooftops and vantage points in the same way. More intriguing is that Shadows is the first Assassin’s Creed where light and dark in the environment influences your likelihood to be seen. It now makes complete strategic sense to wait until dark before infiltrating a fortress, snuffing out candles as you making your way past hordes of enemies, practically invisible. To reach your victim unseen is a satisfying thrill, one that is sure to scratch the itch of even the most ardent stealth enthusiast.</p>

<p>Each player character has an enormous amount of differing abilities, weapons, and tools to mess around with. Yasuke’s shotgun-like Teppo is tremendous fun, thanks to the ability to switch weapons mid-attack meaning you can parry attacks from a sword, before spinning the rifle into position and blowing a foes’ face off Meanwhile Naoe’s standout weapon, the dagger-like Tanto, is far more exciting than it sounds, thanks to they way in which the Ninja slams it into to her victim with wanton abandon. Actually, this must be the goriest Assassin’s Creed yet – watching Yasuke slice off both his opponents arms before hacking off their head is quite the sight.</p>
<p>What really makes Assassin’s Creed Shadows tick though, is the option to freely switch between the leads depending on the situation you face and how you want to deal with it. A veritable army of Samurai blocking your way? Yasuke will carve a bloody path through them, but, if you’re not feeling the need for a fight, you can switch to Naoe and creep past them instead. It’s a shame that whilst the game encourages experimentation with its two player characters, offering open combat encounters to play around in, it makes it so darn clunky to swap between them, forcing you to dip into the menus to do so. This is particularly aggravating when you encounter a quest-giver for a specific hero, demanding you switch hero before you can interact with them. This is something they can hopefully refine in an early patch.</p>
<p>It’s in the depiction of feudal Japan that Assassin’s Creed Shadows truly delivers. Frankly, there are moments of jaw-dropping visual beauty here. You can spend ages just soaking in the vistas that stretch many miles into the distance. Blossom trees blow hither and thither in the wind, each branch moving independently of the others as blossoms float down to coat a woodland path. Seasons change and the environments with it, submerging villages in snow, or causing flowers to bloom in the summer. Waves lap against the shore, the sunlight sparkling across the water. Stunning is a word that doesn’t quite do justice to the environmental detail on display here, but it’ll do.</p>

<p>Unusually for Ubisoft, this glorious open world isn’t covered in icons and intrusive HUD nonsense. While you can still scan the surroundings from high-up vantage points, this doesn’t automatically fill your map with navigation points, instead insisting that you mark points of interest for yourself, and only a handful at a time. It’s less immediate, but it means you’re encouraged to explore the world more dynamically, search for your next target, find yourself distracted by an intriguing cave that you decide to explore, discovering an awesome new weapon hidden deep within.</p>
<p>Events occur organically around you, often dictated by the season. A peasant might need rescuing from some thugs, a passing Ronin might challenge you to a duel, or you might spot a lovely dog to pet and bring home to your hideout. There’s a wide range of activities to undertake, delightfully many of them avoiding combat to bring different experiences to the player. A forgotten crumbling temple becoming a free-running playground, a meditation point that brings transport your character into past events, taking the time to paint a playing bunny, clambering to the summit of a big waterfall to try and see if Yasuke can do a leap of faith – you’re definitely going to want to try it. In short, the world of Assassin’s Creed Shadows feel alive, with a historical and cultural authenticity that blew my mind.</p>

<p>The historical plot is smart and well-researched, brilliant evoking a Japanese Samurai cinema vibe with Assassin’s Creed’s own distinctive style. During your adventure, you’ll meet a who’s who of important figures from the period in their adventures, Oda Nobunaga and Hattori Hanzo are two early stand outs, but there are many more infamous characters expertly woven into proceedings. Thankfully, there’s also a minimum of modern-world nonsense here, with the option to explore digital anomalies and AI shenanigans if you want, but mostly letting you stick with the awesome feudal Japan setting. With all that going for the storyline, even a few blatantly obvious plot twists doesn’t change the fact that this is my favourite Assassin’s Creed setting and storyline by far.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Assassin's Creed series</a> may no longer have the luster it had with the games starring Ezio Auditore, but there's no denying that there's still no video game series like it. While the stories featured in many installments may not be one hundred percent accurate to the time period they are set in, the ability to explore some of the world's most incredible places while getting to interact with real historical figures is something that very few games can offer at this quality level. With the introduction of role-playing game mechanics, some of the uniqueness of the series was inevitably lost, but the market seemed to appreciate this direction, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, even with its issues, achieved financial success, selling the highest number of copies during its launch weekend for the series.</p>
<p>Following the return to the series' roots with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, the franchise doubles down on the open-world RPG formula this year with Assassin's Creed Shadows. While an entry in the series set in Feudal Japan was something that fans have been asking for for a very long time, the game has been very controversial since its reveal due to the choice of protagonists, mainly Yasuke, the first known African man in Japan who served Oda Nobunaga whose status as a proper samurai is still debated to this day, and other cultural mishaps, which include using a stolen flag design in concept art and a collectible statue of the game featuring a damaged torii gate resembling the ruined gate of Sannō Shrine in Nagasaki linked to the tragic 1945 atomic bombing.</p>
<p>While some of the complaints that have been raised are justified, I feel it would be a shame if the discourse surrounding the game were only limited to them, as I have found Assassin's Creed Shadows to be a solid game that improves on the series' RPG formula in a lot of ways and that takes full advantage of its incredible technical achievements to improve its open-world gameplay to make the experience more about exploring and living the world, rather than going from one map marker to the next.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250307184718_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set in late 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama period, the final phase of the Sengoku period marked by social upheavals and the unification of Japan under powerful warlords, which culminated with the Battle of Sekigahara and the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate by Ieyasu Tokugawa. The turbulent political situation of the period serves as the backdrop of Naoe's story, a female shinobi from Iga whose father has been killed by the Shinbakufu, a group of powerful individuals that move in the shadows to take advantage of the chaos enveloping Japan to further their own unclear ends.</p>
<p>Set on avenging her father and recovering a mysterious box Naoe's father told her to protect at all costs, the young shinobi embarks on a journey of vengeance that will get her to meet and act together with some of the most powerful men of Japan, and their servants, including the African warrior Yasuke, who will join Naoe in her quest for vengeance for his own personal reasons, which tie into the Brotherhood and Templar Order story previously seen in the franchise. The two will be joined during the course of the adventure by other individuals who will get to be part of the League Naoe has to put together to take on the powerful Shinbakufu.</p>
<p>While the premise is relatively straightforward, the story of Assassin's Creed Shadows is enjoyable, with some surprising twists related to the Shinbakufu that keep the player hungering for more until the mostly satisfying ending. Unlike Assassin's Creed Valhalla, whose story really started dragging on a dozen hours in, Shadows' story is much better paced and, clocking at around 40 hours, doesn't overstay its welcome, although some fatigue will inevitably start to creep in after 20 or so hours as some scenarios and individual storylines start to feel kind of repetitive. Still, there are definitely some remarkable moments in the adventure that make it worth experiencing, especially for history buffs who love the Sengoku period, as every major player of the late 16th century is present in some capacity.</p>
<p>Being the main characters, Naoe and Yasuke obviously get the most development, which is delivered in a series of quests that delve deeper into their pasts and how they got to the fateful day when the armies of Oda Nobunaga attacked Iga. Further development is offered during main and side quests, which delve deeper into their bond as well as into both their new and already established relationships. Those who like one of the two characters more than the other also have the choice of initiating quests with their character of choice, although there are times when both will be present or when either one of the two protagonists is required to proceed. Many other characters appear as the story dictates, but they receive limited development, which is not surprising considering their brief screen time, although the allies that get to be part of the League have a slightly bigger role than the characters who appear in the regional main quests, and thus stay a little longer in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Like in the prior games since the RPG shift, Assassin's Creed Shadows also allows players to make choices during pivotal moments that can heavily influence a character's relationships and how the story moves forward. Those who want to have a more traditional Assassin's Creed experience, however, can play the game in Canon Mode, which makes the story proceed as the developers intended. This is definitely a nice option to have and one of the many included in the game that further bridges the gap between the action RPG entries in the series and the classic formula that powered the first few entries in the franchise.</p>
<p>One thing that modern Assassin's Creed doesn't seem capable of bringing back properly is the modern-day story, and, as such, it is not surprising that Assassin's Creed Shadows fails in this area as well. The game serves as a starting point for a new modern story, but given how little importance it has in the game, it's clear that the developer focused more on getting their historical fiction set in the late Sengoku period right. For some people, they will have failed, as the two protagonists will continue to be controversial choices, especially Yasuke, who did appear already in other video games set in the late Sengoku period but never as a proper samurai, and details here and there remain inaccurate, but generally, Ubisoft, at the very least, attempted to address some of the controversies, such making it impossible to climb on torii gates, although this is only one of the many issues in the setting.</p>
<p>Would a traditional Japanese samurai have made for a better protagonist? Perhaps, but that would have required telling a different story. A key part of what makes Yasuke's story interesting is how he fits into a society so unlike the one he was born into, and his ambiguous historical role gave the developers more creative freedom to fill in the gaps. At the same time, the Assassin's Creed series has always taken liberties with real history, which led to plenty of inaccuracies, like the Icelandic Vegvisir magical stave appearing prominently in Valhalla when there is no known historical evidence that it was used during the Viking Age, so Shadows really isn't doing anything different in this regard.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311183830_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with its story, Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't exactly push the boundaries of the third-person action RPG formula established by its predecessors but introduces some choice improvements that really enhance the experience. While the player will still need to explore a huge map roughly the size of the map in Assassin's Creed Origins, heading towards certain locations to initiate and complete quests, how the player goes on to do this has been slightly changed. To start and continue a good portion of the game's quests, players first need to find where exactly to go, as the game doesn't provide a precise location from the get-go but only a few pointers, leaving players on their own to find out where they have to go.</p>
<p>The scout system can also be used to search an area on the map, but scouts have limited uses each season and can only be replenished by spending money, so searching on your own will be the way to go most of the time. And the most fun, to be honest, as it makes the experience more immersive than before, requiring players to look at the map and engage in a bit more organic exploration in the vein of<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/breath-of-the-wild-greatest-legend/"> Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">sequel</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a>, to name a few open-world games that mostly avoided the excessive use of map markers. Similarly, some of the game's side activities, such as those that involve hunting down the members of certain groups, also require the player to put in some work to find their locations, which makes these side activities more engaging than most of the others in the game. Those who prefer playing Shadows as if it were any previous entry in the series can just skip all of the above and turn on Guided Exploration Mode.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no way to completely turn off the map indicators, so you will still know beforehand the general location of points of interest, which include towns, enemy strongholds like castles, temples, individual challenges for Naoe and Yasuke, painting spots, and more. The vast majority of these locations are entirely optional to explore, but Assassin's Creed Shadows provides an incentive to do so by tying character progression with the Knowledge System. To learn additional skills on the twelve skill trees, six for each character, the player needs not only Mastery Points, obtained by leveling up and completing certain side activities, but also Knowledge Points, which unlock a new portion of the skill trees once certain point thresholds have been reached. Focusing on exploring the locations that are encountered while going for the main story objectives provides a decent amount of Knowledge Points, so there's thankfully no need to go out of one's way to explore every inch of the map to unlock fundamental skills for both main characters.</p>
<p>When it comes to variety, Assassin's Creed Shadows provides some in the moment-to-moment gameplay with a solid main quest design centered around the two protagonists and the open-world design technical advancements. After a certain point in the story, which coincides with a well-known moment in Feudal Japan history which takes place at Honnoji Temple, the player can switch at will between Naoe and Yasuke and becomes able to approach quests in two very different ways. As a shinobi, Naoe is extremely agile and comes with advanced parkour capabilities, which include a handy grappling hook that makes it very easy for her to stay concealed and eliminate targets with a bit of finesse. Yasuke, on the other hand, fully embodies the combat-oriented approach seen in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, coming with very average parkour abilities but a wealth of combat options that allow him to take on multiple enemies at the same time with ease, something Naoe sometimes struggles with due to her weapon options and skills. As such, every quest has been designed so that it can be completed with any playstyle, providing an unprecedented level of flexibility for an Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>Empowering the two different playstyles available in Assassin's Creed Shadows are some noticeable improvements for both stealth and combat mechanics. The former, in particular, has benefitted the most from the incredibly dynamic world Ubisoft created for the game, where sudden weather condition changes aren't just aesthetic but impact gameplay considerably. For starters, enemy visibility is heavily impacted by the time of day but also by certain weather conditions, so infiltrating a stronghold at night with a heavy rain downpour can prove to be beneficial for Naoe, who can use Eagle Vision to pinpoint enemy locations and mark them on the HUD with the Observe mechanics, no matter the visibility.</p>
<p>The lighting of any given area can also have a tremendous impact on stealth, so turning lamps and lanterns off can be incredibly beneficial and prevent enemies from being alerted by your character's shadow. All of these elements are further influenced by the current season, which can provide certain advantages or disadvantages, such as vegetation providing more cover, more frequent weather conditions changes, and so on. The enemy AI has been slightly improved as well, as they react to sound, which includes footsteps on nightingale panels, and group up when investigating anything that caught their attention. At Expert difficulty, enemies are even more observant, and even roofs become unsafe, requiring players to really be careful navigating enemy territory as any slip-up will result in getting discovered and potentially overpowered. The best thing about all of these features is how they dynamically interact with one another, forcing players to adapt to any given situation, elevating the typical Assassin's Creed experience in some surprisingly good ways, and making the Shadows' stealth mechanics some of the best in the entire series.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250309175824_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The combat improvements are slightly less substantial than those made to stealth, but they are still quite noticeable, building upon the existing foundation to deliver something a little bit more involved. Both protagonists can unleash light and heavy combo strings, powerful Posture attacks, and special skills that require Adrenaline, block, dodge, and parry enemy attacks, but it's how they accomplish all of the above that differs. While competent, Naoe is not that great at fighting enemies head-on, thus her weapon of choices, which include Katana, Nanto and Kusarigama, don't deal the same amount of damage Yasuke's powerful long Katana, Naginata spear and Kanabo war club.</p>
<p>Her superior agility, however, makes her better at dodging enemy attacks, whereas Yasuke's heavier fighting style allows him to take a few hits, though he is still capable of sidestepping and backstepping to avoid attacks. By unlocking skills on the 12 skill trees and completing companions quests, it is possible to learn additional combat abilities for all available weapons, which include different combo strings, timed button presses for increased power and some passives, and become able to call in allies to fight alongside Naoe and Yasuke and even assist them when they are undetected, which, together with the many types of gear available coming, in their Legendary highest level of rarity, with some rather useful perks, expand combat options and make the experience quite varied. Some of the skills also allow both characters to use the environment to their advantage, adding more depth to the experience.</p>
<p>All of this wouldn't matter much if we were in the same button-mashing territory of some of the previous entries in the series, but this isn't the case in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Button mashing here leads only to dragged-out fights and higher chances of defeat, as enemies not only tend to block a lot, forcing players to use the slower Posture attacks to break their guard, but they also parry and counter reckless attacks. To get an opening, the player needs to pay attention to how they attack, deflecting or blocking their regular white and blue-coded attacks, and dodge the red-coded unblockable attacks. When defending properly with the correct timing, enemies become Vulnerable, allowing the player to deal increased damage. With enemies often ganging up on the player and even canceling their attack animations with sudden guards, the combat experience in Assassin's Creed Shadows can get rather intense, which is something I wasn't expecting. The excellent animation work in combat and some brutal finishers from Yasuke also contribute to making fighting enemies head-on as satisfying as assassinating them from the shadows.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250311195407_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Another major part of the Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay is the Hideout mechanics. A few hours into the game, Naoe will get the chance to start building a haven for her allies to help her, and later Yasuke, in her war against the Shinbakufu, adding a variety of facilities that offer different services like a forge to improve equipment, a dojo to train allies, a Kakurega to improve safehouse management, and more, and introduce some beneficial effects like increased experience points and the like. By improving the Hideout, it will also level up and introduce some other beneficial effects that can be more or less useful. Those who want to combine looks with functionality can also freely arrange the buildings any way they see fit, decorate them with all sorts of items, connect them using some of the Engawa roofed corridors available, and so on. To do all this, however, players will need to use a lot of resources besides mon. These are mostly found by completing side content, such as the seasonal regional contracts, which often involve stealing resources or killing all enemies from enemy camps that are randomly generated on the map, bloating the already inflated wealth of side content even more.</p>
<p>While the typical open-world bloat has indeed been reduced over past entries, Assassin's Creed Shadows still features way too many side activities clearly designed to extend the playtime and get players to spend money on cosmetics and additional gear that add little to the experience. At the start of my playthrough, I tried to explore a bit more and see what was hidden below all those question mark indicators on the map, but I quickly changed my mind when all I found were similar enemy camps that provided small rewards that, ultimately, have little positive impact on the experience. My time with the game got way more enjoyable when I started doing things a little more organically, exploring whenever I felt like it when going from one main story quest to another, engaging with the additional system only when truly required, or halting my travels whenever I saw some villager in need of help, or a Shinbakufu ronin ready to fight.</p>
<p>This also made me appreciate more how dynamic and living the world is, as there are a lot of little details scattered around that enhance immersion, such as groups of women grieving their dead, people talking about their lives, and so on. Ultimately, the additional content is there for those who really want to fully complete the game, but I feel the vast majority of players would get bored of the game pretty quickly if they were to go after absolutely everything they see on the map, as the rewards aren't really worth the effort. Unfortunately, there are times when completing side content is essentially required to level up so as to be able to take on story quests, so avoiding side content almost completely is pretty much impossible.</p>
<p>The release of Assassin's Creed Shadows also marks the launch of the Animus Hub, the project previously known as Assassin's Creed Infinity, which will act as the immersive point of entry for the entire series, allowing players to quickly access any of the previous games they have purchased, access regularly released missions to obtain Keys that can be exchanged for rewards and more. The rewards offered for the current projects are decent enough, so these additional missions are definitely worth pursuing for those who are wholly invested in the game's many mechanics and systems. Those who feel the game is already bloated enough, even without the Animus Hub Projects, will end up ignoring them to keep the experience slimmer and more focused on story-related content.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313193816_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Before the game's launch a few months back, Ubisoft stated that Assassin's Creed Shadows would be the most visually advanced entry in the series to date, and after having seen a good portion of what the map has to offer, I can say that is not only the most visually advanced entries but also one of the most visually advanced open-world games to date. Besides being extremely polished with little to no visual glitches, this rendition of Feudal Japan looks outright stunning, thanks to the great usage of ray-traced global illumination. With the Diffuse Everywhere option, and high ray tracing quality, the game's atmosphere is unparalleled at all times of day and weather conditions, making it a joy to traverse the game world bordered by dense vegetation, get up high on viewpoints, and see some of the most amazing vistas seen in open-world games to date. Ray-traced global illumination, lighting, and the density of the game world are only some of the remarkable visual features of the game, as particle effects are just as impressive as RTGI.</p>
<p>Whether it's leaves blown in the wind, pouring rain, or snowflakes, these effects do a great job highlighting the great attention to detail that has been poured into the game, which, at times, rivals that seen in Red Dead Redemption 2. The tech used for rendering hair is also one of the highlights and something that very few games have got as right as Ubisoft has in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Unfortunately, there are some stiff animations here and there that really feel out of place in such a beautifully rendered world, as do some mediocre facial animations, but thankfully, the vast majority of them are fine. Some are more than fine, such as combat animations, which feel incredibly smooth and well deliver not only the extreme agility and the extreme strength of the two main characters, but also their lack of. Yasuke's heavy parkour animations and clumsy leap-of-faith animations are great examples of this.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows PC 4K@60 Gameplay DLSS Quality, Frame Generation, Ray Tracing High" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkqOwIONdxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Experiencing Assassin's Creed Shadows at its best, however, has a cost, and only the most powerful system configurations are able to run the game at maximum settings, full ray tracing, and native 4K resolution at 60 FPS. Thankfully, the game scales really well across different system configurations, sporting a great variety of visual settings to tweak with a handy preview that highlights how each setting affects the visuals. At 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS Quality and Frame Generation, and the settings in the screenshots below, the game ran extremely well on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) with no visible stuttering, often hitting the 120 FPS mark, except for cutscenes, which are sadly locked at 30 FPS to retain a cinematic feel. The in-game benchmark also returned excellent results with unlocked framerate, hitting an average of 117 FPS, 99 1% low, and 93 0.1% low. Seeing the essentially bugless high level of technical polish on display here, there's little doubt that delaying the game multiple times was definitely the right choice, one that more publishers should consider to deliver solid PC ports.</p>

<p>While the Assassin's Creed Shadows visuals do their best to make players feel immersed in this amazing rendition of Feudal Japan, the same cannot be said for the game's audio features as a whole. The game's soundtrack is mostly fine, alternating between some rock-oriented and traditional-sounding pieces as the situation requires, but the English voice acting is most definitely not. Accents are all over the place, and the insertion of Japanese words into the English script sounds really forced at times, ruining immersion. Thankfully, the game offers an Immersive Mode where characters speak in their native tongues, Japanese and Portuguese, for the most part, where voice acting is of really high quality. Needless to say, Immersive Mode is the one to pick for the best experience.</p>
<p>Everything considered, Assassin's Creed Shadows is undoubtedly a solid open-world role-playing game and one of the best entries in the series in a long time. It brings back the stealth gameplay that made the series what it is and seamlessly combines it with the combat-focused experience seen in Valhalla. While the content bloat is still as annoying as ever, the solid narrative, engaging gameplay, and one of the most beautiful renditions of Feudal Japan ever released make it a game worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kill-team-blood-and-zeal-expansion-brings-ferocity-and-faith-to-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced a new expansion for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. The aptly named <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>, will not just introduce new factions to the skirmish game, but the introduction of two new mission decks.</p>

<h2>The <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/qtq917vz/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-how-the-latest-expansion-set-changes-the-game/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop goes into detail about the <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> expansion. First, the expansion will introduce new units to the game: Khorne's bloodthirsty Goremongers and the militant Sanctifiers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-card-artwork.jpg?itok=CTR09X2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-card-artwork.jpg?itok=0r-bG8NT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But the big draw in this set is an exclusive set of 32 cards. Those cards are divided into two new mission categories: Blood and Zeal. Zeal mission cards represent protection and guidance, reducing wounds or preventing death. Alternatively, Blood cards are aggressive, providing bonus damage, extra movement, and even double Fight and Shoot actions.</p>

<p>Players can draw and play from either of these decks during the Strategy phase and whenever an opponent scores Victory Points. In addition, these cards can be used with any faction in the game. In addition, you can score additional Victory Points if you played the most Blood or Zeal cards during a match. This means no matter what you play, you have some extra options at your disposal.</p>

<p>These cards play into another new feature in <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. There is a shrine statue in the set; a focal point of supernatural power. While controlling the statue, your operatives can perform two new actions. Praise/Blaspheme lets you remove cards from your hand or discard pile and draw a new one. Hallow/Defile, allows you to draw a new card into your hand.</p>

<p>This means controlling the shrine statue can grant players a major advantage. It can lead to valiant standoffs or devastating slaughter depending on how the dice go.</p>

<p>These new mission decks will not stop with <em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em>. The post continues stating each new Kill Team battle box will contain new mission packs. It mentions an upcoming box, Kill team: Brutal and Cunning, which will facilitate attacker/defender scenarios.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team: Blood and Zeal</em> will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> has a new patch that makes a raft of changes to the Paradox city builder's UI and systems such as traffic and garbage, while adding two new Easy and Normal difficulty modes and ten 'birthday parks' to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-celebrate-10-years-of-cities-skylines-with-a-roadmap-of-anniversary-goodies">celebrate the first game's 10 year anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The developers have also made some "quality-of-life improvements related to homelessness". That's "quality-of-life" in the vacuum-sealed software development sense of the simulation being nicer to operate, rather than quality of life in the sense of having a roof over your head. I would probably have gone with some slightly less dystopian phrasing, Colossal Order.</p><!--more-->
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 patch 1.2.5f1 adds a homelessness stat to the population info view, and makes homeless 'households' visible and selectable in park Selected Info Panels. "These changes make it easier to track homelessness, find homeless populations in your city, and check the situation for individual homeless citizens," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/604150552688854681?l=english">changelog</a> explains.</p>
<p>They've also tinkered with the game's systems to reduce homelessness in general. As of this new patch, "if the homeless in your city are generally employed, they simply need affordable housing," the changelog continues. "If they are also unemployed, they will need jobs suitable for their education level before they can leave the homeless status behind."</p>
<p>Colossal Order have also changed the logic for newly adult citizens leaving their childhood homes. Rather than leaving as soon as they reached adulthood, and becoming homeless if there were no affordable new homes to be had, they'll stay until certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Firstly, they'll need a job before moving out. Secondly, households will provide kids flying the roost with some starting funds for a new house: if there isn't enough cash to spare, the younger generation will stick around and contribute their incomes to the household. Thirdly, they'll now check for available homes before moving out. If there aren't any to be had, they'll leave the city and become commuters. That's to say, their housing needs will become another city's problem.</p>
<p>Going by the most recent Steam reviews, the big story with Skylines 2 is still the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">technical state at launch</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">shortage of features</a> versus its much-updated predecessor, but there have also been some headline-worthy twiddles for the economic and social systems. Last June, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-achieves-ultimate-catharsis-by-deleting-landlords-to-fix-spiralling-rent-prices-in-its-next-patch">solved the problem of soaring rents by deleting landlords</a>, a crowd-pleasing "quality-of-life" adjustment if ever there was one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems like no matter where you go, Mappa is right there, ready and waiting with an anime something-or-other you weren't expecting. This time, you'll find the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, of all places, specifically in its first expansion pack Lost Colony. Studio Wildcard revealed a teaser of the expansion yesterday, set to be released November this year, showing off one of "numerous" anime cutscenes that it will feature focusing on the character Mei Yin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
If you couldn't recognise her voice from all the grunting she does in the trailer, Michelle Yeoh is reprising her role as Mei Yin from Ark: The Animated series, and she'll be joined by Madeleine Madden as Helena Walker from the show too. The expansion will also include Moana's Auli'i Cravalho as Meeka, that little kid hanging out with Vin Diesel in Ark 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-stars-vin-diesel">reveal trailer</a>. And yes, Wildcard wants you to know that her presence alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/extinction">Extinction</a>, Genesis, and Lost Colony "leads into the events" of the sequel. Wildcard has been pretty quiet on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> since its announcement in 2020 outside of a few delays, so this at least marks some sign of life.

<p>
Lost Colony will feature the kind of additions many expansions do like new abilities, gear, building systems, things like that. Story wise you're being hunted by, uh, demons, it seems, which there appeared to be a taste of in the teaser above, in a "vast occupied city" called Arat Prime, the "birthplace of the Arks."
</p>
<p>
Ark 2 itself has been delayed numerous times, and was technically meant to come out last year, but considering Wildcard released a <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/articles.html/community-crunch-440-ark-survival-ascended-content-roadmap-r2429/">content roadmap</a> earlier this year that featured plans for Survival Ascended all the way up to December 2026, and nothing for its sequel, you're probably safe to place a bet on it taking a while longer.

And the answer is yes. The extra power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S seems to have let Ubisoft’s artists and devs go wild. </p><p>This time around, Ubisoft has implemented  seasonal shifts and created four versions of its digital Japan for each season. So when winter arrives there’s snow and ice everywhere, changing how the world looks and feels. Summer brings lots of bright, sunny days, green fields, and bugs. Spring is filled with flowers and rain. And fall, my favorite season in the game and real life, changes Japan into an orange and red collage complete with strong wind blowing colorful leaves all around. </p><p>The end result is not only the best-looking <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game ever, but one of the most visually impressive open worlds ever created. As I played through <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>for review on my big dumb 4K TV, I constantly took screenshots because everything looked so good. The first time the game shifted into fall, when walking below some orange foliage I was bathed in an orange glow from the sunlight piercing the leaves above. It looked amazing, and wasn’t something I was expecting. The <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games have looked fine for a long time, but they never really wowed me until <em>Shadows</em>. And so, because I have so many screenshots, I decided to show off my favorites. Don’t worry, there aren’t any spoilers in here.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1e88a17141671edde8de85fad7598d7" data-recommend-id="image://e1e88a17141671edde8de85fad7598d7"

<p>The use of AI in video game development has been—and continues to be—a hotly debated topic among developers and players. </p>



<p>In its annual gaming report, Unity claims that 79% of the developers polled feel at least somewhat positive about AI’s impact on the gaming industry. More specifically, of the 300 respondents to the question, 48% felt somewhat positive while another 31% said they were “extremely positive” towards its use in game development.</p>



<p>“After ChatGPT hit the market, generative AI tools were suddenly everywhere, and a lot of game developers and other creators seemed apprehensive at first&nbsp;–&nbsp;but today, 79% of devs polled report feeling positive about using AI in gaming, while a mere 5% are apprehensive,” the report reads.</p>



<p>“Developers would benefit from AI tools that simplify playtesting and automate bug detection,” Pixonic marketing director Sola Saulenko said. “Additionally, AI-powered solutions for localization and quick translations of ad copy, or even generating initial sketches for concept art, could save significant time and resources.”</p>



<p>As far as the use of AI tools is concerned, that has held steady across the industry despite a growing positive sentiment. According to the survey, some usage of AI, for example in adaptive difficulty, as dropped while other areas such as automated playtesting has slightly increased.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Unity Gaming Report – AI Usage Survey</figcaption></figure>



<p>“Devs report picking up AI tools at a similar rate to last year, but AI applications and use cases have matured considerably in the interim,” the survey reads. “They’ve grown faster and are better trained, and we as users have honed our ability to guide generative AI toward desired results as AI use has grown normalized.”</p>



<p>Lastly, regarding adoption of AI tools, only 4% of those asked said they aren’t planning to use AI tools in any capacity in 2025.

<p>When you play Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll regularly come across buildings identified as ‘Kakurega’, but what are they and how do you unlock more of them? In this guide, I’m going to dive into the topic of Kakuregas and highlight how they help your playthrough. They’re super important, and you’ll want to acquire as many as possible.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything about what a Kakurega is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-does-a-kakurega-do-in-ac-shadows">What Does a Kakurega Do in AC Shadows?</h2>



<p>Kakurega are small buildings that you’ll unlock all across the world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and they serve as micro ‘bases’. They’re points at which you can restore your supplies, regenerate your Scouts, amend your Hideout, and accept Contracts. They also act as fast travel points, which is almost certainly what you’ll end up using them for.</p>



<p>Each Kakurega offers a tactical location at which you can generate more side missions or unlock more Scouts to search for objectives or smuggle back resources to your Hideout. I’ve covered everything you need to know about Scouts in another guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-more-kakuregas-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Unlock More Kakuregas in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>If you want more Kakuregas in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you’ll need to have plenty of Mon, which is the money in this game. To unlock a Kakurega, you’ll first need to discover it on your journey, and once it’s marked on your map, you need to pay 800 Mon <strong>for each Kakurega </strong>to unlock it.</p>



<p>I’m not sure how many there are, but I managed to unlock more than a dozen in my first few hours of play – they’re <strong>everywhere,</strong> and they’re extremely helpful. </p>



<p>You’ll start the game with a core Kakurega in your Hideout in Tomika’s Homestead, but that isn’t one you’ll frequently visit – it’s much better to acquire Kakuregas on the road as you uncover the map.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is finally here, almost six months after it was supposed to be released. As a fan of the franchise since day one, I’ve been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this open-world adventure set at the heart of feudal Japan, an era that players have been requesting for <strong>many years</strong>. It’s finally here, and I’ve already logged stacks of time exploring my authentic, dual-protagonist journey.</p>



<p>This game is great, but it’s not perfect. It’s one of the best ‘modern’ Assassin’s Creed games in the series, boasting the RPG mechanics and the gargantuan open-world environment we’ve come to expect from these titles since 2017’s AC Origins was released. But that doesn’t mean it’s going to land well with every fan – myself included.</p>



<p>Read on and check out my full Assassin’s Creed Shadows review to understand what I mean.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has one of the most stunning worlds in franchise history. If there’s one thing I can say quite openly, it’s that 1579 Japan look <strong>gorgeous</strong>. The ability to move through seasons only adds to that beauty, allowing players to transition from the incredible colours of autumn to a world blanketed by a layer of snow in winter.</p>



<p>The world might feel overwhelming at first, but the pacing helps with that. Like in previous games, certain areas are considered off-limits until you’re tough enough to venture into them. And I mean <strong>off-limits</strong> – I found myself getting thoroughly humbled with a one-tap death from some hulking samurai because I crossed borders far too early more times than I can count.</p>



<p>It looks flawless on the surface, and everything from the weather systems to the dynamic day-night cycles works well. This is where my gripes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows start to surface, though.</p>



<p>For instance, wildlife is everywhere, but it seems far too random to make sense, and you can’t kill animals in this title, so the fauna doesn’t serve a purpose. Also, NPCs are going about their lives everywhere, but as with previous titles, they’re repetitive and <strong>never </strong>show any facial expressions, which always rubs me the wrong way.</p>



<p>If you choose to play via the non-guided mode, you’ll have to naturally explore the open world and find your objectives based on clues and tips, which is nice enough if you’ve got the time to do so. Exploring Japan in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is nice enough, and there’s plenty of scenery and hidden locations to uncover, but ultimately, it’s <strong>yet another enormous Assassin’s Creed map</strong>.</p>

<p>The dual-protagonist system is decent enough, and it offers a good spread between tactics. In 2015, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate was released with a similar operating model, but Jacob and Evie Frye didn’t feel different <strong>enough</strong>. In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke and Naoe are <strong>poles apart</strong>, and they couldn’t be more different if they tried.</p>



<p>Yasuke is cumbersome but immensely powerful and imposing. Naoe is at the other end of the spectrum – she’s light, agile, and stealthy, but much more susceptible to succumbing to a brutal death at the hands of enemies. I’ve stressed that Naoe is the most entertaining character to play as in series history. She’s so fast and fluid, and her combat mechanics are intense and so refreshing.</p>



<p>It’s a very intentional split, and you’re often given the choice to play through certain sequences as either character, but open-world exploration can be completed as you see fit. If you prefer the heavier hand of an armoured samurai, then opt for Yasuke, but if you want to control a speedy shinobi, then you’ll pick Naoe.</p>



<p>Even stingers, responses to each character, and parts of the soundtrack are unique depending on who you play as, which is another neat touch. </p>



<p>The acting between each character is also superb, with special props being given to Naoe’s actor, Masumi Tsunoda, who makes her major video game debut in Shadows.</p>



<p>There are plenty of weapons to get to grips with, abilities aplenty, and stacks of skills to learn. The ability system works similarly to every Assassin’s Creed game since 2017, but these aren’t demigod warriors, so they’re a little more bound to realism, which I love. I was never a fan of the mythical stuff.</p>



<p>One complaint I have about the combat mechanics is that finishing moves become very old, very fast. In a single fight, you might see the same finishing move play out several times, which isn’t a good look. The game has some of the best stealth mechanics in history, but the open combat sequences could be a bit better.</p>



<p>Also, Yasuke might be a phenomenal powerhouse, but my word, he is clumsy. As you sprint around, he’ll clash with <strong>everything </strong>from barrels to fences and from screens to doors, falling head over heels through every breakable object in the world.</p>

<p>I’ve explained that the world in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is beautiful and a wonder to explore, but the meaningful content spread around the world is quite thin. Most of the side objectives I picked up as I explored were simple tick-box quests such as ‘Kill 100 Enemies in <strong>This </strong>Region’ or ‘Find 10 Things in <strong>This </strong>City’.</p>



<p>The core campaign is great and extremely cinematic. The soundtrack and the visuals mixed with the set pieces and acting all win top points from me, but it’s the side stuff that needs sharpening. There’s just not a lot of weight to the filler content. The side contracts, the Shadows Projects, the collectable hunting – it’s all just bland and quickly becomes boring.</p>



<p>Do I really want to kill 100 bandits in a certain area five times to unlock a new hat? Probably not.</p>



<p>There is a <strong>lot </strong>of side content, from assaulting enemy castles to finding spontaneous missions from NPCs, but once you’ve done it all a few times, you’re left not wanting to do it again – but you <strong>need to </strong>if you want to unlock everything. </p>



<p>If you want to eliminate every target that pops up, you’ll be in for a pretty tough time, too. As I dug into Assassin’s Creed Shadows, I found myself constantly finding more circles of enemies to assassinate:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a similar story with the base-building elements of the game. You can build a full-fledged Hideout complete with multiple, open-ended buildings, ornaments, trees, rocks, and so on. It’s great, but I feel that the requirements for constructing certain buildings are unrealistic and such a grind, casting a pall over a feature that I was looking forward to.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve spent hours in photomode capturing every angle of this idyllic, incredible world, but there’s only so much depth you can get from snapping photos in a fairly empty world.</p>

<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>There’s enough meat on the bones here to justify the purchase, and the game’s visuals, stunning world, and cinematic campaign all contribute to my recommending the title. However, the cracks in the game’s foundations are evident, the flaws that have existed for years are front and centre, and it’s not enough of a change from the formula that we’ve known for years to feel <strong>all that different</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is technically sound and authentic and represents a world that fans of the franchise have wanted to explore for many years. The artistic choices are great, the soundtrack is impressive, and the ambience is stellar, plus Naoe makes for a phenomenal lead, but there are just too many niggling flaws for me to consider this a perfect title.</p>



<p>Buy it, but don’t expect anything too different from the last game – or the one that’ll probably follow this one.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest open-world epic in Ubisoft’s flagship franchise, and it teleports players to Japan in 1579. It’s a game set at the height of a disruptive, conflict-laden era, and with a dual-protagonist system fronted by both a samurai and a shinboi, the player finds themselves at the heart of that conflict.</p>



<p>I’m here to give you the ins and outs of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows story before you jump in.</p>



<p>Without further ado, what <strong>is </strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows about, and where does it fit into the overall landscape?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-explained">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Explained</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows opens up in and around 1579 in feudal Japan. The legendary daimyo, Oda Nobunaga, is seeking to unify the clans of Japan with an iron fist, but he’s being challenged by foreign oppressors and rebellious organisations lurking in the country’s shadows.</p>



<p>The game, which explores the late Sengoku period, tells the tale of Oda Nobunaga and those close to him, revealing plots and shady cabals working to bring down the would-be ruler and overthrow him and his people. The player will assume control of two protagonists – an honourable African samurai named Yasuke and a young but capable shinobi named Naoe.</p>



<p>Their stories, which start entirely separate, will intertwine as the game unfolds.</p>



<p>Players will explore nine regions of Japan, all of which are steeped in history, architecture, art, politics, and culture. From the hills of Iga to the monasteries of Yamato, and from the mountains of Tamba to the seascape of Wakasa, players will dive into a massive open-world environment in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>In typical Assassin’s Creed fashion, the player will be charged with taking down vast arrays of enemies. They’ll need to disrupt conspiracies, eliminate malicious groups, and topple powerful warlords. They’ll do this by assembling a network of confidants, utilising a range of period-accurate weaponry, and striking from every angle.</p>



<p>Players will ultimately learn about Naoe’s familial connection to the Assassin Brotherhood, discovering how and why she has acquired a hidden blade and why she has the typical talents of an assassin, like eagle vision.</p>



<p>It’s not to be missed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/the-technical-magic-behind-doctor-strange-s-portals-in-marvel-rivals<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Boasting an expansive roster of playable heroes and villains from across the Marvel multiverse, many with bespoke mechanics, Marvel Rivals presented developer-publisher NetEase games with a myriad of technical challenges to overcome, especially when optimizing the hero shooter for consoles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tieyi Zhang, a senior graphics engineer at NetEase Games, hosted a talk at GDC this year to demystify the process behind one specific mechanic: Doctor Strange's portals. If you haven't seen these portals in action in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Doctor Strange can open a portal from where he's standing to anywhere on the map within a certain distance. That portal will (in most circumstances) show where players will end up after passing through once the portal is placed. They work and look very similar to those seen in the recent Doctor Strange movies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although teleporting a player from one point of three-dimensional space to another already presents technical challenges for the device rendering the environment, the talk mostly focused on a greater challenge: how NetEase managed to render multiple angles of the same environment at the same time with minimal frame loss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhang walked the audience through the many steps of the rendering techniques used to produce the effect, discussed the inspirations behind the effect, and showed the differences in frame rate between various iterations of the technique during his talk.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/save-the-saves" target="_self" data-discover="true">Converting saves, a cross platform journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He started the talk by showing how the mechanic functioned when using a tool baked into Unreal Engine called Scene Capture 2D, which works like a virtual camera without any optimization changes. He introduced the tool, saying, “For those of you who are familiar with [Unreal Engine 5], the go-to solution for portals is the Scene Capture 2D component. As a built-in tool, it is perfectly documented and supported by many tutorials,” before going on to praise the tool’s “Consistent visual quality in creating captured content.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the tool’s apparent reliability, the frame rate dropped drastically as Doctor Strange passed through the portal in the videos shown in Zhang’s slideshow. The example shown onstage exhibited a doubled required rendering time, causing the game’s frame rate to plummet to roughly half. However, this could vary in extremity based on the complexity of lighting in the scene. Regardless, given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals'</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> competitive bent, dropped frames during a match can be fatal, especially in such a competitive landscape where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/15-percent-of-steam-users-played-2024-s-game-releases">less than one fifth of active PC players</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> play new titles.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/deep-dive-crafting-detailed-and-dynamic-water-in-planet-coaster-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Deep Dive: Crafting detailed and dynamic water in Planet Coaster 2</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="It Takes Two"><span>It Takes Two</span> offered a guiding light</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, the engineer dredged up a surprising point of inspiration for his solution to this framerate issue: 2021’s widely acclaimed co-op hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It Takes Two</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Hazelight’s use of Unreal Engine to render two simultaneous views without drawing an overwhelming amount of power from the computer or console running it led Zheng to utilize a similar rendering technique for the portals. Zheng joked about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>It Takes Two</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s largely airtight framerate, quipping, “Does this game use some kind of magic? I don't know!”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using lagless split screen rendering techniques pioneered by Hazelight and EA’s heavy hitter, Zheng worked out an optimized, frame-efficient solution that took advantage of tech that’s usually reserved for local split-screen co-op, essentially placing another player into the game in order to render the view from the other side. This approach allowed NetEase to use the GPU on board the device much more efficiently, drastically decreasing dropped frames. But NetEase pushed things even further by skipping roughly every 5-10 frames per second within the portal, conserving the computer’s power even more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doctor Strange’s portals have proven to be one of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel Rivals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’ most beloved mechanics, with players finding clever placements and strategies that highlight just how versatile this tech can be, including a now-patched exploit that allowed players to essentially trap their opponents inside of a map’s geometry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/6-steps-to-a-successful-playtesting-process-for-an-indie-developer" target="_self" data-discover="true">6 steps to a successful playtesting process for an indie developer</a></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Charlie's a Milwaukee-based games, food, travel, and tech reporter with work also featured in the likes of IGN, CNN, NPR, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/iem-recommendation-hardware-regret<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember when Chris wrote that blog about <a href="https://aftermath.site/dont-buy-a-yeti-mic-please-logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shitty Yeti mics</a>? That was inspired by me and my refusal to heed his advice by buying a garbage mic he warned me at length would be garbage. I returned that busted mic and basically never thought about my audio setup again–until recently, when I was, let’s say, politely informed via our podcast producers that it’s time to get big boy gear. This has been bad news for me, though very good news for Chris.</p><p>Look: despite working in a tech beat, I am aggressively not a gear guy. I don’t understand <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware</a> and I <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hate to tinker</a>. I want the simplest possible items that do what I need them to do with minimal interaction from me. Until recently, my audio setup was an <a href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-pro-gamedac?srsltid=AfmBOorHbUiKULQaTA7Pl0oPtsLYtPcI11AZYfYOBeYTc9-qBVChX5vI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arctis Pro headset</a> that a past Gizmodo colleague dropped on my desk one day with an unceremonious “Take this.” It comes with (Chris, look away) a little display thing with a knob that I have straight-up never understood how to use and whose manual I have long since lost, and it glows in embarrassing gamer colors, but it makes noise in my ears and transmits my voice to other people’s ears, so I love it.</p><p>But if you watch our streams and listen to our podcasts, you’ve probably realized that it’s not the best. I have long known this and felt bad about it, and Chris has been offering for months to help me improve my situation, but I kept waving him off. This was a combination of guilt at inconveniencing him and fear that his aid would begin a long and complex descent into gear hell, where each upgraded item would require additional items until I was lost in a tangle of cords and jargon.</p><p>But when critique of my setup stopped just coming from Chris and his high and justified professional standards and started coming from outside the Aftermath house, I decided it was time to relent. Chris biked over with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lknwuev6x22w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a microphone</a> that is basically the length of my torso, and which connects to my PC via an <a href="https://us.focusrite.com/products/scarlett-solo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interface</a> with lots of little knobs that, despite being intimidating to me because they are knobs, are pretty straightforward. He very politely set the whole thing up for me and verified that it sounded good, and I thought that was the end of it, until our weekly staff meeting revealed that my embarrassing gamer headphones were bleeding into the high-powered mic, necessitating new ones.</p><p>This is the exact cascading situation I was hoping to avoid, but Chris ignored my weeny protestations and simply mailed some <a href="https://aftermath.site/you-should-get-some-chinese-in-ear-monitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEMs</a> to my house. When I opened the envelope I was greeted by the world’s most humiliating box, which features a detailed watercolor rendering of an anime lady. There is nothing in this world that could be <em>less</em> my aesthetic, except possibly having to keep editing my Slack messages about my new gear to say “IEM” instead of “headphones.”</p><p>How are the–<em>sigh</em>–IEMs? They seem good. They plug very sensibly into my–<em>SIGH</em>–interface, and they sounded very <a href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good</a> once I undertook the tedious process of convincing the various programs on my PC to use them instead of every program insisting I want sound to come out of my webcam, which is my PC’s favorite place to try to send sounds. Someone asked me <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3lkdyoszk622a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why IEMs over headphones</a> and I was thoroughly unable to answer them, though of course <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lke34a3hwk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris</a> was. My favorite part so far is that my joke Bluesky post about the box has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3lkgza7zl7c2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kellymerka.bsky.social/post/3lkmbx7ic4c24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sp00kydeer.bsky.social/post/3lkmnv5o4r22e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> to also purchase the IEMs, which feels like a real testament to the power of a Chris Person recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The only thing I can say with confidence about the IEMs is that they come in a <em>really</em> great box, anime lady aside. It has super solid little compartments, and even the tiny plastic bag for its eartips is really robust and seals well. Honestly, I’d feel bad throwing the box away and want to figure out a way to repurpose it. It could be good for holding odds and ends on my bikepacking trips, though it’s a little big. I briefly reflected that it could make a nice, though very nerdy, box for an engagement ring if I were ever to propose to anyone. I recognize that my <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/pets/why-do-cats-like-boxes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cat-like</a> obsession with the box over the IEMs is probably the most Riley reaction to all this, but at least I have enthusiasm for <em>some </em>part of this situation.</p><p>Once I get a new mic stand that goes low enough for me to not need a booster seat to actually reach the mic, I bet I will sound much nicer on our podcasts than I have to this point. Chris also tried to entice me by saying I could record <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-a-mandolin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandolin</a> videos with it instead of my current bootleg <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lcmeewolet2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">setup</a> of leaning my phone against my French press, an offer I totally fell for. Fuck you, Chris; thank you, Chris; I hope the rest of you are enjoying your new IEMs.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter"><h3>Kotaku.com.au Would Have Been Better Off Dead</h3></a><p>A 404 would have been preferable to whatever this is</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/monster-hunter-movie"><h3>That Live Action Monster Hunter Movie Kinda Rips</h3></a><p>Who would’ve thought Paul W.S.

		<p>In a world of forgotten 3D platforming stars, Croc is a green, snappy reminder that time has no meaning, and that your childhood was genuinely only a few moments ago, rather than the truth. If you’re ready to put on your nostalgia shoes, and think about a time when Sony’s PlayStation didn’t need a number because it was the only one, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos Remaster is due to release on the 2nd of April 2025, for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC as a GOG exclusive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos coming April 2nd!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTbQv0NENaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This beloved title from Argonaut Games, founded by 3D gaming visionary Jez San OBE, harkens back to a time where 3D platforming was the apex predator of the gaming scene. It captured the hearts of players worldwide in the late ’90s – the original really did release in 1997 – and is now making a triumphant return with stunning new visuals, updated quality-of-life features, and an array of exciting additions that are sure to delight longtime fans and new players alike. These features will evoke a sense of nostalgia and deepen appreciation for the game’s rich history.</p>

<p>The remastered Croc Legend of the Gobbos brings the heart-warming journey of Croc, the humble and courageous little crocodile, equipped with his iconic backpack and wiggly butt back to life with vibrant high-definition graphics, modern controls and an updated camera system (thankfully) and refined gameplay mechanics. Players will once again embark on a delightful quest across a series of imaginative worlds by running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail spinning to rescue the adorable Gobbos from the nefarious Baron Dante’s grasp. Players will navigate Croc through beautifully recrafted levels brimming with quirky enemies, puzzles, and hidden secrets in order to save Croc’s adoptive family of  Gobbos from captivity.</p>

<p>The original Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remains a much-loved title in many gamers’ back catalogue, and it’ll be interesting to see how the remaster fares when it launches on the 2nd of April.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1902030119524331617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and consoles on April 2nd. You can wishlist the game on PC now via GOG, but wishlisting isn't yet available for the console platforms; it's coming "soon", according to Argonaut.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what's happened to the Steam version of the game, Argonaut revealed back in October that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-no-steam-release" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming to Valve's platform</a>, citing a desire for the game to remain DRM-free on PC (although not on consoles, of course).</p>

<p>The game was part of a rush of mascot platformers released around that period, going up against the likes of Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 64</em>, Naughty Dog's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and Insomniac Games'&nbsp;<em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, all of which were released within a couple of years of one another.</p>

<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>wasn't quite as well-received as the aforementioned titles during its time, but it garnered a cult following, and in August last year, its original publisher Argonaut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster" rel="nofollow">announced its revival</a>, as well as the game's remaster.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster will, of course, sport fresh HD graphics, as well as new controls and an updated camera to make the game's occasionally janky platforming a little less frustrating. You can also expect a&nbsp;<em>Croc</em>&nbsp;treasure trove with lots of materials pertaining to the game's creation.</p>




<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>, as well as on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, on April 2nd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro gaming specialist company Analogue has announced that its upcoming Analogue 3D, a "reimagining" of the original Nintendo 64 console, has once again been delayed.</p>

<p>Back in October, the console was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed until the first quarter of this year</a>, but in an updated <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for the machine, Analogue says it's now intended to ship "by July 2025" following a delay. The company doesn't give the reason for said delay.</p>

<p>Analogue does, however, say it's "working hard to get your 3D order in hands ASAP" and that it "appreciate[s] your patience". The company also reiterates that its refund policy is still "no questions asked", so while you don't need to do anything if you're happy with your pre-order, you can cancel it and get your money back if you wish.</p>

<p>If you're not aware of the Analogue 3D, it's a retro console that's intended to serve as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">sort of supercharged N64</a>; it can play any cartridge officially released for Nintendo's console, but it's got a bunch of upscaling tricks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D will be fully region-free, and it'll support Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, as well as sporting its own operating system. The console is engineered in FGPA, too, so Analogue says it won't have any of the kind of glitches you might expect from software-level emulation.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is basically a reimagined N64, it'll also feature the same four controller ports included with the original console, and you can even use your original N64 controllers with it, although you may prefer to use the (not included with purchase) 8BitDo 64 controller.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp%E2%80%99s-omen-16-slim-gaming-laptop-packs-an-rtx-5070-gpu-into-a-thin-ish-chassis.1137951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631371/hp-omen-16-slim-gaming-laptop-rtx-5070-specs-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HP is introducing a new entry into its PC gaming line with the Omen 16 Slim. As the name indicates, it’s a 16-inch gaming laptop with a “slim” profile — the thinnest portion being 20mm / 0.79 inches. What its product branding doesn’t immediately tell you is that the Omen 16 Slim is aimed at a midrange spec, using an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, where the bigger, badder, heavier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332194/hp-omen-max-16-elitebook-x-flip-g1i-zbook-ultra-14-g1a">Omen Max 16</a> tops out with the RTX 5090.</p><p>The Slim is meant to be more portable than its higher-tier siblings. I presume it will also be cheaper — in addition to a lower-spec GPU, it opts for lower-cost extras, like a four-zone RGB keyboard instead of customizable per-key lighting. But HP didn’t have finalized pricing in my brief time checking it out at a recent preview event. At the time, HP reps only disclosed that it’s expected to launch in June.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Even setting aside my personal dislike of number pads on laptops, that keyboard looks a little cramped to me.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Omen 16 Slim features a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS display capable of 240Hz refresh and 3ms response time. It uses Intel Arrow Lake CPUs, starting with a Core Ultra 5 225H and topping out with a Core Ultra 9 285H. As for its GPU, you can go up to Nvidia’s RTX 5070 — which is the bottom end of the current crop of 50-series cards until, as is expected, Nvidia launches new entry-level options. For storage and RAM, the Omen 16 Slim starts at a typical 512GB and 16GB, respectively.</p><p>While HP’s new laptop may be slimmer than its other 16-inch offerings, at 0.79 inches and 5.4 pounds, it isn’t the slimmest or lightest around. Razer’s $3,000 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">Blade 16</a> for 2025 trimmed some of its fat from previous years and is both 0.20 inches thinner and 0.75 pounds lighter than the Omen 16 Slim. But even if the Slim isn’t the slimmest around, it maintains a decent port selection, with a 10Gbps USB-C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, a 10Gbps USB-A, two 5Gbps USB-A ports, ethernet, 3.5mm headphone / mic combo jack, and HDMI 2.1. It’s also got Wi-Fi 6E support.</p><p>There really isn’t one thing about the Omen 16 Slim that reaches out and smacks me with excitement, but it seems on paper to have a respectable set of specs and features — especially if the price is right. Hopefully we’ll find out what that price is well ahead of the expected June launch.</p><p>Aside from the new 16 Slim, HP’s Omen laptop line will soon see refreshed versions of the Omen 17, Omen Transcend 14, and HP Victus 15. The Omen 17 and Omen Transcend 14 will both be configurable with the RTX 5070, while the Transcend 14 gets Intel’s Arrow Lake and the Omen 17 opts for AMD Strix Point (and is still stuck with a 16:9 screen — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7">yuck</a>). The HP Victus 15 is down in the bargain basement, to be offered in a wide range of configurations as low as the two-generations-old RTX 2050 — though HP’s spec sheet does list it with the option for a “Nvidia GeForce RTX Next Gen Laptop GPU.” Perhaps an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/leaked-geforce-rtx-5060-and-5050-specs-suggest-nvidia-will-keep-playing-it-safe/">RTX 5050 or 5060</a>?</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631589/hyperx-cloud-iii-s-wireless-gaming-headset-hp-announcement-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HyperX is announcing a new flagship Cloud III S Wireless gaming headset that adds Bluetooth 5.3 and a second microphone for standard headphone use on calls. It’s a follow-up to the Cloud III Wireless from 2023 that was HyperX’s most popular model, and which our own Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686476/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-features-price-release-date">found very compelling</a>. Like that model, the new Cloud III S Wireless headset takes a working formula and enhances it with some new features and improvements.</p><p>Using the HyperX Cloud III S in Bluetooth mode can get you up to 200 hours of usage, even more than the already high 120 hours it gets via 2.4GHz wireless. It still uses a small USB dongle for 2.4GHz, though it can connect dongle-free to specific HP Omen gaming laptops that have the connectivity built in.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Yep, that looks like a HyperX Cloud headset alright.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Since this is an “S” model, it’s unsurprising that it looks nearly identical to its predecessor and is available in the same all-black and red / black color options. But when you pop out the 10mm boom mic on the III S, you uncover a backup omni-directional mic hidden underneath. I wish all gaming headsets had this, since it allows you to take your headset on the go and not lose any core functionality. (Why not allow a gaming headset to double as your headphones when traveling or commuting — as long as they’re not ugly as sin?) You could also pop the boom mic off the last-gen model, but doing so restricted it exclusively to listening duty.</p><p>Another fun new feature is the magnetic earcup covers that allow users to hot-swap different designs, including 3D-printed ones — you can even 3D print your own. like you can with the recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336191/check-out-these-colorful-modular-mouse-shells">HyperX Pulsefire Saga Pro mouse</a>. The ones I saw in my brief in-person demo of the Cloud III S Wireless all had a dragon motif, which was — a choice.</p><div id=":Rcbdber6:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The tiny mic port-hole is buried beneath the boom mic’s slot.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Here be dragons for some reason.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Otherwise, the Cloud III S is a lot like the Cloud III, with the same 53mm drivers and cushy earcups for lengthy play sessions. The headset is expected to launch in May, but like other new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/631371">gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/631559">non-gaming products</a> from HP announced today, pricing is not yet solidified. Though, for reference, the original Cloud III Wireless launched at $170, is currently listed for $150, and is <a href="https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-gaming-headset">discounted to $99.99</a>.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

Also, he’s never really played the games because modern controls are just a pain in the ass. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196191" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Ragnarök DLC: Spend 19 Minutes In Valhalla" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="1149" data-playlist="196191,196196,195922" data-current="196191"><div><p>God Of War Ragnarök DLC: Spend 19 Minutes In Valhalla</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21730.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “Right now I’m working on the adaptation of this video game called <em>God of War</em>, that Amazon has ordered two seasons of and they asked me to come in, I’m literally in the writers room and that’s my new thing,” Moore, best known for the 2004 <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> reboot<em>,</em> said on a recent episode of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sackhoff Show with Katee Sackhoff</a></span> who starred in that show as Kara “Starbuck” Thrace  (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></span>). </p><p>He added that he hasn’t played video games since the arcade days, however, and quickly bounced off the new <em>God of War </em>series. “The controllers now…” he said laughing, “Press R1. Which one’s R1? Oh, I’m dead! I can’t quite get a hold of that.”</p><p>If anyone else said this, gaming fans—a notoriously chill and reasoned bunch—would unleash a cacophony of online Kratos yells. Moore, who has credits on some of the most beloved TV episodes around, starting with <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, can probably get a pass.

So, maybe Moore having no experience with the actual games will be a boon to the project. Or he can just watch a longplay on YouTube. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In the 11+ years since the ID@Xbox program was announced, the indie game self-publishing program has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generated more than $5 billion</a> in payments to indie developers, according to Microsoft. The program shows no signs of slowing down, with over a thousand games released just in the past year.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-id-xbox-program-has-generated-billions-for-indie-game-developers">The ID@Xbox Program Has Generated Billions for Indie Game Developers</h2>



<p>The amount of money generated though the ID@Xbox program and given to indie developers has greatly increased in recent years. In 2020, the program’s director Chris Charla <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/what-idxbox-is-doing-for-the-next-generation-of-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> ID@Xbox paid developers close to $2 billion since 2014, and had paid out more than $1.5 billion just in royalties since the program’s start. By 2022, Xbox reported that total royalties paid out had increased to $2.5 billion.</p>



<p>Since the program’s inception, some of the most popular and successful indie game titles have made their way to Xbox Game Pass. Just in the past year, Microsoft claims that over 1,000 games were added to Game Pass through ID@Xbox over the past year, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 2024 indie game of the year, Balatro</a>.</p>

Xbox says that the program’s upcoming lineup includes several titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Descenders Next, FBC: Firebreak, and the highly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/towerborne-xbox-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Xbox has announced that Towerborne will be launching on Xbox Game Preview on April 29. The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC via the Xbox app, and Game Pass all on the same day.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/towerborne-game-pass-xbox-game-preview-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox channels</a>, with the game also being available for press at this weeks GDC event.</p>



<p>Alongside the release on Xbox, Towerborne will get new features such as cross-platform play and progression between PC and Xbox consoles, couch co-op on Xbox consoles, and a new class skills progression system.</p>



<p>“Probably the biggest change to the game itself, Class Mastery is an all-new progression system that makes every Ace unique, based on individual player choices,” Xbox says. “By completing missions, players earn Skill Points, allowing you to fine-tune your chosen class, unlocking Focus Skills and Class Mechanics that drastically change how you play. And don’t worry, you can swap your Skill Points freely between missions, meaning you can experiment and find the perfect build.”</p>



<p>Developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Studios</a>, Towerborne first released on PC in early access in September 2024. Despite early strong impressions, the game had only hit a peak concurrent player count of 596 on Steam, with only 12 concurrent players playing at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-role playing game where the player takes control of the heroes of the game called ‘Aces’, who must set out to reclaim lost territories and make the land of Belfry safe. </p>



<p>Will you be playing Towerborne? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The director behind Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield was asked to pick the most influential game of all time. Todd Howard decided there are actually two titles that fit that billing: Super Mario Bros. and Doom. But that's not all, as the Bethesda Game Studios executive producer also offered up what he thinks are the two most important titles, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1901709779061420388" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the official BAFTA Games Awards account asked Howard for his selection regarding the most influential game of all time. While the acclaimed developer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/">currently busy with The Elder Scrolls VI</a> (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/">and Fallout 5</a>), he started his response with a small, but intriguing detour. "Well first, I think, the two most important games of all time are Tetris and Pac-Man for what they do for gaming overall and bringing so many people to it," Howard said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the actual question, Howard selected Super Mario Bros. and Doom as the most influential games because he sees their DNA in modern games--even three decades later. "Two games where if you trace things games are doing today, you can trace so much of that back to those games," Howard said.</p><p dir="ltr">Howard most recently served as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-raids-indiana-jones-game-studio-doesnt-get-crushed-by-giant-boulder/1100-6520460/">executive producer on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. He also got to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-pulled-a-john-travolta-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528440/">appear with Harrison Ford on stage at The Game Awards</a> in December. As for Super Mario Bros., it's still one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#2">the top-selling video games of all time</a> after launching on NES in 1985. Meanwhile, Doom came out on PC (specifically MS-DOS) in 1993 and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hacker-puts-playable-version-of-doom-on-nintendo-alarmo/1100-6527574/">gets hacked onto every device known to mankind</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-bafta-games-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6298/#1">The 21st BAFTA Games Awards</a> will take place April 8, with Senua's Saga: Hellblade II receiving the most nominations with 11.</p>

What if Call of Duty was filled with wizards? Suspicious Developments creative director Tom Francis barely even remembers where the joke originally started, but it helped him and his team build out the foundation for one of 2024's success stories: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The joke was combined with a simple idea—what if there was an XCOM alternative that was easier to parse so that casual players could jump in smoothly?—to create the core design philosophy behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A game that earned 98% positive reviews on Steam and doubled the revenue of Suspicious Developments' previous game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis held a short talk about the variety of "cheats" he used to turn one joke into a 15 hour tactical adventure at the Game Developers Conference.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cheats for jokes">Cheats for jokes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The core premise for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was so simple that Francis and team put their brains together and combined "tactical" and "wizardry" words to create ideas for characters. It was a process—and their first "cheat"—they called their joke engine, or a system that came up with jokes quickly and easily. They came up with and illustrated characters like a "Riot Priest" that would eventually become full on characters in their game alongside the likes of the Traffic Warlock and the Necro Medic.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-ufo-50-s-incredible-8-bit-journey" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside UFO 50's incredible 8-bit journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis's cheats detailed how several well known writing methods worked for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Methods like dialogue trees that put the player's sense of humor first, word-by-word text that helped timed-based jokes hit in stride, character-based comedy that doubled as both jokes and context, and the idea that jokes should be told with the lowest amount of friction possible. Don't put a ton of work into a single joke—or take your player on a detour—to avoid letting them down in a big way.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis detailed one joke, in which two players are hugging a wall as they prepare to breach a room, where one character starts trash talking someone that she noticed inside. The character on the other side of the door could hear her and a speech bubble popped up as he said, "wow, Jen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">We got a ton of value out of that out of very little cost," Francis said. "It doesn't matter if it bombed, because we didn't take much effort to get there."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Moving beyond the joke">Moving beyond the joke</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> may be a game built off a joke, Francis emphasized that you can't stop there. Some games that have nothing but jokes exist and do well, but others that want to inspire empathy and emotion have to dig deeper to work with the player. This led to another cheat, including the idea that parody doesn't give a license to repeat a genre's mistakes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I like military action games, but their views don't align with mine," Francis said, adding that he couldn't set his game within a different genre, because it wouldn't align with the premise of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "We wanted a Tom Clancy-like universe with wizards, so we needed it to look like a Tom Clancy universe."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis felt that the majority of military games shared the idea that "killing people is cool, as long as they are foreigners," and wanted to give players something vastly different. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't revolve around a national military fighting foreign enemies or terrorists, it has a group of criminals fighting a theocracy. It focused on punching up.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Telling a story with cheats">Telling a story with cheats</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The process of choosing how to tell a story in a game is just as complicated, if not far more complicated, then whatever story you choose to tell in a game. Games offer a massive variety of tools to deliver a story to the player, which is why Francis provided a third and final set of cheats during this talk that included the idea that comedy and magic can let you get away with nearly anything and two methods to effectively deliver context and dialogue to players: breach conversations and conspiracy boards.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/encouraging-player-creativity-in-caves-of-qud" target="_self" data-discover="true">Encouraging player creativity in Caves of Qud</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A special type of mission exists throughout </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> called an anxiety dream, and it is exactly what you think it is. Each character has a dream mission where they talk to and fight alongside another version of themselves. It gives the player deep insight into that character's thoughts and feelings that wouldn't be possible in any other mission in the game. There would be no reason for those players to share those feelings elsewhere.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A glimpse of each character's private life goes a long way," Francis said, as he admitted that the mere idea of an anxiety dream felt ludicrous to him. It was accepted because magic gives developers a license to get away with almost any ridiculous idea.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After breaking down many of the writing methods that he and his team used to flesh out </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Francis also detailed two production design ideas that made the delivery of that writing much smoother.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first was the main setting for the game, breaches. Throughout the game characters follow the same mission and dialogue structure: they line up right outside a door, share a bit of dialogue, and then breach the room. That happens several times within a single mission, giving characters multiple opportunities to share quick and witty bits of dialogue. It's a major reason why many players found the game's jokes natural and funny.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis ended his talk by showcasing the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> conspiracy board, which laid out the game's plot like an evidence board with pins and string in a police station. It was a simple way for the players to recap the story, cement the ideas the story presented, and reinforce that the story was taking place in a larger world. He encouraged the developers of any game with a story to have a similar mechanic that would help visual learners keep track of what was happening while they were playing.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Eight years after its release, the Nintendo Switch hardware continues to be rather impressive for what it has achieved, and with some small changes to its specs, it could have been even more impressive, as shown by a new test video shared online today.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a>, who previously shared other <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-tegra-x1-steroids/">test videos</a>, shared today a new video showing how an overclocked Nintendo Switch modded with 8 GB RAM runs 20 PC games, such as the Dead Space games, Kingdom Hearts III, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Grand Theft Auto IV, Fallout 3, NieR Replicant and others via Wine 9.22 w/ ESync Support + DXVK Fix. Some of the most demanding games included in the test, like Rise of the Tomb Raider, don't achieve playable framerates, while others, like Kingdom Hearts III and the Resident Evil 2 remake, run surprisingly well, though only at low resolution, which is impressive nonetheless also considering they are not running natively on the system.</p>
<p><iframe title="20 PC Games Tested on Nintendo Switch (8GB RAM) - Wine 9.22 Esync" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_q2DjKjsuc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Due to its low specs and total RAM, porting games to the Nintendo Switch from other consoles could be a real challenge, but developers should have far less trouble porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2. The new Nintendo system launching later this year may not be as powerful as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but its better specs over its predecessor will reportedly make it <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/">easier to port current-generation console games over.</a> We still do not know how much developers will have to make compromises in their ports, but thankfully, it won't take much longer to see the new system in action, as a Nintendo Direct focused on it is scheduled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>
