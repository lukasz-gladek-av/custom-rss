            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/need-for-speed-turns-30-the-lasting-legacy-of-eas-fastest-franchise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s December 1994. The Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th Street, Pulp Fiction, and Forrest Gump are duking it out at the global box office. Boyz II Men’s On Bended Knee is about to (temporarily) cede the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 to Here Comes the Hotstepper by lyrical gangster Ini Kamoze. In video games, the original PlayStation has just launched in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But forget the PlayStation for a moment, because December 1994 also marked the arrival of <em>another </em>interactive icon: The Need for Speed, on the ill-fated 3DO home game console. The 3DO, despite being lauded as <a href="https://time.com/archive/6675290/the-best-products-of-1993/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Time Magazine’s 1993 Product of the Year</u></a>, was ultimately a flop. There was no '3DO II'. The Need for Speed, however, was <em>not </em>a flop. There <em>was </em>a Need for Speed II. And III. And a fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, 30 years later the Need for Speed series is still with us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s become one of the best-selling game series of all time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-1-3do-1734000662200.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1994's Road &amp; Track Presents The Need for Speed.</figcaption></figure></output><p id="the-need-for-speed-debuts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Need for Speed Debuts">3DOh Yeah</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Need for Speed is actually one of the most successful game franchises ever,” notes Criterion Senior Creative Director John Stanley. Stanley has been with Criterion for 14 years working across multiple EA series, from Battlefield to Battlefront, but his predominant focus is Need for Speed. “So it’s a very big honour and mantle to be lifted each time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">15 years ago, sales figures for the franchise hit 100 million copies. A decade ago they’d rocketed past 150 million. Precisely what they sit at today is not known, but what’s clear is Need for Speed’s success and longevity make it a monster within the racing genre.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Need for Speed is actually one of the most successful game franchises ever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly got off to a flying start. The original Need for Speed was an immediate critical hit, despite the 3DO’s own particular woes. Fortunately, subsequent ports to PC, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn would go on to make The Need for Speed a commercial smash as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presented by Road &amp; Track Magazine and developed by EA Canada, The Need for Speed’s 3DO debut boasted just eight cars – a modest mix of European exotics and 1990s sports icons from the US and Japan. It also featured a total of three tracks. Yes, that’s paltry by later standards, but it’s worth keeping in mind that this was entirely typical for the time – at least, until the original Gran Turismo arrived several years later with a garage pumped up to unprecedented proportions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also important to note that EA Canada had previously been known as Distinctive Software. Prior to its acquisition by EA in the early ’90s, Distinctive Software was responsible for the influential original Test Drive, its follow-up The Duel: Test Drive II, and cult, early 3D racing favourite Stunts (known as 4D Sports Driving in some regions). That high-speed experience was abundantly evident in The Need for Speed. Like the early Test Drive games that came before it, The Need for Speed asked players to dodge traffic as fast as they dared while outrunning the pursuing police. Electronic Gaming Monthly called it “the racing game to beat on the 3DO.” Edge Magazine declared it featured “the richest 3D environment ever seen on a home system.” GamePro was similarly full of praise, positing that “[i]f you dream of racing exotic sports cars, it doesn’t get any better than this incredible game.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-2-1734000726995.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Need for Speed featured cabin views for all vehicles.</figcaption></figure></output><p id="raising-the-high-stakes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Raising the (High) Stakes">Raising the (High) Stakes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it <em>did </em>get better. Need for Speed built itself into a true racing juggernaut throughout the remainder of the ’90s, and it lapped Test Drive as the premier purveyor of playable police pursuits and illegal street racing. The series became <em>the </em>place to find the greatest exotics of the era: the Lamborghini Diablo and Ferrari 512TR. The Jaguar XJ220 and McLaren F1. Down in my own native Australia, the games were even localised with their own, regional-exclusive covers, and injected with the hottest homegrown sports sedans of the time. That was truly something, as a teenager; to be stalking a games store and see the sickest Australian cars on the street staring back at me from the shelves. That was unique to Need for Speed during this era.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-aus-1734000792323.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Regional-exclusive cars and covers made Need for Speed unique.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But perhaps more than anything, Need for Speed carved itself out a reputation as a series that celebrated not just racing, but <em>risk</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I argue it’s the forerunner, or has been and still <em>is </em>the forerunner, in the only franchise really delivering on consequence,” says Stanley. “That thrill of the chase. I think nothing else out there in the racing game genre does that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By asking people to outrun police, and eventually even place their pink slips on the line, Need for Speed was a series that pushed its players to take risks. For clarity, by the time Need for Speed came around, we’d admittedly already faced the long arm of the law in 1987’s Test Drive, and many of us would’ve already lost rides to rivals after racing for slips in 1989’s Street Rod. But even if it wasn’t the first, Need for Speed was an extremely early adopter of these philosophies of risk – and it certainly became the most recognisable. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-high-stakes-1734000845837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1999's Need for Speed: High Stakes.</figcaption></figure></output><p id="going-underground"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Going Underground">Tuna, No Crust</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the years went on, the property eventually found itself taking risks of its own. Firstly, with 2003’s radically reinvented Need for Speed: Underground, and then with 2005’s Need for Speed: Most Wanted – which is still the best selling game in the whole series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh man, they’re my beloved,” grins Justin Wiebe, who jokingly describes himself as the “old fossil” EA dug up for this chat. Currently Studio Design Director at Ripple Effect, Wiebe’s history with the Need for Speed series dates back to Hot Pursuit 2 in 2002. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re like my crown jewels, to be honest with you,” he continues. “I’ve had a long career here and boy am I proud of having a chance to work on those games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Underground, Wiebe explains the team didn’t quite know what they had on their hands at the time, but they were all hooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was so addictive to play,” he says. “It was the introduction of things like drag racing for the first time, where it was a completely new way of playing at high speed. And we were starting to explore other new, emerging racing genres – like drift racing and stuff like that – and starting to bring all of these new and cutting edge ideas, and then mixing in customisation. We were pioneering at that time.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-ug-2-1734001037130.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2003's Need for Speed: Underground arrived in the slipstream of The Fast and the Furious.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA followed Underground with a direct, open-world sequel – the first open world in the series – but the bigger question was where to take it next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We kept asking ourselves, ‘Well, what do we do now? How do we one-up this? What are we gonna do?’” says Wiebe. “And we had an exceptional executive producer at that time, Mike [Mann], who came in and he basically said, ‘I want to make it <em>the </em>most elicit experience that we’ve done to date. I want to bring in the cops, and I want to make them feel so threatening, like they are the real world.’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So that was the mandate to me: take these cops and make everyone absolutely terrified of them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that was the mandate to me: take these cops and make everyone absolutely terrified of them.’ And I said, ‘Then, Mike, I gotta take away people’s cars that they earned; I’m gonna impound them, and they’re gonna lose them for a while.’ And he’s, like, ‘<em>Do it</em>.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[Need for Speed is] a franchise which is big, but it’s also unafraid to try to take risks. To do things differently. To challenge the norm. And that’s what I love about working on the franchise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an entertaining twist, Wiebe even found himself <em>in </em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted as the racer Taz – number 14 on the Blacklist – after one of the actors failed to show up for a photoshoot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They started wandering around the office trying to see, like, ‘Who’s the most shifty-looking person we have here?’, and then they’re, like, ‘<em>You!</em>’” chuckles Wiebe, stabbing his finger in the air. “So yeah, they just grabbed me and did a couple of shots and there I am. It was a good time.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/taz-nfs-most-wanted-1734001094796.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vince Kilic, aka 'Taz', was number 14 on Need for Speed: Most Wanted's famous Blacklist.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Stanley, within the corridors of Criterion, Most Wanted remains a revered example of the series at the peak of its power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I cite Most Wanted so much within the studio,” he says. “Just around the way that it managed to weave together the narrative, the gameplay, the progression. Everything comes together in this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A term that I use a lot, and now I’ll have to drink a shot for this: ludonarrative harmony. Because actually executing on that in a game? So important. And Most Wanted is a masterclass in that, and something that I definitely cite a lot.”</p><p id="always-changing"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Always Changing">On: The Run</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been almost two decades since Need for Speed: Most Wanted, and the series has continued to evolve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you look at it, Need for Speed’s never remained the same,” says Criterion Producer Patrick Honnoraty, who’s worked on every Need for Speed since 2012 – from Criterion to Ghost and back to Criterion. “From one iteration to the next, it’s always had something that was different.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For good and for bad – because those things don’t always work and they don’t always resonate with players – but we guarantee that we’ll always be doing something different.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Things don’t always work and they don’t always resonate with players – but we guarantee that we’ll always be doing something different.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“‘For good and for bad’ is a great example,” says Wiebe. “For example, my experience on creating Need for Speed: The Run. We really tried to break some new ground there. We talked about getting out of the car, and we had all these grandiose visions for how it was going to be more than just racing; the character’s going to get out of the car. But then we realised very quickly, ‘Well, we can’t <em>really </em>do that’, so we introduced some quicktime events.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, we all love quicktime events, right?” he adds with an ironic smile.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Wiebe believes they ultimately created “a grand racing adventure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted it to feel like your life is on the line,” he says. “That it’s more humanised than ever before about the character and the story that they’re in, racing from coast to coast. I’ll be the first to stand up and say that didn’t really work, but I’m proud of the fact that we tried it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was actually on a fan forum a few months ago and I actually was shocked at how highly-rated some of the fans actually made that game. I had thought, ‘Well, that’s a bit of a lump of coal in my resume.’ But it turns out that it actually has a massive cult following, and there are certain people that absolutely <em>adore </em>that game. And that brought a little joy to my heart; that we took a risk and there are some people that really found something to love about it.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That brought a little joy to my heart; that we took a risk and there are some people that really found something to love about it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Honnoraty has noticed the same thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think every Need for Speed I’ve worked on, when it’s come out it’s been, ‘Oh my god, it was no good; it was rubbish,” he says. “People didn’t like it. And then years pass and it’s, like, ‘Ah, it was so good! It had these great elements to it. It was the best Need for Speed. Why don’t you go and make one back like that?’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Need for Speed is always too ahead of its time, is my thing. Every time we bring one out. Every time we bring one and it doesn’t strike, people look back on them so fondly.”</p><p id="defining-the-series"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Defining the Series">Defining the Series</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">30 years on, building a Need for Speed game is an exponentially more complicated task than it ever was, and more challenging than ever. For Senior Vehicle Artist Frankie Yip the work required is significant, but he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The cars in Need for Speed are far more intricate now compared to the earlier days of the franchise,” explains Yip, who has worked on the franchise for the entirety of his 20-year career in the gaming industry. After picking up a copy of Need for Speed: Underground for PlayStation 2 as a teenager, Yip got so hooked he took a 3D modelling course and was soon living his dream, making cars for Need for Speed: Underground 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I actually thought I was going to fail in the 3D school,” says Yip. “All the assignments? All I did was just model cars. And they’re, like, ‘That’s not part of the assignment.’ I don’t care; I like cars. So my portfolio was just all cars.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I actually thought I was going to fail in the 3D school. All the assignments? All I did was just model cars.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Yip, dealing with the vast amount of content produced for each car is not as straightforward as it may seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ll give you an example, just to break it down,” he begins. “Bodykits, for example. Say a car has three bodykit designs. That’s three front bumpers, three rear bumpers, three sideskirts, three front fenders, so on and so on. That tallies up to 15, 20 individual parts. But allowing the player to seamlessly and smoothly mix and match those parts? Yeah, it sounds simple, but it actually involves a significant amount of work. You run into issues; like, this part doesn’t fit with this. This part doesn’t fit with <em>that</em>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s different variations in bumper widths, fender shapes, fender sizes; the list goes on. Panel lines, shut lines; nothing lines up. So, how do we make this all work? We actually have to build out <em>every single part combination out there</em>. You take that 15 to 20 individual parts I mentioned, and you multiply it to an additional 60, or well over a hundred. It depends on the car. Like, every car is a different shape. It <em>is</em> a ton of work, but what this does allow is it allows the player to have thousands of part combinations. And who doesn’t want that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So now you know why, in earlier Need for Speed titles, we just restricted the body kit to be equipped as one whole unit. But honestly, where’s the fun in that?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Criterion Vehicle Art Director Bryn Alban, there’s a bigger-picture challenge; that is, what defines Need for Speed to its massive and multi-generational audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It means so much to so many people, and everybody’s got a different opinion as to what a good Need for Speed is,” says Alban, who’s been around since the days of Need for Speed: Shift and brings the experience of building his own Skylines over the past 20 years to his role on the franchise. “So trying to appease everybody at all times is super difficult. Even down to the nitty gritty details of what customisation we put on our cars; it’s so divisive a subject for our players that it’s almost impossible for us to get it a hundred percent right, all the time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So when we do get things somewhat correct, it’s great. But when you see those comments where you’ve missed something, it really hurts. It hurts to your core. You’re, like, ‘Oh yeah, I forgot that we should’ve added <em>that </em>to the game.’ So, yeah, it’s really tricky and tough to get that balance of making the perfect Need for Speed, really.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So when we do get things somewhat correct, it’s great. But when you see those comments where you’ve missed something, it really hurts. It hurts to your core. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it’s worth, I’ve been missing Australian cars in the Need for Speed series since they stopped featuring back in the early 2000s, and Alban agrees it could be time for the series to circle back and include them again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, that’s a very valid point, and I think it’s true that Australian cars have been underrepresented in Need for Speed in its most recent history,” he says. “I can’t give you a reason why that is the case, but it’s definitely something that we should take a look at in the future moving forward, to see if we can redress that balance a little bit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you look at things like Holden, they’re very iconic within Australia,” adds Honnoraty. “They’re very interesting things; the utes that you have. So I think those are interesting examples for us to look at. And I’m sure, Bryn, you’d tell me there’s plenty of them in the drift scene as well?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, you see them crop up,” Alban responds with his finger clearly on the pulse. “I mean, just this last week there’s the Drift Matsuri that’s happening in Japan, and I saw that there were a couple of Ford Falcons over there in Japan doing their thing. So there’s definitely opportunities to tap into that, I think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s obvious Alban knows his cars. There’s also a fun synergy in the fact that the first Instagram video I’d watched of the very Falcons Alban is referencing features one <a href="https://www.instagram.com/au.house/reel/DCl4xGNMaXX/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cruising through a Tokyo tunnel to Get Low by Lil Jon &amp; The East Side Boyz.</a> It should go without saying that anyone who played Need for Speed: Underground has that song seared into their synapses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-hp2-1734001289099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Redress away, team!</figcaption></figure></output><p id="need-for-speeds-biggest-challenge"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Need for Speed's Biggest Challenge">To the Window, to the Wall</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need for Speed itelf has cruised both high and low over the last three decades but, while the team seems conscious that the series hasn’t <em>always </em>been at its best, there’s a clear feeling that it’s always remained faithful to being fun and approachable above all else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the trajectory has been bumpy, actually, in some cases,” admits Honnoraty. “But what’s happened – and I think what’s been most important – is if you think about the first inception of what The Need for Speed was, it was really accessible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember going to what was probably the local video game shop, or computer shop, at the time, and me and my friends saw it on the 3DO. We were like, ‘What’s this?’ We all jumped on it, on the 3DO, and you felt badass. Being able to drive it, being chased by the cops; there wasn’t an experience that was really like it at the time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think today the biggest challenge we face is literally the age of the franchise, and what it's been.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s really tried to stay true to that formula. It’s still accessible today; a lot of car racing games are not so easily accessible, so people still have the option to jump in and have fun with a Need for Speed game. It makes you feel like you’re just a bad-arse... It’s really inside of the DNA; it’s always there.</p><div id="rank-the-need-for-speed-series" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Need for Speed series</h3><h3>Rank the Need for Speed series</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Honnoraty, what makes handling Need for Speed tricky today are the side effects of how long the series has survived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think today the biggest challenge we face is literally the age of the franchise, and what it's been,” Honnoraty continues. “It’s been so many different things and appeals to so many different people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We even see the debates between players: which is the best game, and why is it the best game? You look at [Underground and Most Wanted]. The divisive debate that happens between which one of those is better and why – and how different they really are and what they were looking at – means that we sit in a place where Need for Speed means many different things to many different people.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Honnoraty gives an example where, after speaking to attendees of the Need for Speed Payback booth at EA Play, some players compared the demo to Most Wanted, and others were adamant it reminded them of Underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I’m, like, ‘How? What? They’re completely different!’ he says. “So I think it’s just that people carry with them the feeling that they had when they played those games… I think that’s the hardest thing today; it’s honestly reconciling what Need of Speed means to players. And you’ve seen it; when we go in one direction with something that doesn’t quite work, and it doesn’t appeal to certain sorts of players. Or we go in another direction, so it’s a real thing that we have to tackle with, day in and day out. But John [Stanley] and I work with it constantly. We think we’ve nearly cracked it, so we’ll see.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don’t forget the Porsche Unleashed crowd that would argue that that is the number one Need for Speed of all time!” adds Wiebe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Exactly! Exactly!” smiles Honnoraty. “We have a very vocal member in our player council that’s <em>very </em>vocal on Porsche Unleashed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then the Carbon crowd, the ProStreet crowd,” lists Stanley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The list goes on,” replies Honnoraty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The list goes on indeed. So too, we hope, will Need for Speed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the window, to the wall, ‘til the sweat drop down… well, you get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Nvidia replaced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/latest-nvidia-drivers-to-be-locked-behind-geforce-experience-app/">the longstanding GeForce Experience App</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">a new, unified Nvidia App</a> last month, most GPU owners probably noted the refresh and rebranding with nothing more than bemusement (though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/nvidias-new-app-doesnt-require-you-to-log-in-to-update-your-gpu-driver/">the new lack of an account login requirement</a> was a nice improvement). Now, testing shows that running the new app with default settings can lead to some significant frame rate dips on many high-end games, even when the app's advanced AI features aren't being actively used.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/we-tested-nvidia-app-performance-problems-games-run-up-to-15-percent-slower-with-the-app">noted the performance dip</a> after reading reports of related problems around the web. The site's testing with and without the Nvidia App installed confirms that, across five games running on an RTX 4060, the app reduced average frame rates by around 3 to 6 percent, depending on the resolution and graphical quality level.</p>
<p>The site's measured frame rate drop peaked at 12 percent for <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> running at 1080p Ultra settings; other tested games (including <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, and <em>Stalker 2</em>) showed a smaller drop at most settings.</p>
<h2>Unfiltered</h2>
<p>This is a significant performance impact for an app that simply runs quietly in the background for most users. The impact is roughly comparable to that of going from a top-of-the-line RTX 4070 Ti Super to an older RTX 4070 Ti or 4070 Super, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/4070-ti-super-review-faster-gpu-for-the-same-799-but-not-nvidias-best-value/">based on our earlier testing of those cards</a>.</p>

<p>For any fan of gaming, a great title becomes even better when it’s subjected to fantastic post-launch content – and that tends to come in the form of top-shelf DLC. This could be anything from a few missions to an entire sub-campaign some ten or fifteen hours in length. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best DLCs ever released, deciding once and for all what the greatest game expansions are. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-dlcs-ever">Best DLCs Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our representation of the best DLCs ever released in gaming – let us know in the comments if you agree with this breakdown. </p>



<h3 id="h-1-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">1. Shadow of the Erdtree (Elden Ring)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was such a phenomenal release that it became a candidate for <strong>Game of the Year</strong> at 2024’s edition of The Game Awards. This stellar piece of DLC brought millions of players back into the fold, all ready to fight notoriously difficult bosses in a brand-new section of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-blood-and-wine-the-witcher-3">2. Blood and Wine (The Witcher 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blood and Wine was effectively a ‘send-off’ for The Witcher 3, taking place long after the main story was completed (chronologically) and serving as a ‘retirement’ of sorts for our hero, Geralt of Rivia. There’s a fourth-wall break at the end of the expansion that is worthy of a chef’s kiss – one of the best DLCs ever, indeed.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-point-lookout-fallout-3">3. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout is one of the creepiest Fallout DLCs ever, plunging players into a foggy, mutant-infested backwoods county and leaving them to fend for themselves. It was one of the largest expansions Bethesda Game Studios had released at the time, boasting a wide, open map and hours of extra content for the best Fallout game ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-left-behind-last-of-us">4. Left Behind (Last of Us)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left Behind was a poignant, emotional expansion to an already heart-wrenching game. It told the backstory of Ellie and explored the journey she took before becoming bitten and discovering she was immune to the Cordyceps infection in The Last of Us. It was a perfect prequel that offered a few solid hours of gameplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-burial-at-sea-bioshock-infinite">5. Burial at Sea (BioShock Infinite)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>BioShock Infinite was released back in 2012 and at the time of writing is the last game in the series. It was a phenomenal and beautiful game that was perfectly expanded upon in Burial at Sea, a two-part DLC that spans BioShock’s in-game ‘multiverse’. It takes players back to Rapture, the instantly recognisable location from BioShock and BioShock 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-6-dragonborn-skyrim">6. Dragonborn (Skyrim)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dragonborn was a massive piece of DLC that took players from the province of Skyrim to Solstheim to face off against an ancient dragon priest with a thirst for power. In this expansion, players travel through the likes of Apocrypha, learn new and powerful abilities, and explore a sizeable and dangerous map. </p>



<h3 id="h-7-nuka-world-fallout-4">7. Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s another Fallout DLC, but honestly, Bethesda Game Studios did such a phenomenal job expanding these games that it deserves another spot on this list of the best DLCs ever. At the end of Fallout 4’s lifecycle, BGS released Nuka-World, an expansion that serves as a perfect endgame, ultimately giving players one last opportunity to make a grand choice to impact their ‘status’ in the game for the final time. </p>







<h3 id="h-8-freedom-cry-aciv-black-flag">8. Freedom Cry (ACIV: Black Flag)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Freedom Cry ultimately arrived on the scene as a standalone expansion, telling the story of Adéwalé, the strong and memorable supporting character from 2013’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. It’s one of the most impressive stories in Assassin’s Creed history, with players assuming the role of this former slave turned pirate turned assassin in an adventure that lasts a good few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-phantom-liberty-cyberpunk-2077">9. Phantom Liberty (Cyberpunk 2077)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Phantom Liberty quite literally changed the face of Cyberpunk 2077, going hand-in-hand with an update so large it was dubbed ‘Cyberpunk 2.0’. Phantom Liberty was a star-studded expansion that introduced an entirely new area of Night City and took players through a story so emotional that it broke hearts worldwide when it wrapped up.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-undead-nightmare-red-dead-redemption">10. Undead Nightmare (Red Dead Redemption)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Undead Nightmare is legendary, and these days, fans of the Red Dead Redemption franchise are wondering why Rockstar Games hasn’t released a new version for RDR2. Released in 2010, Undead Nightmare saw players revisit John Marston, gunslinger extraordinaire, as he attempts to survive a brutal and terrifying zombie outbreak. It was a brilliant expansion that boasted its unique multiplayer modes. </p>

<p>Starfield is a great game, but sometimes, using one of the title’s best commands or cheats can make it a more enjoyable experience. If you’re playing on PC, you can lean on <strong>hundreds </strong>of commands and codes to alter your game – sometimes with hilarious results., In this guide, I’m breaking down the best Starfield cheats and commands, just for you.</p>



<p>I’ll also teach you a trick that’ll allow you to unlock Starfield cheats on Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats">How to Use Starfield Cheats</h2>



<p>Call them commands, call them cheats, it doesn’t matter – they’re basically the same thing. On PC, it’s seriously easy to use Starfield commands, and it all begins with tapping the key that sits alongside the ‘1’ on the top left of your keyboard, just beneath the ESC key. It might be a tilde or it could be a ‘grave’ symbol, but whatever it is, it’ll produce the same result.</p>



<p>Once you’ve hit the right key, your on-screen console will pop up and you’ll be able to just type in the Starfield cheats you want to enable, hitting enter and applying them at will. For most of these Starfield commands, you’ll be able to type the same thing into the console again to disable them but bear in mind that any save with cheats applied will be locked out of achievements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starfield-commands">Best Starfield Commands</h2>

<p>If you want to use Starfield cheats and commands on Xbox, you’ll need to have a PC – that’s the caveat at play. As Starfield is ‘Play Anywhere’, you can access your saves across the two different platforms. That means you can open Starfield on PC, enable the cheats, then boot up your save on Xbox, and the commands and cheats will still be applied. </p>



<p>Again, this will still disable achievements and can result in a corrupted save or crashed game. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contrary-to-popular-belief-final-fantasy-and-warframe-voice-actor-ben-starr-is-not-a-gerbil-breeder.1063971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ben Starr has had a wild past couple of years. A professional actor for over a decade, Starr’s star turn in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> as main character Clive Rosfield put him on the map in the world of video games, and his good looks and oddball sense of humor took things from there. He’s since <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amassed a sizable online following</a>, something in which he takes great pride. He also likes to mess with his fans. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Starr_(actor)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starr’s Wikipedia page</a> claims he was “president of the gerbil breeding society” at his alma mater, University of Durham. This is not, strictly speaking, true.</p><p>Starr, who has posted videos of himself as <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1752344712663417281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tifa from<em> Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, a very sexual version of <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1832784072700989503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1719716479111692583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glitched-out cube from <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a>, among others, loves a good bit. So when I mentioned his Wikipedia page during an interview at a <em>Warframe: 1999</em> press event in LA last week, he happily finished my sentence for me.&nbsp;</p><p>“Gerbil breeding,” he said with a look of satisfaction on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>"I did a podcast once where I said, 'You can change my Wikipedia, and I won't ever change it back. I don't really care,'" Starr told Aftermath. "And someone did. So the fact is, no one's ever changed it or checked, and I haven't changed it. I should do more due diligence, but I quite like this scenario where somebody is like 'One more question...' and I'm like 'There you go. You read my Wikipedia.' I love it."</p><p>Despite his far-reaching reputation as a vaunted gerbil breeder, Starr does not plan on ever trying his hand at turning two gerbils into significantly more.</p><p>"I would know nothing about that, and I would never want anyone to think that I would breed gerbils,” Starr said. “I love gerbils, but I think gerbils should breed by themselves of their own free will. I think gerbils should be allowed to live on their own terms. I shouldn't be their lord and savior and enforcer of breeding. I fight for the rights of all gerbils. I stand here now with gerbils in solidarity saying 'Strike, strike, strike for your rights.'"</p><p>Starr might carry himself with an air of madcap silliness, but he takes his craft extremely seriously. He views games as fertile soil for performances he couldn’t pull off anywhere else, and he’s thrilled that this industry has welcomed him with open arms.</p><p>"I'm fortunate enough to lend my, for lack of a better word, talents to really interesting explorations of the human condition, but on social media, I can be a complete idiot – to be genuine and serious and emotional and vulnerable in a game, but online, I can be a clown at the same time," he said. “I'm really excited to see where the rabbit hole goes, like taking a lot of the learnings I've been fortunate to take from film theory, from stage, to see what I can do in a performance sense – getting on the performance capture stage and seeing what I can do there and push myself in ways that I haven't done before. ... You're not restricted by the way you look. Aesthetics are not important. It's about the essence of your character and what you bring to it. It's honesty reflected in a very different way."</p><p>Starr, who’s recently landed gigs in games like <em>Warframe </em>and <em>Hades 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/ff16s-ben-starr-will-host-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting this year’s Golden Joystick awards</a>, is happy to see the video game industry shine more of a spotlight on actors.</p><p>"I think for a long time in this industry, many incredibly gifted performers have been sidelined because people don't often play games for the performance. But there's something like [<em>Warframe: 1999</em>] where they are showcasing the talent,” Starr said. “They're celebrating us as an integral part of what makes this expansion special, and it's been a really cool thing to embrace."&nbsp;</p><p>Starr does, however, wish a few select companies at the top of the food chain would do a better job of respecting the talent that lends so many games their unique voices. Striking, after all, <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t just for gerbils</a>.</p><p>"As a fan of video games, I want to see them made,” said Starr, who is based out of England and isn’t currently part of SAG-AFTRA. “But also as a person who works in [the industry], I want to see them done in a fair way that rewards the incredible amount of work that goes into performance and certainly how we can as fans engage with games, which I think more and more and more you've seen [involves voice actors]."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The nonstop barrage of jokes, then, belies Starr’s awareness of what he views as a responsibility to fans.</p><p>"There's a desire to paint fans and parasocial relationships as very dangerous things, and I get that,” he said. “I'm sure those can exist. But as a fan myself, I recognize how to interact with performers and know when to step back. I know my responsibility. It's my responsibility to let fans know that I'm engaging in a way that's healthy and in no way anything other than that. I think we get it: I'm a playful idiot. If you want to play along with me, I'm playing games with you. … How do we nod and wink and understand that, fundamentally, this is all pretend, but at the same time respect and venerate the work? It's a push and pull all the time."&nbsp;</p><p>But there is at least one place where these polarized expressions of Starr’s personality can meet in the middle, gerbil-like: He’s open to voicing a gerbil in a video game.</p><p>"If there are any developers out there who are doing any gerbil-based games, I would love to [voice them],” he said. “As you can see from my Wikipedia, I was head of the gerbil breeding society, so I know a lot about them."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix"><h3>Squid Game: Unleashed, Like Other Squid Game Spinoffs, Misses The Point</h3></a><p>Netflix's mobile game highlights how weird it is to turn Squid Game into IP</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new Unearthed Arcana for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. Specifically, they have revealed official Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer playtest material, meaning the class may be returning to the game in a future supplement.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-artificer" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast has released the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer Unearthed Arcana for all users. The post includes a half-hour YouTube interview with Todd Kenrick and D&amp;D's lead designer, Jeremy Crawford.</p>

<p>The playtest material is notable since the Artificer class was absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Player Handbook</a>. This updated version of the fantasy TTRPG rules was marketed as an update and consolidation of core player options, so the community saw its omission as a slight.</p>

<p>The class's core appeal is still intact: creating gadgets and gizmos that run on magic. The big change is that magical infusions, the ability to imbue mundane items with magic abilities, have been replaced with the ability to make magic items.</p>

<p>There's still a limitation on how many can be made based on Artificer level. But being able to just make Bags of Holding or Sending Stones is a notable upgrade. Furthermore, artificers can destroy these magic items to regain spell slots in a pinch. The benefits of the 2014's Artificer infusions are now separate magic items which can be made with the 2024 Artificer's class features.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer's late-game features are also tweaked. Flash of Genius can be used in response to a dice roll failing and can be used multiple times equal to their Intelligence modifier. And Soul of Artifice doesn't require a Reaction anymore, just destroy a magic item when you drop to 0 HP and you're back in the fight with 20 HP.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-artificer-alchemist.jpg?itok=bWkNzanb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-artificer-alchemist.jpg?itok=ncZQLxJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Unearthed Arcana also makes tweaks to the Artificer's subclasses. The Alchemist's Chemical Mastery feature has been redesigned, allowing them to cast the 2024 spell Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron.</p>

<p>The Armorer's Perfect Armor has gotten a damage boost. The Artillerist's Eldritch Cannons have gotten more tactical options and explosive punch. Lastly, the Battle Smith's Steel Defender has gotten some adjustments to its health and damage output.</p>

<p>The release of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer Unearthed Arcana may hint at the class returning in a future supplement. It is hard to tell since certain UA material like the Mystic class has been lost to the ages. But given the Artificer's popularity, this may hint at good things on the horizon.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this Unearthed Arcana goes live December 24, 2024.</p>

And some of these players are tired of being tossed into matches where their entire team is duelists, forcing them to play healer or tank to help balance the lineup. </p><p>One solution to this problem is a role queue. Found in games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, a role queue lets players pick a role, like tank, and then find a match that needs that specific role. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s case, this means every match has a tank, two attackers, and two healers. This should lead to more balanced teams, but the devs behind <em>Rivals </em>don’t seem interested in adding this system to the shooter.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Dot Esports</em></a></span><em>,</em> Chen said that the studio is “not considering a role queue” at the moment. </p><p>“The team’s goal is to offer a wider variety of team composition through team-up skills and their own designs, to let people play their Marvel superheroes rather than limiting players to choosing a role.” </p><p>Chen further explained that data from matches shows that <em>Rivals </em>currently doesn’t need a role queue system. </p><p>“We want people to have a Marvel experience where they’re free to select what they want. [Since the beta test earlier this year], things have been rational and within expectations. In our Competitive play recently, there is a lot of different compositions emerging from players and we’d like to continue to monitor these fun compositions and how they impact our game.” </p><p>While some might be upset that Chen and developer NetEase aren’t rushing to balance the game or add a role queue system, I’m happy to see an online multiplayer game studio step back and let things be chaotic and messy for a bit before jumping in to sand things down and make everything more fair and balanced. </p><p>One of the reasons I enjoy <em>Rivals </em>is because everyone feels powerful and matches rarely play out the same way as nearly every character seems viable with the right comp or strategy. And while a role queue might be nice in ranked mode, I hope if it is ever added, it doesn’t signal a shift to balancing all the fun out of <em>Marvel Rivals. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now we get an encore during the holidays as well. This year’s Day of the Devs: Game Awards 2024 Edition didn’t disappoint either. Every time I think the heavily curated, very personal, extremely intimate showcase <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297">can’t possibly top the last one</a></span>, somehow it still does.</p><p>As the video game industry ping-pongs from one big-budget sequel and live-service disaster to the next, with seemingly ever less room for creativity, experimentation, and risk-taking, Day of the Devs reminds us that wild, wonderful things are being made all around us as long as you know where to look. And the organization, which started as a collaboration between DoubleFine and iam8bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dayofthedevs.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before becoming a donation-supported non-profit</a></span>, does indeed know where to look. </p><p>This year’s event featured 19 rad-looking games from all sorts of genres, sporting a wonderful assortment of visual styles and coming from devs around the world,  and I can’t wait to try them all. Especially <em>TankHead</em>, which seems like what you’d get if you set <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> in the world of <em>Wall-E</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>A successor to the 2009 cult hit <em>Eliss</em>, <em>Faraway</em> is about a shooting star charting the cosmos while chasing high scores and vibing out to a soundtrack that reminds me of <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em>.  The whole game is operated with a single button input as you use gravity wells to slingshot your way around celestial bodies. “Let me teach you something about infinity,” says the game’s creator. It’s meant to be infinitely replayable like <em>Tetris</em>: simple on the surface but full of lasting depth. </p><p><strong>Developer and publisher:</strong> Little Eyes <strong>/ </strong>Steph Thirion</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2025</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831000/Faraway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831000/Faraway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam Wishlist</strong></a></span></p></div><div><p><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em> follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, <em>Ultimate Chicken Horse</em>, with lo-fi pastel art and chaotic antics.

It’s a stealth action deckbuilder set in an occult noir world where you can scout, teleport, set traps, blind enemies, and use other abilities to get through levels unscathed and discover what strange magic is haunting Steeple City. “It’s a little bit like if you took <em>Metal Gear Solid </em>and replaced the guns and tools with cards,” director Joshua Boggs said. </p><p><strong>Developer and publisher:</strong> RiffRaff Games</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> Xbox Series X/S (Game Pass), PC</p><p><strong>Release date:</strong> TBD</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2857810/Sleight_of_Hand/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2857810/Sleight_of_Hand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam Wishlist </strong></a></span></p></div><div><p>The developers are billing this one as an expressive platformer. It’s a 3D tropical colorfest that looks like a Dreamcast game got a major glow-up. You parkour through dilapidated ruins swallowed by warm seas in an open world full of time trail challenges, collectibles, and cinematic set pieces. You can even tag buildings during your travels for players online to find in their own games.</p><p><strong>Developer and publisher: </strong>Fabraz</p><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>TBD</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam Wishlist</strong></a></span></p></div><div><p>You might have seen a glimpse of <em>Kingmakers</em> when footage from it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937?_gl=1*1w50kw6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ2NDkxMC4xNDIuMS4xNzM0NDY1OTEyLjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937?_gl=1*1w50kw6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ2NDkxMC4xNDIuMS4xNzM0NDY1OTEyLjU4LjAuMA..">went viral earlier this year</a></span>. It’s a game about saving the future by traveling back into the past and uniting medieval England by battling massive armies using modern-day weapons of carnage.

Here, snowballs will continually fly across the screen when playing 5v5 elimination and free-for-all matches. In Mei's Yeti Hunt, five players must work together to lay down traps and capture the Yeti, who his Winston in his Yeti skin.</p><p>Freeze Flash Elimination is Overwatch 2's version of freeze tag, where players who get frozen can rejoin the match by having their teammates thaw them out.</p><p>Overwatch 2's 6v6 experiment has also begun on the King's Row map. It'll be in role queue format, with 2-2-2 rules, meaning that teams need to be split into an equal number of tanks, damage, and support characters. The experiment will last until January 6.</p><p>There are also plenty of new holiday-themed skins to earn for characters. Playing three, six, and nine games will reward you with the Merry Marionette Echo Legendary, Cassidy's legendary, and Widowmaker's legendary skins, respectively.</p><p>Some games received holiday and winter-themed updates recently--this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-gets-a-cheerful-holiday-update-this-week-with-new-minigame/1100-6528497/" data-ref-id="1100-6528497">Stellar Blade</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-new-free-winter-wonder-level-on-thursday/1100-6528374/" data-ref-id="1100-6528374">Astro Bot</a> have gotten their own.</p>

Do you think the company cares as much about the rights of <em>other </em>people's games on their platforms?</p><p>Hrm, I dunno, let's take a look. Anyone who's tried to wade through the garbage prominently available on the eShop would already have some doubts about the company’s standards on that front already, but for a more specific case study, check this out:</p><figure></figure><p>On the top left is <em>Unpacking</em>, which is a very good video game. The next five games are most definitely not <em>Unpacking</em>, even though their key art makes them very much look like it. They're not made by the same team, they're not continuations or sequels, they're just some slop--seemingly using AI art on the thumbnails, no less--made to try to cash in on the established game's brand.</p><p>That's some mobile gaming-type bullshit. Surely Nintendo--with the company's history of quality control and video game litigiousness--would not allow such a thing? Like, if <em>Super Mario Galaxy's</em> shop listing was immediately followed by an AI-generated thumbnail for <em>Super Mario Galaxy: New Chapters</em>, someone would end up either bankrupted or strangled and stuffed in the back of a black Toyota Crown.</p><p>Here, though, even <em>Unpacking's </em>creators are being left on read.
