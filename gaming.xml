		<p>The travails of Grand Theft Auto 6 really are a sign of just how much game development has changed over the decades. There were three GTAs on PS2, there were two on PS3, and now we’re lucky to see one big game a generation from Rockstar – I think we ought to really count Red Dead Redemption 2 in this. It’s something that’s echoed by the likes of Naughty Dog, where the most prestigious studios now take what feels like forever to produce their games.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m talking about that because GTA 6 got delayed by another six months.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>So, that’s obviously the biggest headline of the week, closely followed by the back and forth over work unionisation at Rockstar. Let’s get to those and all the other biggest stories we’ve caught.</p>

            <p>Active development on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> will end on the same day that Operation: Infinite kicks into gear: 18th November.</p>
<p>Released in 2021, Halo Infinite was announced amid a 10-year plan to "continu[e] Master Chief's saga for years to come".</p><p> Now, however, with less than half of those ten years on the clock, Halo Studios - formerly known as 343 Industries - has confirmed Operation Infinite is, ironically enough, not infinite at all, but will "be the last major update currently planned for Halo Infinite".</p>

<p>"Operation: Infinite may be the last major update currently planned for Halo Infinite, but we're fully committed to supporting players with exciting challenges, ranked rewards, and community events throughout next year and beyond," the team <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview">said</a>.</p>
<p>"As the Halo Studios team shifts focus to in-development projects such as Halo: Campaign Evolved, we'd like to thank our Halo Infinite players for years of steadfast support."</p>
<p>The team said it's been a "legendary run of Seasons, Events, Fractures, and Operations, with plenty of maps, modes, sandbox additions, Forge tool upgrades, and incredible memories along the way", and thanked Halo's community for its support and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Your excitement is the lodestar for our every effort. Whether you're a long-time player, a recently returned Spartan, or a brand-new ally, we’re grateful to have you on our Fireteam.</p>
<p>"As we look ahead, your feedback will continue to help us refine our goals, in hopes of exceeding expectations and delivering the best Halo experiences possible. Throughout our day, we look to your suggestions, your art, and even your memes as constant reminders of our dual commitment to faithfully stewarding Halo's legacy and forging its future."</p>
<p>Starting 18th November, Operation: Infinite will introduce a 2X boosts on Career Rank and SP, 100-tier Operation Pass, eight earnable armour sets, new Ranked Seasons, and "200 never-before-released customisations" arriving in The Exchange.</p>
<p>The news comes after Halo art director Glenn Israel left Halo Studios last month after 17 years working on the franchise.</p>
<p>Israel worked on titles such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-3-odst">Halo 3: ODST</a> and the most recent Halo Infinite, across both Bungie and 343 Industries (now known as Halo Studios). As he left, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-art-director-leaves-studio-after-17-years-with-ominous-message-alluding-to-discontent">dropped an ominous message that appears to allude to discontent within the studio</a>. It follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs at Microsoft</a> this year.</p>

		<p>Halo Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> has reached the end of the road as a live service, with Operation: Infinite set to be the last major content update when it arrives on 18th November.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview#thankyou">team writes</a>, “As we look back on four years of evolution and updates in Halo Infinite, we’d like to thank our community for your steadfast support. Without your feedback and enthusiasm, Halo Infinite multiplayer would not be the special place it is today: a robust arena for slaying and playing, with something for every Spartan.</p>


<p>“With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us. While we remain committed to supporting <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned.”</p>
<p>This final content update will bring a&nbsp;2X boosts to Career Rank and SP, a 100-tier Operation Pass, eight armour sets to earn, new Ranked Seasons, and 200 new customisations in The Exchange.</p>
<p>Following this, the game will still be receiving stability updates, and Halo Studios will continue to support it with rotating in-game challenges to let you progress through the Operation Passes that will remain available, and there will be new ranked rewards, ranked seasons and community events. There just won’t be any more big content drops and battle passes.</p>

<p>This is in large part down to Halo Studios needing to put more resources toward their upcoming projects. A lot is being made of the studio’s old plan for Halo Infinite to be a 10-year game, but that plan was made at a very different time with different studio leadership, and grand aspirations for the Xbox Series X|S generation. But Halo Infinite then suffered a difficult launch, the Xbox Series has struggled, and Microsoft has dramatically changed its plans. For Halo, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/343-industries-is-now-halo-studios-announces-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/">studio has jumped across to developing in Unreal Engine 5</a>, it’s rebranded from 343 Industries to Halo Studios, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo: Campaign Evolved has been announced</a> – a remake of the first game in UE5 that’s coming to PS5, Xbox Series and PC. There’s also another mooted live service game rumoured to be in the works.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Halo Infinite through its first year or so, but it’s actually a little bit surprising that the studio stuck it out this long.</p>

		<p>Escape From Duckov has hit 3 million sales since it launched on October 16th, Team Soda has announced. It is one of the big indie success stories of the year, with players taking to the slightly bizarre premise of the game. In Escape From Duckov, players play as an armed duck in a survival RPG where the goal is to gather resources, build a base, and survive the more hostile ducks that live in the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="We're Ducks. We're Armed. | Escape From Duckov - OUT NOW! ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewmV79zP5XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a message celebrating 3 million sales, Team Soda said, <em>“Three million Ducklings have gathered! Whether you’re a newcomer just joining Duckov, a seasoned duck with a warehouse full of treasures, a creative duck who loves to share Duckov with others, or a MOD duck making Duckov shine with your imagination and codes. Thank you to every Duckling!&nbsp;Because of you, Duckov stays full of life! The journey of Duckov is far from over. We’ll keep bringing you new content and an even better experience. Quack quack!”</em></p>

<p>In the absence of a major Animal Crossing announcement, this week felt a little quieter than last, but there was still plenty to get excited about. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC scored a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-legends-z-as-mega-dimension-dlc-scores-december-release-date">December release date</a>, and we got a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-mystery-gift-code-event-has-been-announced">Mystery Gift event</a> in the process.

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867,193521 @ 1762602519 -->
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m very excited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> at the moment, so I’ve gone back to the old favourites: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, and yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>. Considering the appearance of Alyssa Ashcroft in the upcoming title, I’d love for Capcom to provide a legitimate way to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/resident_evil_outbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a> on modern consoles, but alas, I don’t think it’s happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>We’ve also got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami 2</a> on the horizon, so I’ve gone back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director’s Cut</a> for a little bit. Truth be told, alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, this might actually be my favourite launch game for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm in the fun little position of being <em>between games</em> after wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> earlier this week, and not wanting to splash out on anything else 'AAA' until Metroid comes a-calling. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> is still eating up my every free moment (obviously), but maybe now it my chance to sneak in something smaller before the year's up. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> has been looking at me from my wishlist for a while now, so perhaps it's finally time to dive in.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I just remembered that I've had <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> on pause while I put Pokémon in the rear-view mirror. <em>That's</em> the weekend's plan sorted, then.</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm hoping to polish off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blippoplus">Blippo+</a> this weekend. I've found myself playing/watching a little bit every morning over breakfast, as if I were channel-hopping before school as a kid. It's a cracking little piece of software - look out for a review sometime soon-ish.</p>
<p>Beyond that (and keeping with the early '90s theme), I found myself redownloading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> just to get a look at the Simpsons stuff. After dying twice in a row extremely early doors, I enabled gyro and made it to #2 on the third jump from the bus. First loser! It's a weird thing, Fortnite these days, but I did enjoy most of those 20 minutes. Maybe I'll dip back into that.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> proves that every failure is an opportunity to learn and grow, just like in real life. While there has been zero progress since last weekend (except, of course, making Melinöe stronger with each demise), I hope to turn the tables this weekend. Lots of high adrenaline arcade action as well, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/arcade-archives-2-tokyo-wars">Arcade Archives 2: Tokyo Wars</a>' bare-bones single player experience quickly turns into a frenetic split-screen multiplayer extravaganza (I miss Wii U’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/tank_tank_tank">Tank! Tank! Tank!</a> …) and both Toaplan’s Arcade Collection volumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 50 of 50 games played! The final five titles are all absolute stunners! 'Combatants' (clever pun!) is all bout real-time tactics with fighting ants, 'Quibble Race' finally made me understand Japanese obsession with horse racing simulations, 'Seaside Drive' is purest shmup bliss, 'Campanella 3' is the final game in the series and goes full <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/vcarcade/space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and to wrap up this package the multi-genre, 'Cyber Owls', which I hope to complete this weekend. What an incredible package, part of me wants 'Super UFO 50' to happen, with SNES-style graphics and music… one can dream!</p>
<p>My game of the week is Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. Being a huge fan of this spin-off series and the added hardware strength of the Switch 2, I see nothing but a very good time ahead. Are you a person who finds the whole Musou gameplay strangely soothing and great stress relief? Just me?</p>

<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>I’ve got to admit, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has hooked me far more than I expected it would. The criticism about the sameness of the environments and the rather wooden NPCs is completely fair, but I still find it hard to put down. I particularly enjoy hunting for Alpha Pokémon and having an oversized critter following me around. The battle system feels fresh and fluid — and occasionally challenging, which makes for a nice change. I was genuinely taken aback by how good the Mega Dimensions DLC looks. It really seems to cater to high-level play, though I’m not exactly thrilled about the price point.</p>
<p>I’m also completely addicted to BALL x PIT. It gets me into that flow state I love, scratches the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> itch, and does something new and mechanically interesting that you don’t often see in other Survivors-likes. It’s such a fresh and satisfying gameplay loop.</p>
<p>I’ve also been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi’s Mansion</a> via Nintendo Switch Online. I missed it back in the day, but I can definitely see what people mean about the spooky atmosphere of this first entry compared with the next two in the series. The original just nails that haunted house vibe a bit better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/luigis_mansion_3">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a>, which is objectively a better game in almost every respect.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kill-team-dead-silence-review-hunter-vs-hunter.1347664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The current season of <em>Kill Team</em> continues with a new expansion featuring 2 new kill teams, both masters of covert operations, and a new campaign style to fight in.&nbsp;In this article, we'll take a look at how the new kill teams play and the new campaign style.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a>,&nbsp;or the set that kicked off this season, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Tomb World</a>.</p>






<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Dead Silence is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;and requires a copy of the <em>Kill Team</em> core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. The campaign is set in a Tomb World, so having a copy of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Tomb World</a> box will also give you the scenery to keep it thematic.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Dead Silence Dossier</li>
	<li>6x Adeptus Astartes Wolf&nbsp;Scout&nbsp;kill team miniatures (5x Space Marines and 1x Fenrisian Wolf)</li>
	<li>8x Tau Stealth Battlesuits kill team&nbsp;miniatures (5x Stealth Battlesuits, 2x Drones and 1x Beacon)</li>
	<li>Datacards and tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Campaign map and log pads</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-2.jpg?itok=0PtUsjJ0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-2.jpg?itok=hSNQ5VvK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The new map-based campaign, the Ctesiphus Campaign, sees players exploring a map, rolling randomly to determine the type of surface or tomb location, and then fighting a battle using the location rules that a kill team is on. Players can build camps, destroy other players' camps, and use supply points to move around the map. There are also rules for playing it using the solo/cooperative rules for <em>Kill Team</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-3.jpg?itok=navLyjUd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-3.jpg?itok=DddG9Uzx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Awoooo!</h2>

<p>The Space Wolves get their first dedicated kill team with the Wolf Scouts. This kill team, rather than being made up of novice Space Marine scouts like those from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-salvation-review-striking-scorpion-hidden-space-marine" rel="nofollow">Salvation</a>&nbsp;expansion, the Space Wolf Wolf Scouts are made up of veteran Space Marines, who prefer to operate independently, away from their brothers. They do serve the same purpose as the scouts in other chapters, taking on shadowy, clandestine operations, they're just a lot more deadly.</p>

<p>The Wolf Scout kill team is made up of 5 Wolf Scouts and a Ferisian Wolf, and has 6 operator choices, plus the standard Hunter, so you'll have to make a choice between them when selecting your kill team. You'll also have to make a choice when building them between the Pack Leader and Frosteye (but you can use the parts on another body if you wish), but if you want to build all 6 specialist operatives, plus a standard Hunter, you will need to pick up another set when they go on sale seperately, or get hold of another 2 Space Marine/Space Wolf bodies and use the extra components from this set.</p>

<p>When the Wolf Scouts go to battle, they bring the storm with them, which is represented by a token, and any operative within 6 inches of it activates any bonuses on their profile card. The Wolf Scout Gunner for example, ignores the hot rule on their supercharged plasma gun, and it gains the punishing rule, allowing you to turn a fail into a hit if you roll a critical.</p>

<p>My auto-take choices for the Wolf Scouts are the Fangbearer, who allows your entire kill team to ignore any stat modifiers from being wounded, even if they're incapacitated during the game, and the Frosteye, who can go on guard within your storm and remain concealed. I love the thematic rules for this storm-powered sniper, shooting from within a blizzard.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-4.jpg?itok=4yRzv37n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-dead-silence-4.jpg?itok=49c4FHpD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Only Ghosts</h2>

<p>The Tau Empire is a group of technologically advanced alien species that look to collect others to their cause through peaceful means, but are happy to use violence if required. Their previous dedicated kill team was made up of Pathfinders, long-range reconnaissance operators. But now they get their first elite kill team, featuring Stealth Battlesuits, which make use of light-bending technology to remain invisible.</p>

<p>The Stealth Battlesuits kill team is made up of a Shas'vre, the leader, a marker drone and a gun drone, and a selection of 4 specialist operatives, or the standard Infiltrator operative. In the Dead Silence expansion, you get 5 miniatures, so you'll have to choose if you want to build all the specialists or drop some for standard Infiltrators. All operatives also have a choice of burst cannon, with high attacks that can reroll any results of 1, or up to 2 fusion cannons, which are shorter range but higher damage. So you will also have to make armament decisions before building your miniatures, or pick up more Stealth Suits to build the different options.</p>

<p>My favorite Stealth Battlesuit operatives are the Lodestar, who has a chance to gain bonus CP each turn, depending on how far the homing beacon is from your drop zone. My other favorite operative is the Designator, who can mark enemy operatives if they've a valid target, which gives any of your operatives targeting that enemy the option to turn a normal hit into a critical if you don't roll any crits at all. This doubles up with the gun drone to mark targets, which is especially helpful for making sure you get that Devastating 4 for auto wounds from the Fusion Blasters.</p>

<p>All the Stealth Battlesuits have stealth fields, which means when they have the conceal order, they're not visible to enemies more than 3 inches away from them, keeping them safe until they close the distance with the enemy, and are ready to attack.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Dead Silence contains 2 great new kill teams. Both have some great thematic play styles, with the invisible Battlesuits and the Wolf Scouts storm rules. Both factions are also masters at what they do, with the Wolf Scouts excelling in close combat and the Stealth Battlesuits being masters of range. They offer some great games against each other, and while the map-based campaign is a welcome addition to <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;campaigns, it would have been nice to have some thematic missions to play these teams off against each other and some more scenery to build up on the Tomb World set.</p>

			<p>Yet another MMO bites the dust as the Warhammer project in the works at Jackalyptic Games has been canceled following the studio's shutdown. The news comes directly from founder Jack Emmert, an MMO veteran who was behind City of Heroes, Champions Online, and Star Trek Online. </p>



<p>Later, he managed DC Universe Online while at Daybreak. When the DC Universe Online team <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-on-dimensional-inks-total-independence-and-whats-next-for-the-dcuo-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was spun off as Dimensional Ink Games in early 2020</a>, Emmert began working on an unannounced project that ultimately became a Marvel-based MMORPG. When that project <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-mmorpg-canceled-as-investment-is-refocused-on-smaller-projects-based-on-current-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got canceled</a> by Daybreak's parent company, Enad Global 7, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-games-launches-u-s-studio-jackalope-games-to-develop-pc-and-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established Jackalope Games</a> (later rebranded as Jackalyptic) with funding help from NetEase. In May 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-for-pc-console-in-development-at-jackalyptic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the Austin-based development team was working on an MMO based on a Warhammer IP.</p>



<p>A few days later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I spoke with Emmert</a>, who broadly mentioned that it would be an accessible game focused on properly representing the IP. The game designer is a lifelong fan of Warhammer, so that was one of his first mandates. Unfortunately, with NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down studios left and right</a>, Jackalyptic is only the latest team to be impacted. </p>



<p>Yesterday, Emmert announced the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7392684257858494464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the company's LinkedIn page</a>:</p>



<p><em>I’m here to share a note that after nearly three and a half years working with NetEase Games as a first party studio, our partnership will be coming to an end. We appreciate all the support NetEase Games has provided with their resources and engagement throughout this development process.</em></p>



<p><em>As we navigate this transition, our talented team members will be exploring new opportunities. If you’re looking for passionate, creative professionals who bring excellence and collaboration to everything they do, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We want to thank our community and all the individuals who have contributed to the project, and have made it something special.</em></p>



<p>It's yet another sad day for MMO fans after the closure of Amazon's <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-development The Lord of the Rings project</a>, not to mention Fantastic Pixel Castle's Ghost MMO also vanishing into the air.</p>



<p>As for Warhammer, while the IP is very lively in the gaming space, 2008's Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning remains the only MMO made based on the fantasy franchise, and it was shut down in 2013 (though fans have been operating a private server called Return to Reckoning). The sci-fi universe Warhammer 40,000 received an MMO-like third-person shooter game titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-eternal-crusade-dated-for-pc-while-console-development-gets-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternal Cr</a>usade in 2016, but developer Behavior Interactive eventually closed the servers in September 2021 due to a lack of players.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-881-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-november-8.1347649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the weekend, but don’t feel like you can relax until you’ve completed today’s NYT Connections puzzle! I’ve got the solutions and NYT Connections hints you need to dominate today’s puzzle, which happens to be pretty tricky. Before you roll into your weekend, scroll down and get the answers I know you’re looking for.</p>



<p>NYT Connections hints await!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-8">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 8)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #881:</p>



<ul>
<li>SIGN</li>



<li>SPY</li>



<li>STOP</li>



<li>ROBOT</li>



<li>SEAL</li>



<li>BODY</li>



<li>DELIVER</li>



<li>PRESENT</li>



<li>BEAM</li>



<li>PLUG</li>



<li>PROGRAMMING</li>



<li>CHING</li>



<li>GIVE</li>



<li>SPOKEN</li>



<li>CLOSE</li>



<li>PRONOUNCE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These all suggest <strong>obstructing or closing</strong> something</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word implies <strong>offering or stating something publicly</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all <strong>forms or systems of communication</strong></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these can follow <strong>“I” </strong>to form a phrase</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 8.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-8-881">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 8 (#881)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CLOSE, PLUG, SEAL, STOP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DELIVER, GIVE, PRESENT, PRONOUNCE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BODY, PROGRAMMING, SIGN, SPOKEN</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BEAM, CHING, ROBOT, SPY</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Expect this patch to go live within the next two weeks with more details of the next patch being shared closer to its release. So stay tuned and once again, thanks for your support, feedback, and patience! Now let’s get back on the lawn and listen to those sweet tunes!"</p>

<p>Though the listing has seemingly been removed, it’s been revealed—h/t <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/silent-hill-2-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a> for finding it first—that Silent Hill 2 will launch on Xbox on Friday, November 21, 2025. </p>



<p>For those who’ve been following, an Xbox launch has <a href="http://long been rumor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long been rumored</a> and expected. Talk even picked up more steam when the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/">officially rated for Xbox</a> by the ESRB on October 31, meaning that a launch wasn’t going to be far off. </p>



<p>Looking at the store listing, it says the game is optimized for both the Xbox Series X and Series S. It will also release for the console and PC via the Microsoft Store. However, there’s no official mention of it being a play anywhere title.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 first launched on PlayStation 5 (PS5) and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024. The deal for the game to be console exclusive on the PS5 was for a year, which expired early last month. As of writing, the game has a “generally favorable” rating of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">86 on Metacritic</a> from 105 reviews while the user score is even higher at 9.1 from 3,998 user ratings.</p>



<p>In addition to Xbox, there have also been rumors that it will be released on the Nintendo Switch 2. Whether it happens on the same date as Xbox remains to be seen, but it’s clear that those without a PC or PS5 will be getting to play the remake from Bloober Team in the very near future.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting, though, that neither Konami nor Bloober Team have officially announced anything yet.</p>



<p>Now that we seemingly have a release date, will you pick up Silent Hill 2 on Xbox? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modiphius has announced a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion for N7 Day. The tabletop publisher will be bringing new material for both <em>Mass Effect</em> fans and board game enthusiasts:<em>&nbsp;</em>more enemy miniatures and an official expansion&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>&nbsp;Expansion Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Modiphius made several announcements regarding a <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em> expansion. The first announcement was for a new wave of miniatures. These sets will provide unpainted resin miniatures of different Mass Effect enemies to use in your game if the base experience's cardboard tokens aren't cutting it for you.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-expansion-atlas-mech-miniature.jpg?itok=dLmQhkD_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mass-effect-board-game-expansion-atlas-mech-miniature.jpg?itok=Hwig3Axn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The line of miniatures coming in Q2 of 2026 is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Priority Threats Delta</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Gamma</li>
	<li>Priority Threats Epsilon</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Alpha</li>
	<li>Battlefield Scenery Beta</li>
	<li>ATLAS Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>YMIR Mech and Marker</li>
	<li>Brute and Marker</li>
</ul><p>The second, more notable announcement is confirmation that the studio is working on an official expansion. This will introduce six new squadmates, new loyalty missions, and new locations. At the time of writing, the exact details on the expansion's contents, release date, or price, is unknown.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> series was created by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts in 2008. It followed Commander Shepard, a custom player character, as they explored a vast sci-fi universe with unique aliens, factions, and history. The unique selling point was that you could import your save data from each game, with your choices and partnerships having widespread consequences as the series progressed.</p>

<p>The <em>Mass Effect Board Game</em>, aka <em>Mass Effect: Project Hagalaz</em>, released last year. It is a cooperative game set during the events of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and follows Commander Shepard and their crew on a mission involving Cerberus and The Reapers. The game was designed by Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>) and Calvin Wang Tze Loon.</p>

<p>The game garnered a bit of controversy at launch. Namely, a culture war spat regarding squadmates' personal pronouns being featured in the game. This led to a series of review bombing on Board Game Geek, Lang being harassed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mass-effect-board-game-designer-harrassed-over-culture-war-review-bombing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">off social media</a>, and pronouns being removed in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/czech-release-of-mass-effect-board-game-will-remove-squadmate-pronouns" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Czech version</a> of the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO</a> launches for the Switch and Switch 2 next week, and in case you missed it, players who purchase the Switch release will be able to update their game to play an "enhanced version" on the Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco explains on its website (and in the video above) how you'll be able to do this by simply connecting your Switch 2 system to the internet and then downloading the update. After this, the characters and backgrounds in the game will appear with "improved clarity and richer detail".</p>
<p>When applying this update, certain save data - including battle replay data, edit data and online records cannot be carried over. As for battles, you'll be able to play with users on Switch 2 and other Switch players who have this same update applied.</p>
<p>Below is a look at the Switch version before the update, after the update, and how the game looks on Switch 2:</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Square Enix disclosed its ambition to drastically cut its Quality Assurance employees and use generative AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">handle 70% of its game QA and debugging</a>. The company went on to note that it wants to "establish a competitive advantage in game development."

"They are a massively advantageous vibe check."</p><p>Douse also noted that QA jobs have often been gateway positions for people looking to get into the video game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Halo Infinite is ending after four years of updates, confirms Halo Studios. However, it seems the company is putting the teams on multiple new Halo projects, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>



<p>The Halo franchise has been at the forefront of the FPS genre since its debut in 2001 on Xbox. With several entries, the series has become synonymous with gamers alike for its epic space setting and thrilling gunplay. With the 30th anniversary coming up, Halo Studios is going all in, starting with the recently-revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of 2001’s Combat Evolved. Unfortunately, the most recent title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-halo-qa-tester-blames-microsofts-policies-for-halo-infinite-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a>, is ending production, but it will lead to new projects in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-studios-stopping-updates-for-halo-infinite-to-support-other-games">Halo Studios Stopping Updates for Halo Infinite to Support Other Games</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post from Halo Studios</a>, the team announced that <strong>Halo Infinite’s newest update</strong>, Operation: Infinite, <strong>will be its last major one</strong>. The update, set to go live on November 18th, 2025, will include new armor, maps, challenges, and 2x XP. Unfortunately, it’s the final one for the game, as, in the blog, the team states,</p>



<p>“<strong>With multiple Halo titles in development, we’ll need our whole team’s combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us</strong>,” the blog reads. “<strong>While we remain committed to supporting&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>&nbsp;on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned</strong>.”</p>



<p>Fortunately, it seems the Halo Infinite team is shifting to help on other Halo games currently in the works. We only know of one, Halo: Campaign Evolved, so <strong>this does confirm more is in development at Halo Studios</strong>. There are rumors that a live-service Halo game is planning to release in 2026, so perhaps it’s one of the titles it’s working on. Of course, one can also assume the next mainline entry is in production, though no confirmation has been made for either project.</p>



<p>What do you think of Halo Infinite ending support? Are you excited to see what Halo Studios has in store? What game do you hope is next? Mainline? Multiplayer?

Eyes on the Prize, however, is one such quest that expects you to bring along a little something to help you get the job done. Let's jump in and see what's what.</p><p><strong>You'll need 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> and complete Eyes on the Prize. Wires are a common resource found in Electrical-based POIs, and within a few hours of gameplay, you should've already amassed quite a collection--unless you've been selling them. Whether you're tossing them into your inventory before you head out or finding them while in the raid, just make sure you have 3 of them before you head to the secluded roof terrace for Eyes on the Prize. And make sure you toss them in a safe pocket if possible, as you never know when things could go wrong, and you don't want to lose them.</p><p>When you're ready to repair a solar panel, here's how to complete Eyes on the Prize.</p><h2>Where to find the secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station</h2><p>The first objective in Eyes on the Prize is to find a secluded roof terrace west of the Southern Station extraction point. The quest mentions to keep an eye out for a blue tarp, but it can still be hard to spot if you're not at the right angle. With that in mind, refer to the photo below for the exact location on the map.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598921,1300-4598922" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598921-19a6053211f29-screenshoturl.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598922-19a6051753f6-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You'll need to be on the roof to reach the secluded roof terrace (as per the name). You'll eventually spot a blue tarp with some chairs, boxes, and an electric box. That's your destination.</p><h2>How to rewire the solar panel</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, <strong>you'll need to have brought or scavenged 3 Wires to repair the solar panel</strong> at the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace. If you didn't bring any in with you, you'll either have to recycle an electrical item like a Battery or visit an Electrical-based POI on the map to round a few up.</p><p>As long as you have the 3 Wires in your inventory, you can approach the electrical box on the secluded roof terrace and interact with it to finish your repairs like a proper electrician. With that out of the way, the Eyes on the Prize quest will conclude.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598920"></a><figcaption>Repair the solar panel using 3 Wires.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598920-19a60518a884-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Since you don't need to extract to complete the quest, you're now free to finish looting or shooting until you're ready to leave. The nearby Southern Station should prove to be a solid spot to extract when you're finished up, though. Just keep in mind that it tends to be an active region of the map, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>If you need to tackle more quests, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

This quick and straightforward quest sends you to Blue Gate to snag one of these honey-filled bee homes from the Olive Grove POI, and we'll tell you exactly where to get your hands on it.</p><p>You'll need to extract with the beehive in your inventory to get credit for the quest's completion, so you'd do well to bring an augment that possesses a safe pocket so that you can toss this quest item in there for safekeeping--you know, just in case some other raider decides to get fiesty with you. Don't worry--the bees won't sting, though.</p><p>When you're ready to get your hands sticky with honey, here's how to find a beehive for the Bees! quest.</p><h2>Where to find a beehive for the Bees! quest</h2><p>To collect a beehive, you'll need to visit the Olive Grove POI on the Blue Gate map. This area is located in the southern region of the map and happens to be a very active spot for raiders since Olives are a hot commodity. With this in mind, make sure you wave and ask to be friends if you don't want to catch any fire from folks while you're snagging the beehive here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932" data-ratio="0.56135770234987" data-width="1149" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598932"></a><figcaption>Find the beehive here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598932-share_20251107_1127582.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive to the location on the map above, you'll find a little shack. If you listen closely, you can probably hear the bees swarming nearby. Look under the roof on the side of the shack to spot the beehive and plenty of little bees flying around. Interact with it to add it to your inventory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4598933"></a><figcaption>Interact with the beehive to pick it up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598933-share_20251107_1127550.jpeg"></figure><p>With the beehive acquired, you'll need to extract and take back to Speranza to finish the Bees! quest. The Forest Airshaft is to your northwest, while the Overlook Airshaft can be visited by heading northeast. Head to whichever one is open based on how much time is left in the map, as they're both likely to be equally dangerous. Keep a lookout for rogue raiders and any patrolling ARC, hit the button, drop inside, and interact with the computer to get back to Speranza and finish things up.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, we've compiled a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full quest list</a> for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Anyone who makes videos or podcasts for a living knows that the impact of audio comes above just about everything else. Seriously, if your sound quality is good enough, then everything else is often secondary, and that’s why having really good microphones is so important. If you’re looking for an amazing option, then you’ll want to get a good lavalier microphone, because they’re a lot more subtle in appearance while providing excellent sound quality.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has a deal on which means that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">DJI Mic Mini is currently on sale with 38% off, which means it’s down to $74 for a limited time:</a>&nbsp;It’s normally $119, so that’s a decent discount for sure. Not only that, but <strong>this comes with two transmitters and one receiver</strong>, so you can even use this for duo productions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mic Check</h2>
<p>The microphones here are incredibly light, weighing in at only ten grams, which means that you’ll not only be able to connect them to just about any bit of clothing, but also not be weighed down by them. That means you’ll look better on camera, but it also means you can fine-tune the placement to get the perfect sound quality, no matter what environment you’re recording in.</p>



<p>They also feature amazing noise cancelling, with you being able to switch modes as needed. Basic will get rid of standard noises you’d expect, but strong can handle all sorts of sounds. It means that you’ll be getting crystal clear audio at all times, and that’s really important. The microphones have an amazing range of 400m as well, so you can set this up indoors then go outside to record as needed.</p>
<p>The battery life is also very impressive. You can keep these on for up to 10 hours in total, which means that you can record for an entire work day without any problems. That’s plenty of time for a huge number of takes, interviews, or different video or audio ideas as you need. These are small, mighty, and long-lasting microphones that are sure to make you sound better, no matter what you’re using them for.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant discount, but it’s also one that we’re not expecting to last for very long. So, if you do want to enjoy this amazing price tag, we recommend doing so soon. The $74 could run out at any time, and that means time is of the essence if you want to save big and sound good.</p>

                <p>Everyone needs a pick-me-up sometimes--maybe even more so if they're living underground after devastating losses to an army of machines. In the Espresso quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you'll need to go topside and seek out an espresso maker from a cafe in Buried City. If you're wondering where exactly to go for this caffeine fix, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need to extract from Buried City and return to Speranza with the espresso machine in your inventory to complete the mission, so it's smart to bring along an augment with a safe pocket to store the quest item in. A good gun and shield for protection can't hurt, either.</p><p>When you're ready to get the espresso machine, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the espresso machine in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The espresso machine is located in a cafe in Plaza Rosa in the southern portion of the Buried City map. This area is often swarming with ARC, so it can be a challenge to get in and out unnoticed, especially if you're also dealing with other raiders questing or looting in the vicinity. Don't be afraid to take things slow when approaching to stay unnoticed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598913" data-ratio="0.57222222222222" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598913"></a><figcaption>Cafe location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598913-19a6051607696-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>The cafe is a red building with a "cafe" sign just above the door.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598918-19a60513aee38-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598918" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598918-19a60513aee38-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598918"></a><figcaption>The cafe is a red building with a cafe sign above the door.

You're in luck, though, because the Souther Station extraction point is literally right in front of the cafe.

                <p>Lance loves to send you out looking for stuff in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, and the A New Type of Plant quest is no different. In this outing, you'll be tasked with finding a possibly toxic plant growing in the Old Battleground area of the Dam Battlegrounds map, then bringing it back to Lance at Speranza. </p><p>You'll be required to extract from the map with the quest to finish A New Type of Plant, so it's a good idea to come equipped with a loadout that you feel comfortable with--especially one with a safe pocket. Equip a decent gun (it's best to prioritize one for human opponents in this case) and make sure you've stocked up on some ammo and healing items before you head in--just in case you need to fend off any attackers while trying to extract.</p><p>When you're ready to get raiding, here's how to complete A New Type of Plant.</p><h2>Where to find the Baron Husk</h2><p>The first objective you have in A New Type of Plant is to located the Baron Husk. This giant fallen ARC can be found in the Old Battleground section on the far western side of the Dam Battlegrounds map. This husk isn't particularly hard to spot, as it's a giant metal monstrosity that has clearly seen better days.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864" data-ratio="0.56460044809559" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598864"></a><figcaption>Old Battleground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598864-19a601d5e6289-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>This area isn't known for being particularly heavy on foot traffic, but it's still a good idea to keep an eye out for other raiders. A simple "don't shoot!" might stand between you and grabbing your quest item, after all.</p><h2>Where to find the toxic plant</h2><p>The toxic plant has plenty of spawns around the Baron Husk area. It looks somewhat similar to the Great Mullein plant you've already had to gather for Lance's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-doctors-orders-quest-guide/1100-6536044/" data-ref-id="1100-6536044">Doctor's Orders quest</a>, except this one has orange blooms that are rather visually striking. If you're struggling to find the plants, check for directly next to the husk until you round one up. Make sure you loot it!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598863"></a><figcaption>Make sure to add the plant to your inventory and take it back to Speranza.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598863-19a601ce58022-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you've picked up the toxic plant, you'll need to extract. If you brought an augment with a safe pocket, make sure you toss the quest item in there to keep it safe in case you run into trouble. Either way, head east to the Central Swamp Lift. This area is often crawling with ARC and frequently camped by other raiders, so don't be afraid to take things nice and slow--and keep your wits about you. You'll be back in Speranza in no time where you can turn in your quest to Lance.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Celeste's quest Digging Up Dirt is no different--though figuring out how to get to the dead drop she's asked you to retrieve can be a little tricky. In this guide, we'll fill you in on how to reach the dead drop inside the Santa Maria Houses so you can finish up the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><p>For this quest, you won't need to extract to receive credit. As such, you can always enter the map using a free loadout to reduce the pain of death should some ARC or other raider put a quick end to you. The last thing you'd want is to lose a bunch of your best gear because you were just trying to get a quest done, after all.</p><p>Here's where to find the dead drop for the Digging Up Dirt quest.</p><h2>Where to find the dead drop for Digging Up Dirt</h2><p>The dead drop Celeste wants you to find is located at the Santa Maria Houses POI in the southern portion of Buried City. Luckily, it's a pretty safe area in most matches, so you aren't likely to get into too much trouble so long as you don't start any yourself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598831" data-ratio="0.56564748201439" data-width="2224" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598831"></a><figcaption>Santa Maria Houses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4598831-19a6005a10399-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>The dead drop is in the interior of the building here, but getting inside won't appear possible if you're trying to approach it from the ground floor. Instead, make your way to the roof and enter the open window up there. You'll drop into the attic where you can take a zipline down into the next level of the building.</p><p>Navigate the fairly linear building until you reach a large, open room filled with sand on the ground floor. Here, directly in the center of the room, will be the dead drop. Hop down and interact with it to complete the quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598833" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598833"></a><figcaption>Dead drop location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4598833-19a6005781921-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the quest for Celeste complete, you'll want to worry about extracting next. Both the Southern Station and Eastern Station are within reasonable proximity to you, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with and get the hell out of dodge before the timer runs down too much and spawns a boatload of ARC for you to fend off--or, you know, before another pesky raider comes along and causes any problems.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="468">Now that we’re in the last two months of the year, the doors are wide open for all the holiday shopping you need to take care of. If you’re still on the hunt for some gifts for a friend, family member, or loved one, you might want to consider this Fitbit Inspire 3 health and fitness tracker. It’s not even Black Friday yet, but the GPS-enabled wristwatch is already on sale with Black Friday-level prices. It normally sells for $99, but for a limited time you can pick it up on sale for 30% off: Some <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5395/">quick napkin math will tell you that’s a $30 savings, bringing the price you pay to just $69</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>


<p data-start="0" data-end="468">The Fitbit Inspire 3 is you’re own personal trainer right on your wrist, there to help you whether you’re out for a run or grinding through a session in the gym. With over 20 exercise modes to choose from, it automatically kicks into workout tracking when it senses you’re getting active. You can even connect it to your phone’s GPS to track your distance and pace when you’re outside. Want to keep tabs on your stats while lifting, kayaking, or biking? Maybe post to Strava so you can get all your precious kudos? Do it with the Fitbit Inspire 3.</p>
<p data-start="470" data-end="894">The Inspire 3 monitors your heart rate around the clock and can measure the intensity of your workouts, letting you know when you’re in the fat burn, cardio, or peak zones. This way you can fine-tune your workouts accordingly. Plus, it can help you stay on top of your health by checking for signs of irregular rhythm that could point to atrial fibrillation (AFib). It even tracks things like blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more.</p>


<h2 data-start="896" data-end="1274">Sleep Better, Wake Better</h2>
<p data-start="896" data-end="1274">The Fitbit Inspire 3 can gently wake you up with a vibration during your lightest sleep stage, so you start your day feeling refreshed instead of groggy. It also gives you a sleep score and breaks down your light, deep, and REM stages, along with your sleeping heart rate, to help you understand your sleep patterns and improve your habits over time.</p>
<p data-start="1276" data-end="1465">Need a little nudge to move more? The Inspire 3 has your back there too. If you’ve been sitting for too long, it’ll send a friendly buzz reminding you to stretch your legs and get moving.</p>
<p data-start="1467" data-end="1699">This wristwatch isn’t just to help you tackle physical wellness, but mental wellness too. You can see your daily stress management score, based on factors like heart rate and daily activity, and take guided breathing sessions to help you reset and relax.</p>

              <p>We’re quickly approaching the holiday season which means gift shopping season is already here. We’ve got Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up in just a few short weeks. You can either hold out until then to find some good tech deals for all your gift shopping needs, or if you look in the right places, you can find some great tech deals right now. Amazon happens to have the Beats Studio Buds earbuds on sale for almost half off right now. For a limited time, you can grab <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4822/">these noise-cancelling earbuds for a 47% discount, bringing the price down from $149 to just $79</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Cancel the Sounds of the World Around You</h2>
<p>The Beats Studio Buds support two distinct listening modes. With Active Noise Cancelling, you’re able to turn off the distracting background noises from your environment. This is wonderful for when trying to get some work done in a chatty office or coffee shop, or when flying and you want to drown out the sounds from the plane turbine so you can focus on catching up with&nbsp;<em>50MPH — </em>an oral history podcast cataloguing the development, production and legacy of director Jan de Bont’s Oscar-winning 1994 summer blockbuster&nbsp;<em>Speed</em>.</p>



<p>When you you do need to hear your surrounding again, like for instance you’re heading out of the office and walking down a busy sidewalk in a car-centric city, then maybe switch over to transparency mode. This will allow you sounds from your environment to filter through, keeping you alert to what’s around you. Safety first.</p>
<p>Battery life is pretty solid here. With the charging case, you can listen a full 24 hours. When using just the buds, you can expect a total listening time of roughly eight hours.</p>



<p>The earbuds are sweat and water resistant, making these Beats Studio Buds ideal for working out. Whether you’re running the roads or hitting the gym, you can keep up with your favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks while working up a sweat.</p>
<p>One small caveat is this set of earbuds doesn’t come with a charging adapter, just the USB-C charging cable. Lots of manufacturers have ceased including the brick with their stuff as a cost-cutting measure. Thankfully everything is USB-C these days so odds are, you already have a few on hand.</p>
<p>These stylish earbuds come in three different colors to choose from. Pick between the classic black, or decide to go with red or white. All three options are going for just $80 for a limited time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-the-kotaku-review.1347466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As I’ve continued to sink hour after hour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>, I keep thinking about Paintball, a sport I’ve never spent any meaningful time with but have always been attracted to, especially as a fan of video games in which you shoot other people.</p>

 <p>Specifically, I think about <a href="https://youtu.be/RJEjSddm4B8">the origins of this kind of sport</a> in which human beings willingly participate in a simulation of violent survival. In Paintball’s case, the game was sparked by an argument between a country boy, Charles Gaines, and a city boy, Hayes Noel. It became a way to settle a score between two friends: Who is better equipped to survive in the wild? It turns out the country boy fared better, as he summed up with an anecdote that almost perfectly describes a kind of interaction I’ve had a few dozen times in <i>Arc Raiders</i>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Within about 20 minutes, I came around a big maple tree and Hayes was sitting on a rock. And I walked right up behind him and put the barrel of the gun right on his neck and said “alright, I don’t wanna shoot you. Who wins?”</p></blockquote> <p>This experience inspired the duo to gather a whole bunch of other friends to play out more survival scenarios, equipped with nonlethal, though still painful, weaponry with which to defend themselves. According to Gaines, Paintball was an exciting game of “stealth, wood skills, and strategy […] the idea of running through the woods, competing and symbolically surviving, those go way back into our genetic development.”</p>

 <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>, I’m convinced, taps into similar things, lighting up a primal part of the brain that is both thrilled and terrified about entering a dangerous area to earn rewards, establish victory, and get out alive. Of course, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ arsenal is way more diverse and, of course, mercifully free of any physical pain from getting shot.</p>

 <p>Losing though? Damn, that sting is something you still have to learn to deal with. If you’re up for the mental challenge of tolerating devastating losses baked into a thrilling set of third-person shooter encounters, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has distilled that distinctive combination into a single package like few other games out there.</p>

 <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000642206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642206">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is a PvPvE extraction shooter set in the late 2100s following two world-ending events: A complete ecological collapse that destroyed human civilization as we know it, and the arrival of deadly, autonomous machines that have made it all but impossible to recover from the collapse.</p>

 <p>No one knows where these machines—Arc as they’re referred to—came from. They were beaten back once before but have now returned with more sophisticated, deadlier designs. Humanity’s only option for survival is to live below the surface while brave pioneers, Raiders, venture Topside to collect resources and manage what few elements of human infrastructure remain.</p>

 <p>Players take on the role of Raiders as they accomplish quests related to the survival of the underground community known as Speranza, while also grabbing items with which to craft various weapons, gadgets, and restorative items.</p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Get ready to lose...all your shit!"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Embark Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person extraction shooter.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Unpredictable gameplay, engaging progression systems, fantastic stealth and shooting scenarios.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Crafting menus are cumbersome to navigate.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>October 30, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>60 hours, mostly running solo.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>This perpetual task of gathering and crafting represents one half of the game: inventory management. Flipping through menus, breaking found items down, combining them to build an assortment of resources. These are the vegetables you have to eat before the main course of shooting and survival.</p> <p>The other part of the game, the meat and potatoes, is all the shooting and survival you have to engage in to acquire that stuff and, crucially, to hang on to what you’ve laid claim to.</p> <p>In each match, you’ll have roughly 15 to 30 minutes on one of the game’s four different maps, set in different regions of post-apocalyptic Italy. Your goal is to grab what you can and leave before the timer runs out, or before someone guns you down–be it a machine patrolling the surface, or another player looking to take your stuff.</p>

  <p>If you make it back home alive, you keep everything you found. Die, and it’s all left behind, now potentially loot for someone else.</p> <p>Other players don’t have to be your enemies, strictly speaking, but whether or not you engage in PvP isn’t entirely up to you. When two un-partied players catch sight of each other in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner’s dilemma</a> unfolds: Is this person a threat? Can they be trusted? Will you ever feel safe taking your eyes off of them? How should you split the loot you collectively find?</p>

 <p>After a healthy amount of time spent in-game, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has thoroughly won me over with its slow-paced, tactical third-person shooting and its satisfying perpetual game of collecting Things™. But it’s that social game that sparks between two random players that has become the most engaging aspect for me. I rarely hop on a mic to chat, but thankfully <i>Arc Raiders</i> has an emote system that includes a decent range of options, enough for me to get a first impression of someone and decide if I feel safe traveling with them for the remainder of the game.</p> <p>All of these unpredictable elements—what loot is available at any given time, what Arc are present and in what locations, whether other players are friendly or dangerous—combine to create a machine that generates interesting situations and memorable encounters.</p> <p>Escape sequences, tense sniper battles, close-quarters showdowns with SMGs and shotguns, stealthy infiltrations of loot-filled locales, quests to hunt and take down a tough-as-nails and well-armed Arc; these and other scenarios just spontaneously happen in a game of <i>Arc Raiders</i>. It’s all unscripted and entirely reliant on the mixture of whatever and whoever is on the map and what their agendas are, be it questing, looting, or intentionally hunting down other players.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642207"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642207">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Gone is the safety of a single-player campaign with checkpoints and forgiving Game Over screens. Gone are the prescribed rules of engagement of traditional PvP, in which you’re forced to engage in a firefight with specific win/lose conditions. Here, it’s all live and in the moment. You, by yourself or with two other squad members, are fighting, literally, to hang onto what you’ve laid claim to. You don’t just raise your gun while infiltrating an area because it looks cool, you do so because that gun is a tool for your survival and there’s no telling what’s around the next corner.</p> <p>I’m convinced this game taps into some kind of primal fight-or-flight mechanism in the brain. For some, <i>Arc Raiders</i> will always be too stressful as a result. For other kinds of sickos, it’s the thrill of third-person shooting straight from the tap.</p> <p>As I continued to sink hour after hour of my time into <i>Arc Raiders</i>, it has felt like <i>this</i> was the experience I’ve been training for by playing and loving the hell out of tactical third-person shooters for so long, especially those with a bit of a survival bent. The risk associated with losing what I’ve found triggers an adrenaline rush of a kind I think is only possible in this specific genre of extraction shooters, and <i>Arc Raiders</i> is one of the best executions of this format. Though it is also a live-service game of a sort and thus could, in time, evolve in ways that fundamentally alter its identity, as long as <i>Arc Raiders </i>remains what it is right now, I have no need for any other online shooter. It is the “sport” of third-person shooters I have long hungered for.</p> <h2>Raiders of a Lost Age</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000642208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642208"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642208">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As an extraction shooter, <i>Arc Raiders</i> gives you a healthy selection of maps to enter and leave, hopefully wealthier than you were when you came in. The four maps present at launch provide a smorgasbord of post-apocalyptic scenes against which a variety of violent an endless assortment of stealthy scenarios can play out. Upon successful extraction, you keep what you found and you’re rewarded with XP to invest in your skill trees, as well as “Cred” which you can use to progress the game’s battle passes, or “Raider Decks,” as the game calls them. Currently there is only one Deck available; it’s free and can reward you with both cosmetics as well as in-game items.</p>

 <p>Out in the field, you’ll encounter wide open spaces spotted with broken-down machines from a battle fought long ago, as well as abandoned buildings with winding staircases and long stretches of vacant hallways adorned with rust, peeling paint, and signs and symbols from a forgotten age. It all constitutes an endless labyrinth of faded ruin for you to traverse. Weather conditions and changes in the time of day make the maps feel varied and fresh.</p> <p>There’s loot around every corner. You frequently have to break into locked caches, which itself is risky given the amount of noise it makes and time it takes to sort through a bunch of junk with the hope of finding that one piece of rusted gear you need to improve your crafting skills back home, or to kit out a new gun that will hopefully do a better job of keeping you alive.</p>

 <p>You can also take on specific quests, some of which fill you in on a bit of lore. You learn why there are abandoned, destroyed Arc machines in certain areas, and where the community of Speranza gets its water and other resources from. You’ll often have to go out to specific locations to gather key items, or to activate essential infrastructural elements. Completing these quests will see you earn loot from the quest giver in addition to whatever you found during your trip.</p>  <p>The quests are hardly riveting on their own, and often feature vague descriptions of where you’re supposed to go which can be frustrating, but it also forces you to observe your surroundings in a refreshing way–you’re not just chasing waypoints on a HUD. <i>Arc Raiders</i> wants you to actually be observant. One quest asked me to find a room in a building with a beautiful view of the map. What does that even mean? Well, I ran around the building until finally I came upon a window that, to me anyway, looked like it offered quite a pretty view. I audibly <a href="https://youtu.be/wGY9pakwFBU?t=32">quoted a young Ellie</a>, and searched the room to find my objective. And find it I did!</p>

 <p>These quests mostly consist of the same “go here, grab this thing, flip this switch” objectives, but even that can spark thrilling encounters given the unpredictability of what can happen when you encounter another player and the randomness of which of the game’s Arc menaces might be patrolling the area at that moment.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642209"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642209">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Different points of interest on each of the maps hold the promise of greater or lesser loot. And there are a variety of keys you can find to unlock hidden areas. Naturally, the areas with better loot are often the most dangerous, either because there’s a more aggressive Arc presence in that area, or because other players like yourself are heeding the call of better loot as well.</p> <h2>Shoot (or sneak) to survive; survive to subsist on your loot</h2> <p>There’s a ton of loot and items in <i>Arc Raiders</i> and, like in many games, it’s all color coded: Gray items are at the bottom, green items are better, blue even better. Purple is sick and gold is GOAT. If we’re talking about guns, then obviously a purple gun will be more desirable than a green. And if we’re talking about crafting ingredients, green crafting items are used to build better stuff than gray ones.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642210">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you’ll kit yourself out with an “Augment,” which will affect the kind of shield you can wear, as well as the size of your inventory. You’ll always have access to a free version that gives you enough loot space for a run, as well as a gun with ammo. Unless you’re specifically interested in doing so, there’s no reason to spawn onto a map with just your fists.</p>

 <p>Once you’re out on the field, <i>Arc Raiders</i> plays like many semi-realistic shooters. Characters are intentionally a little weighty and slow in how they move and shoot. Think <i>The Last of Us</i>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i>Metal Gear Solid</i></a>, or <i>Resident Evil 4</i> and not, say, <i>Vanquish</i>, <i>Warframe</i>, or <i>Max Payne</i>. Add in the essential and finite nature of loot, and the game reminds me often of a survival horror game, just without screaming monsters (though you’ll learn to fear some of these machines for sure).</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ enemies, specifically the computer-controlled ones known as Arc, pose a deadly threat. Many of them fly and can easily get new angles on you, and they’re equipped with weapons that can finish you off in no time.</p> <p>By having its AI antagonists serve the role of patrolmen on the field, <i>Arc Raiders </i>keeps you on edge, always on the&nbsp; lookout for their presence. But as dangerous as they are, damn, are they also fun to shoot. Metal parts fly off of them as bullets collide with their armor; the drone variety in particular satisfyingly spins and sputters when taking shots. As I’ve mentioned before, it reminds me of another IRL sport: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_pigeon_shooting">Clay pigeon shooting</a>.</p> <p>You’re not just mindlessly mowing down enemies to see damage numbers fill the screen. You have to place your shots well to destroy key parts of the Arc, while also being aware of their specific capabilities. The Leaper, for instance, can jump across vast distances and ignore difficult terrain to get to you.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642211" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642211"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642211">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Arc make for a satisfying foe. Because they’re machines, they’re not constantly repeating the same canned lines of dialogue like enemies in other shooters often do. And their patrol patterns feel believable for a force that exists solely to keep you off the map. They’re not just masked NPCs that exist to walk back and forth forever. And their behavior, which in some cases was built using machine learning, is wildly unpredictable in a satisfying way.</p> <p>Your other threats, though? Those would be your fellow human beings. They’re not just for shooting at, or for contests measuring who has the better collection of loot. They’re sometimes for forming uneasy alliances with, and the social game of determining whether to cooperate or compete with someone rarely plays out the same way twice. You might roll out on a map to do some solo looting, only to find yourself a new ally who’ll join you. Maybe they’ll even have a key to a place you haven’t been to yet. (And don’t worry if you’re mic-shy; you can ping what items are in your inventory to say things like “I have a key for this location” without ever needing to say a word.)</p> <p>Once, I grouped up with two other players who had one goal in mind: “We’re gonna take down a Leaper,” they told me. So I followed them to a bunker one of them pointed out. We dug in and opened fire on a nearby Leaper, took it down, grabbed its loot and then took down another team who tried to take advantage of us when we weren’t looking.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642212"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642212">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Another time I grouped up with a single random person on my quest to reach the Control Tower in Dam Battlegrounds, a promising location for loot. I had a key, but when we ascended the top, I found the door had been barred by a player-made Door Blocker. You can break these, but you’ll make an awful lot of noise in the process, and anyone lurking on the other end of that door will know you’re coming. I jammed my pickaxe into the door to start breaching it while my newly found comrade covered my back. We broke in to find no enemy players. Instead, a bunch of hostile Arc called “Pops” which just, well, pop with a deadly explosion right in front of you, poured down a staircase right to us. We took them out and then cautiously, room-by-room, stalked and searched the perimeter for whoever had blocked that door. Turns out they were long gone, but they did leave some decent loot for us to claim.</p> <p>And while you always want to hang on to your loot, given that <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ is an extraction shooter, dying and losing your stuff is just a standard part of the game’s inherently entropic nature. You can lose things just as easily as you found them, and guns and other items also have durability meters you need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>But if you die and your gun goes on to someone else, you’re also contributing to the economy of the game overall. That great shotgun you leveled up and kitted out? Lose it and now it’s someone else’s great shotgun that they’ll go cause some chaos with. Lately, I’ve taken to offloading my overflowing inventory by just gifting players better guns I made, which will hopefully aid them in their future fights.</p> <p>PvP in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is an endless pendulum of conflict and cooperation. Sometimes you can sway which direction it’s going in, while at other times you need to learn how to move with it or get the hell out of the way.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642213"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642213">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But when you’re not negotiating the terms of your survival with other players, or engaging in thrilling firefights with or against them, you’re back home, tinkering away with an inventory system that, as of now, is decent enough at letting you sort through your junk. But know that this is itself a time commitment.</p> <h2>The ‘joys’ of menu diving</h2> <p>Some quick back-of-the-napkin math tells me I’ve probably spent about a third of my time in <i>Arc Raiders</i> sorting through the menu system. Any engagement with this game also necessitates hours spent moving things around on a grid, combining them, breaking them down, and crafting them into new stuff. A strict cap on how much stuff you can stash away (you can level your stash up to a max of 256 items) means that you have to use your stuff rather than just hoarding all of it. If you have a tendency to be a pack mule, prepare for frequent back-and-forth to clear out enough space.</p> <p>The menu systems are serviceable, though they could stand to be improved. Crafting, for example, requires you to back out of your inventory screen to go to a specific workshop menu. It would be great if you could just craft more of a given object by right-clicking on it and selecting a “Craft” option but, at present, that isn’t there. There’s also no way to lock or mark an item to avoid accidentally selling or destroying it. Furthermore, some of the language, specifically around items whose only use is seemingly to be broken down into crafting materials, is vague. A Rusted Gear, for instance, might tell you that its only purpose is to “be recycled into crafting materials,” but you’ll soon find out that Rusted Gears are needed to upgrade your gun workshop.</p> <h2>‘It can’t be for nothing’</h2> <p>Shooting, surviving, navigating social situations with other players, hell, even collecting and crafting all present satisfying game loops that can just theoretically go on forever in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. And eventually, everyone will have access to better loot. So the nature of how lethal other players are in this game will ebb and flow. But what’s it all for?</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642214"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642214">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s <a href="https://youtu.be/fHuE5qqRPJA?t=35">not for nothing</a>. Right now, your ultimate goal in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is to invest in what it calls “Projects,” where you dedicate tons of found loot into building a caravan to send your Raider off to unknown frontiers.</p> <p>It’s a narrative wrapping for a mechanic very common in survival games and other extraction shooters: A server wipe.</p> <p>Because players can amass such incredible arsenals of weaponry and gear, a server wipe is a necessary controlled burn of its loot forest, a way to tame the lethality that will surely spiral out of control and descend into strict metas that, I’d argue, are antithetical to the experience of the game.</p> <p>But Embark Studios has chosen not to enforce a strict time for a global wipe. Instead, you opt into wiping by sending off your character, all their loot, and all of their skill tree and workshop upgrade progress. You’ll get some XP bonuses and crafting bonuses for doing so, as well as some extra points to invest in a new skill tree based on the value of what you had in your stash.</p> <p>At the time of writing, no one can send their character off. The window to do so will be a timed event.</p> <p>The game also features trials that reset every week featuring challenges like damaging certain Arc foes and searching specific loot caches. As you progress through these trials, you’ll ascend a publicly viewable leaderboard to track your global progress against that of everyone else playing the game.</p> <p>But perhaps what is most unknown right now is where the <i>story</i> of <i>Arc Raiders</i> is going. No one in-universe seems to know where the Arc came from. It is thought that some humans managed to jump ship and leave Earth as the environment fell apart, which has led fans to speculate that the Arc were actually sent here by now-extraterrestrial humans looking to mine what’s left of the planet for their own survival elsewhere.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642215" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642215"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642215">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Certain quests indicate that Arc behavior is changing, but the NPC quest givers are just as concerned with making sure everyone in Speranza has drinkable water and a decent supply of food as they are with tracking mysterious Arc behavior.</p> <p>There’s a lot of potential in <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ story, and in what future challenges it can introduce. We know from the game’s 2025 road map that a new Arc will arrive, presumably bringing with it new morsels of narrative to fuel the mystery of their origin.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> will naturally evolve as its various systems develop. Right now, however, it’s a stunning offering of eustress-inducing shootouts with very real consequences for failure as you take on unpredictable enemy players, cooperate with allies, and face down the cunning threats posed by the game’s excellent enemy AI. For those with an appetite for hunting and gathering, <i>Arc Raiders</i> promises an endless supply of loot to find and work with, all set in gorgeous maps brought to life with incredible sound design that conveys information as much as it entertains the ear with its satisfying sounds of clanging metal and rummaging through crates of <i>stuff</i>, as well as the compelling but terrifying digital chirps and songs of the Arc when they spot you.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000642216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642216"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642216">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But it is a punishing game. You will have to confront your own sense of failure, and the frustration that comes from getting sniped out of the blue or taken down by a sudden swarm of AI drones. <i>Arc Raiders</i> rarely eases up the pressure it puts on you. For some, that’s likely to be a dealbreaker. But if you’re game for something thrilling and you’re willing to tolerate loss, <i>Arc Raiders</i> is one of the most approachable and engaging examples of the extraction shooter yet.</p>
