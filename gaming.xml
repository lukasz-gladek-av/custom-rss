            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-the-tower-leaderboards-beta-arrives-update-2-5-2-blizzard/</link>
            <guid>1403689</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Blizzard's</strong> latest update for <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, patch <strong>2.5.2</strong>, is set to go live today at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BT, adding the Tower in the seasonal realm and Leaderboards in a Beta state, with Blizzard introducing them early to give more time for player feedback.</p>



<p>For now, the Beta introduction of the Tower and Leaderboards may be a bit buggy, Blizzard warns, but encourages players to leave their feedback as the team will continue to build out more features for the Tower and Leaderboards in Diablo IV in future updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Tear through the Tower, a fearsome new experience for many players, with a chance to earn a place on the Leaderboards," </em>Blizzard writes in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta">a blog post on today's update</a><em>. "Arriving in Beta with 2.5.2, the Tower and Leaderboards are launching early so we can shape the experience together with your feedback."</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>In the Tower, you’ll battle your way through a series of floors featuring randomized layouts and monster families. Push deeper, race against the clock and unleash your build as you fight toward the final Tower boss to complete your run.</em>"</p>



<p>Only players who have completed Rank 2 of the season rank will be able to access the Tower, so you'll have to get that finished before trying to place your name at the top of the leaderboards, which will be updated in two-week rounds throughout each season. The day before this current season, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-divine-intervetion-lands-on-december-11/">Season of Divine Intervention</a></strong> ends, the leaderboards will close and be locked in, cementing your place in the rankings.</p>



<p>Leaderboards, a new ranking system, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/"><strong>Lord of Hatred</strong></a> expansion were three of the teases included in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/">2026 section of the last roadmap Blizzard put out for Diablo IV</a>. Now that we're a dozen days into 2026, and we know that the Lord of Hatred expansion will arrive this coming <strong>April 28, 2026,</strong> we'll hopefully get a clearer idea of what Blizzard has planned for Diablo IV this year soon.</p>



<p>The Lord of Hatred expansion was revealed at<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/"> The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, and is the second major expansion coming to Diablo IV after its first expansion, <strong>Vessel of Hatred</strong>, arrived in October 2024. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo reviewed Vessel of Hatred at its launch</a>, he called it "<em>a solid expansion that is perhaps not heavy on content but more than makes up for it with many systemic changes that will elevate the whole game for years to come.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Lord of Hatred is able to improve on Diablo IV in more ways than just systemically, building off the foundation left by Vessel of Hatred.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Peter Molyneux's studio 22cans has revealed the release date for upcoming god game <em>Masters of Albion</em>, which Molyneux describes as "the culmination of [his] life's work", and it's coming in spring.</p><p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-is-the-culmination-of-my-lifes-work-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-has-a-release-date-and-a-new-trailer" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>, <em>Masters of Albion </em>will be landing exclusively on PC on April 22nd. Molyneux has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/emperor-of-overpromising-peter-molyneux-says-hes-done-with-games-after-masters-of-albion-which-is-also-his-redemption-title/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously described</a> the sim as his "last game", so it's also the controversial industry icon's swansong (assuming this really is his last hurrah, of course).</p><p>Molyneux and 22cans are promising that <em>Masters of Albion </em>will offer a blend of "cozy creativity" during the game's days and "brutal survival" when night falls, which sounds like a pretty typically ambitious combination of genres for <em>Fable </em>and <em>Populous</em>' designer.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Masters of Albion </em>will be Peter Molyneux's final game, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to 22cans and Molyneux, <em>Masters of Albion </em>is a "bold reimagining" of the god game genre, which Molyneux himself helped to pioneer through efforts like the aforementioned <em>Populous</em>, as well as games like <em>Black &amp; White</em> and <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>.</p><p>It's angling to be a city-builder with a strong narrative element; not only will you be building and developing the town of Oakridge, but you'll also be able to zoom in and see what you've built through the eyes of the people who live there.</p><p>Of course, Molyneux also has a history of overpromising and (some might say) underdelivering; although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fable-3-10th-anniversary" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="106de72f-8712-45e2-984c-a0d2b75cd71e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fable </em>series is well-loved</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-peter-molyneuxs-godus-is-such-a-disaster-1685539932" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">lessons of <em>Godus</em></a><em> </em>should teach us to approach any of Molyneux's future projects with trepidation.</p><p>That, however, is a reputation Molyneux himself is aware of. He's called <em>Masters of Albion </em>an attempt at "redemption" for him, and that this represents all of his "chips" being put on the table.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Will <em>Masters of Albion </em>live up to Peter Molyneux's long-standing tendency for overstatement?</figcaption>

<p>In any case, if you want to find out whether <em>Masters of Albion </em>will finally see Peter Molyneux putting his money where his mouth is, you can check it out on PC via Steam on April 22nd. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-dream-sleep-death-stranding-2-2000658957</link>
            <guid>1403680</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hideo Kojima dropped a new bit of lore over the weekend: the renowned designer has “always” suffered from nightmares. As he </span><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009914266024100002"><span>wrote</span></a><span> on Twitter, Kojima stumbled upon old dream logs in his phone’s notes while preparing to deliver </span><a href="https://gdconf.com/article/hideo-kojima-heads-to-the-festival-of-gaming-for-gdcs-first-keynote-in-5-years/"><span>the first keynote address in five years</span></a><span> at the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming 2026.</span></p> <p><span>Suggested to him as a remedy, jotting down his dreams proved to be ineffective in relieving Kojima of his nightmares. However, the notes grant us some insight into the subconscious of one of the most influential game designers of his time, in the form of two snapshots from almost exactly nine years ago. </span><span>If you’ve ever tried to explain your own dreams, you can probably empathize with Kojima’s struggle to articulate the goings-on of his sleeping mindscape. Still, for memos that likely weren’t intended to be seen by others, they paint a surprisingly coherent picture.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2017/1/3 Memo<br>The dreams I have are always strange ones. I’ve never had what you’d call a “good dream.” Or maybe I just don’t remember them. Ok. My first dream of the year. It’s difficult to put a hazy dream into words, but I’ll try to turn it into text. Some foreign filmmakers… <a href="https://t.co/ryN1yleObC">https://t.co/ryN1yleObC</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009915298602951012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The first log he shares is from January 3, 2017: In this dream, Kojima is invited to a film set where he is bitten in the arm by a flying, furry round creature. When he manages to pry the strange ball-like creature off his arm, it flies backward and morphs into an undisclosed new form. “A creature from outer space?” Kojima writes.&nbsp;</span><span>“An object from the fourth dimension? Whatever ‘it’ is, it keeps changing form in midair and returning again and again.” The film directors then point their cameras at Kojima, wordlessly capturing the struggle, which concludes with the creature transforming into a plastic card that lands in Kojima’s palm. </span><a href="https://x.com/DOrynbayev/status/2010025245919560025"><span>Fanart</span></a><span> has already been made.</span></p>

 <p><span>The second dream log comes from the following day, and takes place in a hot spring town. Kojima moves to a boarding house surrounded by narrow alleyways of packed dirt, and decides to clean the walkways. He hoses down the paths to keep the dust down, and on his journey encounters “voluptuous nude women who look as if they’ve stepped straight out of figure sketches or croquis drawings, [and] scar-covered elderly men who speak in foreign languages.”&nbsp;</span><span>The water uncovers corpses decomposing in the soil, posed as if they were swimming. Kojima returns to his rooms to call the police, but the corpses follow him and make themselves at home in his new residence. At the sound of the doorbell, the corpses transform into young men in relay racing gear. Their coach is at the door, and he’s furious.</span></p> <p><span>Any dream interpreters in the chat?</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oh, Thank Goodness Arc Raiders Isn’t A First-Person Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-first-person-mod-console-cheating-2000658944</link>
            <guid>1403677</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It is a tale as old as time itself: a hack gets a third-person game to run in first-person, or vice-versa, and the result is unspeakable horror. Sometimes that horror comes from <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-third-person-bug-reveals-v-is-a-shamblin-1845914278">the monstrosities that result</a>, but other times it can just be that the new perspective makes the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-mod-fps-first-person-pc-ea-remake-horror-1850186468">far more terrifying</a>. It’s the latter that appears to apply for&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after someone managed to get the game running in first-person mode and discovered it became even more intense.</p> <p>Via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-first-person-view-reddit/"><em>Polygon</em></a>, Redditor Short_Satisfaction_9 showed off the results of his fiddling with&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ console settings to force the game into a first-person perspective, and while the results are very janky-looking, they also show a version of the game where fighting is a far more frightening endeavor.</p>

   <p><em>Arc Raiders’</em> combat is already very tough, even if you’re completely avoiding PvP antics. The game’s PvE bots and drones don’t go easy on you at the best of times, but in third-person you at least have the advantage of somewhat mystical vision of your surrounding area, able to see incoming enemies at a good distance. In first-person, however, that’s all gone. It sets you up for an awful lot more surprise attacks, and given how unbelievably worked up I get playing the game already, this really isn’t something I’d be clamoring for.</p>

 <p>It’s also not something anyone else can do now, as Embark has just removed access to the in-game console. That’s for a good reason too—over the weekend, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">following complaints of widespread player cheating</a>, many realized that the commands enabled PC players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q92qd4/embark_please_ban_everyone_who_use_that_console/">to switch off all fogging</a> and thus increase visibility by a wild amount. Something Xbox and PS5 players could not, giving PC cross players a ridiculous advantage over both them and their fellow PC players who weren’t doing this.</p>

   <p>On January 10, Embark’s community manager posted to the Discord to say that a hotfix was being rolled out to remove the “NewConsole” command, a vestige of its Unreal Engine basis that had accidentally been left in the game. That’s going to reduce an awful lot of cheating, but does mean the rest of us can’t experience the horror of a first-person view.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Big Shooters Releasing In 2026—Best FPS Shooters]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/big-shooters-releasing-2026-best-fps/</link>
            <guid>1403674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re a fan of first-person shooters and FPS games in general, you’re in for a treat in 2026. From epic multiplayer games to core single-player campaigns, there’s something for everyone.</p>



<p>Some genres and trends have come and gone over the years. First-person shooters will be here until the end of time, thanks to the fine, fun foundations laid down by the likes of Wolfenstein, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, Call of Duty, Duke Nukem, Battlefield, and many other Hall of Fame-worthy franchises.</p>



<p>2026 already looks like a rootin’, tootin’, shootin’ good time.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-first-person-shooters-launching-in-2026">Biggest First-Person Shooters Launching In 2026</h2>



<p>One important thing to note about this list of big-time shooters coming in 2206 is that <strong>everything is subject to change</strong>. The video game industry can be great at times, but delays and unexpected events can alter plans in a heartbeat. Some games are one GTA 6 delay or date change away from a drastic U-turn. So bear this in mind with the attached release dates.</p>



<h3 id="h-highguard">Highguard</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Everyone needs to be on guard for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a>. It quickly became one of gaming’s biggest enigmas after its The Game Awards 2025 reveal. The game effectively closed the show, and the reception wasn’t good. Official Highguard social media pages also weren’t active in the weeks following. There’s still a feeling that it could do <em>something</em>. </p>



<p>It’s made by former Respawn Entertainment devs, which means it should be as mechanically efficient and effervescent as it can be. Whether the interest in another free-to-play shooter is there remains to be seen, but it might have been written off prematurely.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: January 26</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High On Life 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out critics weren’t as high on High On Life as Squanch Games may have expected. However, this didn’t stop everyone from gulping down a helping of Fleeb juice, throwing back some Schleems, and seeing what the Rick and Morty-inspired shooter on Xbox Game Pass. The interest was there, and it was enough to push through a sequel. If you enjoyed the first game, High On Life 2 should be worth checking out, and if you decided to give the first game a pass, you should maybe consider shouting “Show me what you got” at the follow-up.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-toxic-commando">Toxic Commando</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Saber Interactive is on a bit of a heater at the moment. Not content with the nightmare-inducing Hellraiser debut or the studio’s brilliant work on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (and the upcoming sequel), the team has concocted Toxic Commando. It can be enjoyed in either single-player or multiplayer, but there’s a real emphasis on fun and freakish terror when played with more people. You need to battle through eight missions of hideous creatures with your backbreaking arsenal of weapons and implements, and it looks like an old-school FPS delight!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 12</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. For Hire</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fumi Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Insider Gaming team is very excited about Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The rubberhose animation immediately makes it an endearing and unique-looking game, bringing back fond (and frustrating) memories of StudioMDHR’s Cuphead. Instead of cutesy-looking bosses, Mouse: P.I For Hire is a clever FPS making excellent use of its theme and style. It’s an FPS game at its cartoonish core, but you only have to watch a trailer to realise there’s an unmistakable air of bold brutality about it. Mouse: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026’s sleeper hits.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 19</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-marathon">Marathon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>After months of testing and trying to work out the kinks to ensure Marathon is not DOA on release, like many are already condemning the extraction shooter to, Bungie is gearing up for the game’s March 2026 release. The game has literally been on a marathon in the last 12 months: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plagiarism</a> claims, low internal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morale</a>, and the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Art Director leaving Bungie prior to the game’s release</a>. The shooter has endured it all, and even now, the game’s future feels like it could go either way. It could still end up as one of 2026’s biggest shooters, and try not to become another Concord.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Halo Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to see Halo: Campaign Evolved being anything but a win. There’s a quiet acceptance that its PS5 release signals the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of the console wars</a> and is the beginning of the series’ PlayStation arc. Still, the OG Halo campaign stands head and shoulders above most contemporaries and modern-day shooters that can only offer pale imitations of a legendary story. No multiplayer is a disappointment, but if you want to experience some of the purest and smoothest shooting mechanics in any video game ever, Halo: Campaign Evolved has the goods.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>

<p>The Vietnam conflict is still remembered as one of the most brutal wars, one that lasted for two decades. Hell Let Loose is the pinnacle of realism in military shooters, and the new Vietnam setting is a purist’s paradise for those wanting to indulge in a dark period of human history. Insider Gaming experienced a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, with Tom Henderson saying: “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.”</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>

<p>Call of Duty will always happen, and whatever does happen with each release, <em>another </em>one will be waiting just around the corner. It’s the best-selling FPS franchise by all metrics (including Guinness World Records), and Black Ops 7 will be consigned to history come the end of 2026. Why? It will be time for Call of Duty 2026—rumored to be Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly set in North &amp; South Korea</a>, and a BIG effort and push will be needed after the coldly-received Black Ops 7. Even if there’s not, everyone will still buy it anyway.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: Late 2026 (Oct/Nov)</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[After Shutting Down Crucial, Micron Says It’s Trying To “Help Consumers”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shutting-down-crucial-micron-trying-help-consumers/</link>
            <guid>1403671</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Back in December, Micron announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down its consumer memory</a> and storage brand Crucial. At the time, the company said it was due to the “AI-driven growth” within the industry. Now, just over a month later, Micron is addressing the decision to shutter the budget-friendly brand in favor of powering data centers and large AI companies.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WCCFTech</a>, Micron’s VP of Marketing, Mobile, and Client Business Unit, Christopher Moore, was asked about the decision and the consumer backlash that followed. </p>







<p>Moore says that the “perception may not be exactly correct” from his point of view. The perception being that the company turned its back on consumers to favor large companies and the continued expansion of data centers. He says that the decisions being made are done to “help consumers around the world.”</p>



<h2 id="h-micron-is-still-involved-in-the-consumer-market">Micron Is Still Involved In The Consumer Market</h2>



<p><strong>“So, I would never want to tell someone what to think or that they’re wrong, but our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re just doing it through different channels. We still have a very sizable business in the client and mobile markets. We are also, of course, servicing our data center customers.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“And what’s going on right now is that the TAM and data center is growing just absolutely tremendously. And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.”</strong></p>







<p>Moore said that it’s still suppling LPDDR5 to companies like ASUS and Dell, which he uses to defend is point on helping consumers. He said that the company is <strong>“in contact with every single PC brand out there to supply memory modules”</strong> and holds a <strong>“large portion of the consumer supply chain through the OEM model.”</strong></p>



<p>That said, Micron <strong>“cannot ignore the demand coming from AI right now.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the continued shortage of memory and storage, Moore believes that things might not get better until 2028. At least, on Micron’s side. They are working on building new facilities, including a new facility in Idaho scheduled to open in mid-2027 as well as facility in New York. But, Moore says that everything won’t be up and running until 2028.</p>



<p>In the meantime, consumers might have to stick with their older machines a while longer as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices continue to soar</a> throughout the market. </p>



<p>What do you make of Moore’s comments regarding Micron, Crucial and the state of consumer PC parts?

Under their collective control, Mario pulled off some of the most athletic moves we've seen from Nintendo's iconic plumber. They even made some of the game's trickiest platforming moments seem easy.</p><p>In total, this speed run lasted just under two hours. There are 120 stars in the game, so it's possible to pull off an even larger Super Mario 64 relay at future AGDQ events. The current AGDQ event also had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youve-gotta-see-this-amazing-mario-kart-world-speedrun/1100-6537235/" data-ref-id="1100-6537235">a Mario Kart World speedrunner</a> complete the All ?

            <p>Peter Molyneux's Masters of Albion - which the game creator has said is the "culmination" of his life's work - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Masters of Albion is coming from Molyneux and 22cans, and will arrive on 22nd April for PC via Steam. "Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">official Steam description</a>. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In [Masters of Albion], there is no single solution, only your solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, whenever. Kill or carry, crush or coax.</p>
<p>"You are the ultimate power."</p>

<p>Molyneux said Masters of Albion's forthcoming release owes "so much" to other games already out there, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>, Black &amp; White and Fable, which he famously also worked on.</p>
<p>"It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-is-the-culmination-of-my-lifes-work-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-has-a-release-date-and-a-new-trailer">the developer said</a> of Masters of Albion.</p>
<p>The game itself will allow players to command the world with ancient powers. You want to build it, you go for it. The world of Albion is, quite literally, in your hands.</p>

<p>Masters of Albion was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>. Our former editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">Tom Phillips spoke to Molyneux all about Masters of Albion ahead of its reveal</a>, where the developer said:</p>
<p>"I'm in my 60s now… My lifestyle is so awful. My life expectancy is probably measured in seconds rather than years. So if I'm going to design another game, it's got to <em>matter</em>."</p>

Where the latter's started life as a physical medium, the former's attempt at such a thing, literally just called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> Official Card Game, announced today, looks to be of the digital-only variety, though what there is to learn about it is a touch slim overall.
</p>
<p>
There is a small teaser trailer to bear witness to, but to be honest that barely shows off the cards itself. You will see in the opening shot a card of Wooloo- sorry, Lamball, with some quite lackluster card art. The rest of the trailer is just glowing, artless cards summoning forth different Pals, so perhaps there's a bit more of a Yu-Gi-Oh! vibe going on here? Especially considering matches appear to be just held in the regular Palworld overworld.

Some further details confirmed in a little blog post on the game's official site explain that it's a two player competitive card game "where you can enjoy strategic and tactical battles through deploying various unique Pals. Players fight alongside their Pal companions, gathering resources, and building bases as they aim for victory. These adorable and dependable Pals will utilize their own unique traits to lead you to victory."
</p><p>
To me that sounds like it could be anything from a tower defence type situation, or even semi-autobattler, but who knows, not a lick of proper gameplay was shown off. Presumably some will come soon at least, as the game already has a release date: July 30th, later this year. It's also being made with card game maker Bushiroad, so at least someone with some experience is involved. Probably also worth noting that there's been no direct confirmation of a PC release just yet, but a console release hasn't been confirmed either, and the base game's on PC, so this seems like a shoo-in.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo says it’s actively monitoring the impacts of tariffs and the rising prices of RAM as an AI-fueled scramble spikes computing costs around the world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The comments came in a rare interview the </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span> maker’s president, Shuntaro Furukawa, gave to </span><em><a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945"><span>Kyoto Shimbun</span></a></em><span>, which was translated </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/"><span>by </span><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp; In it, the executive noted that the possibility of raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 due to future costs is hypothetical and didn’t commit one way or the other. However, he did acknowledge that AI data centers requiring large amounts of RAM, and the scarcity this situation creates, may become a concern in the future.</span></p> <p><span>When asked about the current challenges for keeping Switch 2’s profit margin lower than that of its predecessor, Furukawa explained, “Hardware profitability depends on factors like component procurement conditions, cost reductions through mass production, and the impact of exchange rates and tariffs.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The executive previously told investors that Switch 2 pricing was safe for now unless there was another Trump trade war blowup. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts,” Furukawa </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086"><span>said in November</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <h2>Is 2026 the year Switch 2 goes to $500?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803"><span>The rising costs of PC parts</span></a><span> aren’t only concerning for gaming firms like Nintendo but also for average people. It’s become pricey and challenging to purchase RAM and graphic cards for PCs. </span><span>It’s gotten so bad that NVIDIA </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687"><span>is reportedly</span></a><span> considering making its older RTX 3060s graphics cards available again to meet demand.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the interview, the Nintendo president also said that the game company had projected a negative impact from tariffs last year which ended up costing it tens of millions in the first half. </span><span>“This is a crucial period for our game business as we promote the adoption of new hardware and maintain the momentum of our platforms. We are working on this while carefully considering the situation,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Nintendo is monitoring these rising costs and market changes, it has already responded to them over the last year. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220"><span>In August of 2025</span></a><span>, the gaming firm increased the prices of its original Switch console. The U.S. price for the nearly decade-old Switch console rose from $299 to $339, the Switch OLED from $349 to $399, and the Switch Lite from $199 to $229.</span></p>

 <p><span>At this time, it’s unclear what decisions Nintendo will make due to the market conditions of RAM costs and the tariffs. However, during the interview, President Furukawa said, “While it’s difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US.”</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Dog Beat Alison Brie And Ethan Hawke For An Acting Award, And No, This Isn’t The Plot Of A New Air Bud]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/good-boy-indy-astra-award-best-performance-dog-horror-2000658943</link>
            <guid>1403629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497"><span>dog-led horror movie starring Indy the retriever</span></a><span>, premiered last year, I said we should give the titular good boy an Oscar for his performance. That was just an offhand comment made in jest, but now that we’re in award season, Indy has actually been winning awards for his performance, though most of them have been against other animal actors. That is, until the Astra Awards on Friday, January 9, where he won the award for Best Performance in a Horror or Thriller, which was met with both happiness for the dog and a surprising amount of cynicism about the state of award shows.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note that Indy had no awareness that he was even “acting” in any real sense of the word. Director Ben Leonberg said in a behind-the-scenes mini-doc accompanying the film that Indy is not a trained canine actor, and the film is edited such that shots recontextualize moments where Indy is just looking at something off-screen as Leonberg makes noise behind the camera.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Indy has won animal performance awards from the South by Southwest Film &amp; TV Festival, the San Diego Film Critics Society, and the Boston Society of Film Critics. However, the Astra Award is the first he’s won against actual human actors, and there were some pretty big standouts in the category:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alison Brie – </span><i><span>Together</span></i><span> as Millie Wilson</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ethan Hawke – </span><i><span>Black Phone 2</span></i><span> as The Grabber</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sally Hawkins – </span><i><span>Bring Her Back</span></i><span> as Laura</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sophie Thatcher – </span><i><span>Companion</span></i><span> as Iris</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alfie Williams – </span><i><span>28 Years Later </span></i><span>as Spike</span></li> </ul>  <p><span>Now, if you look at the comments under Leonburg and Indy’s acceptance speech video, you’ll see an outpouring of support for Indy’s win and his handsome little bowtie. If you look elsewhere, however, you’ll find that both fans of the other nominees and general award season followers are viewing it through a much more cynical lens. Honestly, the more I think about it, the more Indy winning out against excellent human actors sounds like the plot of a Disney Channel Original Movie in which a young kid’s canine companion makes trouble for their owner’s no good, mean-ass bullies by beating them at the local talent show. It’s the kind of move that feels like it was made for the sake of the meme rather than to actually recognize the performance that displays the most craft, skill, and artistry.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Incredibly so,” AdhesivenessFar5588 responded. “Especially since in the ‘making of’ at the end of the movie, they literally say that he’s not acting. There is no performance. It’s simply recording over and over again until you get the reaction you were looking for, and then splicing it together with other scenes. This would be like giving an award to an actor who had to wear an ear piece with their dialogue fed to them line by line. Like, it’s cute in theory to give the dog an award, and incredibly insulting when you think about it for more than 10 seconds.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As some have pointed out, this is an especially annoying move for an award celebrating the horror genre, which is rarely recognized during awards ceremonies, and it’s unlikely several of these actors will be nominated in more general categories throughout awards season.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This kinda sucks, [not gonna lie],” 1080TJ wrote. “Horror performances are barely awarded outside of these specialized categories and it would’ve been nice for any of these actors to get some acknowledgement for their work. Alfie Williams in particular was amazing.”</span></p> <p><span>I’m of the mind that </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>’s most award-worthy aspects are in its editing and directing, especially once you realize Indy has no formal training as an acting dog and it’s Leonburg’s directorial debut. Indy can sweep the animal actor awards, but pitting him against the likes of Ethan Hawke and Sophie Thatcher and giving him the trophy is pretty unserious. </span></p>

            <p>Just before the calendar ticked over to 2026, Witcher and Cyberpunk makers CD Projekt revealed that they'd <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cd-projekt-red-sells-gog-platform-to-co-founder-for-25-million">sold off their PC storefront</a> - GOG. In a deal worth 90.7 million Polish zloty (about £18.6 million / $25 million), original CD Projekt and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński bought the storefront and has now offered some words about his vision for its future in a Steam-dominated market.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Speaking to RPS' tie-wearing and LinkedIn-browsing corporate sibling <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Kiciński argued that the ideal approach to thriving in a universe that's home to Valve's puffing and whistling baby isn't imitating it, but making sure GOG continues to stand out.</p>
<p>That commitment to getting classic games working on modern hardware and working to maintain them? It ain't going anywhere. Neither is the store's firmly anti-DRM stance, with Kiciński neatly summing up the issue of such software continuing to be pushed by declaring: "most corporate people, they make plain stupid decisions". That said, the exec was clear Steam's success does highlight areas in which GOG will be striving to do better going forwards. "Steam is winning with its ease of use," he said. "In that regard, I think much can be done in GOG without losing its core values and the way it operates in general."</p>
<p>On the flipside, there are things GOG's current makeup facilitates which Kiciński reckons are key to the strength of what it offers the would-be PC game buyer. "GOG is a very curated platform. This is, I think, one of our strengths: we don't release hundreds of games daily, 95% of which are really not super high quality, he said, adding that this relative lack of overwhelming rat race compared to Steam's ever-raging battle for eyes can be a boon for smaller developers. If you've got something with unique flair that might struggle to break through the noise and reach players open to giving it a go, maybe being a bigger fish in a smaller pond is better. Or so is the idea here.</p><p>While GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski did point out in this chat that the store are "getting better at getting new games" with each passing year, packing releases from the current year alongside their calling card good old games, Kiciński was clear that competing with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-ancient-behemoths-face-increased-competition-from-new-games-in-the-stores-2025-money-making-rankings">the likes of Steam in that area</a> in future isn't the goal. Though, he wouldn't commit to anything concrete when asked about a previously floated idea which could be a natural way for GOG to double down on classics instead - making their own remasters in a similar fashion to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-remake">System Shock Remake</a> devs Nightdive Studios.</p>
<p>That path very much isn't being ruled out, though. "It's very close to what I've said about development and publishing, being close to those processes," Kiciński said. "We have a very big talent pool in Poland in that regard. So it feels very natural to grow in that direction, but it's too early to say any concrete things."</p>
<p>Given hosting big mods - including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> and still in-the-works <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> - has been another growing string to GOG's bow in recent years, I'm personally hopeful its new ownership will keep that ball rolling too. After all, it's another area Valve's behemoth doesn't have totally locked down, even if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-workshop-mods-should-hopefully-suffer-less-update-induced-hassle-thanks-to-new-version-control-tools">Steam Workshop</a> continues to be modding hub of choice for certain games.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904</link>
            <guid>1403593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When fans learned that <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713">Lego had finally snagged the Pokémon license from a rival brick-based brand</a>, there was a lot of excitement. But now, some fans aren’t happy about the higher prices and the build differences between each company’s Pikachu sets.</p> <p>After teasing it in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895">Lego has finally revealed its first upcoming Pokémon sets</a>, which include an Eevee and a Pikachu. However, these aren’t the first officially licensed brick-based toy products based on Game Freak’s famous franchise ever to hit store shelves. For years, Mega Bloks, a Lego competitor, had the license and released over 100 different Pokémon sets. Mega Bloks has produced a lot of different Pokémon sets and themes in various sizes and packages. So to keep this fair, we are going to focus on the two most comparable sets from Mega Bloks: Jumbo Pikachu and Jumbo Eevee. These sets are roughly the same size as Lego’s upcoming Pikachu and Eevee sets and seem the fairest to compare.</p>

 <p>First up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/building-poseable-character-Building-Exclusive/dp/B079KNH886?tag=kotaku01-20">from 2022, it’s the Mega Bloks Jumbo Pikachu</a>. When it arrived on shelves a few years ago, this 12-inch-tall Pikachu cost $50, though you could often find it on sale if you looked around. It contains 806 pieces and features posable arms, legs, ears, and a movable head. It is also a chunkier Pikachu, more closely resembling the OG “fat Pikachu.” Honestly, a pretty solid, good-looking set, though there were complaints at the time that the build had some issues with pieces falling off. All you get in the set is the Pikachu and nothing else.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658926" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658926"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658926">© Mega Bloks / Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s compare that set to Lego’s newly announced Pikachu set. <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/first-lego-pokemon-sets-officially-revealed-for-27-february-2026-launch/">This set is going to cost $200</a> when it launches in February, which is four times as much as Mega Bloks’ version. Ouch. And when directly comparing them, I’m struggling to see why. Lego’s set is technically 13 inches tall, but that’s only when it’s set up on the included brick-built stand.</p>

 <p>The actual Pikachu build appears to be around 11 inches or so tall, so around the same size as the old Mega Bloks set. And yet it costs $150 more. It also includes over 2,000 pieces. Lego’s Pikachu is cleaner looking for sure, with fewer exposed studs, but that might be a negative for some folks. I think the biggest downgrade is that the Lego Pikachu seems far less posable. Though I greatly prefer Lego’s version of Pikachu’s hands, which look like cute paws instead of the blocky, ugly human-like hands found on the old set from 2022. Lego’s set also includes a brick-built Poké Ball, which is neat, but I could have done without.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658927">© Lego / Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, the comparison between Mega Bloks’ Jumbo Eevee and Lego’s Eevee set is much less interesting. They both appear to be about the same size and are similarly priced. Mega Bloks wanted $50 for Eevee back when it was released in 2020. Lego is going to sell its Eevee for $60. A $10 increase for more pieces and a nicer-looking build. That works for me.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658933"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658933">© Mega Bloks / Lego / Game Freak / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On the flipside, the Lego Pikachu does seem like a very pricey set that seems somewhat of a downgrade compared to Mega Bloks’ spin on Pikachu. I appreciate the cleaner look and the included stand, but the Pokeball seems like wasted pieces, and I wish, for that price, Lego included more posable limbs and joints.</p>

 <p>Ultimately, I’d say if you are desperate to get your hands on a brick-built Pikachu for your desk or bedroom shelf, but don’t want to fork over $200, then buying a new Mega Bloks Pikachu for $50 or less will get you a solid alternative, and you’ll have money leftover to buy Lego’s cheaper Eevee set.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The next game in The Sims franchise--codenamed Project Rene--has turned into a mobile-first experience that's all about social multiplayer. It is not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6510166/">The Sims 5</a>, and developer Maxis states this title can live in harmony with The Sims 4 and any future single-player installments in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis discussed the future of The Sims in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims" rel="nofollow ">a blog post</a> celebrating the new year. Within this article, the companies noted that "Project Rene has evolved to focus on social multiplayer play, offering a more direct way for friends to share creativity together." In addition, the "mobile-first life-sim game" is about collaboration.</p><p dir="ltr">However, The Sims franchise won't forget about its roots. The blog post states: "At its core, The Sims was built on a deep, single-player life simulation, chock full of rich systems, meaningful storytelling, and player agency that puts you in control. That foundation isn't going anywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">Originally announced in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-is-now-in-development-heres-a-first-look-at-its-build-mode/1100-6508378/">Project Rene was presumed to be The Sims 5</a>. But that changed in recent years, as EA and Maxis pointed out the in-development game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wont-drop-sims-4-support-when-project-rene-comes-out/1100-6526534/">would complement The Sims 4</a> instead of replacing it. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">The Sims team declared their values wouldn't change</a>, in wake of fan concerns regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">EA's $55 billion deal</a> with the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund affecting the life-sim series.</p><p>Talk of Project Rene exploring multiplayer concepts emerged in 2023, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-5-multiplayer-could-be-inspired-by-animal-crossing-or-among-us/1100-6519254/">Animal Crossing and Among Us name-checked as possible inspirations</a>. Now, it's clear, Project Rene is going all in on social multiplayer. Outside of gaming, there is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-movie-from-margot-robbies-production-company-confirmed-will-include-freezer-bunnies/1100-6526524/">a Sims movie in the works</a>.</p>

While it's available to play on Valve's Steam Deck handheld, last year's Switch 2 launch had many wondering whether it would make the jump to Nintendo's new platform as well. Hopes only raised higher with the recent announcement that Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian's previous game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/divinity-original-sin-2-surprise-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-switch-2-today" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a272ebc-a75c-4126-9e9e-c733a87a4849" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Divinity Original Sin II, would come to modern platforms, including the Switch 2</a>. However, it seems that the D&amp;D adaptation is likely not going to follow in its footsteps.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The news comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a recent Reddit AMA</a> (Ask Me Anything) in which some members of Larian Studios answered questions for members of the r/Games subreddit. When user u/darkwai asked "Baldur's Gate 3 for Switch 2? Is it even possible?" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Larian game director Swen Vincke replied</a>, "We would have loved to but it [sic] wasn't our decision to make."</p><p>Vincke is potentially alluding to the now-fractured relationship between Larian and D&amp;D IP owner Wizards of the Coast. After Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/21/larian-ceo-says-the-studio-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-to-focus-on-something-new">Larian canceled its DLC plans and decided to end its relationship with Wizards of the Coast</a> to return to its fully independent state. Despite the studio's continued support of the game, it's not the sole owner of the rights, so there are some potential hurdles that might come with bringing it to other platforms.

            <p>Gaming can't escape the shadow of global economic uncertainty, and things are going to get worse following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/microsoft-xbox-prices-tariffs-macroeconomic-conditions.html">2025's price hikes</a> due to the memory shortages caused by the AI and data centre gold rush (which doesn't seem to be producing much gold just yet). What about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> following a strong summer launch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">but slow Christmas</a>? Will it be safe from the price hikes?</p>
<p>According to an interview for <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> (read and extracted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/">VGC</a>), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa isn't ready to sound the alarm yet, but he acknowledges things aren't looking too great at the moment.</p>
<p>"We procure from suppliers based on our medium- to long-term business plans, but the current memory market is very volatile… There is no immediate impact on earnings, but it is something we must monitor closely."</p>
<p>Furukawa also went on to explain Nintendo is trying to reduce the impact of the annoying RAM shortages and fluctuating tariffs (not limited to the United Sates) by "advancing component procurement over the medium to long term." Of course, at some point the company might run out of runway, which could lead to increased prices<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them"> in line with PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">Xbox's</a> unwelcome adjustments.</p><p>For now, Furukawa won't comment on potential price increases, only saying it's hypothetical talk until things get more difficult. He was more open about the impact of tariffs though: "While it's difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US."</p>
<p>For those unaware, consoles' profit margins have traditionally been lower than you'd expect, which is why they're especially susceptible to sudden shifts in the market conditions around tech components and tariffs. Even before the hiccups caused by the madness around AI services and infrastructure we've seen over the past few months, we'd been facing a tricky decade when it comes to resources used for hardware production, so these are rough waters we'll collectively have to learn to navigate in the future.</p>

<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161451/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>While it presents itself as a chilled-out ode to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">Legend of Zelda</a>–style adventuring and the Game Boy aesthetic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a> is more than meets the eye.</p>
<p>It opens with an ominous dream in which your protagonist is told, “If it can’t be seen, it does not exist.” From there, the game drops you into a very familiar scenario.</p>
<p>You wake up in your house, greet your mother, and step out into a small village that will feel instantly recognisable to anyone who has played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a> or any given Zelda title. It is so familiar, in fact, that you would be forgiven for rolling your eyes and dismissing Wonderland Kazakiri’s creation as just another homage to Nintendo classics.</p>
<p>That assumption does not last long. Your first dungeon (actually more of a basement) presents a progress block with a static, isometric corridor and a stubborn snail in the way. Instead of fighting it, you are instructed to flip the camera and make the snail stop existing altogether. A tap of the shoulder button and the whole world rotates on its axis, offering an entirely new viewpoint.</p>
<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161441/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Cassette Boy is a game about perspective. The developers call it a "Schrödinger System". Traversal, combat, and puzzles all hinge on your ability to rotate the environment and cause objects, enemies, or hazards to cease to exist.</p>
<p>In that sense, it is like The Legend of Zelda, if Lizalfos were constantly at risk of their quantum superposition collapsing.</p>
<p>There’s another homage to note here. The dimensional shifting, paired with chilled-out chiptune beats, recalls Phil Fish’s classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fez">FEZ</a>. That game offered an intoxicating world to explore with very little concern for traditional narrative structure. Cassette Boy leans more toward the generic side when it comes to its adventure.</p>
<p>Setting out from the hub town, our hero collects weapons and power-ups, explores caves and dungeons, and hunts down fragments of the moon to reassemble it. There is nothing particularly exciting about the story being told here, and it rarely surprises.</p>
<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161447/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The real hook lies in the often ingenious puzzle mechanics. Every enemy and environmental hazard is vulnerable to being obscured by camera rotation. Early on, this simply means erasing obstacles from your path. As the game progresses, however, you are required to make increasingly sharp logic leaps to move forward.</p>
<p>Switches stop functioning when they disappear. Deadly spike traps become harmless when obscured from view. Some devices in a room will only trigger after the camera has been rotated a specific number of times.</p>
<p>This can be deeply disorienting, especially during boss battles that are built entirely around this mechanic, but it is also where Cassette Boy is at its most clever and confident. After its initial tutorial quest and boss battle, the game stops holding your hand. Much like the titles that inspired it, you’re free to poke around the edges of a relatively open world.</p>
<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161440/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Progression is neither linear nor truly open, and it’s easy to get lost wondering where to go next, especially at the start, when you’re still acclimating to the shifting perspective. Luckily, any frustration is offset by the calming nature of green.</p>
<p>The game’s other creative flourish is the viridescent splendour of its Game Boy-like visual style. The initially harsh glow of the colour scheme gives way to a flood of childhood memories. It looks surprisingly sharp on a big screen, easier on the eye than you might expect. Rotating the camera from flat to blocky is fluid; it’s consistently satisfying to see those ancient handheld visuals shift into another dimension. Undocked is much more comfortable, though, if only because it feels like this style should always be depicted on a smaller display.</p>
<figure><a title="Cassette Boy Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161446/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a shame that the adventure itself isn't as compelling as the visuals and puzzling. Even with some snappy NPC dialogue, this is a journey you’ve taken countless times before.</p>
<p>While the roster of enemies is pleasingly odd at times, fighting them is pretty dull. Sword slashes and charged range shots are the order of the day for monsters that can't be sent into the void with a flip of the camera. There is a neat quirk with the ability set in which staggered tutorial prompts let you know of abilities you already had. This felt reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tunic">Tunic</a>, a game that also wore its influences on its sleeve.</p>
<p>For all its shortcomings and liberal borrowing from better titles, though, it’s worth considering that, as a budget release asking a fraction of what others charge for similar — and often less innovative — experiences, Cassette Boy is still worth picking up.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A familiar adventure that pulls from the likes of Zelda and Pokémon for its setting and story, Cassette Boy is nevertheless a smart puzzler with a great visual style. The dimension-shifting mechanic never gets old, putting a fresh and literal spin on traditional isometric questing.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While there hasn't been a new main entry in the series in a long time - not counting the 2018's MMO - the Fallout series is more popular than ever thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-show-season-2-goes-for-broke-says-walton-goggins-we-put-everything-in-there/"><strong>Amazon Prime TV Show</strong></a>. The adaptation effectively rejuvenated the franchise, attracting millions of new players to its post-apocalyptic world and prompting them to explore older titles, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong>.</p>



<p>The series' resurgence has also breathed new life into an old debate among the community: the "purist" first two entries versus the first-person RPGs developed by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Bethesda Game Studios</strong>. According to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Chris Avellone</strong>, the lead developer of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> - which many feel is the true successor to the original top-down games - the series' current direction has a simple reason: Bethesda doesn't fully understand its roots. Nor does it care.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009457239694954576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009457239694954576%7Ctwgr%5Ebe45c50dada723054da89576b40cc48a3f92b2b1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Ffallout%2Fi-dont-think-bethesda-hates-fallout-says-new-vegas-lead-they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care%2F"><strong>Replying to a fan's question regarding whether Bethesda "hates" the original series on X</strong></a>, Avellone was remarkably clear: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"I don’t think Bethesda hates Fallout, they just don’t fully understand its roots and arguably, don’t care - they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm."</em></p>



<p>This lack of deeper connection is what Avellone believes fuels the series' current design philosophy. <em>"This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout – and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me,"</em> Avellone pointed out.</p>



<p>Although these statements sound harsh, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</strong> </em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong> veteran clarified that he doesn't hate Bethesda, highlighting some of their strengths. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"There are things they do well (open world exploration), and there are things they do badly (telling linear stories in open world games and their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill). But every developer has their pros and cons,"</em> Avellone concluded.</p>



<p>As someone who loves the first two entries and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout </strong></em><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">New Vegas</em></strong>, but could never really get into <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout 3</em></strong> or <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">4</em></strong>, I can only agree with Avellone's sentiment. While the Bethesda entries are undeniably solid open-world RPGs, they often feel like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout</em> games only on the surface, missing those small elements that made the original games and the Obsidian title truly memorable.</p>



<p>Standing as one of the best modern entries in the series, a remastered <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> would be an extremely welcome release to tide fans over until the release of the inevitable fifth entry, which may not see the light of day for a long time, with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-quite-playable-state-though-release-window-remains-unknown-rumor/"><strong>Bethesda still hard at work on </strong><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Elder Scrolls VI</em></strong></a>.

			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/"><strong>Microsoft</strong> signed a 10-year deal with <strong>Nintendo</strong></a> that promised to bring <strong>Call of Duty</strong> to Team Red's console in order to help get its acquisition of Activision Blizzard across the finish line, technically speaking, seeing the shooter franchise arrive on the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> (or more likely, the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>) has been a sure thing.</p>



<p>We're four years into that deal, and still no Call of Duty on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2, but a recent datamine spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-on-nintendo-switch-datamine">Eurogamer</a> seems to indicate that the shooter's arrival on the platform is "<em>imminent</em>."</p>



<p>Dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/2010381277011284375">Realityuk</a>, who has previously shared accurate datamined files related to Call of Duty updates, spotted a mention of Nintendo in the launcher code the last time they delved into Call of Duty HQ, and believes it is an indication that we'll see the official announcement the next time Nintendo hosts a major event. </p>



<p>This datamine comes just three weeks after a report pointing to Call of Duty arriving on Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/">sometime in 2026, potentially launching "<em>in a few months</em>."</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Back in 2022, when Microsoft's head of gaming, <strong>Phil Spencer</strong>, was first talking about the deal to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo's console,<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-bringing-call-of-duty-to-switch-will-require-time/"> he admitted that it</a> "<em></em><em>would likely take a little bit of time</em>" to make the port happen. </p>



<p>Now that it has been "<em>a little bit of time</em>" since that deal was inked, and the Nintendo Switch 2 is not just a poorly-kept secret but the latest console on the market, it seems like we are coming very close to seeing the world's most popular shooter franchise arrive on the hybrid console.</p>



<p>Regardless, at least it's not a question of 'if' but just a question of 'when.' Hopefully, we'll hear more official news soon.</p>
