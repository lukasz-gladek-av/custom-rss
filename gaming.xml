<p>NYXL ‚Äì the parent company of the New York Subliners ‚Äì has just revealed that the NYSL brand is closing down. This news comes mere weeks after the announcement that the Subliners and Cloud9 had partnered ahead of the Esports World Cup. It wasn‚Äôt made clear how this new partnership would impact the CDL team‚Äôs branding, but now the epic change has been unveiled ‚Äì the New York Subliners (by brand, at least) are no more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line">End of the Line</h2>



<p>The New York Subliners have been a hugely impactful force in the Call of Duty League for years. From being an underdog squad in the Cold War season to dominating an entire year of gameplay and winning COD Champs in 2023, the squad has come up <strong>fast</strong>. For the longest time, fans have followed the ins and outs of this team, learning transparently what goes on behind the doors of the Subliners.</p>



<p>It was announced today that the New York Subliners is being shut down from a branding perspective. Here‚Äôs the message (and the emotional montage) that was posted online:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>1 üíç, 6 ü•á, 3 ü•à , the first New York homestand, and countless other memories. To all our fans, thank you for your love and support over the past 5 years. It has been an incredible journey, and we‚Äôre grateful to have experienced it with all of you.</p><p>Signing out. </p><p>-NYXL‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/57z1fdnTFB">pic.twitter.com/57z1fdnTFB</a></p></div>‚Äî Subliners (@Subliners) <a href="https://twitter.com/Subliners/status/1816519252137881962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Cloud9 responded to this post by stressing: ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt the end, just a new beginning‚Äô. It‚Äôs a direct indication that C9 will make a grand re-entry to the Call of Duty scene next season. It was always a guaranteed thing that the Subliners squad would represent C9‚Äôs brand at the Esports World Cup, but nobody thought that the CDL-focused brand would dissipate.</p>



<p>Days ago, the New York Subliners came in second place at COD Champs, with OpTic Texas securing a massive win ‚Äì the organisation‚Äôs first world championship victory since 2017.</p>



<p>I‚Äôve since reached out to sources close to the Subliners to see if there‚Äôs more information about what‚Äôs coming next.</p>



<p>Are you sad to see the back of the Subliners, or excited about what might come from C9 during the 2025 CDL season?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Blizzard Entertainment has laid out plans to begin testing for the potential return of 6v6 matchups in Overwatch 2‚Ä¶eventually.</p><p>The update on the controversy plaguing the Overwatch community comes from game director Aaron Keller, who posted a 3600-word <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Director‚Äôs Take blog post</a> on the subject today. It‚Äôs a lengthy statement on the history of 6v6, why <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-pvp-will-now-be-5v5-not-6v6"><u>it was removed with the launch of Overwatch 2</u></a>, and how Blizzard plans to experiment with the mode once again. That‚Äôs right ‚Äì the team is interested in bringing back the 12-player option nearly two years after it was swapped out for the faster-paced 5v5 mode.</p><p>‚ÄúThe community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test,‚Äù Keller says. ‚ÄúWhy not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we‚Äôre exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results.‚Äù</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/ow2-f2p-trailerthumbnail-1920x1080-1721888065622.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is re-examining the possibility of 6v6 in Overwatch 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Keller says that while the team remains focused on ironing out 5v5, it is also ‚Äúlooking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in Overwatch 2.‚Äù Even the smallest sign of 6v6 is enough to reignite interest in players who have begged for its return, but implementing these tests is not as simple as just flipping a switch. Technological challenges presented by 12-player lobbies is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome. The game director explains that, while the team is investigating a permanent performance increase across all platforms, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlarge effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish.‚Äù There‚Äôs also the issue of queue times, which could be potentially inflated across the entire Overwatch 2 experience should something like 6v6 stick around.</p><p>No matter how badly some players want 6v6 back, alterations to the Overwatch 2 formula present new challenges to overcome. Though Keller says a new iteration of Quick Play: Hacked will experiment with team assembly at some point during Season 13, it‚Äôs not exactly clear when official testing will begin. He cautions that this proposed reintroduction of 6v6 will be a long process and that today‚Äôs post is only the ‚Äústart of this conversation.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôd run the test for a few weeks and gauge interest from the community,‚Äù Keller explains when speaking on the benefit of the tests. ‚ÄúThen we‚Äôd measure the impact it had on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, Arcade, etc. We‚Äôd take the lessons from this playtest to see what we can learn about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of Overwatch. We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for. Whether that‚Äôs a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out.‚Äù</p><h2>Let‚Äôs break it down</h2><p>Overwatch launched in 2016 and has since slowly evolved into an entirely different beast. As Blizzard has worked to establish fair and fun game environments, it has added, gutted, and altered a wide variety of game modes. As noted by Keller, these changes include stricter Hero limits in Quick Play, the addition of the more rigid mode known as Role Queue, and of course, the switch to 5v5.</p><p>The original Overwatch used the 6v6 format as its go-to structure until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-will-replace-the-original-game-at-launch">the entire experience was replaced with Overwatch 2 in 2022</a>. This free-to-play sequel swapped in 5v5 matches, with Blizzard‚Äôs reasoning at the time being that it would reduce battlefield clutter and lead to a cleaner, more enjoyable experience for all three roles ‚Äì Tank, Damage, and Support. Keller stands by the decision, saying that 5v5 is ‚Äúmore cognitively manageable‚Äù than the 6v6 matchups. It also led to drastically shorter queue times in Role Queue, especially for those who queued up to play Damage Heroes.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/picture1-1721887226043.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A chart shared by Aaron Keller highlighting 5v5 and 6v6 Ranked Play queue times per role.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Keller acknowledges that 6v6 still has its upsides, and the decision to remove it was not made lightly. Still, there are those who prefer the original format to this day and have even campaigned for its return. Calls for Blizzard to include a 6v6 option reached a boiling point the last few months, with many players complaining that 5v5 is more punishing on an individual level, especially when queueing up to play Tank. With tensions in the Overwatch community rising, Blizzard has finally stepped in.</p><p>Keller has been <a href="https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teasing plans to offer more insight into Blizzard's point of view for several weeks</u></a>, and today‚Äôs post likely goes into more detail than many were expecting. However, as the director mentioned, the studio has a lot of work and listening to do before team composition tests begin, and even then, it‚Äôs unclear if these experiments will yield the results its community desires.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Overwatch 2 Season 11 Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Overwatch 2 is barreling toward the end of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-teases-transformers-collab-in-season-11-trailer">Season 11</a> of its post-launch roadmap. While details on how Season 12 will up the ante mostly remain a mystery, the studio did just wrap up a weekend playtest for its new Support Hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-reveals-newest-support-hero-and-shell-be-playable-this-weekend">Juno</a>, an agile space-themed competitor with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-voice-line-debunks-long-running-fan-theory-in-the-funniest-way-possible">interesting ties to the Overwatch universe</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Less than two years after the release of Overwatch 2, game director Aaron Keller has announced that Blizzard is now open to reversing one of the series' biggest--and most contentious--decisions: its shift to 5v5 gameplay.</p><p>Keller shared the news in his latest <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104605/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Director's Take</a>, a regular blog he publishes to help keep fans up to date on key decisions. In it, Keller explained the reasons why the studio pivoted away from Overwatch's 6v6 gameplay, as well as laid out a rough plan to implement 6v6 battles back into the game through a "series of events" most likely taking place "several seasons" down the road.</p><p>"The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test. 'Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results?' We agree, and based on your feedback, we‚Äôre exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results," Keller wrote.</p><p>If all these plans sounds a bit loose, it's because they are. As for why we don't have concrete dates or event names yet, Keller was quick to explain that the transition back to 6v6 is somewhat of a logistical nightmare for "reasons that may not be readily apparent." To attempt to explain these reasons, he offered up a "Historical Overview" of Overwatch as well as several paragraphs outlining why he believes 5v5 best suits Overwatch 2.</p><p>According to Keller, the introduction of Hero Limits--and subsequently Role Queues--in the original Overwatch played a large role in the team's decision to make Overwatch 2 5v5. Data collected by the team revealed that queue times were dramatically shorter when only ten players were needed to start a game--particularly for those playing the game's most popular role, Damage. Keller also explained that the switch was made to offer "greater individual agency" to players.</p><p>"Many times, fights in 6v6 couldn‚Äôt resolve until ultimate abilities came online. Correct that, until ultimate combos could be executed to break through two tanks worth of mitigation supported by high, uncontested healing output," Keller wrote. "The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows. One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments."</p><p>Keller went on to explain that "tank synergy wasn't always fun," and that the inclusion of two tanks on a team could "absolutely grind [a game] to a halt." Seeing as Overwatch 2 is more focused on being a fast-paced FPS now, 5v5--and the elimination of one of the game's two tank roles--felt vital to executing that idea. He also noted that it was simply harder to follow 6v6 combat, as "tracking nine other players is easier than 11." Keller called the switch to 5v5 "a bit more cognitively manageable."</p><p>Despite all of this, however, Keller admits there were plenty of things he enjoyed about 6v6, such as its charmingly chaotic energy. He also stated that the stakes perhaps felt a bit lower in 6v6, as an extra player mitigated the damage caused by someone "performing poorly." Naturally, lower stakes can lead to players experiencing more fun.</p><p>And yet, pivoting back to 6v6 doesn't seem entirely simple. The largest reason for this, Keller wrote, is that they need to implement the 6v6 tests in a way that "allows the game to have optimized technical performance (I'm referring to framerate and memory constraints) with 12 players in a match."</p><p>"There have been quite a few upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 that have an impact on the performance of the game. These range from new features like allied outlines and enabling healer vision by default, the addition of more technically demanding hero kits, as well as visual upgrades to UI, heroes and maps," Keller explained. "In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can have significant impacts for our players, causing the game to underperform on older systems. Overwatch is a fast-paced game, and maintaining a game that runs smoothly across all our platforms is important for the player‚Äôs experience. While a limited time test could arrive sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently increase performance across the game. This would be a large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish."</p><p>Keller also noted that another issue "that still gives [him] anxiety about opening this Pandora's Box" is queue times. Keller concluded that gathering data from these tests--particularly data regarding queue times, overall performance, and player feedback--will be incredibly valuable.</p><p>"We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for," Keller said. "Whether that‚Äôs a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."</p>

            <p>
Maybe you've heard of Kamala Harris; she's the current US vice president and very likely the Democratic party's official presidential nominee for November's US election. But now she's firmly back in the spotlight, the mildly curious case of her secret life in developer Remedy's 2019 action-adventure Control has resurfaced online.
</p>
<p>
You see, pinned to a whiteboard in an unassuming corner of The Oldest House - the transdimensional Brutalist office block at the heart of Control's story - is a picture of a missing 40-year-old Bureau employee, Jane Farland, lost during one of the House's shifts. Only, Photoshopped eyes aside, Jane Farland is the spitting image of Vice President Harris.
</p>
<p>
Harris' surprise secret life as a fictitious video game character has been noted before - in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/comments/d0rhzv/kamala_harris_apparently_exists_as_a_different/">five-year-old Reddit thread</a>, for instance - but the picture has started gaining traction again as Harris once again makes headlines thanks to her likely US presidential bid.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the story behind the image is a little harder to uncover. Journalist Stephen Totilo tried to get to the bottom of it as part of his latest <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, first pinpointing the image's location to a whiteboard near an elevator in Control's Central Executive hub.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/control-kamala-harris-side-by-side.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Kamala Harris vs. "Jane Farland" in Control. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Stephen Totilo/Remedy Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Totilo's attempts to get a comment from Remedy on Harris' appearance in Control have so far been met with silence (I've reached out to the developer, just in case it's feeling chattier today), but the real answer is likely to be a fairly boring one.
</p>
<p>
The image appears to be an only lightly doctored official photo from Harris' time as a US Senator. And given US government materials are generally in the public domain, Remedy would be free to use Harris' headshot if it was Googling "US federal employee in a business suit" for its missing person whiteboard (notably, Harris isn't the only real-life US senator who appears there). One eye-tweak later and - ta da! - another in-game asset is complete.
</p>
<p>
Still, if Jane Farland suddenly finds her way back to The Oldest House in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-2-still-in-proof-of-concept-stage-as-max-payne-remake-enters-production-readiness">Control 2</a> and she's <em>still</em> got Kamala Harris' face, then Remedy might have some explaining to do.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game.936894/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the biggest changes made by Blizzard to Overwatch 2 is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-pvp-5v5-maps-hero-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch</a> from 6v6 matches to 5v5. However, a sizable amount of fans of the original game remained vocal about reintroducing 6v6 in some form, and the developers are taking that feedback seriously.</p>
<p>Today, Game Director Aaron Keller explained the hurdles it'll have to overcome first. The first and biggest reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance with 12 players in a match: a number of upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 impact the game's performance. In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can significantly impact players using older systems.</p>
<p>While a time-limited Overwatch 2 test could come sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently improve performance across the entire game. This endeavor will likely take at least several seasons, said Blizzard.</p>
<p>Another issue is what to do with queue times, which was the main reason for switching from 6v6 to 5v5 in the first place. They have some ideas, but there's no guarantee they'll work. Moreover, Blizzard understandably wishes to make sure that those who enjoy the game as it is today are not frustrated by these attempts to reintroduce 6v6.</p>
<p>The current objective is to run a test for a few weeks and gauge the community's interest. Then, the developers would measure its impact on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, arcade, etc. They'd use the lessons from that playtest to see what could be learned about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of the franchise. They would carefully ponder on the learnings from each test and how they can best give players what they want. Whether that's a 5v5 world, a 6v6 world, or both will be figured out in the future.</p>
<p>In other Overwatch 2 news, the first Mythic weapon skin was <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this week, giving Reinhardt fans a cool new cosmetic to purchase.</p>

All of those changes have led to where we are today, a spot that many feel is stagnant and unenjoyable.<br></p><p>Role Queue ensures you‚Äôre not playing competitive matches with no healers (which was incredibly frustrating in the original game), but Keller acknowledges that this consistency made <em>Overwatch </em>‚Äústart to feel samey.‚Äù I‚Äôve played hundreds of hours of competitive <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and so many of my matches have blurred together into a streak of sameness. ‚ÄúCould there be an in-between version that softens the original problems without completely solving them and also isn‚Äôt quite as reactive as our current Role Queue system?‚Äù Keller wonders.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, the shift to 5v5 also somewhat flattened <em>Overwatch 2</em>‚Äôs gameplay. ‚ÄúThe world of 6v6 could have really high, highs but reaaaaally low, lows,‚Äù Keller wrote. ‚ÄúOne of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of those high moments.‚Äù The 5v5 change removed the secondary tank role, which helps prevent matches from getting stunlocked and drastically reduces queue times, but also fundamentally alters the way every single role is played.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Support players, no longer tasked with keeping two massive tanks afloat, have to be more aggressive, adding their damage to an already high-damage pool thanks to the dual DPS characters. And the tank, rather than having a secondary, or off-tank, to support them, is now the biggest hero on the field and the most likely to bear the brunt of every enemy player‚Äôs damage and utilities. Tanks now play to exist, to stay alive, rather than playmake.<br></p><p>‚ÄúHaving two [tanks] allowed one to focus on protecting their backline while the other held ground or pushed into the enemy team,‚Äù Keller writes about 6v6. ‚ÄúThe tank role had a lot of depth in understanding how to work with the other tank on the team.‚Äù And as <em>Overwatch</em> players have pointed out, so many of the tanks‚Äô existing kits are tailored for 6v6 play, which too-often renders off-tank choices like Wrecking Ball completely unviable, especially in competitive matches.<br></p><p>The struggle to balance tanks for 5v5 play has persisted for nearly two years. In June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-tank-heroes-reinhardt-buffs-rework-nerf-1851567261&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-tank-heroes-reinhardt-buffs-rework-nerf-1851567261">Blizzard admitted that</a></span> tanks were miserable to play after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">damage hero passive</a></span> weakened healing and made them feel like they were made of glass, and a subsequent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-midseason-worst-patch-mauga-tanks-1851584869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-11-midseason-worst-patch-mauga-tanks-1851584869">tank-focused patch wildly overcorrected</a></span>, making them far too powerful.<br></p><p>‚ÄúThe past year and a half has shown us that there are issues with balancing tanks for 5v5, as well [as 6v6],‚Äù the blog post reads. No shit.<br></p><h2 id="h15920"><a id=""></a><strong>Five versus six</strong></h2><p>The crux of what many players believe is the issue with the 5v5 swap is that the majority of <em>Overwatch 2</em>‚Äôs characters, maps, and modes were built for 6v6 play. Some suggest that Blizzard, rather than making major changes like nerfing shields (which would render problematic <em>Overwatch 1</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metas like pirate ship</a></span> useless), the team just pulled the second tank. Pulling that second tank removes freedom of choice for tank players and robs us of the variety of gameplay styles and approaches that comes from finding the perfect balance between two tanks.<br></p><p>It also puts more pressure on the supports to keep that singular tank afloat, while ensuring that DPS players have to choose specific heroes to counter the singular, beefed-up enemy tank. Not to mention the burden the singular tank player has to bear‚Äîif they can‚Äôt keep up with the enemy tank, matches are wildly unfun for them and their squad.<br></p><p>Warring team composition factions within the <em>Overwatch </em>community are nearly split right down the middle, as evidenced by a March poll from former OWL esports player Jake Lyon, in which 51.9% of players said they preferred 5v5 to the original 6v6 supporters‚Äô 48.1%. That almost-even split tells me one thing: this is more about personal preference than what is objectively better, as there are downsides to both formats. As Keller writes in the blog, ‚ÄúOur players have different opinions and preferences about the ideal number of players in an <em>Overwatch</em> match, and so does our team.‚Äù</p><p>For more flexible, top-down players, 5v5 is a perfectly fine experience, as they can easily swap between any character in their role‚Äôs roster to ensure the match is a success. For people like myself, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-moira-hero-tips-guide-tricks-1851392060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-moira-hero-tips-guide-tricks-1851392060">former Moira one-trick</a></span> who expanded her support roster to five or so solid picks, 5v5 can feel incredibly limiting‚Äîand therefore frustrating. As Keller and others have made clear, there are pros and cons to both versions of <em>Overwatch</em>‚Äôs core multiplayer mode. There‚Äôs no singular, simplistic solution to this problem that Blizzard has inadvertently created.</p><figure id="" data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h15921"><a id=""></a><strong>Now what?</strong></h2><p>Keller‚Äôs blog post is clear: Blizzard is ‚Äúfocused on making 5v5 the best experience that it can be.‚Äù But, the team is also ‚Äúopen-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback.‚Äù As we‚Äôve seen in the last year or so, Blizzard has experimented with gameplay changes in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812">Quick Play: Hacked mode</a></span>, including increasing the speed of objective captures and payload movement (a change it ultimately kept in the game). An upcoming Quick Play: Hacked will experiment with team comps in ways ‚Äúthat aren‚Äôt quite as rigid as set composition but not as loose as Open Queue.‚Äù But what about 6v6?<br></p><p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at running a series of events to try out different core team composition formats in <em>Overwatch 2</em>,‚Äù Keller promises. He doesn‚Äôt outline what those events will be or what they‚Äôll entail, but I don‚Äôt envy the work Blizzard will have to do if it plans on implementing 6v6 in any form. As much as myself and other disgruntled <em>Overwatch</em> players would like to think it‚Äôs as simple as offering both 6v6 and 5v5 Quickplay and Competitive modes, there is a lot going on under the hood that could break.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em>‚Äôs updated UI and improved graphics could creak and strain with the addition of two more heroes in each match, and changes made to hero‚Äôs kits could feel either perfectly balanced or wildly off depending on whether you‚Äôre in a 5v5 or 6v6 match. And Keller voices concerns with ‚Äúopening Pandora‚Äôs box‚Äù when it comes to queue times, which will likely increase with the inclusion of an extra player on your squad. ‚ÄúThe team was not able to solve this problem previously,‚Äù he admits. But would 6v6 loyalists even care that they have to wait longer to get their preferred game mode back?<br></p><p>This latest Director‚Äôs Take promises that ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt the last time [Blizzard will] be getting into 5v5 or 6v6,‚Äù so I‚Äôm sure the debate will continue on for many more months. I just want to get out of gold in support, please. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Want to find a career in the world of esports? With competitive video games constantly on the rise, more and more career options within the field are opening up. But is esports a good career? And what type of career options are there in competitive video games? In this guide, we‚Äôre breaking down everything that you need to know about getting a job in esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-find-a-good-career-in-esports">Can You Find a Good Career In Esports?</h2>



<p>New career options in esports are popping up every day. As the industry continues to grow, people are beginning to find new roles that need to be accompanied. Let‚Äôs not forget that a career in competitive video games is relatively new, meaning there is still so much for us to learn about it.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Is working in esports a good career move? Or is it just a failure waiting to happen? Well, it depends on what section of esports you are looking to create a career in.</p>







<h2 id="h-esport-career-options">Esport Career Options</h2>



<p>There are plenty of career options in esports. Many do not require a college degree ‚Äì most personalities and experts working in esports got there without any formal qualification <strong>in an esports capacity</strong>. It can be tough to make a living in some roles though, and salaries are typically a little lower than in closely competing career paths.</p>



<p>For instance, holding a career as a professional player is incredibly difficult. It‚Äôs the same as being a professional athlete. You have to take care of yourself while also devoting your life to whatever game you play. And still, you are not guaranteed a spot at the top. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, many other career options in competitive gaming could be considered suitable for those without top-tier gaming skills. It‚Äôs not all about the players, after all ‚Äì an esports career can be quite diverse. Finding the best career in esports, though, is subjective, as it just matters what type of skillsets you can bring to the table.</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of different esports careers:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Esports Journalist</li>



<li>Esports Caster</li>



<li>Tournament Coordinator</li>



<li>Player Manager</li>



<li>Team Manager</li>



<li>PR for an Esports Organization</li>



<li>HR for an Esports Organization</li>



<li>Broadcast Director</li>



<li>Broadcast Worker</li>



<li>Event Worker</li>



<li>Esports Marketing</li>



<li>Content Creator</li>
</ul>



<p>While this is a broad list of esports careers, there are still many other options out there that may not even seem plausible. Over the last ten years or so, the industry has blossomed, and around the world, there are <strong>thousands </strong>of esports job opportunities.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-an-esports-career">How To Get An Esports Career</h2>



<p>Figuring out how to find a job in esports can be quite difficult. There are very few colleges offering esports-related degrees at the moment, meaning many people will have to get their foot in the door elsewhere.</p>



<p>Luckily, many degrees such as PR, Marketing, Business Management and more can easily help you find a job in the world of esports. The only issue, though, is many jobs are hoping you have some sort of experience relating to competitive video games. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>So, how do you get that experience? How does someone get a career in esports? Well, making connections is a great place to start. Go to events, meet people, create a presence online, and start creating your own esports-related content or blogs. Hiring managers want to see dedication towards the industry when they sit down to interview you.</p>



<p>Sure, you may get lucky and get hired in the world of esports after being fresh out of college with just a basic marketing degree, but if you can show a future employer that you have already begun to make a name for yourself in the industry, then you will have a much better chance at receiving a job.</p>



<h2 id="h-ultimately-is-esports-a-good-career">Ultimately, Is Esports a Good Career?</h2>



<p>This is one of those verticals that‚Äôs getting more popular all the time, so it‚Äôs of course becoming more competitive. Trends are emerging, requiring jobseekers to seek higher qualifications for jobs in esports, and many roles want multifaceted employees who have transferable skills in several areas. For instance, you could be a Social Media Manager for an esports organisation, but they‚Äôd want you to have photo and video editing experience, community management experience, and even qualifications or experience in journalism ‚Äì or <strong>psychology</strong>.</p>



<p>With that being said, esports is a good career choice because it‚Äôs so dynamic, and you‚Äôll be working at the forefront of one of the most exciting industries in the technical world. Everyone working in esports is spearheading the growth of the industry, and hundreds of millions of fans have their eyes fixed firmly on everything that happens within it.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre happy accepting a lower-than-average salary and working a little harder to stay innovative and dynamic, then yes, esports is a good career ‚Äì it also helps if you <strong>love </strong>competitive gaming.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Is a Great Start For Newcomers | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>This is a stark contrast to EA's previous games, which required players to have the EA app to play on PC. However, the game will still need players to agree to a third-party EULA, as noted by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>. This year, there was particular blowback with other publishers requiring third-party accounts to play Steam games, most notably with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">Helldivers 2</a>.</p><p>BioWare also said that it will be providing more details about the game's launch later this summer. It's due out sometime this fall for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. So far, there's been quite a bit info out there about the game, including it having a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-no-death-setting/1100-6524662/" data-ref-id="1100-6524662">no-death option</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-explains-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-not-open-world/1100-6524197/" data-ref-id="1100-6524197">being mission-based rather than open-world</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-gonna-show-a-lot-of-skin/1100-6524909/" data-ref-id="1100-6524909">apparently a lot of nudity</a>.</p>

The demo lets you take on Gonzo, a boss who you can either kill or spare.</p><p> Team Ninja has confirmed that progress from the demo can be carried over into the main game if you decide to buy<em> Rise of the Ronin</em> and keep playing. </p><p>Former <em>Kotaku </em>writer Levi Winslow was mostly positive about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rise-ronin-ps5-game-review-team-ninja-soulslike-1851355751&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rise-ronin-ps5-game-review-team-ninja-soulslike-1851355751"><em>Rise of the Ronin</em> in their review</a></span> from earlier this year, even though the game has dated visuals and some lackluster writing. From Winslow‚Äôs review: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I‚Äôm here for everything <em>Rise of the Ronin</em> is serving because I‚Äôm still having a great time with Team Ninja‚Äôs latest game. I‚Äôm enjoying the combat, which is approachable, deep, and varied. I‚Äôm enjoying the setting, which is inspired by IRL events I‚Äôve studied for years. I‚Äôm enjoying the characters, all of whom are three-dimensional and memorable. (I‚Äôve teared up a few times when some of my fave characters died.) Hell, I‚Äôm even enjoying the uninspired side content simply because I get to swing my sword. </p><p>For better and worse, <em>Rise of the Ronin</em> is Team Ninja‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreatest Hits‚Äù RPG. There might be a dud or two in the tracklist, but on the whole, this record‚ÄîI mean, game‚Äîbangs.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Larian Studios has successfully resolved the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-been-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dice-rolling issue</a>, and as a result, the highly anticipated Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 patch 7 closed beta is now live exclusively on Steam. If you‚Äôre one of the fortunate players chosen, you can find the link to download the playtest in your Steam Library.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The developers have also requested players not to share spoilers from the new update, as most players cannot access the closed beta. The beta test is an ongoing process, and you still have the chance to sign up, as Larian will be adding more players throughout this period. Keep an eye on your Steam Library for updates. If you were among the lucky few selected, you can compare notes with other participants through this Discord server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several players in the comment section have posted screenshots for their invites for Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3 patch 7 closed beta. Some can access the beta directly through the game‚Äôs Steam store page; others have received a special invite email. The ones that couldn‚Äôt get in the first time shouldn‚Äôt lose hope, as Larian might randomly select them when letting in another batch of players. Also, the developers have confirmed that the closed beta is unavailable for console players.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition is now widely available to play via GeForce Now across various platforms.<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-has-been-integrated-in-xbox-game-pages-premium-memberships-are-discounted-and-theres-new-games-too/"> GeForce NOW</a> already has an expansive library, but now this iconic classic has made its way into it. Along with Skyrim, eight other games will be joining the library.</p>
<p>If you play The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim through GeForce NOW, you can stream it to your device without worrying about your specs. This includes your laptop, a MacBook, and even a Chromebook.</p>
<p>Those who are members of GeForce NOW will get access to a new reward if they participate in the World of Warships challenges, which will be available until July 30. By doing so, you can earn a GeForce NOW one-day priority code each day.</p>
<p>Along with the nine games added to the GeForce NOW library, the summer sale is still available. Those interested in purchasing the Ultimate and Priority memberships can get 50% off their subscription.</p>
<p>While there is the option for a free subscription, the options are limited, allowing you to play for an hour at a time. If you <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/how-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay for the Priority subscription</a>, you can play up to 6 hours per session with 60 FPS. If you want a premium experience, the Ultimate subscription allows you to play for 8 hours at a time with up to 240 FPS.</p>
<p>By connecting to your Steam, Epic Games, Ubisoft, EA Origin, or even a GOG account, you will have access to a library of games that you can stream to your setup.</p>
<p>The latest games to be added to the library are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cataclismo (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>CONSCRIPT (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>F1 Manager 2024 (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 6 (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition (Available on Steam, Epic Games Store, and PC Game Pass)</li>
<li>Gang Beasts (Available on Steam and PC Game Pass)</li>
<li>Kingdoms and Castles (Steam)</li>
<li>The Settlers: New Allies (Steam)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those unfamiliar with how GeForce NOW works, it doesn't offer games to play. The games listed are now compatible with GeForce NOW, and if you already own them, you will be able to play them using a GeForce NOW rig. This is important to remember if you're considering subscribing but don't have a games library of your own across any platforms. Any of the compatible GeForce NOW games will need to be purchased unless specified as Free to Play.</p>

The forbidden city of Akratya is an unforgiving land that cannot be conquered alone. Bind with fallen warriors found throughout your crusade and dynamically transform between characters seamlessly in mid-combat with the unique four-hero party system.</p><p>The fallen are individual characters with their own unique skill sets, combat styles, and rich history. By absorbing their essence, you inherit the fiber of their very being. Conflicts and synergies between characters greatly impact gameplay, so relationships must be balanced. Strong synergies may offer combat buffs that can spell disaster for the ruthless boss awaiting your steel and magic.</p><p>Throughout combat, you will charge a sync meter shared across all characters. During an opportune moment, dispel your sync meter and unleash a devastating Morphstrike using the combined power of the bound fallen warriors. When faced with a formidable abomination, a precisely executed Morphstrike can be the deciding factor between life and death.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The world of <em>Deathbound</em> has been lovingly crafted and influenced by the developer‚Äôs homeland of Brazil, a vibrant culture brimming with life, creativity, rhythm, and a rich history. From the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira to the sweeping music cascading through Akratya, Trialforge‚Äôs origins shine throughout every aspect of <em>Deathbound</em>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Deathbound</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277130/Deathbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a title="Companies > Epic Games [339 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store, <a href="https://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/deathbound" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> on August 8.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Phantom Blade Zero is an upcoming PS5 and PC action-RPG that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-blade-0-brings-stylish-swordfighting-to-ps5/1100-6514520/" data-ref-id="1100-6514520">made waves</a> at a 2023 PlayStation Showcase thanks to its impressive combat and striking dark fantasy aesthetic. In a recent interview, the director of the game--known by the moniker "Soulframe"-- compared its map and level design to the pre-Elden Ring Dark Souls games, though he stressed that it's not a "Souls-like."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1753231124409807047" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Phantom Blade Zero ‚ÄúYear of the Dragon‚Äù special trailer: Rain and Blood is now officially released!

"You move around and explore in a seamless map, it's just not a huge open-world map. But every region is connected together seamlessly‚Ä¶There are certain gates requiring keys, and the keys are obtained from some missions. There's still some process you go through, but it's non-linear. There are always multiple paths you can go through. It's just like the Souls games before Elden Ring."</p><p dir="ltr">Dark Souls 1 in particular is often praised for its highly interconnected world design, where players can choose to take a variety of paths through Lordran--provided that they're skilled enough to deal with the difficult enemies, of course. Based on the trailers we've seen, Phantom Blade Zero has fluid, propulsive combat similar to what you might see in the Ninja Gaiden games. It also might remind you of Koei Tecmo's Nioh series, or 2024 release Rise of the Ronin. Phantom Blade Zero doesn't have a release date yet, but we do know that a 30-minute <a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1753231124409807047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">playable demo</a> is on the way sometime in 2024.</p>
