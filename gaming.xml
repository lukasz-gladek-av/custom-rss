            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-shareholder-qa<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its latest shareholder Q&amp;A summary, and while some of the questions asked by shareholders are perfectly sane and sensible, there are some that truly beggar belief.</p>
<p>The summary&nbsp;gives Capcom shareholders a chance to ask the company pertinent questions about its operations, and if you ask me, some of those questions truly demonstrate that some Capcom shareholders don't appear to know the first thing about video games or how they're made.</p>
<p>One shareholder, for instance, asks Capcom whether it wouldn't be more prudent, from a profit perspective, to bump the release date of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>up from 2025 to "the December 2024 holiday season". Why didn't every other studio ever think of that?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-shareholder-qa-slope.jpg?itok=CundxPcY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-shareholder-qa-slope.jpg?itok=1zsQ8zqk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A Capcom shareholder wants to know why Capcom doesn't just release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>earlier. Genius!</figcaption></figure><p>The studio's response is characteristically patient. Capcom simply says that it will announce&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' release date "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom">once preparations are complete</a>" and reiterates the studio's commitment to a goal of 10% or better profit growth each year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, another shareholder asks whether the gaming giant has thought about engaging in a share buyback scheme in order to ensure "the current share price is appropriate" and that share prices aren't "simply left to the market".</p>
<p>Capcom's response to this question is fairly stock; it says that it typically engages in share buyback schemes and the like "after comprehensively considering several factors". Given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">state of the industry right now</a>, I can't say I'm particularly sad Capcom doesn't seem to have any plans in this direction.</p>
<p>One shareholder asks Capcom about whether&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>will be limited to "non-portable consoles", which is, on the surface, a reference to the Switch, but which could also be read as an attempt to perhaps tease some information out regarding the Switch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-talked-about successor</a>. No such luck, sadly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mega-man-11-capcom-shareholder-qa.jpg?itok=yv4g3OeI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mega-man-11-capcom-shareholder-qa.jpg?itok=T98Tl-vn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom says it's "considering" how to make more&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Some shareholders have some pretty pertinent questions for Capcom. One asks about what's in the pipeline for&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>, for instance, to which the studio responds that it is "considering how to create games" for the franchise.</p>
<p>Another wonders why Capcom hasn't made a cozy game yet, and while I can't say I'm personally sad about this, I can't deny there would be a significant market for it. Who doesn't want to chill with a cute Palico in Raccoon City?</p>
<p>It's worth reading the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/assets/pdf/stock/2024capcom_d.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full shareholder Q&amp;A</a> if you want to see what kind of issues the shareholders hold close to their hearts, and also if you want to know why shareholders probably shouldn't be allowed any kind of creative control over games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/team-folon-tease-fallout-londons-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/team-folon-tease-fallout-london%E2%80%99s-release.935574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/team-folon-tease-fallout-londons-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just over a year ago, Team FOLON uploaded a video of the song "I Just Can't Wait (For Tomorrow)" to their YouTube channel, which will be heard on the Fallout: London radio in-game. As of today, the developers behind the expansive mod posted this song on their Discord server, which is home to over 50,000 members with only a handful of moderators to take care of the entire server.</p>
<p>Since they posted this, fans are excitedly waiting for the release of Fallout: London, which is expected to be released tomorrow, as the song suggests. However, they have not officially confirmed a date, so this is speculation.</p>
<p>The Fallout: London mod is a complete overhaul of Fallout 4, allowing players to explore a brand-new universe in a familiar game. The mod is hosted by GOG.com, and players can access it from the GOG mod launcher. This mod takes players through many different boroughs of London, each with unique traits and aesthetics.</p>
<p>The mod introduces some very well-known voices to breathe life into the characters of the mod, such as Neil Newbon from Baldur's Gate 3, Colin Baker from Doctor Who, and John Bercow, who was Speaker of the House of Commons from 2009 to 2019, and is now reprising his role as a Speaker in Fallout: London.</p>
<p>With the release of the next-gen update for Fallout 4, players who have purchased the game through the Epic Games Store <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-confirms-fallout-london-wont-be-playable-through-epic-games-store-versions-of-fallout-4/">can no longer access</a> the mod unless it is purchased directly through Steam or the GOG.com store. This is because players must be able to roll back the Next Gen update, which resulted in Team FOLON having to redo the coding for the mod entirely, as it isn't compatible with the Next Gen update. However, the current version of the mod is compatible with the game pre-update. As it stands, Team FOLON is working on a version of the mod that will be compatible with the Next Gen update, but it may take a while for that to be realized, as they found out at the very last second about the update being released.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://fallout4london.com/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FAQ</a> listed on the official Fallout: London website, players must make a new save entirely to explore the mod in full, as pre-existing quests that players will have completed in their previous save can cause issues with the mod.</p>
<p>If the Fallout: London Discord post is true, it means that the full release of Fallout: London is just around the corner for excited players to get stuck into.</p>

<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced a beta test for the PlayStation 5, enabling players to access new features such as personalized 3D audio profiles, remote play settings, and adaptive charging for their controllers. Learn more about these features and how to sign up for the PS5 beta below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enrolling in the PS5 beta is an exclusive opportunity. It will only be available for invited participants in select countries and will be released globally shortly. The players who are selected for the beta will receive an email invitation on July 25. However, some features showcased during the beta test may not make the Final Cut.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-personalized-3d-audio-profiles">Personalized 3D Audio Profiles</h2>



<p>This new feature allows players to create a personalized 3D audio profile for headphones and earbuds. Players invited to the PS5 beta can run sound quality tests to analyze many factors to create an audio profile that best suits their hearing characteristics. For example, players will have a “better sense of the positions of characters and objects in a game world more clearly than before,” which helps enhance immersion.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To access this feature, players must go to Settings, Sound, and 3D Audio headphones on the PS5 console. Then, follow the steps on the screen to create and save their audio profile. Players can create one audio profile per user and also select from the 3D Audio presets if they wish to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-remote-play-settings">Remote Play Settings</h2>



<p>The PS5 Beta also adds new Remote Play settings per user, allowing them to choose individuals to connect to their console through this feature. To access the features, head to Settings, System, Remote Play, and Enable Remote Play. Here, you can choose which users you want to enable access to.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-adaptive-charging-for-ps5-controllers">Adaptive Charging for PS5 Controllers</h2>



<p>Players should know that this feature is only available for the beta testers using the latest PS5 console, which comes with a detachable disc drive. Adaptive charging for DualSense wireless controller, DualSense Edge wireless controller, PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, and Access controller players can save power “by adjusting the time that power is supplied to your controller based on its battery level”.</p>



<p>This saves power and contributes to a more eco-friendly gaming experience. Players must enable this feature through the Features Available in Rest Mode menu and change the Supply Power to USB ports as Adaptive.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-producer-says-game-wont-be-another-run-of-the-mill-anime-fighter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>During Anime Expo 2024, Bandai Namco shocked fans by announcing a brand new 3D fighting game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-new-bandai-namco-fighting-game-trailer-anime-expo"><u>Bleach Rebirth of Souls</u></a>. Much like Bandai Namco’s other hotly-anticipated anime fighter, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hands-off-preview-and-new-details-revealed-at-gamescom-latam"><u>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</u></a>, it's been well over a decade since we’ve last seen a Bleach game, and expectations for it are understandably at an all-time high.  </p><p>Piggybacking off Bleach Rebirth of Soul’s newly released gameplay trailer, which saw a recreation of Ichigo Kurosaki’s battle against Byakuya Kuchiki, IGN spoke with producer Katsuaki Tsuzuki about how the game will differentiate itself from other titles in the series and what players can expect out of its swordplay-centric combat once it releases on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.</p><p>Anime arena fighters have a track record of having a short shelf life in players' minds, in part because their gameplay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-deserves-more-than-run-of-the-mill-arena-fighters"><u>tends to lack depth</u></a> beyond the bread-and-butter strategies that are sussed out within the honeymoon period of their release. Tsuzuki says Rebirth of Souls will distinguish itself from the pack by incorporating the anime’s intricate power systems into the DNA of its gameplay, resulting in an enthralling ebb and flow of mechanically-rich battles. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“While developing the game as a fighting action game, we delved into details from Bleach like reishi, konpaku, spiritual power, and spiritual pressure. After looking into that, we were surprised by how the worldview had been created in detail and how well those features aligned with our game concept and the fighting action genre," Tsuzuki said.</p><p>"For example, konpaku, which represents the concept of the soul in Bleach, is constructed with reishi. Drawing inspiration from that concept, we set reishi as a health gauge in the game, and players can break the konpaku to decrease reishi," he added." We introduced systems that allow players to experience reversals such as breaking konpaku with a single strike or enhancing power through transformations to facilitate breaks.” </p><p>In action game layman's terms, Rebirth of Soul’s combat is like a pastiche Sekiro’s stagger swordplay, Tekken 7 reversals, and Smash Bros. Ultimate’s stock health bar system, wherein players win battles by destroying an opponent’s 9 stocks or konpaku. Although Tsuzuki referred to established action games like the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jojos-bizarre-adventure-all-star-battle-r-review">JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle R</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/02/tekken-7-review">Tekken 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/22/dragon-ball-fighterz-review">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> when making Rebirth of Souls, Rebirth of Souls feel authentically Bleach to fans new and old.</p><p>"I know that Bleach is loved by fans worldwide, so I have been eager for the opportunity to work with this IP," Tsuzuki says. "We know that there is strong enthusiasm from Bleach fans, and I wanted to develop a new Bleach game for modern high-spec platforms, especially since it is also around the timing of the 20th anniversary of Bleach."</p><h2>A balanced shonen fighting game</h2><p>Arguably the most difficult challenge in making Rebirth of Souls was integrating major tenets of the anime’s unique power systems. While Rebirth of Souls’ naming conventions may prove intimidating to prospective players on first blush, Tsuzuki stressed that players won’t be required to have an overfamiliarity with Bleach’s encyclopedic power structure to enjoy the game and eke out a victory. Rebirth of Souls will also come with a comprehensive in-game play guide, tutorials, and a user-friendly battle UI to make it easy to understand, akin to standard action games to ensure first-time players aren’t lost in the sauce of Bleach’s unique flavor of shonen anime power schemes.  </p><p>In contrast to Sparking! Zero, whose producer hinted that the game would reflect the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-delightfully-unbalanced-and-definitely-not-an-esports-game-so-the-devs-had-to-find-a-unique-approach-to-ranked-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>anime ensemble’s power scaling with unbalanced battles</u></a>, Rebirth of Souls characters were designed to have an equal win rate with another. </p><p>“Our game concept revolves around the reversal experience and each character is really unique, especially their zanpakuto [the weapons wielded by Bleach's Shinigami], which offers multifaceted abilities,” Tsuzuki said. “Each character retains distinct features: some characters excel in speed, while others focus on heavy power, and some are good at attacking from distance. </p><p>“Additionally, each character can enhance their abilities through Awakening. In that regard, some characters are easy to handle, even for casual gamers, while others cater more [to] core action gamers,” Tsuzuki added. “However, every character has the chance to reverse the situation, ensuring that all have an equal chance to win.”</p><p>Historically, Bleach has been noticeably out of the gaming zeitgeist in comparison to its fellow “big three” shonen contemporaries, Naruto and One Piece. As mentioned earlier, it's been 13 years since Bleach characters have graced a video game—that is if you don’t count their appearance in 2019’s anime Oscars-esque arena fighter, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/jump-force-review"><u>Jump Force</u></a>. The last fully-fledged Bleach game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/28/bleach-soul-resurreccion-review"><u>Bleach: Soul Resurrección</u></a> for the PlayStation 3. Bleach: Soul Resurreccion received <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/07/28/bleach-soul-resurreccion-review"><u>middling reviews from critics including our own</u></a>, where we said the game had a simple yet enjoyable Dynasty Warriors-esque combat system that players wouldn’t be missing out on if they passed it up.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls - Announcement Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As far as the “big three” are concerned time hasn’t slowed down their output of games with recently released titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naruto-x-boruto-ultimate-ninja-storm-connections-review"><u>Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-piece-odyssey-review"><u>One Piece: Odyssey </u></a>— a classic turn-based action RPG that Tsuzuki produced. When approaching Bleach Rebirth of Souls, Tsuzuki said the upcoming anime action game will be an exception to the trend of anime action games by having a combat system that is as complex as its beautifully rendered 3D models.</p><p>“Each of the previous Bleach games published by the other companies have different features and all of them capture the charm of Bleach. The development team played these games before starting the development of Bleach Rebirth of Souls and really enjoyed them. We learned the core features of Bleach like bankai, and integrated them into the necessary components of an action game,” Tsuzuki said. “Thanks to the capabilities of new-generation platforms, we tried to create a Bleach game that delivers cutting-edge visual expression in battle.”</p><p>Although Bleach has one of the largest casts of characters in shonen anime with more personalities and power sets being introduced in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-thousand-year-blood-war-part-3-will-air-in-october-2024">Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War, </a>— the anime's sequel series which adapts the manga's final arc — Rebirth of Souls will only feature characters from the anime’s first two story arcs, Soul Reaper and Arrancar arc. </p><p>“This is the first Bleach game that Bandai as a company is introducing and it's been a while since the last game was introduced so we thought that it would be great to introduce these characters from the original [arc] to the Arrancar time period and introduce the history of these characters, how they met, and how battles have taken place,” Tsuzuki said. </p><p>Fans can look forward to more updates like Rebirth of Souls playable character roster in the future as the game inches closer to its yet-to-be-announced release date.</p><p><em>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-only-accessibility-option-is-its-fantastic-open-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been two years since I traversed The Lands Between. Two years since I became Elden Lord. Two years since I beat a game that I now consider one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. And now, with Shadow of the Erdtree, I’m once again reminded why Elden Ring is a masterpiece, despite some accessibility flaws.</p><p>For this Access Designed, I’m going to talk about how Shadow of the Erdtree is nothing short of incredible – it’s more of the same game that left me in awe of its combat, open world, and inclusive design. Yet, despite following the same formula of vast landscapes dotted with optional, difficult content, nothing substantial is brought forth to increase FromSoftware’s latest title’s accessibility.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/21/eldenringthumb-1708528702214.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The open world structure of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, while not explicity an accessibility feature, is nontheless a good example of inclusive design.</figcaption></figure></output><h2>Exploration and Discovery</h2><p>Shadow of the Erdtree’s introduction immediately transports players to the Land of Shadow, an area that rivals Limgrave in its size. It’s an understatement to say that it’s massive and occasionally overwhelming with direction and choice. As is common with the Eden Ring base game, players are given no guidance on where to go. A glowing white castle that leads to a giant divine lion puppet, a castle that mirrors the Raya Lucaria Academy, and empty fields filled with huge dead birds and a giant flaming golem are immediately present, and it’s up to you to decide what you want to tackle first. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For physically disabled players that struggle with fatigue, it’s entirely possible to save a troublesome boss for later or even skip it altogether. </p></div><p>Naturally, I ignored all of these and traveled into a pleasant forest where a naked man named Logur, the Beast Claw killed me 10 times over. Rather than give up and move to a different section, I stubbornly fought Logur until I defeated him, claiming his Beast Claw weapon as my prize. This was my first foray into Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><p>Do I recommend this path? Absolutely not, unless you want to try the new Beast Claw weapon type. However, my questionable decision demonstrates one of the best inclusive design practices of Elden Ring – optional content. Much like the base game, players are not required to fight many of the bosses. For physically disabled players that struggle with fatigue, it’s entirely possible to save a troublesome boss for later or even skip it altogether. While classic Elden Ring accessibility mechanics like summoning spirits and other players are available, many of the enemy encounters are brutal, especially when players refuse to explore and rush to progress the game.</p><h2>The Difficulty Question</h2><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is immensely tough at first, so much so that the award-winning game received mixed reviews on Steam because of the drastic spike in difficulty above that experienced in the base game. And, in true FromSoftware fashion, the game doesn’t explicitly tell you how to mitigate this jump in challenge – you need to explore to learn how. I praise Elden Ring’s exploration as a crucial accessible tool, and the DLC is no different. Yet while the design practice can ultimately be viewed as optional in the base game, it’s a mandatory requirement for the expansion. You <em>need </em>to explore. You <em>need </em>to discover items that boost you over the game’s difficulty spike.</p><p>Dotted around the massive map are Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes, two key items that act as Shadow of the Erdtree's new leveling system, called the Shadow Realm Blessing. While you are within the Land of Shadow, your traditional rune level does little, if anything, to provide buffs for combat. Instead, you must use Scadutree Fragments to boost your stats, and Revered Spirit Ashes to bolster the offenses and defenses of your spirit summons. While it’s entirely possible to beat the expansion without ever using these, nobody should ever follow this method unless they're a masochist. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/elden-ring-dancing-lion-divine-beast-1721742945977.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Divine Beast Dancing Lion is a strong and fast boss that poses a big challenge. </figcaption></figure></output><p>Prior to discovering any Fragments or Ashes, I attempted to fight the Divine Beast Dancing Lion using my magic build that could obliterate most base game bosses in under 10 seconds. After around 15 tries, the closest I came to defeating this optional boss was by bringing its health bar down to one third. My spells did pitiful damage, and my summons did nothing more than boost the Lion’s already-inflated health bar. So I left. I explored until I discovered a significant number of Fragments and Ashes, and only returned after significantly increasing by Shadow Realm Blessing levels. And while the Blessing's enhancements didn't allow my magic build to melt the Lion like it had done bosses prior, the boost to my damage, defenses, and my summon’s stats was incredibly noticeable. It allowed me to survive long enough to finally defeat the beast. The overall boss mechanics may have still mirrored the base game – I sat at the back and fired off spells while my summons distracted the boss – but I needed to explore and find specific items before succeeding.</p><h2>No New Accessibility</h2><p>Despite being a new expansion to a two-year-old game, Shadow of the Erdtree does little to increase Elden Ring’s overall accessibility. While there are new weapons, armors, spells, and talismans that you can discover that lead to new accessible playstyles, no new accessibility-focused options were added. Blind and low vision players still have nothing to assist with combat or exploration, Deaf and hard of hearing players have no new environmental subtitles or visual cues, and cognitively disabled players still need to heavily rely on extensive memorization and pattern recognition. For me, a physically disabled player, Elden Ring and its expansion are near flawless for my needs. Yet, as I continuously say, the disabled experience is incredibly vast and individualistic, meaning the inclusive designs and options like customizable controls that I regularly praise may not be enough for others.</p><p>It’s difficult to review Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree from an accessibility perspective. My thoughts remain the same from two years ago: it was my game of the year in 2022, and this expansion reignites those same feelings. However, it’s admittedly disappointing to see FromSoftware continue to fail to implement accessible tools beyond inclusive designs. Is this DLC accessible? If it wasn’t accessible for you two years ago, I can confidently say this expansion will leave you feeling disappointed. If you found the game to perfectly suit your accessible needs before, then I encourage you to once again lead your Tarnished into unexplored territories. Just be sure to search for Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes.</p><p><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/x-mens-35-year-history-of-games-that-are-wildly-hit-and-miss<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The X-Men may be one of the biggest superhero franchises in the world, but these mutant freedom fighters haven’t always had the best track record when it comes to video games. X-fans the world over are still feeling the sting of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/10/01/x-men-destiny-review">the massive disappointment that was 2011’s X-Men: Destiny</a>. But that’s not to say there haven’t been some truly excellent Marvel games over the years that have prominently featured Marvel’s merry mutants. And with Hugh Jackman’s Logan finally making his MCU debut in Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, there’s no better time to celebrate that gaming legacy. </p><p>From early winners like X-Men: The Arcade Game and X-Men: Children of the Atom to the fan-favorite X-Men Legends series, here’s a look back at the X-Men games that have captured what we love about these colorful yet tragic heroes.</p><h2>The Early X-Men Games</h2><p>By the beginning of the 1980s, the X-Men had risen from forgotten C-List Marvel team to arguably the biggest franchise in comics. Heroes like Wolverine, Storm and Cyclops became as recognizable to comics fans as Batman and Spider-Man. But despite this explosive growth, Marvel was surprisingly slow to capitalize on the X-Men’s newfound popularity outside the comics themselves. Only at the end of the decade did the X-Men begin dipping their toes into the gaming waters.</p><p>1989’s Uncanny X-Men for the NES has the distinction of being the very first X-Men game… and not much else. The game allowed players to take control of a wide variety of mutant heroes in a top-down action-adventure setting. However, it proved to be punishingly difficult, to say nothing of the fact that the final level is only accessible by a secret code. Uncanny X-Men is often lumped in among the worst NES games of all time. Not an auspicious start for the X-Men’s gaming career.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/nes-wolverine-1684956720483-1721789916073.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: TheCoverProject.net</figcaption></figure></output><p>1991’s Wolverine wasn’t much better. That game proved to be a somewhat more traditional side-scroller, pitting Logan against his nemeses Sabretooth and Magneto. But any game that revolves around Logan scarfing down hamburgers to unsheathe his claws like some sort of bloodthirsty J. Wellington Wimpy has missed the mark. </p><p>Both Wolverine and Uncanny X-Men struggled with a problem that’s hounded superhero games over the years. How do you properly represent the X-Men’s powers in an interactive setting? How do you allow Wolverine to unleash his berserker fury and incredible healing without tying those powers to limited energy meters and punishing players for using them too often? It would be a long time before developers truly overcame that hurdle.    </p><h2>Welcome to Die: The X-Men Hit the Arcade</h2><p>It fell on Konami to give Marvel fans their first great X-Men gaming experience. 1992’s X-Men followed the same side-scrolling beat-em-up formula that made Konami’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Simpsons arcade games such a blast. But X-Men had an extra trick up its sleeve, cramming in a double-wide monitor and no fewer than six sets of joysticks so that gamers could team up and control the full team - Wolverine, Colossus, Storm, Nightcrawler, Cyclops and Dazzler - simultaneously.</p><p>X-Men didn’t necessarily reinvent the arcade brawler wheel. Like its many brethren, the goal was simply to move from left to right, pummeling wave after wave of Sentinels, Reavers and other foes until making it to the boss battle. And like many X-Men games, it penalized players for using the X-Men’s mutant powers by tying them to the characters’ health meters. But with its large, colorful sprites and its deep roster of X-Men villains (including Magneto, Pyro, Mystique and The Blob), the game scratched that comic book itch. And who could forget Magneto’s most iconic catchphrase - “Welcome to Die!!!”?</p><p>Sadly, unlike TMNT, X-Men never got a sequel of any kind. It probably didn’t help that the game was based on the short-lived Pryde of the X-Men cartoon, hitting the same year X-Men: The Animated Series catapulted the franchise in a much different and more successful direction. But the silver lining is that X-Men ‘97 recently paid homage to the arcade game with the episode “Motendo.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The X-Men Get Their Genesis On   </h2><p>The X-Men may have found success in the arcade, but their track record on home consoles remained pretty spotty in the early ‘90s. No matter which version of 1992’s Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade’s Revenge you played, the experience was pretty underwhelming.</p><p>1993’s X-Men on the Sega Genesis proved to be the first ray of light on the horizon. While not a huge departure from past X-Men games, the vibrant graphics and stylized music were a definite step up, taking full advantage of the newfound power the Genesis brought to the table. Some of the old flaws remained, however. This was another extremely difficult action platformer, and the various mutant powers, be they Wolverine’s claws or Nightcrawler’s teleportation, were tied to rapidly depleting special meters.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/xmen1993-1648585311013-1684956630662-1721790003410.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Fortunately, the 1995 sequel, X-Men 2: Clone Wars, improved on that formula and established itself as arguably the best of the Genesis/SNES era. Clone Wars shook things up by allowing free, unlimited use of the X-Men’s powers and offering gamers a wide cast of playable heroes whose respective powers significantly affected the gameplay. Even Magneto was playable this time around. The game also benefited from a much more robust story that drew heavily from the contemporary X-Men comics.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the SNES got one gem of an X-Men game to compete with the Genesis titles. 1994’s X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse offered its own spin on the side-scrolling action formula, benefitting from colorful graphics and a large ensemble cast of mutant heroes. Mutant Apocalypse wasn’t as brutally difficult as its peers, making for an all-around enjoyable experience and the pinnacle of X-Men gaming on home consoles up to that point. But a new hope was brewing in the arcade… </p><h2>How Capcom Cracked the Code</h2><p>If Capcom only published X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse, they’d still deserve a special place in the hearts of Marvel fans. But the publisher’s real success story came in bringing these colorful heroes back to the arcade and forging an entirely new fighting game franchise.</p><p>1994’s X-Men: Children of the Atom built on the foundation of other Capcom fighting game series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers, but with an extra layer of over-the-top action that befits the X-Men. The game featured a wide cast of heroes and villains, each with their own playstyle and special moves. Who can forget Wolverine’s Berserker Barrage or Iceman’s Ice Boulder?</p><p>Speaking of special moves, Children of the Atom tapped into the X-Men’s mutant abilities like no game before it. As in Clone Wars, no longer did players have to worry about depleting a special meter just to slash claws or fire off an optic blast. Instead, the game hinged on a combo system where players could build up energy to unleash devastating special attacks. Finally, the X-Men played like real superheroes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Finally, the X-Men played like real superheroes.</p></div><p>Children of the Atom was also undoubtedly the most attractive X-Men game released to date, with large, colorful sprites that instantly appealed to fans of the comics and animated series. And with many of the animated series’ iconic voice actors reprising their roles, Children of the Atom had all the nerd cred it needed to be an arcade hit.</p><p>And it was definitely a hit. Children of the Atom spawned numerous follow-ups, such as 1995’s Marvel Super Heroes and 1996’s X-Men vs. Street Fighter. That latter crossover paved the way for the even more popular Marvel vs. Capcom franchise. By the time 2000’s Marvel vs. Capcom 2 rolled around, gamers were building teams of three fighters pulled from a roster of dozens of fan-favorite characters. Who could ever have imagined we’d see Wolverine fighting alongside Jill Valentine and Mega Man? </p><p>Sadly, the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise has run out of steam in recent years, with 2017’s Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite disappointing most fans. To add insult to injury, that sequel didn’t even feature any X-Men characters. Talk about forgetting where you came from.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The X-Men Become Legendary</h2><p>By the time the 2000s rolled around, the X-Men had more or less found their footing in the gaming world. Fans had several decent action platformers from which to choose, as well as Capcom’s bombastic fighting games. But with home consoles rapidly growing in power and complexity, the time had come to up the ante and show players what it really felt like to don some spandex and battle the Brotherhood of Mutants.</p><p>Developer Raven Software and publisher Activision answered the call with 2004’s X-Men Legends. Legends was no mere platformer, but an isometric action RPG in the vein of Diablo. Players were allowed to build teams of four X-Men from a cast of 15 playable characters, each with their own moves and combo potential. Each character could be individually leveled and upgraded.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not only was the gameplay deeper and the storyline more complex than any X-Men game before it, X-Men Legends also raised the bar in terms of presentation.</p></div><p>Not only was the gameplay deeper and the storyline more complex than any X-Men game before it, X-Men Legends also raised the bar in terms of presentation. The game featured a unique cel-shaded graphical style inspired by Marvel’s Ultimate X-Men comics. The voice cast included such X-Men luminaries as Patrick Stewart’s Professor X and Steve Blum’s Wolverine.  </p><p>X-Men Legends quickly spawned a sequel in 2005’s X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse. Rise of Apocalypse proved to be a textbook case of a sequel dialing everything up to 11, with more playable characters, deeper gameplay, a bigger scope, and an engrossing story that involved the X-Men teaming up with the Brotherhood of Mutants to take down the mighty Apocalypse.</p><p>Even two decades later, the X-Men Legends games are widely regarded as some of the best games ever to feature the merry mutants. And while there haven’t been any direct sequels to these two classics, they did pave the way for the Marvel: Ultimate Alliance series, which continued that trademark blend of action RPG combat and deep Marvel superhero rosters. That hasn’t stopped many X-fans from crying out for an X-Men Legends III, however. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>X-Men: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here is every Marvel-licensed X-Men video game ever made.</p></div><h2>Wolverine and Deadpool’s Solo Adventures</h2><p>It’s been surprisingly quiet on the X-Men gaming front since the release of X-Men Legends II. Again, we’d bring up 2011’s X-Men: Destiny, but the less said about that game, the better. But if there’s been a real lack of ensemble X-Men games in recent years, things have been slightly rosier where Wolverine and Deadpool are concerned.</p><p>2003’s X-Men: Wolverine’s Revenge served as one reminder of how much potential Wolverine has as a video game protagonist. While ostensibly a tie-in to the movie X2: X-Men United, Wolverine’s Revenge actually took its cues from Grant Morrison’s New X-Men comics, right down to the costume design for Logan himself.   </p><p>In terms of its third-person action gameplay, Wolverine’s Revenge was a giant mixed bag. But the game still deserves credit for its comic book-inspired trappings and the fact that it features none other than Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill, as the voice of Logan. Ultimately, both Wolverine’s Revenge and 2006's movie-based X-Men: The Official Game served as a loose prototype for what was to come.</p><p>Cue X-Men Origins: Wolverine, perhaps the only game that can rival X-Men Legends as the best X-game of all time. That’s a strange thing to say considering that the movie it’s based on is universally panned by superhero fans. But in this case, Origins took the best parts of the source material and ran with them. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/wolverine-x360-boxshot-esrb-1721790221703.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Lousy movie, great game.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In this heavily embellished take on the movie’s plot, players take control of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine in two different time periods, as Logan both carves his way through a deadly jungle in search of adamantium in the past and singlehandedly takes on the Weapon X program in the present. The game did an admirable job of adapting God of War’s visceral character action gameplay. Lunging across gaps to impale enemies on your claws never gets old. </p><p>Origins deserves a lot of credit for solving many of the problems that had always plagued X-Men games. Wolverine’s powers aren’t locked behind special meters and limited in use. Even his healing factor plays an integral role in the gameplay, with players able to actually see his ruined body stitching itself together in real-time. No game has done a better job of making players actually feel this iconic hero’s berserker rage.</p><p>As for the Merc With a Mouth, he got his due in 2013’s Deadpool. Another violent third-person action game, Deadpool immediately stood out by embracing the fourth-wall-breaking antics of its titular anti-hero. It didn’t hurt that the game was actually scripted by prolific Deadpool comic book writer Daniel Way. And with a large ensemble cast that includes many mutant favorites and Mister Sinister as its main villain, Deadpool features enough X-Men pedigree to satisfy fans starved for new content. Temporarily, at least.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The X-Men’s Murky Gaming Future</h2><p>Outside of the occasional game like Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 3 and Marvel’s Midnight Suns, it’s been pretty quiet on the X-Men gaming front over the past several years. It didn’t help that Marvel has been accused of purposely downplaying the X-Men in other media while feuding with 20th Century Fox over the movie rights, an alleged battle that only came to an end <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/19/disney-completes-acquisition-of-21st-century-fox">when Disney purchased Fox in 2019</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, the future is beginning to look brighter for our mutant heroes. X-fans the world over have their eyes on Insomniac’s upcoming Wolverine game, which will put players back in the shoes of the Ol’ Canucklehead as he claws his way through the seedy town of Madripoor. If the game is even half as good as Insomniac’s Spider-Man series, X-Men Origins: Wolverine will be facing some serious competition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Thanks to a massive data leak, we also know that Insomniac’s plans for the X-Men franchise don’t stop with Wolverine. The studio reportedly intends for Wolverine to kick off a trilogy that will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-signs-deal-with-marvel-to-make-exclusive-x-men-games-until-2035-insomniac-cyber-security-attack-reveals">culminate in a full-fledged X-Men game</a>. That’s great news for fans… so long as they have a Playstation 5.</p><p>As for what else the future holds for the X-Men in video games, only time will tell. Will the X-Men return to the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise? Will the calls for X-Men Legends III finally be answered? For now, all we can do is replay these classics and hope for a brighter future for mutantkind.</p><p>What’s your favorite X-Men game of all time?

These features give you additional options to immerse yourself more deeply in the rich variety of soundscapes in PS5 games, powered by Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p><p><strong>Enable Remote Play for individual users (available for all PS5 models)</strong></p><p>You can now adjust Remote Play settings per user and choose who is allowed to connect to your PS5 console using Remote Play. So, if your friends or family members come over and sign in to your PS5 console with their account for PlayStation Network, you can easily modify who can continue to access your PS5 console using Remote Play when they leave.</p><p>To adjust these settings, go to [Settings] &gt; [System] &gt; [Remote Play] &gt; [Enable Remote Play], and choose which user you want to enable access to your PS5 console through Remote Play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/24/ps5-1721824457140.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p><strong>Adaptive charging for your controller (available for the latest PS5 model)</strong></p><p>Adaptive charging for the DualSense wireless controller, DualSense Edge wireless controller, PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, and Access controller is now available for PS5 beta participants using the latest PS5 model, when the console is in rest mode.

                <p dir="ltr">Looking to create "the best and safest place to stream," Twitch has clarified it sexual harassment policy as well as added AutoMod functionality to block problematic messages before they even appear in chats. It's all part of an enhanced effort to fight back against abuse on the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/How-We-re-Combatting-Sexual-Harassment-on-Twitch?language=en_US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, Twitch shared a new definition for sexual harassment on the platform to provide "clear boundaries around what behaviors are and aren't allowed." The full explanation is below:</p><p dir="ltr">"We define sexual harassment to encompass non-physical behaviors of a sexual nature that cause users to feel uncomfortable, degraded, unsafe, or discouraged from participation. We prohibit unwanted comments--including comments made using emojis/emotes--regarding someone's appearance or body, sexual requests or advances, sexual objectification, and negative statements or attacks related to a person's perceived sexual behaviors or activities, regardless of their gender. We also do not tolerate the recording or sharing of non-consensual intimate images or videos under any circumstances, and may report such content to law enforcement."</p><p dir="ltr">It is possible the company's team may get it wrong on consensual messages, Twitch admitted. That's why there is an Appeals Portal, though any expression of sexual violence will not be allowed on the streaming service--no matter the context.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, Twitch announced that AutoMod has been updated to catch sexual harassment messages before appearing in a streamer's chat. It's also customizable, allowing users to make it more or less strict. The updated AutoMod functionality only works for the English language so far.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitch-will-reinstate-former-president-donald-trumps-account-report/1100-6525160/" data-ref-id="1100-6525160">Twitch reinstated former President Donald Trump's channel</a> after he became the official Republican nominee for the US presidency in 2024.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Overwatch 2 - Super Mega Ultrawatch | Official Season 11 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Bound Demon skin has three levels of visual effects that can be unlocked via Mythic Shards. These visuals include unique weapon flourishes, special animations/VFX that play when eliminating an enemy, and other reactive visual effects that reflect players' in-game actions.</p><p dir="ltr">The basic version of Reinhardt's Mythic Weapon can be unlocked for 50 Mythic Shards ($40 USD), but the three levels of the Bound Demon Mythic Weapon skin cost 10 Mythic Shards ($10 USD) each. Players looking for a more wallet-friendly way to obtain the skin may want to opt for the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin Bundle, which is currently available via the in-game shop for $40 USD.</p><p dir="ltr">The bundle includes the basic version of the weapon, along with 2,000 Overwatch Coins and an instant, 20-level boost for the current season's battle pass. Since 80 Mythic Shards are included in the premium version of the game's battle pass, that 20-level boost could easily provide more than enough Mythic Shards to unlock the three tiers of Reinhardt's new Bound Demon Mythic Weapon skin.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear how long the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon skin bundle will be available for purchase, but Blizzard did say the bundle will only be available for a "brief period," so players looking to get their hands on the new skin--along with a battle-pass boost and some Overwatch Coins--will likely want to act fast, as the bundle option could be gone in a matter of days, when the in-game store's weekly restocking takes place.</p><p>More information on the fiery new weapon skin--and the story behind its creation--can be found on the official <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104604/unleash-your-inner-demon-with-reinhardt-s-mythic-weapon/" rel="nofollow ">Overwatch blog</a>.</p>

            <p>
It looks like Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is on its way to Xbox Game Pass next month.
</p>
<p>
That's according to leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815874694349770896">eXtas1stv</a>, who previously correctly leaked that Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 would arrive on Game Pass on 24th July, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">officially confirmed yesterday</a>.
</p>
<p>
The leaker suggests the Crash trilogy will be available from 8th August, claiming it's "100 percent confirmed".

<p>

Previously, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-reportedly-heading-to-game-pass-in-august">leaker claimed the game would arrive in August</a> - now the date has been specified.
</p>
<p>
If proven true, it will be the next of Activision's back catalogue to make it to Xbox's subscription service following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">completed purchase of Activision Blizzard for $68.7bn</a>.

</p>
<p>
Blizzard's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-will-make-a-hellish-addition-to-xbox-game-pass-this-march">Diablo 4 was already added to Game Pass</a> back in March.

</p>
<p>The Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is a remastered compilation of the first three games in the platformer series, developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Activision.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-and-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-confirms-xbox-will-publish-new-game">Toys for Bob has split from Activision to go independent</a>, but its next game will be published by Xbox.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">Microsoft recently altered its Xbox Game Pass tiers</a>, removing day one releases for its basic tier and increasing the price, all in the run-up to October's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.

</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-slams-microsofts-xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-calls-it-a-degraded-product">FTC slammed the change as a "degraded product"</a>, which Microsoft has since defended as "wrong".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-new-beta-adaptive-charging/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new PlayStation 5 beta system software will start rolling out tomorrow, introducing new features to the system, which will eventually make their way to a future public system software update.</p>
<p>The new beta, whose access is limited to invited participants in select countries, introduces some new features, starting with personalized 3D audio profiles for headphones and earbuds. This new feature allows users to undergo a set of sound quality tests to analyze a large number of factors to create an audio profile that best suits their hearing.</p>
<p>The new PlayStation 5 beta system software also introduces some new Remote Play settings, allowing users to adjust settings per user and choose who is allowed to connect to a console via Remote Play. The third and final major addition is the introduction of Adaptive Charging, which can only be used on the new PlayStation 5 model to adjust the length of time that power is supplied to controllers based on their battery level. Adaptive charging applies to DualSense controllers, DualSense Edge controllers, PlayStation VR 2 controllers, and Access controllers. More information on these new features can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/24/new-ps5-beta-rolls-out-tomorrow-with-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-and-new-remote-play-settings/">official PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Sony seems to be working hard on the software side of things lately. Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-24-05-09-60-00-performance-improvements/">yesterday</a>, a new PlayStation 5 system software update went live, introducing a new feature that allows players to invite others using a URL of the multiplayer session and more.</p>

Although presumably any real-world IT managers, looking to play the game for a bit of escapism after the last week, might not have found it <em>quite</em> as funny.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Sdss7AXask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new trailer</a> released today, Bandai Namco revealed a first look at Bleach Rebirth of Souls with a detailed gameplay overview.</p>



<p>It breaks down the goal of each fight, where players must wear out their opponent’s Reishi gauge and destroy all 9 of their Konpaku to win. </p>



<p>There are also Spiritual Pressure Moves and reverse actions to keep battles balanced. Fighters can use reverse actions while attacking or defending, inviting fans to make tactical decisions. Players can also accumulate power to reach an “Awakened State” and wield an ultimate ability. </p>

</p></figure>







<p>Some fans were concerned Bleach Rebirth of Souls might resemble Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero too closely. However, many praised the distinct combat style and flow in today’s trailer.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco first announced Bleach Rebirth of Souls during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-bleach-game-possibly-coming-to-bandai-namco-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 showcase event</a> earlier this month. The event mostly revealed cinematic footage and story beats. There is currently no concrete release window or date.</p>



<p>There are a variety of previous games based on the popular Bleach anime. However, many of these titles only released on mobile devices.</p>



<p>Last week, Bandai Namco also announced its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bandai-namco-announces-gamescom-2024-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lineup for Gamescom 2024</a>. That will include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, which will be playable for the first time.</p>



<p>Bleach Rebirth of Souls will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-physics-new-cars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and this one is adding six iconic cars to the racing sim's roster, as well as a "major update" for the game's car physics simulation model and more.</p>
<p>Most&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>updates <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144">bring</a> new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-january-update-coming-tomorrow-with-3-new-cars-and-more">cars</a> with them, and this one is no exception, but it's a bumper crop: you're getting six cars spanning decades of racing history, with high-profile brands like Subaru, Lamborghini, and more represented.</p>
<p>First up, the BMW M3 '97 brings a touch of 90s racing class to&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>. It's followed by the 2007 Ferrari 430 Scuderia, a sleek racer that "greatly improved upon the performance of the F430", as Sony and Polyphony have it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-july-six-new-cars.jpg?itok=aSL6cGFf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-july-six-new-cars.jpg?itok=0aySxSkP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This month's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update has six new cars for you to stare lovingly at.</figcaption></figure><p>The Genesis X Gran Racer Vision Gran Turismo Concept is next, and it's a "racing version of the Gran Berlinetta" with a very sleek and idiosyncratic shape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your next car in this&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update is the Lamborghini Gallardo LP 560-4 from 2008, which is an updated version of the 2003 Gallardo model that sports a frame 20kg lighter than previous models.</p>
<p>Finally, you can drive the 2016 RUF RGT 4.2 and the iconic Subaru Impreza Rally Car from 1998. Let it never be said that you don't have enough cars to choose from in&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, eh?</p>
<p>All of these cars come with an update to the game's physics simulation model, which Sony says should give cornering a more natural weight-shifting feel and improve tire response as well. It's a pretty significant change that should alter the way cars feel to drive.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you're also getting a new GT Circuit in the form of Eiger Nordwand, a classic circuit situated in the Swiss Alps. As you'd expect, it's breathtakingly beautiful, so try not to get distracted by the sights while you're zooming along its track.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-multiversus-leaks-skins-stages-renders/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-skins-renders-and-stages-for-multiversus-have-been-leaked.935478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-multiversus-leaks-skins-stages-renders/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Multiversus, the first and only game to be developed by Player First Games, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/">now officially owned by Warner Bros. Games</a> and has recently experienced some leaks. These leaks include new skins, character renders, and stages that could all be set to be added to Multiversus over the coming months.</p>
<p>These leaks first appeared on X before being compiled into a megathread on r/GamingLeaksandRumors, where you can see all the possible leaked content in one place. Some franchises included are Adventure Time, Samurai Jack, PowerPuff Girls, and Looney Tunes. In addition, stages from Barbie, Harry Potter, and Mad Max have also been leaked, suggesting plenty of new content to be added to Multiversus.</p>
<p>At the moment, it remains to be seen whether this content will make it into Multiversus. Still, the images posted by <a href="https://x.com/ausilmv/status/1815831816986845530?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X user AusilMV</a> seem incredibly polished, even if they are motionless renders. The stages are still very early concepts in basic shapes and colors, but those who look at the pictures can still tell what franchise they are from. In addition, AusilMV goes into depth about the minor details visible on the stages, which can help be a giveaway for what franchise these stages originate from.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, AusilMV has posted one stage that seems to be the outlier. There is a Steamboat Willie stage, which suggests a collaboration between Disney and Warner Bros. for Multiversus. In the early development stages of Multiversus, franchise additions that weren't exclusive to WB Games were showcased, with some assets from Marvel and Disney appearing in the renders. However, it is uncertain whether those original renders will ever make it into the game or whether they were just part of the pitch for Multiversus.</p>
<p>However, fans feel doubtful that a Steamboat Willie stage will be added to the game, as Epic already has many ongoing collaborations with Disney, such as plenty of different Fortnite collaborations, the most recent one being from Pirates of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The only known upcoming collaboration is the <a href="https://multiversus.com/en-gb/news/2-0-season-2-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samurai Jack</a> collaboration, as it appears officially on the Multiversus website. Not only is there a new stage, but a few new characters are now available on the roster, with Samurai Jack appearing on the Battle Pass.</p>
<p>No statement from Warner Bros. Games or Player First Games has been released regarding the Multiversus leaks, which means that they may be a complete falsehood created by someone online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shift-up-job-listings-hint-at-possible-pc-port-future-content/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As spotted by fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eazpj5/new_job_listing_pretty_much_confirms_stellar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Reddit</a>, some of the loosely translated job listings on Shift Up’s <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/recruit/recruit.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recruitment page</a> further hint that a Stellar Blade PC port could be on the way.</p>



<p>One of the listings calls for a Combat Designer to work on PC development. The description requests “PC skills design and data work” experience. </p>



<p>It also invites “anyone who wants to create battles for domestically developed AAA console action games.” This in particular appears to point to Stellar Blade, rather than other IP.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure>







<p>In May 2024, reports surfaced that Shift Up is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sales-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already considering</a> a PC port of Stellar Blade, following strong sales. The game sold an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sells-estimated-1-million-units-dlc-sequel-under-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated 1 million units</a> as of last June.</p>



<p>CEO Kim Hyung-Tae previously said that “we cannot comment” on a Stellar Blade PC port due to a “contractual relationship.” However, at this time, Shift Up has not officially confirmed a PC port is coming.</p>



<p>Fans widely praised the PC version of Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut when it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in May 2024</a>. PlayStation seems keen to continue introducing similar PC ports.</p>



<p>In addition to the Combat Designer listing for Stellar Blade, fans on Reddit noted that a Battle Designer for “monster creation” seems to tease future content. Fresh monsters could point to the DLC and potential sequel hinted at in the previously released Stellar Blade roadmap.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade first launched in April 2024, and it’s available now on PlayStation 5.</p>

The big focus of this gameplay deep dive is the game's so-called "BOOM Tech," which EA is touting as a totally redesigned tackling system that focuses on physics and real-world impact to give players more control over defense.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the blog post, BOOM Tech applies to any one-on-one tackle, which means that the game's physics system will determine "dynamic outcomes" based on factors like speed, momentum, weight, and player ratings. BOOM Tech will apply to already-existing Madden gameplay concepts and moves, like the cut stick, trucks, stiff-arms, and dive tackles.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This same physics-based focus also applies to the other side of the coin: the new ball-carrier balance and recovery system. If you're hit square-on, your back or receiver will be more likely to go down, or possibly even fumble the ball, whereas they're more likely to shrug off glancing blows. In the event of a fumble, the ball-carrier's chance to recover is determined by "the position of his center mass relative to his feet and torso," as well as other factors.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post expands on many other additions to the game, including a reloaded Hit Stick that relies more on timing than previous games, revamped skill moves, more in-depth pre-play adjustments like hot routes, and the option to attempt a one-handed catch. It's a lot of info, so if you want to fully digest it, check it out in full. Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/24/creepy-jar-showcases-starruptures-real-world-inspired-environment/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creepy Jar has showcased the environment of StarRupture, its upcoming sci-fi survival game. The environment of StarRupture is highly inspired by one environment that is mostly untouched by people, and that is the nation of Iceland. Creepy Jar has used Iceland’s natural landscape to create the foundation of StarRupture’s hostile world.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - Environment Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rklKZ1tNQUQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The showcase delves into how Iceland inspired the look of the game due to having a near prehistoric look and feel to it. The video also shows how resources are shown in the StarRupture, for example titanium has been given the shape of basalt rock columns, and given a shine inspired by other materials. Even with such a hostile natural environment, life does thrive in StarRupture with plants and animals adapting to the unstable world. The majority of the animals will be especially hostile to players, though a few will not pose any real danger. The planet in StarRupture is littered with remnants from previous expeditions, none of which survived the harsh conditions that they came up against. Those remnants include abandoned bases which contain resources that were left behind.</p>
<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. Players will be able to play solo or up to four player co-op. As well as dealing with the weather issues the planet, the fauna will attack and be a threat to player progress. There will be regular cycles of attacks, and it will be about learning on how to deal with those threats to make the base more resilient.</p>

<p>A release date for StarRupture is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/DavideSoliani/status/1816050633343938597" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a> earlier today, Soliani shared a shot of the famous moment of him crying during E3 2017 when&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-e3-2017-mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle">was first announced</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say about his tenure with Ubisoft and his plans for the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all folks. After 25 years, 11 of which beautifully spent working with Nintendo on Mario+Rabbids along the company of our incredible community of players, I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure. I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly.</p>

<p>Soliani served as the creative director on both 2017's&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle&nbsp;</em>and its excellent sequel, 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope"><em>Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</em></a>, but that's not all he did while at Ubisoft, of course.</p>
<p>His credits also include work as a creative director on&nbsp;<em>Just Dance</em>, as well as level design for 2005's GameCube action-strategy game&nbsp;<em>Battalion Wars&nbsp;</em>and even a credit on influential action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>.</p>
<p>It's safe to say he's one of Ubisoft's lifers, so his decision to leave the company will probably be a blow for many at the studio, although whether it's a surprise or not is another question.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-davide-soliani-ubisoft.jpg?itok=HfA0cLzH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/beyond-good-and-evil-davide-soliani-ubisoft.jpg?itok=cNU7mMfV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Davide Soliani has credits on lots of Ubisoft games, including&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's done a lot of work with Ubisoft behind the scenes, he's perhaps best known for a viral moment in 2017 when he cried during the unveiling of&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>As Shigeru Miyamoto took to the stage to introduce the game, cameras cut to Soliani, who was weeping, most likely out of a mixture of happiness and relief that his game was finally out there. Well, Davide, you needn't worry; they're both great games, and your legacy is secure.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Davide Soliani does next. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-game-pass-underperforming.935451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/is-game-pass-underperforming-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the defining changes in media in the 21st century - perhaps the defining change - is the switch to on-demand subscription services for most of our video and audio entertainment. This change isn’t just dramatic, it’s seemingly inevitable. Now that we have the technology to do this, the idea of going back to individual purchases of all music and movies feels just like that - going backwards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was only natural then, to expect that something similar would happen in the gaming space. And sure enough, some of the big players have tried to become the Netflix of gaming, including Microsoft, Apple, and of course, Netflix themselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a player, I’m a fan of these. I have on several occasions suggested that Game Pass specifically is the best value in gaming. But over 5 years later, it’s clear that the service hasn’t taken off to the extent they might have hoped, leading to the narrative that it’s underperforming or a failure.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The state of game subs">The state of game subs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Recent reports have Game Pass subscribers at somewhere around 34 million, which is simultaneously a large sounding number and a small fraction of the total Xbox and PC gamers. Consider that there are an estimated 120M+ monthly users of Steam, and that Steam doesn’t include Fortnite, League of Legends, Roblox, Minecraft and other titles that may boast more than that 34M figure by themselves. This slower than expected growth is being cited as a key reason for Microsoft’s recent studio closures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A recent tweet by Circana’s Mat Piscatella reported that “non-mobile video game subscription spending was only up 1%” vs the previous year. That’s a tiny increase for what seemed like it could be the next big thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the mobile side, things are a bit murkier. Subscriber counts for Apple Arcade are a little harder to come by, and due to the inclusion of Apple Arcade within the broader Apple One package, they may represent an overcount of the number of real users if we did have them. Similarly, Netflix technically offers games to all of its several hundred million users, but since it comes bundled in with the existing video subscription, that number represents only the number that have access to their game catalog, not those using it or those aware it even exists. Data from Apptopia put the number of players on a daily basis somewhere in the ballpark of 2M.</span></p><p>Source: https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1787873505092202867</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So what happened?">So what happened?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given the ubiquity of streaming in music and video and the time these services have been available, a couple of potential explanations jump out. Either</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They just haven’t gotten the quality or quantity of titles required to convince most gamers to sign up.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The discussions about this performance are based on a flawed assumption.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While I can’t rule out A, I suspect B is more likely, and I’m going to make an attempt to explain what I think that flawed assumption is.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Two types of game">Two types of game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To start with, let me ask a seemingly simple question: are games a form of media? The obvious answer is “Yes”, but a more nuanced answer would be “They </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>can</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be”. One of the biggest trends over the past couple of decades has been the rise of games specifically designed to be played for a potentially endless amount of time. The audience for these titles do not really treat “gaming” as a hobby so much as they treat individual games as a hobby.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This change can be seen in a variety of ways:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Several popular game genres that now exist primarily as ‘forever games’ - MMO’s, MOBA’s, Battle Royale’s, etc. Many of these have subscription models built in, be it mandatory monthly subs or optional battle passes.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost the entire field of mobile F2P games, with the exception of the hyper-casual space, is now designed to be played for as long as possible. To give an extreme example, the immensely popular Candy Crush Saga now has over 15,000 levels. Most successful games have regular events, clan functionality, daily challenges, and a host of other features intended to make a game into a core part of your week. Many (most?) of the top mobile games these days have their own subscription model, though usually just as one payment option of many.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Almost the entire concept of e-sports, which usually relies on both a player base of competitors committed to mastery of a single game and an audience who also know the game well enough to appreciate the skills on display and to care enough about who is the best in the world.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Game-As-Platform model exemplified by games like Roblox and more recently Fortnite, where a single game launcher actually contains a variety of game experiences, such that one title can become a catalog of games in and of itself.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even the rise of Twitch and related services, letting you watch your favorite game even when you can’t be playing it.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So while games certainly can be a form of media, not all gamers treat them as something to be consumed like media. Ironically, despite this article being about subscriptions to catalog services, subscriptions to individual games have actually done very well. Wold of Warcraft alone reportedly peaked at over 10M subscribers, putting it potentially around ⅓ of Game Pass by itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amongst all these trends, there may have only been one clear trend in the other direction, and that’s in the independent scene. Not all independent devs of course, but prior to the last decade, it was unusual to see smaller teams competing for Game of the Year awards, whereas now that’s fairly common, and most of those tend much more to the experiential side.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, as you can probably tell from the words being used in this blog, there still aren’t commonly agreed upon terms for these two types of game, nor does any store (to my knowledge) let you search or filter by one or the other. All of which continues to make it easy to conflate them and overlook the importance of this distinction.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The size of the market">The size of the market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To rephrase the above, the core problem of selling monthly access to a catalog of videogames is the sheer number of gamers who simply aren’t looking for new game experiences every month. There may well be hundreds of millions of people who played a videogame today, but let’s start chipping away at that figure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the people who just play F2P games and don’t spend a cent on anything? They’re probably not potential customers, and I’d guess that this group could number in the hundreds of millions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And all the ones who do routinely spend money in F2P games? They’re typically quite committed to those games, and hence probably not the kind that are looking to jump from game to game on a regular basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ditto for the competitive gamers who want to find a game - be it FPS/RTS/MOBA/CCG/etc - that they can commit to for long enough to develop mastery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Really, if any game in your Steam library has a playtime of over 500 hours, you may be getting enough value from the games you buy that a catalog service actually becomes worse value by comparison.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anyone who just wants to play the biggest AAA games of the year will likely be ruled out too - there’s just not that many exceptional ones per year these days, and they’re spread across too many publishers and platforms to get a significant number on one service. Others may arrive later, but at this point I think Microsoft and Ubisoft are the only traditional publishers launching their biggest titles on day one on [the higher tiers of] their services, something Sony has thus far declined to do for their PSN Extra/Deluxe tiers. So this kind of player may be a potential customer, but may also lean towards signing up occasionally for limited time periods rather than being an ongoing customer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, fans of indie games may also want to play whatever notable releases arrive in their favourite genres (or just anything getting enough buzz), but again, if you want to be part of the zeitgeist then you may also not be fully satisfied with this combination of occasional day 1 releases and semi-random older choices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what you’re left with is players who want to play a wide variety of games, either by indies or whatever back catalog premium titles are currently on rotation, and aren’t getting so distracted by other off-service titles to find the subscription service unnecessary. Oh and they also need to have access to the platform(s) your service runs on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How big is this market? I have no idea. We’d need some far more experienced analysts to dive into that one. But I feel fairly comfortable saying that it’s likely nowhere near as big as the overall size of the gaming market might suggest. And it likely pales next to the largest single titles as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This concept of total addressable market is very important to the perceptions of success or failure, because if you hear that Microsoft are only reaching ~34 million of the multiple billion gamers, then it’s easy to conclude that it’s underperforming. But if you think that the number of people who might be interested in such a service might stretch to only around 100M, then they may have already reached around a third of the entire market. In most industries that’d likely be considered pretty good for a few years work at a new business model.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why this goes unnoticed">Why this goes unnoticed</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of the reason this often goes undercovered in much of the gaming press is that the gaming press is comprised of people who need to be jumping from game to game on a weekly basis as part of their job. As a result, even if they do have their forever game that they can keep going back to, they also need to enjoy playing a variety of games every month or they likely wouldn’t be doing what they are.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are of course people who specialise in covering a single game, though I suspect it’d be a fairly rare scenario that there was enough to say about a game that launched over 3 years ago to keep a gaming journalist employed full time, even if there were still 10M people playing that game. All of which leads to a strong focus on what’s new and upcoming over what the majority of players are actually spending their time on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the market for gaming journalism is mostly the section that cares about what’s new and novel. And as discussed above, this section represents only a tiny portion of the total gaming market, and it may not be growing fast, if it’s growing at all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it is the segment of the market that’s most likely to be found regularly reading the gaming press or listening to their podcasts, so it’s natural to think of it as being more representative of the gaming landscape as a whole than it really is. And therefore to think that because their audience would likely appreciate a large selection of high-quality games for a reasonable monthly fee, that there must be a very large market for such a thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it may still be a niche, as hard as that may be to believe.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The wrong solution">The wrong solution</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the face of these perceived shortfalls, an inevitable solution will be proposed - that the service needs to expand into the kinds of games that can hold onto players for months or years. This can be seen both in Microsoft’s addition of bonuses for several of Riot’s F2P games on Game Pass, and in Apple’s reported pivot of the criteria they’re looking for in Apple Arcade titles. These notions, while understandable, may be missing the point. They’re understandable because, as discussed already, we know that there are types of games that can hang onto players for months or longer, and a game subscription service that had such a game might be able to keep someone resubscribing every month in the same way that a must-watch television series might keep subscribers around for the length of the season.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But they’re potentially missing the point because, also as suggested above, these can be exactly the kinds of games that can monetise on an ongoing basis all by themselves. And a game that can get a large player base to commit to even $5 a month directly probably stands to make a lot more than it could as 1 of several hundred games on a $10-15 monthly subscription.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is one area where games are unique from the other media types. Movies and music can certainly get one-off revenue from a number of sources, but I don’t know how many musicians or film directors ever aspired to reliably make $15 a month from over 10 million fans as World of Warcraft did.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Similarly, any player who did find themselves primarily playing a single game on a subscription service might naturally start to wonder why they’re paying for hundreds of other games if they’re mostly just playing one, and could be supporting that single dev directly.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Takeaways">Takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given my rambling nature, there’s a few things to summarise here, but I’m going to focus on one in particular -&nbsp; we need better labels for the variety of experiences games can offer. I have to believe that few people would treat movies, TV shows and Tiktok videos the same, despite all being video-based entertainment options. Spotify doesn’t treat music, podcasts and audiobooks the same, despite all being audio-based entertainment options. And I think gaming provides a similar breadth of forms, though we lack the language to differentiate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The closest any store I can recall has come to this distinction is the paid/free split on the mobile app stores, though I don’t think either has really done anything to explain what the differences are between premium and F2P games, nor does it do anything to separate F2P games from just plain free games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After spending a little time pondering a few ideas for naming, I think the most logical options would simply be ‘finite games’ and ‘infinite games’, though perhaps some creators may wish to declare that they make finite games that just happen to take a year to finish, by which time they hope to have added even more content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such terms could help everyone in the gaming space. They would help developers better communicate what they’re making. They would help players understand what they’re playing or what they’re in the market for. And for the purposes of this blog, it would help analysts and the rest of us better quantify the size of various segments of the overall market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ideally, any catalogue service listing ‘finite games’ should also list an estimated playtime, in the same way that every video and audio service tells you the length of what you’re about to see or hear. Such times may have to include vague min/max figures to account for the variety of different experiences, but not only is this possible, Microsoft are already doing it on Game Pass through the HowLongToBeat data. Some worried that this would limit the reach of shorter titles, but I suspect the opposite might be true - from personal experience, once you have an ‘all-you-can-eat’ model, you develop a new respect for games that haven’t been padded out to meet some arbitrary hours-per-dollars metric. If you’re unsure about a game, knowing that it’ll only take a few hours either way can be a lot more encouraging than hearing a game gets really good after the first dozen hours.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Addendum">Addendum</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of this blog was written before MS announced the recent pricing and feature changes for the Game Pass tiers, but I don’t think anything above fundamentally changes. If anything, it may serve as an explanation for a possible strategy change. Remember the $1 trial month? That’s a thing you do when growing your audience is more important than short-term profit. Upping the prices and forcing players to upgrade to the top tier for what used to be the marketing slogan of your service (“Play it day one with Game Pass”) is something you do when you think that the smarter play is extracting more revenue from your existing users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Robert Green is a game designer with 19 years experience making games across a wide variety of genres and platforms.

			<p>Yesterday, news broke out that the entire dev team behind Humble Games was laid off. This information came from employees working at the company and posted it on their LinkedIn accounts. <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senior QA Emilee Kieffer</a> made the post across Linkedin and their X account to explain the situation. Humble Games is responsible for publishing well-known indie games, such as Unpacking, Slay the Spire, and Coral Island.</p>
<p>However, despite yesterday's statements by the laid-off staff, Humble Games has since made a statement that they did not lay off the entire team but are "restructuring" the company and will not be closing down. According to Emilee Kieffer, in a post on X, roughly 40 staff members were laid off from the Humble Games team. However, the numbers regarding how many staff were made redundant have not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>"In these challenging economic times for indie publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects," says a Humble Bundle Press representative in an official statement.</p>
<p>The statement also confirms that Humble Games' restructuring will have no effect on Humble Bundle and that it will resume operations as usual. The statement also says, "We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017."</p>
<p>Humble Games also has <a href="https://www.humblegames.com/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming projects</a> like Lost Skies, On Your Tail, and Monaco II. What will happen with these projects, whether the developers will have to find different publishers for the games, and whether the projects can continue as normal remains unseen.</p>
<p>In the past year alone, 11,000 people have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-us-home-qa-keoken-talks-studio-layoffs-kickstarter-campaign-and-life-as-a-small-indie/">laid off</a> across the gaming industry, surpassing the numbers of 2023, with 10,500 people being laid off across the entire year. Most of the layoffs of 2024 thus far happened at the very early beginning of the year, quickly surpassing those in 2023.</p>
<p>It remains unknown whether IGN Entertainment will make a statement on the layoffs at the moment, as they purchased Humble Games in 2017, what this means for the future of Humble Bundle as a whole, and whether this will eventually affect Humble Bundle.</p>
