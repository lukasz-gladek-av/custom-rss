			<p><strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3KEv1KkCZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the next step in <strong>Elder Scrolls Online</strong>'s transition to a seasonal model, with the first season set to debut on April 2, 2026. For example, all major gameplay content released from now on will be free, with the revenue model shifting to battle-pass mechanics through the new <strong>Tamriel Tomes</strong>, offering both free and paid progression tracks.</p>



<p><strong>Season Zero: Dawn and Dusk</strong> introduces the <strong>Night Market</strong>, a seven-week limited-time event zone set in <strong>Oblivion</strong>'s <strong>Fargrave</strong> realm. Players pledge to one of three factions, completing PvE encounters with new storylines, quests, and an earnable in-game home. Event Zones are designed to return to Elder Scrolls Online in future Seasons, allowing players to experience content differently through alternate faction choices. Concurrent with <strong>Update 49</strong> (scheduled to go live on all platforms on <strong>March 9, 2026</strong>), a dedicated quality-of-life team addresses longstanding player pain points: free skill and attribute respecs, accelerated Riding training, and expanded housing furnishing limits.</p>



<p>That's just the tip of the iceberg of what's been just announced; for the full lowdown, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-elder-scrolls-online-content-will-be-free-season-model-debuts-april-2-2026/">check out the dedicated article</a>. Here, we'll focus on the roundtable press interview that Wccftech attended, where Game Director <strong>Nick Giacomini</strong> and Executive Producer <strong>Susan Kath</strong> answered many questions about the future of Elder Scrolls Online.</p>

<h2 id="season-transition"><a href="#season-transition">The 2026 Transition to the Seasons Model</a></h2>



<p><strong>There's no more content pass in 2026, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>That is correct. The Content Pass was a transitional year thing as we moved into our final form of what we're going to be doing in 2026 when we bring seasons in.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> This is a step toward trying to make all new content features accessible for all players.</p>



<p><strong>Could you elaborate a bit more on the changes to the game's difficulty in general?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> We've talked about this a little bit before. The way the players engage with ESO is extremely varied, right? We have players who engage just in small components of the game. We have players who are playing for hours every single day. We have very hardcore players. We have very casual players. So, hitting a sweet spot is inherently challenging. That said, we've heard loud and clear from players that more challenging overland difficulty is something that is highly requested, so we're going to be introducing ways for players to be able to experience more challenging content if they want to.</p>



<p>There's more to come on challenging overland difficulty. We'll be releasing more information in the near future about it, but that's one example where players will be provided an option to engage in more challenging content for greater rewards if they'd like to. Similarly, the Night Market is our first foray into a more challenging zone. You don't have to form or come in with a group, but the content itself will facilitate players working together. It's a difficult spot to hit, but our goal is to be able to provide players with options to engage in what level of difficulty they want to.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_CombatRefresh_LavaWhip-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="difficulty-overland"><a href="#difficulty-overland">Overland Difficulty and Solo Dungeons: New Challenges for All</a></h2>



<p><strong>The Overland difficulty option was listed as being in Season Zero, but it's missing from Update 49. So, when is it coming, and what does it look like in the first iteration? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yes, it is currently slated for season zero. We're trying to be more transparent and part of that is that we're showcasing more of our plans, so some dates may change, and that's part of this. That said, yes, we're expecting it to arrive toward the end of Season Zero. There's so much that we want to do with this and there's a lot more that we're planning to do, but we wanted to get something into the hands of players sooner rather than later because it is highly requested. It's something we're excited about. Again, this is part of our philosophy for providing Elder Scrolls Online players with new content and new features that they can give us feedback on, so that we can take that feedback in and iterate on it and be able to provide an experience more tailored to what our players want. This first version is very much a first step and I would very much think of it that way, as we see if this is something that players want and what we need to change, and we're planning to add to it over time. There will be options in this first version. We're still aligning on the exact number of levels, but currently it's, I believe, three, in addition to what is currently available. There will be three levels, from more difficult to way more difficult, that players can experiment with and try. The latest iteration featured additional XP and gold as rewards. That is also something that we're hoping to add to over time. Again, this is very much a first version. </p>



<p><strong>With the increased difficulty options, will that also be coming to Elder Scrolls Online's Dungeons and Trials in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> No. This is specifically for what we call overland zones, delves, public dungeons, and similar content, excluding dungeons and trials, which are group-based. Those already have different modes of difficulty that players can engage in, and we're not going to be walking away from them. As for solo dungeons, as we build this feature out, the thinking is that there will also be different modes for players to engage in there, like a story mode for players who just want to go through the dungeon, experience the story and explore the space, and then mechanisms to increase the difficulty for players looking for greater challenges and better rewards.</p>

<h2 id="dlc-accessibility"><a href="#dlc-accessibility">Making Older Expansions and DLCs Part of the Base Game</a></h2>



<p><strong>Can you clarify whether all Elder Scrolls Online DLCs and expansions are now free from the start, or will this happen gradually?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath: </strong>The way that's going to work is going forward from this point, everything new that we do will be part of what we refer to as the base game. We will be incorporating some of the older expansions, such as Thieves Guild, Orsinium, and the Dark Brotherhood, into the base game. We're working out the mechanism by which those will be granted to the existing customers, but basically, everyone will have those as part of the game. Things like the dungeon DLCs and stuff like that, those will all still remain exactly as they are now. They'll be purchasable via the Crown Store or accessible if you have ESO Plus. As we go forward, we'll also look at other opportunities where we can bring some of more of the older DLCs into the main game. But those three are the only three that we have planned right now.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_GoldCoastBazaar_Furniture_DragonsTreasureTrove-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="battle-pass-plus"><a href="#battle-pass-plus">Tamriel Tomes and the Evolution of ESO Plus</a></h2>



<p><strong>At the beginning of this presentation, you mentioned that updates would be free, but some content might be paid. Could you elaborate on that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Yes, there are three tracks to the Battle Pass: two optional paid tracks as well as a free track.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> It's optional and that's very deliberate. Again, it's a point of feedback that we heard from players a lot, about having to purchase a new Chapter every single year. In addition to that, it also stratified the population and made it more difficult to play with friends. Going forward, we want to make the content and features that we release available for anyone to be able to jump in and participate in.</p>



<p><strong>On the topic of the Tamriel Tomes, the Elder Scrolls Online Battle Pass, will there be one for each season?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Will Tamriel Tomes replace ESO Plus, or will ESO Plus include the paid version of Tamriel Tomes? How will this work going forward? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> ESO Plus is not going away; it is actually getting an additional set of rewards that are being built into ESO Plus as part of all of this. ESO Plus subscribers will accumulate one token for every 12 months they are subscribed which they can use to unlock one Premium track for a Tamriel Tome of their choice.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> We're also introducing some additional benefits to ESO Plus, which we discussed in the video, such as the furnishing limits that we're going to increase. ESO Plus members are going to get increased capacity to transmute crystals and so on.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_TamrielTomes_Premium_Core_MesaStalker-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="crossplay-development"><a href="#crossplay-development">The Road to Crossplay</a></h2>



<p><strong>Can you speak further about crossplay? Is that something that is definitely coming?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Crossplay is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while. We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like Elder Scrolls Online, which was not built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations that we have to make. We've talked a little bit about this in AMAs: you know, things such as the economic differences between the console realms and the PC realms. We have to figure out a way to merge this in such a way that's fair for everyone who's participating in this. There's a lot of technical considerations underway. It's going to be a while, but I assure you we are working on it. You'll probably start to see over the next year stuff popping up on the public test server as we kind of start to test out some of these accommodations.</p>



<p><strong>Will regular events be replaced, too, if event tickets are being removed?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> No. We love the events, and they're going to continue to be a part of the things that we do throughout the year. Yes, event tickets are going away, but there's still going to be rewards available for events that players will get to experience. Additionally, the events team will be releasing two new events this year. There's going to be a Heart's Day event in February and an event that might involve seas and ship battles and things like that. We're still experimenting with it and trying to find the fun for this, but absolutely, events aren't going away.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_NightMarket_SorrowsFriendCombat-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="night-market"><a href="#night-market">The Night Market: Limited-Time Event Zones</a></h2>



<p><strong>Night Market sounds really interesting. What will make it unique or different from other zones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yes, I'm really excited for several reasons. We have already discussed the challenging nature of it. I think that's really exciting. I'm personally looking forward to seeing it. It's something that we're going to be paying attention to and that we really want feedback on for players from players, is like, should we ramp it up? Should we ramp this down? But the challenging nature and the group-based focus is something that I'm really interested in, and I think the players are going to enjoy it. There's going to be some never-before-seen elements in the zone that I'm excited by. The public event is a good call to action for players to participate in an epic battle. Allowing players to choose a faction should be interesting, and that race toward trying to have their faction win is going to be compelling.</p>



<p>It's going to be a new way to engage with content that we're really curious to see how players engage with and whether they like it. It's also limited time; it's called an event zone because it is like an event. We plan to gather feedback from it and iterate.</p>



<p><strong>So, why not just make the Night Market zone permanently available?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> I think that there is the opportunity to make the Night Market permanent if players enjoy it. We talked about this and debated quite a bit. We landed on this, again, to allow us to experiment more and provide something that is a compelling experience and a call to action for players, as it is limited in time. If players like it, great, we can bring it back. We can potentially make it permanent. If it's falling short in certain areas or if there are things that they'd like to see, that's something that we can then address the next time that we bring it back, so that it's more interesting.</p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Yeah, Nick makes a really good point. That's something we really want to do with a lot of content going forward. One of the benefits of moving Elder Scrolls Online away from the Chapter system is that we didn't have many opportunities to go back and revisit things. This shift that we're making kind of unlocks that for us. We can put things out there, like the Night Market. We can get feedback from the player base and now we'll have time to make some changes and bring it out in a new form. I think you'll see us doing that more with features that we are introducing to the game, doing this more in a collaborative manner with our player base than historically we were able to do because we were on to the next Chapter at that point.</p>



<p><strong>With the Seasons model, will we see the addition of new permanent zones in the future, or will these be limited-time only, like the Night Market?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> No, we'll do zones.</p>



<p><strong>Is there no new normal zone coming to Elder Scrolls Online in 2026?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> We're not quite ready to talk about that right now. There might be.</p>



<p><strong>Similarly, is there no overarching story for this year? Are there just the two separate storylines for the Thieves Guild and Sheogorath?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> We're not quite ready to talk about what some of the plans are and what's likely coming toward the end of 2026 and the beginning of 2027. But if you're talking about the year-long stories that we've done in previous Chapters, not this year. But that doesn't mean that's not a possibility for the future. We want to try to provide players with what we think is going to be the best experience for them and we don't want to lock ourselves into something. This year is more about varying things up and being less predictable, moving away from that templated format that players have told us about. We're deliberately evolving from that. This isn't a revolution; rather, it's an evolution: staying true to the roots while providing meaningful change for players, and this is a component of that. That said, there are absolutely overarching narratives that are going to take place, perhaps in a less structured format than the Chapter model provided, but we're moving the timeline forward to introduce new, exciting stories for our players.</p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> I think a key thing that Nick touched on is that Elder Scrolls Online is about stories. That is a pillar of the company, of the studio, of the game. What we talk a lot about is how we can start to tell our stories in new and different ways. That's what we're exploring right now. It doesn't rule out that we wil  eventually do something that's very similar to maybe what a Chapter has been in the past, but as we go forward into this year, we're looking at how we can tell those things in different ways.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_NightMarket_SkitteringPrecinctCombat-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="dynamic-events"><a href="#dynamic-events">Dynamic Events: Creating a Living World</a></h2>



<p><strong>The roadmap also included new dynamic events later in the year, including multi-stage dynamic events. Can you talk a bit about those?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Yes. I'm trying to temper my excitement a little bit because, well, I am very excited by this. It will allow players to experience the world in a more vibrant, living way, where things may pop up that they can experience that's different than just the world boss that is at the same place on the map. This is going to be something that players will be able to stumble upon that they'll be able to converge on to help or assist with, and it's not just combat focus. That is absolutely going to be some of it, but it's going to vary the type of content that players can engage with and allow us to provide a more living world and a new way to engage in the content, which we're really excited about. However, I do want to temper expectations on this. We're just starting to build this out. In Season One, which is coming in July, that will be the first time that players get to experience this a little bit, but it's just a little bit to start. </p>



<p>Again, we're building out this tech that is going to enable us to do so much more in the future. We want to hear what players think about it, but I think they will be excited. I get really excited to see what this leads to, particularly toward either the end of 2026 or the beginning of 2027.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_NightMarket_TheParch_CalamitousDunegorgerStomach-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="storytelling-lore"><a href="#storytelling-lore">A New Direction for Storytelling and Lore</a></h2>



<p><strong>How much new quest and lore content can we expect in these new Elder Scrolls Online Seasons?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Plenty. Susan said it well earlier, where stories are very much at the heart of Elder Scrolls Online. I personally love the lore of Elder Scrolls. It's my favorite, it's one of the things that we're best known for, and we're not walking away from that. We want to provide players with quests, with stories, with lore,  so there's going to be a lot that is similar that players will find very recognizable compared to what we've done in the past, because we enjoy it and players enjoy it. However, as Susan said, we will have different ways to engage with content and tell stories, and perhaps not the exact same cadence.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that in the new Seasons, there will be 8,000 Endeavors as a reward.  Is that every year, season, or month?</strong></p>



<div><p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Per season.</p><p><strong>Can we choose activity-specific challenges for Tamriel Tomes, as in solely PvE or PvP challenges, and maybe solely overland or solely group challenges?</strong></p></div>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> It's a mix within reason. If there's a challenge that you don't want to participate in, you can reroll.</p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> There will be a deep dive with more information about this. There are a number of free rerolls that players can use, and then they can spend gold if they want to continue rerolling beyond a certain point. There will be activities for all different play styles.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fe4667f3ed21ab97b3139c10b2bc7955-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="pvp-progression"><a href="#pvp-progression">New PvP Seasons and Progression Systems</a></h2>



<p><strong>Could you elaborate a bit more on the PvP progression system coming to Elder Scrolls Online? </strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> There will be a lot more coming on this in the near future, but yes, there is going to be a progression system for PvP that we're really excited about. You'll be able to make progress on it from any aspect of PvP through Battlegrounds, through Cyrodiil, and through the Imperial City. Players will be able to unlock rewards throughout this period of time that this progression is active. Sorry, I keep saying period of time. I would think of it like a season, but the name is like a PVP season, but we haven't decided on what the name of that is going to be. But effectively over the course of say six months, players will be able to make progress toward various rewards. There's some exclusive cosmetics for PvP. Players get to hold on to those cosmetic rewards: they aren't temporary. Once you unlock them, they're yours. And then, we're going to continue adding to it. Right now, the plan is that a couple of times a year, it's refreshed, and players will have new things that they can progress toward and get rewarded for participating in PvP. It's going to be more than we've done before.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2bf0d9f591e42888a345ee67cc6a2d2c-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="dungeons-trials"><a href="#dungeons-trials">The 2026 Outlook for Dungeons and Trials</a></h2>



<p><strong>Are there no new dungeons for this year? Is the Night Market aimed at the players who would normally expect dungeons?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> Right now, there are no new group dungeons planned for 2026. We do have a Trial that's going to be coming. You mentioned the Night Market. And solo dungeons are going to be coming. That will allow players to engage in dungeon content solo, and there will be different difficulties and rewards associated with those. That was one of the trade-offs that we had to make in order to do solo dungeons. It's one of the things that we're trying to invest in generally. That Chapter model and its 18-month lead time was really restrictive in terms of what we could do on top of that to respond to player feedback to do more exciting things, and this is an example of that.</p>



<p>Believe me, we would like to do more dungeons. It is highly likely that dungeons are going to be in the future, but this year, as we invest more in the core experience of the game, this was one of those trade-offs that we had to make.</p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> I think one way of looking at this year is we're coming at this from kind of two areas, right? One of them, with the dev team, was asking them what you would do if you could do anything, if you could give the players anything, and you weren't actually having to focus on Chapters? And then the second part of that was in the surveys and the summits that we had going to the player base, we said, what would you have us do? Everything that we're releasing here is the culmination of both of those things.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/71f6b97dfdc1a621dfd3cfaf66b0ba88-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="development-philosophy"><a href="#development-philosophy">Development Philosophy: Investing in the Core Elder Scrolls Online Experience</a></h2>



<p><strong>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-battle-for-the-writhing-wall-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Writhing Wall event</a> definitely showed that there's some work to be done on the testing side. Has this been improved as we head into Season Zero so that all the new features arrive intact?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> That is the plan. The Writing Wall and Content Pass were, as we said, part of the transition year. We started going down this road of trying to do new and different things. What we have learned from that is all being actually built in and planned. It was a growth experience for us and a learning experience about how we do these things going forward. I look at it from the standpoint of, we've been doing the same thing, you know, in essence, for nine years now. In many ways, that was the midstep between what we were doing before and what we're doing from 2026 onward, which is pretty radically different. In answer to that, yes, we've learned a lot from this, and that's all being built into our plans as we prep for the release of Season Zero.</p>



<p><strong>What lessons have you learned after this transition year for Elder Scrolls Online?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Nick Giacomini:</strong> I think that it was a transition year, but it wasn't enough, right? We need to do more for our players. There needs to be more change, and it needs to be more rewarding. We saw that come through a lot in the feedback. That was one of the biggest lessons for me of what we're going to take going forward. We also stumbled a few times along the way. I think Writhing Wall is an example of that. There are things that we wish we could have done differently that we're going to take forward with us.</p>



<p>Offering player choice and variety is another key element with this. I think that subclassing is a<br>good example where we introduced a system that did allow for a lot more choice for players but also introduced a number of issues and there's a large number of players that now feel that it actually eliminated choice and made it so that they needed to participate in very specific builds in order to be viable, which is very counter to what we're trying to set up. So there's going to be a renewed effort on not just chasing the next new big thing, which historically we've done, but investing in the game and the core experience. The class refresh is a good example of that. I think some of the PVP things that we have going on this year are a good example of that. Solo dungeons is a good example of that. The 20-plus things that we're fixing that players have addressed is a good example of that. So, providing players options, choice, and really improving just the core of Elder Scrolls Online. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/">When we talk about </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being a 30-year game</a></strong>, that doesn't involve just chasing that next big thing. It involves investing in a game for our players.</p>



<p><strong>Susan Kath:</strong> Nick summed it up really well. We're going to keep trying new things. We've talked about being more transparent, being more open about the stuff that's coming up, putting things out in more even if it might still need some work. We're not going to grow if we don't stumble along the way. We have to try things. That's what we're going to do, and I think all of that comes together in an outcome that is actually going to be really fun and exciting for everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Listen, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-main-resident-evil-games-from-worst-to-b-1847399290"><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i></a> <span>is clearly an influential series. It helped mold the enduring vision of survival-horror video games, and over the course of its nearly 30-year history, it has reinvented itself and the genre more times than one can count. There’s even an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><span>exciting new </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> title</span></a><span> coming out right around the series’ 30th anniversary, which feels like an appropriate thing to promote and throw some weight behind. So explain to me why, instead, there’s a </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> knockoff called </span><i><span>Ebola Village </span></i><span>taking up time and space on PlayStation’s YouTube page right now?</span></p> <p><span>The trailer’s description reads, “A classic horror inspired by the original survival games of the 90s, Ebola Village is a modern take on a first-person adventure where the main character, Maria, investigates a series of mysterious events.” Let me just say, “inspired” is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. It’s been sitting on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRM0AdPcs3E">PlayStation YouTube page</a> for over 20 hours, has amassed over 70,000 views, and roughly 7,400 downvotes. It was spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/2008707623428792711">social media gaming news accounts like Knoebel</a>. “</span><span dir="auto" role="text">What are we doing here man,” reads one of the top comments.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span><em>Ebola Village</em> already released on PC last year. Part of an entire series developed by “indie_games_studio” (yes, that’s the studio’s name), it costs $17 dollars and the top Steam reviews say things like, “This game is so bad it gave me Ebola irl.” Usually, it’s Unreal Engine asset-flip knockoffs of hit Steam games that are wasting space on the PlayStation Store. This time around, it’s actual junk from Steam that appears to be flowing downstream. How it ended up with a spot on the PlayStation YouTube channel remains unclear.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The entire trailer feels like a shoddily constructed homage to the </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> series, and not in a campy, fun way, either. One of the opening shots shows a character driving into town, and from the first-person perspective of the scene, their fingerless gloves look almost exactly like part of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-grace-playable-split-2000653406"><span>Leon Kennedy</span></a><span>‘s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span> fit. In another scene, a zombie (or someone otherwise infected by Ebola???) lobs an axe at the player’s head, and I swear the accompanying sound effect even sounds like it’s straight out of </span><i><span>RE4</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I wonder if this trailer will be still available on the official PlayStation YT acc after I wake up tomorrow. <a href="https://t.co/9CKCMwnle8">pic.twitter.com/9CKCMwnle8</a></p> <p>— Knoebel (@Knoebelbroet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/2008707623428792711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make matters worse (or better depending on who you ask), there’s also an enemy with a chainsaw and sack over their head. Come on, y’all.</span></p> <p><i><span>RE4</span></i><span> isn’t the only game from the series that’s shown a bit of love here, and there are some standout “homages” to the larger </span><i><span>RE </span></i><span>series among the various egregious details. For example, the font used for </span><i><span>Ebola Village</span></i><span>‘s title appears very similar to that used by the </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> remakes, and the “E” in Ebola here is crimson followed by gnarled white lettering, mirroring the logos for those games. Additionally, the main character, Maria, feels pretty “inspired”</span> <span>by the series’ early female protagonists, like some amalgamation of Claire Redfield and Jill Valentine.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At some point in the game, Maria even appears to flee to a remote village to “visit her mother and her ex-husband, Ruslan,” at which point the game begins to look eerily like the </span><i><span>RE4</span></i><span>-inspired </span><i><span>Resident Evil Village</span></i><span>. There’s a tall crone-like character, a fight with a werewolf, and there are even scenes set amongst distinctly </span><i><span>Village</span></i><span>-esque cabins. The most surprising part of the trailer is actually the absence of a Lady Dimitrescu analog, but maybe that’s one surprise <em>Ebola Village</em> is saving for those brave enough to actually spend money on it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some commenters on the trailer page couldn’t help but theorize that the video’s thumbnail was AI-generated, which would at least feel in line with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494"><span>rest of the slop currently sitting on the PlayStation Store</span></a><span>. According to the game’s Steam page, it was indeed the work of a neural network. </span><i><span>Ebola Village</span></i><span> is evidently releasing on console on January 23, and I cannot wait to see what </span><i><span>borrowed </span></i><span>tricks it has up its sleeves, at least until <em>Ebola 4</em> comes out. We’ll see if that one makes it into an actual PlayStation showcase.&nbsp;</span></p>

Back in Gotham, he teams up with the likes of Jim Gordon, Robin, Catwoman, Nightwing, and Batgirl (all of whom are playable characters) as he takes on all manner of color villains, from Joker and Poison Ivy to Bane, Mr. Freeze, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way, there’s a heavy focus on collecting things, including 100 suits, more than 20 vehicles, and over 250 props and trophies to display in the Batcave.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">More Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy">Nioh 3 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-where-to-buy">Pokemon Pokopia Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-where-to-buy">Resident Evil Requiem Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saros-ps5-where-to-preorder">Saros Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <p>
If there were ever a dead horse that didn't need so much flogging, it might be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series. Undeniably beloved by many, it has fallen victim to that whole franchising thing, having received an entry only in 2024 via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, a sequel game that was perhaps a little bit too messy. And here we are, in 2026, with PEGI potentially spoiling the reveal of a new entry in the series subtitled Reunion. Spoilers ahead for the game!
</p>
<p>
You can see as such on the official PEGI ratings board website by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-be-still-my-irritated-heart">simply searching for Life is Strange</a>, with Reunion popping up right at the top. There is even an entire outline of the game, revealing that this one brings about the return of none other than Chloe Price, who was absent from the most recent entry.
</p>
<p>
"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret," reads the game's synopsis. "Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."
</p>
<p>
Welp! This sure sounds like a game the Life is Strange fandom will feel incredibly normal about. There are also some more PEGI-oriented references to parts of the game, like there being a scene where the player (presumably Chloe) has her drink spiked at a party, alongside some apparent depictions of "strong, realistic violence," with numerous references to suicide. Sounds heavy, but par for the course with this series.
</p>
<p>
This just being a PEGI rating, there's zero word on when a proper reveal might come, so you'll have to wait to see what this one ends up looking like.

<p>New PEGI rating data has surfaced for an unannounced Life Is Strange title.</p>



<p><em><strong><a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=life%20is%20strange&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B0%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B0%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B0%5D=&amp;release_year%5B0%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-81eGuZckjPQ3buJikytFNQNQ7dlj2m3r6HpbbuwqoKs&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI rating information</a></strong></em> has been leaked for an unreleased game in the popular Square Enix series. Titled Life is Strange: Reunion, it was rated 16 for violence, strong language, and drug use.</p>







<h2 id="h-reasoning-for-the-pegi-rating-in-life-is-strange-reunion">Reasoning For The PEGI Rating In Life Is Strange: Reunion</h2>



<p>The rating information notes that the game features a character realizing that her drink has been spiked, and she begins to experience hallucinations. There is also a recap from a previous game in the series, which includes a scene where a girl is shot in the torso.</p>



<p>Overall, the rating is in line with most other games in the franchise, excluding Life Is Strange 2, which was rated 18.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to the information, the game had a tentative release date of March 27, 2025, on the PlayStation 5. However, that time has clearly passed. The most recent release in the series was Life is Strange: Double Exposure, released in 2024.</p>







<p>Most recently, it was announced that a TV series based on the video game franchise would be coming to Amazon Prime Video. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-show-announced-prime-video/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

                <p>More than a decade after launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> will finally get cross-play, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios has confirmed it's actively working on the feature. However, it might still "be a while" until the feature is ready.</p><p dir="ltr">While cross-play has long been something ZeniMax Online has said it wants to do and has explored options for, this is the first time the developer has confirmed it's actually happening, though there is not yet a clear idea of when, exactly, the feature will arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while," ESO executive Susan Kath said as part of a virtual Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot ahead of the game's 2026 preview livestream. "Just to set the stage on that. We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it might still be a bit of a wait, Kath said players could potentially see some tests related to the feature by the end of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">The news came as part of recent livestream previewing the year ahead for the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG, which is moving to a seasonal content release model in 2026 in contrast to the yearly chapter (expansion) releases that have defined the game for most of its life.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, ESO players can only play with other players on their respective platforms, with separate servers for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players. ZeniMax Online has previously outlined the technical problems that have prevented cross-play up to this point, including issues stemming from the game being built without cross-play in mind, concerns surrounding each server's separate economies, problems around performance, and the fact that PC players can play with game-modifying add-ons that console players can't.</p><p dir="ltr">Cross-play was just one of the big announcements ZeniMax Online shared for its long-running MMO, as it also detailed what else players can expect in the months and year to come.</p><p dir="ltr">After a transitional 2025 that also saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">ZeniMax Online team hit by Microsoft layoffs</a> and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">unannounced MMO project Blackbird canceled</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/" data-ref-id="1100-6537219">2026 is the year ESO is going-all-in on seasons</a>, complete with the introduction of a battle pass system called Tamriel Tomes. The year will also see the introduction of several class reworks, new experimental zones and activities, the introduction of solo dungeons, and the addition of previously paid DLC content like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/" data-ref-id="1100-6537209">Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild into the base game for free</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is continuing to expand, as previously paid DLC content for the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more will soon become part of the base game for free.</p><p dir="ltr">In March with the game's Update 49, the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Imperial City, and Orsinium DLC will be folded into the base game and become accessible for all players. Closer to the end of the year, the Greymoor chapter will also become part of the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, ESO players need to subscribe to the game's optional ESO Plus membership (around $15 a month) or purchase each DLC separately using the game's premium currency, Crowns, in order to access the content outlined above.</p><p dir="ltr">Orsinium, released in 2015, added the homeland of the orcs and new dungeons for players to explore at the cost of 3,000 Crowns, or around $25. The Imperial City DLC, released in 2015 for 2,500 Crowns (roughly $20), saw players return to one of Oblivion's most iconic locations in an effort to stop Molag Bal's daedric forces from abusing the seat of power at the center of Tamriel.  Both the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild DLC released in 2016 for 2,000 Crowns each, translating to about $20 per DLC.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Dark Brotherhood DLC, players are able to join the shadowy organization of assassins and gain access to a new Assassin passive skill line that more easily allows for the murder of NPCs. Those who join the Thieves Guild gain access to sneaking-and-stealing-focused passive skills, allowing players to make more money from stolen goods and access special treasure troves hidden across Tamriel.</p><p dir="ltr">Greymoor, meanwhile, will be the biggest addition of the bunch when it becomes free sometime in the winter of 2026. The chapter originally released in 2020 and introduced the western regions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-skyrim/2900-5554/" data-ref-id="2900-5554">Skyrim</a>, where players can embark on a quest to stop an ancient vampire lord.</p><p dir="ltr">The news of previously premium DLC becoming free came as part of a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/" data-ref-id="1100-6537219">ESO 2026 roadmap</a> livestream. During the presentation, developer ZeniMax Online Studios outlined its plans for its MMORPG in the year ahead--one that includes a new seasonal focus, the addition of a battle pass, and class reworks. ESO's move to a seasonal model comes after a transitional 2025 that didn't see the release of a new chapter. Instead, 2025 saw the release of one experimental season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/" data-ref-id="1100-6528526">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>, that played out over the course of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to free DLC, ZeniMax Online also confirmed it's working to finally bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-finally-getting-cross-play-but-it-might-still-be-a-while/1100-6537192/" data-ref-id="1100-6537192">cross-play to ESO</a> in the future, though it sounds like it could still be a while before players on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation are able to play together.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> in 2026 will look quite different from previous years, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios goes all-in on the game's new seasonal model that will see all of the game's content updates arrive free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">For years, ESO has followed a familiar, fairly typical MMO pattern of yearly paid chapter (expansion) releases. Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.</p><p dir="ltr">ZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release</a>, labeling 2025 as a "transitional" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.The team also announced its long-term goals for the game, including that it's looking to finally introduce cross-play between platforms, as well as long-requested features such as guild mail and guild housing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631357" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631357"></a><figcaption>ESO's 2026 roadmap, which ZeniMax Online Studios stresses is still subject to change.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Game director Nick Giacomini said ZeniMax Online has heard from players that ESO's longrunning chapter-based structure had become "too formulaic," and jsaid it was also limiting from a development standpoint. Its move to a more seasonal model is in the name of being able to more quickly bring fresh ideas and gameplay to the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something players have been asking us to do for a really long time--to pause and work on addressing pain points, and build the future of ESO together," Giacomini said. "This is the beginning of a major shift, just like One Tamriel was a decade ago, where we are going to be making major changes, just in a completely different way."</p><p dir="ltr">Each season will be completely different, Giacomini said, all the while giving the team the flexibility to improve and iterate on parts of the core game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Goodbye Chapters, Hello Seasons</h2><p dir="ltr">As part of the seasonal model, all future content updates will be free, a major change from most of ESO's existence when players needed to buy new chapters or various DLC packs to experience most of the game's new content. Should future seasons add new zones, additional storylines, or new systems, all those additions will come to players free of charge. There will be four seasons a year, with each season lasting three months.</p><p dir="ltr">"In general, the things that were rolled out as chapters, those will just be game updates from now on," executive producer Susan Kath said.</p><p dir="ltr">ESO's transformation will begin with Update 49 in March, when it will bake the game's premium <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/" data-ref-id="1100-6537209">Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Imperial City and Orsinium DLCs into the base game</a>. That update will also mark the first time ZeniMax Online will release an ESO update simultaneously across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, the new normal going forward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630772"></a><figcaption>Season 0 will bring big changes to the Dragonknight class.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next, in April, ESO's first proper season will kick off. Titled Season 0, it will bring with it a major class update for Dragonknight that will see its skills and visuals reworked, as well as updates to the two-handed weapons skill line. Season 0 will also add a new experimental event zone called The Night Market.</p><p dir="ltr">This new zone is designed to be much harder than typical overworld combat in ESO (something the team is also looking to address later this year with a new Overland difficulty setting). It's a group-focused PvE zone where players are encouraged to group up and push farther and farther into the zone. Players will choose one of three factions to represent, earning rewards along the way. Those rewards will include a new upgradable house (the first to include a bank), as well as a new gameplay-effecting reward type ZeniMax Online is keeping quiet about for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the Night Market is billed as a limited-time event, it will return later in 2026 after its initial run. Should it prove popular, ZeniMax Online said it could potentially become a permanent feature.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Tamriel Tomes</h2><p dir="ltr">The release of Season 0 will also see the launch of the game's new battle pass system, called Tamriel Tomes. This system will replace the game's existing daily challenges and login rewards. Instead, there will be weekly and seasonal challenges (with the ability to re-roll unwanted weeklies) that will progress the battle pass as players complete them.</p><p dir="ltr">As players progress the tome, they'll be able to unlock free cosmetic rewards ranging from armor appearances to new skill styles, as well as currencies like Seals of Endeavor. In typical battle pass fashion, there will be a free version as well as $15 and $30 premium versions that come with additional cosmetics. Premium versions of the battle pass won't expire, allowing players to continue progressing them after the end of a season.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with Tamriel Tomes is the new Gold Coast Bazaar, a system that sounds similar to World of Warcraft's Trading Post. The bazaar will sell various cosmetics and former limited-time rewards, as well as some new ones. Items will rotate in and out but will be available for long durations, like the entirety of a season, Giacomini said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630773" data-ratio="0.56246648793566" data-width="1865" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630773"></a><figcaption>The Night Market will offer far greater challenges than ESO's typical content.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Items in the bazaar can be bought with a new currency, Trade Bars, earned primarily through Tamriel Tomes but also in small amounts in-game. While most of the available Trade Bars will be found in the free version of each seasonal battle pass, the paid versions of Tamriel Tomes will additionally include a small amount of the currency. But you won't be able to purchase Trade Bars directly with Crowns, ESO's premium currency.</p><p dir="ltr">"Over the years, we've introduced so many limited-time cosmetics...and if you missed them, it was either impossible to get them again, or we would re-introduce them unpredictably or inconsistently," Giacomini said. "The bazaar provides a consistent and reliable place for players to finally be able to claim these rewards."</p><p dir="ltr">The introduction of Tamriel Tomes and the Gold Coast Bazaar will bring some changes to ESO's optional subscription, ESO Plus. Its price won't change and no benefits are being removed, but additional benefits will be added, such as subscribers earning battle pass progress at an accelerated rate. Every month a player is subscribed to ESO Plus, they'll also earn credit towards a free premium Tamriel Tome upgrade that can be bought once 12 credits have been earned. These credits don't have to be earned consecutively, meaning players can subscribe to ESO off and on and still accumulate credits to eventually be used for a premium Tamriel Tome.</p><h2 dir="ltr">ESO's 2026 Roadmap</h2><p dir="ltr">As for future seasons, ZeniMax Online made clear it is treating its 2026 roadmap as a living document that may change or shift over the course of the year, but it does have plans for what later seasons will include. Season 1, slated for late summer, will introduce new Thieves Guild content, multi-stage world events, a new trial, and new story content centered around the fan-favorite daedric prince Sheoggorath. The season will also bring class updates to the Warden.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 is slated for the winter, and will include Sorcerer class updates, the introduction of solo dungeons (a single-player version of the game's existing group dungeons), large-scale world events in Skyrim, and a still-shrouded-in-secrecy High Seas of Tamriel event that will involve naval combat. It will additionally add the game's Greymoor chapter into the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest requests ESO players have had over the years is cross-play. In the past, the studio has outlined the difficulties posed by linking its players across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but it sounds like, at long last, it's doing the work to make that dream a reality. The only downside is that it sounds like cross-play might not be coming anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while, just to set the stage on that." Kath said. "We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630780"></a><figcaption>Updates in 2026 will bring faster riding skill training and higher furnishing limits for some homes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While cross-play may take some time to arrive, there are other quality-of-life changes coming sooner. Some of the changes coming ahead of Season 0 include account-wide outfit slots, the ability to respecc skills and attributes for free from the game's user interface, and equal experience points for the skills on players' back action bar. Other improvements coming include faster riding training, with the ability to raise the skill by three points at a time instead of one, and the power to upgrade backs from the UI rather than having to travel to a vendor. Higher furnishing limits are coming to some houses as well.</p><p dir="ltr">That's far from an exhaustive list, and even more "player experience improvements" are slated for later in the year, according to ZeniMax Online's roadmap. Judging from the whole roadmap, each season looks wildly different from the last. That's by design, as Kath said the goal is for there to not be a "typical season" blueprint the studio is following. It's a sentinment Giacomini echoed.</p><p dir="ltr">"The key difference is variety and choice," Giacomini said. "We want to be building what's important to you, the players, and we believe this new model is the best way to do so."</p><p dir="ltr">More details regarding launch dates for ESO's Season 0, and new content like the Night Market, will be revealed in the coming months. ZeniMax Online studio director Rich Lambert said last year he wants ESO to be a "30-year MMO. However, he said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-studio-wants-to-make-other-games/1100-6534748/" data-ref-id="1100-6534748">studio does still want to make other games</a>, despite Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceling an unannounced new MMO</a> from the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">codenamed Blackbird</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Seasons are coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> on 2nd April, as Bethesda look to make the biggest shakeup to the MMORPG’s continued development in a long, long time. Chapters are out with quarterly Seasons coming in, bringing all new content and features for free to all players, and a new battle pass system known as Tamriel Tomes. Oh, and all updates will now be launched simultaneously across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to cover, so let’s get exploring everything announced during the stream.</p>

<p>Going from Chapters to Seasons will come with a transition period. Season Zero launches in April and will be followed by Season One and Two later this year on a three month cadence.</p>



<p>Compared to Chapters, this means you will still see quarterly updates for the ESO, but the team point to this switch to seasons letting be more fluid and reactive to fan feedback and game needs, as opposed to the strict annual roadmaps that the team had worked to previously with the one major focal point in June of each year. That the shift to seasons was <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321">announced in December 2024</a> and is only coming to fruition in early 2026 is a sign of how inflexible this could be.</p>

<p>What will a Season contain? Well it could be new zones and storylines, it could be new events, a new or revamped class, skill line or system, a broad range of quality of life improvements, or some mixture of all of these.</p>
<h2>ESO Season Zero</h2>
<p>Starting with Season Zero the team are looking to blend a mixture of new features and revisiting older content. Update 49 will release on 9th March and precede the main Season Zero launch on 2nd April. This will then run through to 8th July.</p>
<p>The first ever group event zone in TESO will be added in the form of The Night Market –&nbsp;running from 29th April through June as a trial run that could see this return or become permanent. This PvE zone in Fargrave is designed to be genuinely difficulty to overcome, and while you don’t need to be in a guild to head there, but it will help if you’re in one, while there are unique rewards such as a new house to earn.</p>

<p>This comes alongside a new PvP progression system and the first iteration of a new overland difficulty setting, to up the challenge of simply getting around the world.</p>
<h2>Classic Content Revamps</h2>
<p>Alongside new content is the focus on raising the bar of quality. Visual refreshes and balance updates are going to rollout across the classes and combat styles, starting with the Dragonknight and two-handed weapon skill lines, continuing with the Werewolf, Warden and Sorcerer through the quarterly updates. Each Season will come with one main class to focus on, but smaller improvements sprinkled throughout. The aim is to make a single class more viable without needing to multi-class.</p>

<p>Core quality of life improvements will make outfits possible account-wide, as well as making skill and attribute respecs free within the UI, back bar XP, faster rider training, increased furnishing limits, and plenty more down the line, including guild housing, hybridisation and cross-play.</p>
<h2>OK, so where’s the battle pass, then?</h2>
<p>Of course, all of this still needs paying for in some fashion, and so there’s the new Tamriel Tomes battle pass with both free and premium tracks of rewards for new armour, weapon styles, crates and more. Daily login rewards are out to help reduce some of the FOMO, and you’ll be able to progress through the ranks with a mixture of weekly and seasonal points from questing, trials, PvP, crafting, dungeons and more –&nbsp;you’ll be able to re-roll weeklies that you dislike, to some extent.</p>

<p>There’s also the Gold Coast Bazaar, which will let you buy rewards including some previously time limited ones, with a steady pace to the shop refreshes. This use the Trade Bars earned through the Tamriel Tome (mostly on the free track) and from some other in-game activities.</p>
<p>Curiously, ESO Plus remains, and will continue to feature all of the standalone expansion contents of before, but the appeal of this optional subscription will be reduced. The main bonuses are accelerated Tome Point earning, and you’ll be able to get a free premium plus upgrade once a year for the Tamriel Tomes.</p>
<h2>Is this a good or bad thing for ESO?</h2>
<p>All in all, this could be a really positive move for The Elder Scrolls Online. There’s always the fear with battle passes that they become all-consuming engagement traps, and compared to older expansion pack models, seasons can often feel much less significant – it’s already been confirmed that you won’t see big new landmasses, but that the game will have smaller additions and look to revisit areas.</p>
<p>The benefit, though, is that this change helps to reduce the mental burden of stepping into a decade-old game and understanding what you need to buy to get the latest experience. Now it will (mostly) just all be there. And for existing players? The developers getting to be more responsive to feedback and making game changes more publicly and speedily is only a good thing.</p>

			<p>Over a year ago, <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-switch-from-yearly-chapters-to-seasonal-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that its MMORPG <strong>Elder Scrolls Online</strong> would transition from the expansion-like Chapter model to a seasonal model. However, 2025 was a transitional year in which the so-called <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-to-add-subclassing-and-seasons-of-the-worm-cult-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a></strong> still retained some elements of the Chapter model.</p>



<p>It is only now that the studio is launching the proper Seasons model, which will go live on <strong>April 2, 2026</strong>, with <strong>Season Zero: Dawn and Dusk</strong>. The reveal came today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3KEv1KkCZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a livestream</a> that we at Wccftech, alongside other outlets, were able to watch in advance.</p>



<p>Right away, one big change is that for the first time in the history of Elder Scrolls Online, an update (specifically <strong>Update 49</strong>) will be released simultaneously on PC and consoles. This is a necessary first step toward cross-play, which the studio is still working on, although it will take some time to achieve it.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons-Roadmap_Infographic-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Game Director <strong>Nick Giacomini</strong>, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-qa-zos-leadership-change-game-alive-30-years-unfortunate-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a> after he took over from <strong>Rich Lambert</strong>, emphasized that the team has frequently heard from players that the game has become more predictable lately. This change <strong>can make the game more rewarding and exciting</strong>, he said, and the Chapter model limited ZOS because it took a long time to produce, leaving little room to react to player feedback or address longstanding issues.</p>



<p>Updates and content will still arrive quarterly, but ZOS is moving Elder Scrolls Online away from the templated and stale release cadence of a dungeon pack, a new featured zone, another dungeon pack, and so on. This model also lets the developers keep iterating on the core game. Perhaps one of the most significant changes is that <strong>all new content coming to the game will be free starting with Season Zero</strong>. No longer will there be barriers to playing a new Trial or dungeon with friends. </p>



<p>The goal is that each season may look completely different. Seasons will happen four times a year, be three months long, and each will contain a <strong>Tamriel Tome</strong> and access to the <strong>Gold Coast Bazaar</strong>. Tamriel Tomes are the game's version of a Battle Pass. </p>



<p>Each season has a unique Tome available for the full season. Everyone has access to the free version and progresses by completing weekly and seasonal challenges to earn Tome Points, unlocking pages and choosing rewards. By the way, ZeniMax Online Studios is reworking Daily Login Rewards and the Endeavors system within Tamriel Tomes. There are also <strong>two paid premium upgrade options for Tamriel Tomes</strong>. These unlock additional tiers of rewards (cosmetics, personalities, mounts). With the premium options, players can continue unlocking pages even after the season ends.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Tamriel-Tomes_Infographic.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The <strong>Gold Coast Bazaar</strong>, on the other hand, is a new in-game store dedicated to earnable rewards. This is a consistent place to claim limited-time cosmetics you might have missed in the past (events, Twitch drops, etc.), which is something the Elder Scrolls Online community had long requested. Items in the Bazaar are purchased with <strong>Trade Bars</strong>, which are earned primarily in the Tamriel Tomes but also through regular gameplay.</p>



<p>The developers also revealed they're getting rid of <strong>Event Tickets</strong>. Players with existing Event Tickets will receive Trade Bars in exchange. Unlike Event Tickets, there is <strong>no cap</strong> on how many Trade Bars you can hold. Trade Bars cannot be purchased with Crowns; they must be earned by playing.</p>



<p>What about <strong>ESO Plus</strong>, the current subscription model? Well, it's staying. Its price won't change and subscribers will accumulate one token for every 12 months they are subscribed, which they can use to unlock one Premium track for a Tamriel Tome of their choice. They also get a monthly grant of Tamriel Tome points and an accelerated earning rate for earning those in the game.</p>



<p>When it comes to content, Season Zero's highlight will be the first-ever <strong>Event Zone: </strong>the<strong> Night Market</strong>. This limited-time PvE zone set in <strong>Fargrave</strong> will be much more challenging than the usual zone, requiring players to group up (organically) to succeed. The zone also features a faction system. Players align with one of three factions, and there is a competition to see which faction makes the most progress. Of course, there will be various rewards, and even a brand new house with a <strong>Bank included inside</strong> for the first time. The Night Market will be available in the game from April 29 through mid-June, although the developers have opened up to the possibility of bringing it back and possibly making it permanent. Additionally, a first iteration of the optional <strong>Overland difficulty system</strong> is coming toward the end of Season Zero.</p>



<p>A new PvE group Trial called <strong>Crimson Veldt</strong> will be released in Season One, while Season Two will see the introduction of <strong>Solo Dungeons</strong>. These are one-man versions of existing dungeons, starting with <strong>Moon Hunter Keep</strong> and <strong>March of Sacrifices</strong>. Season One will also add new stories and quests based on the <strong>Thieves Guild</strong> and the Mad Daedric Prince, <strong>Sheogorath</strong>.</p>



<p>Throughout the year and beyond, the team has committed to a series of visual and combat improvements (including reduced floatiness) to enhance visuals for class and weapon abilities and improve class identity. It will start with the <strong>Dragonknight</strong> class and two-handed skill-line, then the <strong>Werewolf</strong> skill-line at the end of Season Zero, the <strong>Warden</strong> class in Season One, the <strong>Sorcerer</strong> class in Season Two, and so on.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ESO_Seasons_CombatRefresh_FieryBreath-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>But that's not all. The roadmap reveals that Season One will introduce <strong>multi-stage, dynamic world events for the first time in Elder Scrolls Online</strong>, as well as a new system called the <strong>Sage Vault</strong>. Moreover, Season Zero adds the first full-fledged <strong>PvP progression system</strong> to the MMORPG, and the studio said they are making big investments in Player-versus-Player content, including bringing back <strong>three-sided Battlegrounds</strong>, fixing spawn camping issues in maps like Mor Khazgu, adding ways to get around the Cyrodiil RvR map faster, and fixing Alessia, Ash, and Chalman keeps to stop players from <em>slingshotting </em>into inner keeps.</p>



<p>Before Season Zero: Dusk and Dawn, Update 49 will go live on <strong>March 9, 2026</strong> with the following quality of life improvements:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Free Respecs:</strong> You can respec skills and attributes directly from the UI at no cost.</li>



<li><strong>Guild Traders:</strong> Return to the 30-day listing window.</li>



<li><strong>Outfit Slots:</strong> These are becoming account-wide.</li>



<li><strong>Riding Training:</strong> Faster training duration.</li>



<li><strong>Attribute Points:</strong> You can now add stat increases in bulk (three at a time) rather than one by one.</li>



<li><strong>Mounts for Gold:</strong> Adding a brand new mount for gold and moving 16 existing Crown Store mounts to be purchasable with gold.</li>



<li><strong>Housing Limits:</strong> Furnishing limits are being increased on over half of the houses. ESO Plus members get an additional boost to limits.</li>



<li><strong>Antiquities:</strong> Longer exploration times and increased duration across all difficulties.</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, the team let it slip that it is working on <strong>Guild Mail</strong>, which the Guild Masters would definitely love, and <strong>Guild Housing</strong>, which everyone in a guild would appreciate.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Back in September, studio game director Rich Lambert told GamesIndustry.biz that the Elder Scrolls Online team were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-online-is-switching-from-chapters-to-bite-sized-updates-in-the-wake-of-microsofts-awful-layoffs">exploring a move from big expansions to smaller, more frequent updates</a>. Jump ahead four months and, well, that's exactly what they're doing.</p>
<p>Wait, stop running away from me, I'm not bringing you old news reheated like the last of the (now decidedly whiffy) Christmas turkey leftovers, I come bearing fresh details like… a freshly cooked turkey that is seasoned with patch notes and battlepass infographics.</p>
<p>Yum.</p>
<!--more-->
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ahead of the break for Christmas I was given details of the first three seasons coming in 2026 and then swiftly sworn to secrecy under threat of murder by the Dark Brotherhood. Thankfully that contract has now expired and that blade at my back sheathed. I can tell you that it's not just the cadence and scale of releases that's changing. All these new seasonal updates will be free for players, whether they're playing through Game Pass or paid up ESO Plus members.</p><p>On April 2, Zenimax Online Studios will release Season Zero for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. This will then be followed by Season One in July and Season Two in October. Gone are the days of the 12 - 18 month wait between major expansions, and in their place is a new season model that sees smaller updates released every three months.</p>
<p>"We've heard from players that the game has become predictable and too formulaic," game director Nick Giaomini said at the pre-Christmas briefing. Adding that the chapter model was partly to blame: "It took 18 months, longer than that, to do. It was all hands on deck to support. That lead time just didn't really leave much room to react to player feedback or address long standing issues."</p>
<p>Unlike the chapter expansions, which contained broad baskets of new toys for all types of players, such as new areas to explore, storylines to follow, dungeons to crawl, and classes to unlock, seasons will be less generous but more focused. This change, Giaomini said, will give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."</p>
<p>You can see something of that more bitesized approach in ESO's first three upcoming seasons, which make changes and additions across the game, not only focused in a new region.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In Season Zero, coming in April, there is a new PvE area called The Night Market, the introduction of a battle pass called Tamriel Tomes, a PvP progression system for Vengeance players, and new difficulty options for players wanting to up the challenge in overland areas. Alongside these new toys, the team is also providing an art and balance refresh for the Dragonknight class and the two-handed weapon skill tree. Later in the season there will also be a similar update to the Werewolf class.</p><p>Then, in July's Season Two update, alongside new quests for the Thieves Guild, multi-stage co-op world events, and a new trial called the Crimson Veldt, the team is working on a similar balance and art refresh for the Warden Class.</p>
<p>October's Season Three brings a new dungeon, dynamic world events, and a refresh for the Sorcerer class.</p>
<p>The updates remind me of Ubisoft's approach to Rainbox Six Siege Seasons. After the shooter got a little long in the tooth, they slowed the expansion of the game and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rainbow-six-siege-operation-health">announced Operation Health</a>. Ubisoft used each new season as an opportunity to overhaul older maps and characters to better fit in with all the new content that had been released in the years since. It was a healthy change, and meant that characters released early in the Siege's history and fell out of use gained a second wind.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This shift to seasons also sees many of the previous expansions – the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Orsinium, and the Imperial City – rolled into the base game. Previously, you had to buy these as separate DLC or be a paying ESO Plus member. Naturally, Zenimax isn't doing this out of the goodness of its heart. Seasons brings a new way for you to spend your coin in the Elder Scrolls Online.</p><p>Tamriel Tomes is ESO's new battle pass system. A new Tome is released each season and it brings an unlock track where you can earn rewards by completing certain challenges within the game. Challenges might mean completing certain dungeons, crafting certain items, or competing in PvP. Complete the challenges, earn points, and spend those points on rewards. Those rewards are largely cosmetic, with new armour sets, furnishings for your homes, and Seals of Endeavour (the in-game currency you use to buy Crown Crate items).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bethesda Softworks / Zenimax Online Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While there is a free Tamriel Tomes battle pass, there are also two paid upgrades which unlock extra tiers and rewards to be earned in each season. However, the unlocks don't have to be earned within the season's timespan, which is a bit of a blessing.</p>
<p>The shadow over all of these changes is that Microsoft gutted the studio back in July, when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laid off more than 9000 employees</a> across the corporation. Zenimax staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">described the cuts at the time</a> as "inhumane", coming swiftly and giving little opportunity for fired workers to even say goodbye. The team was working on a new project, codenamed Blackbird, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">which was cancelled as part of the downsizing</a>.</p><p>What Giaomini says about a shift to seasonal releases allowing the remaining team to be more nimble sounds sensible, but I do wonder how much of it is a necessary shift as a result of a much reduced workforce. Would the ability to maintain the MMO and create the amount of content included in a new expansion simply have been impossible following the cuts? I'm due to speak with someone at Zenimax next week, where hopefully I'll find out more.</p>

		<p>Ubisoft, which received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/">€1.16bn investment in 2025 from Tencent,</a>&nbsp; have closed its studio in Halifax, Canada, with the shutdown coming just a few weeks after the employees voted to unionise.&nbsp; The studio had been running for over ten years.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” said a Ubisoft spokesperson. </span><span data-testid="content-text">“As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Employees at Ubisoft Halifax formed a union under CWA Canada, which also includes employees from Bethesda Montreal, on December 18th, 2025. 74% of the staff voted in favour of the move.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">“In an era marked by industry-wide uncertainty, studio closures, layoffs, and increasing instability, we want to make clear our commitment to one another and to our craft,” they stated at the time.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">CWA Canada has not made any official comment about the timing of the two events, but is “demanding information”. “Today’s news is devastating,” commented CWA Canada president, Carmel Smyth. “We will pursue every legal recourse to ensure that the rights of these workers are respected and not infringed in any way.”</p>

<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Rockstar Games was recently accused of ‘union busting’ after firing 30 employees who belonged to a union, stating that the employees were fired for sharing company information in a public forum. This has been denied by the staff.</p>
<p data-testid="content-paragraph">Following the dismissals last week, the&nbsp;<a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/">IWGB branded it</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;“a brazen act of illegal union busting”, with IWGB president Alex Marshall calling it “a calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions.”</p>

			<p><strong>StarCraft</strong> is reportedly making a comeback at <strong>BlizzCon 2026</strong>, with a recent report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond">Jez Corden at Windows Central</a> pointing to <strong>Blizzard</strong> unveiling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-allegedly-incubating-a-starcraft-shooter/">long-rumoured third-person StarCraft shooter</a> at this year's convention.</p>



<p>Corden's report covering the upcoming year for Xbox included several claims as to what we'll see from Microsoft and Xbox in 2026, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/">Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas remasters</a> and a claim (which was corroborated by a separate outlet) <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">that MachineGames has Wolfenstein 3 in development</a>.</p>



<p>When it comes to Blizzard, Corden claimed that BlizzCon 2026 is where we'll see reveals for World of Warcraft's next expansion and updates on both Overwatch and Hearthstone and potentially new mobile titles. But none of that will be the 'big' announcement from the show, with Corden instead claiming that title will go to the reveal of the third-person StarCraft shooter coming from Blizzard.</p>



<p>"<em>The headline for BlizzCon 2026 is most likely going to be StarCraft. It was previously reported that StarCraft is getting the third-person shooter treatment, and I confirmed these rumours true via my own sources a while back</em>," Corden writes.</p>



<p>A third-person shooter set in the StarCraft world is the exact kind of project that has the potential to bring the StarCraft franchise back to life, since it has seemingly remained dormant for over a decade. The last major release in the franchise was StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, which arrived back in July 2010 and was followed by three DLC expansions, the last of which was released in 2016. The last time we saw a new StarCraft release at all was 2017 with the release of StarCraft Remastered.</p>



<p>Since then, Blizzard has seemingly dedicated its focus to Overwatch 2, Diablo IV and World of Warcraft over returning to the popular sci-fi RTS series. A new third-person shooter would be the culmination of years spent waiting for fans who never got over the cancellation of StarCraft: Ghost, and the thing to bring back the franchise ahead of the next RTS title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-not-blizzard-will-reportedly-be-making-the-next-starcraft-game/">which we last heard would be coming from Nexon instead of Blizzard</a>.</p>



<p>Hopefully, when BlizzCon 2026 rolls around, we'll have a new shooter to look forward to.</p>

I dove headlong into the RPG upon release, spending every spare moment I could in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246#:~:text=the%20citizens%20of-,Lumiose%20City,-.%20It%E2%80%99s%20a%20Pidgey"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, but now that I’m nearly done with everything the game has to offer, I’m starting to feel my running and jumping through the streets of its Paris-inspired setting shift to a light jog.&nbsp; As I catch the last few monsters in the expansion’s dex and cross off the remaining sidequests, my steps slow as I wait for my Mega Raichu, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>flying behind me like he’s Superman, to catch up</span></a><span>, savoring a few more seconds with his golden, two-tailed, superpowered form.</span></p> <p><span>A friend of mine who also happens to be one of the biggest </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>fans I’ve ever known was visiting me in New York City a few months back, and I was surprised to learn that she hadn’t finished 2024’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA."><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i></a><span>, despite being positive on it. She explained that, especially after everything that’s happened to BioWare in the past year, she felt like seeing the credits roll on this latest entry would mean the end of a “moment” of her life, as </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>future seems murky</span></a><span> at best. I kind of understood, but part of me is also of the mind that seeing something through to the end is only half the experience. Sitting with it and examining its complexities is just as important. But eventually, you exhaust yourself of all that reflection and move on to something else. My reluctance to put </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>in the rearview mirror is helping me understand where she was coming from, and why people often opt not to finish games they deeply admire and enjoy. It is comforting knowing that you haven’t hit that endpoint yet, even if it means you’re depriving yourself of something you love.</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve been writing about </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>for months here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, and I can feel that part of me that loves to critically analyze and engage with these games preparing to move on as next month’s inevitable Generation X announcement on Pokémon Day approaches. This game has been a really compelling experiment , letting Game Freak play around with real-time battles and a single-city setting, and I truly wish the studio would release another major DLC expansion or </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> to keep it going. But I also recognize it’s done what it needed to do. I don’t need more for more’s sake. In fact, with most video game franchises, I prefer things to go away forever after they’ve run their course.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657801"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657801">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is a weird outlier for me on that front as I’m always down to explore a new place in this universe, and since Game Freak took a year without a new game or DLC pack in 2024, the gap between </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s expansions and </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> felt painfully long. So even if </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>hadn’t given Raichu two much needed Mega Evolutions, I would have been squeezing every drop of Pokéjuice out of this game. But on top of that, my superhero rat just got here, and I would be surprised if Mega Evolution showed up in the next pair of RPGs we’re probably getting our first glimpse of next month.</span></p>

 <p><span>I put over 120 hours into </span><i><span>Legends Z-A</span></i><span> and its DLC. I had Mega Raichu by my side for about 60 of those hours, and that still doesn’t feel like enough. Raichu and I will inevitably meet up again in the next game, but it sure hurts knowing I waited all this time to have him Mega Evolve just for it to only last a couple of months before we move on. Lumiose City may not be pretty to look at, but I still love hanging out with its weird citizens who say odd shit and love this metropolis with all their heart. I’m not ready to say goodbye just yet.</span></p>

 <p><span>So now, to make it last just a little bit longer, all I can do is bide my time. I’m booting up my Switch 2 less often. I’m doing menial tasks and wandering in places I’ve already seen dozens of times. As long as there’s an incomplete quest or a Pokémon I haven’t added to my Pokédex, I have a reason to come back. The knowledge that it’s not over is somehow more comforting than having one less game on my backlog list.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Consoles used to come in fun colors, sometimes with transparent shells and other wild features. Those days are long gone, and now we mostly get stuck with black and white consoles with a few limited color options for accessories. So I’m happy to see Sony announcing some genuinely cool-looking console covers and controllers for the PlayStation 5 arriving in March.</p> <p>On January 7, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">PlayStation unveiled its Hyperpop Collection</a>, which features three vibrant new PS5 console covers and controllers. You can get a PS5 shell or Dualsense gamepad in Techno Red, Remix Green, and/or Rhythm Blue. Silly names aside, these console shells look awesome, sporting a gradient design that goes from black on the top to a vibrant color at the bottom, assuming you have your PS5 standing up next to your TV.</p>

  <p>However, what I really find exciting are the three new controllers, which also sport the same black to color gradient pattern. These things look sick as heck, and I want one right now to replace the boring black Dualsense controller I’ve been using for a bit now.</p>

 <p>Sony says the console covers will cost $75, and the Hyperpop Dualsense controllers will be priced at $85. That’s $10 more than a standard Dualsense, which is annoying. But that gradient design is soooo good that I’m willing to pay the extra price. I’ll just consider it a cool tax.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a bit before I can get my hands on that Remix Green Dualsense controller. The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12, 2026, with Sony starting pre-orders for the slick-looking hardware on January 16, 2026 at select retailers and on PlayStation’s official store.</p>

Fans have spent the time since the December 16 launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-goes-live-alongside-big-170-patch-notes"><u>update 1.7.0</u></a> (a.k.a. Cold Snap) theorizing about what the new year may hold while sharing any new concerns with Embark. Although The Goalie Raider Deck helped tide players over late last month, the lack of a firm 2026 roadmap has left some fans curious about what’s to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One player tapped into some of their more pressing issues and shared them with Embark yesterday. They specifically take issue with what they believe is a “lack of urgency” at the studio, calling for communication and tweaks for Stella Montis, cheaters, the skill tree, Trigger Nades, and more. Birdie replied, and while not every point was addressed, it seems Embark has plans to tackle balance changes sooner rather than later – and a Trigger Nade nerf may be on the docket.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The holidays delayed things a bit, but the dev team want you to know that they are looking into balance, for example, the stitcher, kettle, and trigger nade,” the community manager explained. “Rest assured that we hear you and work on delivering a good gaming experience, things are just not immediate.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The shape these nerfs will take remains unclear for now, leaving some players concerned that they’ll do more harm than good before actually evening the playing field. It’s also unclear if the next Arc Raiders update will feature some of these teased balance adjustments, but it’s least being looked into as Embark gets back into the swing of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s Arc Raiders news is a far cry from the 2026 roadmap fans have been hoping to see. While we wait for something more concrete from the team, you can read about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-arc-raiders-movie-and-tv-show-offers-are-already-coming-in-and-the-boss-of-embark-studios-sounds-up-for-it"><u>why some fans are expecting to eventually see an Arc Raiders movie and TV show</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Another entry in the Wolfenstein franchise may be on the way, according to multiple reports today. Specifically, a Wolfenstein 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The possibility was first mentioned by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Central today</a> as part of a 2026 Xbox predictions piece, and was corroborated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku</a>. No hard details were provided, just that the game is in development with Machine Games and, per Windows Central, may be timed to coincide with the already-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wolfenstein-series-in-development-at-amazon-with-fallout-show-team-attached">Wolfenstein TV series with Amazon</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This would be Machine Games' first return to Wolfenstein since 2019's Wolfenstein: Young Blood, which saw series protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz's twin daughters searching for him in France and, of course, fighting the Nazis. Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, was all the way back in 2017, so a third Wolfenstein game would be a long-awaited return indeed. Of course, MachineGames has been a bit busy lately, helping out on Doom: Legacy of Rust and developing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Windows Central also suggests the studio may be working on a "Rainbow Six Siege-like multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wolfenstein reports also aren't a huge shock, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">Machine Games studio head Jerk Gustafsson said</a> just this past September that the series was always meant to be a trilogy, and that "we're not done with Wolfenstein yet." A third game would presumably find a way to wrap up B.J. Blazkowicz's story, and would almost certainly find a way to wrap up the ongoing battle against the Nazis. It's unclear if it would take place before or after Young Blood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Young Blood, we weren't the biggest fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/25/wolfenstein-youngblood-review">giving it a 6.5/10 </a>and calling it "an aggressively okay co-op shooter that doesn’t come close to recapturing the joy of its predecessor’s action or its surprisingly interesting characters and story." We did, however, love The New Colossus, saying it's "a fantastic single-player shooter" with "brilliantly written characters and performances" in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/28/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review">our 9.1/10 review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Mojang Studios has shared a first look at its upcoming baby mob remasters, which is currently being tested. When the update is finished, the dev team promises that the wolf pups, kittens, piglets, calves, baby chickens, baby ocelots, lambs, and baby rabbits will be "even chunkier, floofier, and more charming than ever before."</p><p>In the accompanying announcement video, game director Agnes Larsson explains that previous baby mobs were just scaled down versions of the adult creatures.

"But now baby mobs have just one which creates a new vibe for them, which is just adorable."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/first-features-minecraft-cutest-drop-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">devs also revealed</a> that players will be able to name their baby mobs with craftable labels using paper and any metal nugget.

                <p>If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence. Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report on the site TipRanks</a> said that Microsoft is "considering massive layoffs" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whatlayoff.com/post/3mbtiwjmgtz2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2008806488190709970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2008865530749571146" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purported that the news was "false"</a> on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X. Shaw--who's been at the company for nearly 17 years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fxshaw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to his LinkedIn</a>--chimed in to dismiss the report as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100 percent made up / speculative / wrong.</p>  — Frank X.

However, Shaw has responded to a lot of the commentary, saying that he, too, "<a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/2008942834754441434" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eagerly awaits</a>" the news that he claims is wrong.</p><p>None of this is to say that layoffs at Microsoft may not happen in some future. The company has gone through a myriad of job cuts recently. This just underscores that you can't believe everything you read online, as some--if not most--of it is engagement bait.</p><p>That said, Microsoft has cut jobs at the company recently. In early July 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">laid off roughly 9,000 employees</a>, with Xbox head Phil Spencer calling the cuts "necessary" for the company's enduring success. As a result of these cuts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">several games were canceled and studios were closed</a> so that the company could "increase agility and effectiveness," Spencer said at the time. Despite those layoffs, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">Microsoft still reached a valuation of $4 trillion</a> in late July 2025.</p>

			<p><strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Dynamic Multi Frame Generation</strong> was undoubtedly the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest gaming-related announcement</a> made by the world's largest company (by market cap) at <strong>CES 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After years of trailing behind NVIDIA in the upscaling department, AMD finally delivered a worthy competitor with <strong>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4</strong> in 2025, with the year ending on a high note <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-redstone-official-200-games-supported-3x-performance-boost-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the <strong>Redstone</strong> update</a> that injected FSR with a machine learning algorithm, as well as delivering an improved <strong>Frame Generation</strong> algorithm and the brand new <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong> (an analog to NVIDIA's <strong>DLSS Ray Reconstruction</strong>) and <strong>Radiance Caching</strong> (seemingly similar to NVIDIA's <strong>Neural Radiance Cache</strong>, although it is not yet ready for release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fsr-radiance-caching-requires-further-development-optimization-is-not-currently-planned-release-darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed by the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>).</p>



<p>Less than a month later, NVIDIA answered in kind with the release of its <strong>second-generation transformer model</strong> for the DLSS Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 has been trained on a much larger and higher-fidelity dataset, and as such, utilizes five times the compute power; that's why the initial tests have shown older <strong>GeForce RTX</strong> graphics cards struggling with it.</p>



<p>Luckily, those PC users can still use the older models, either the CNN one or the first-gen transformer model, which run games noticeably faster. NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 is not really about increased speed - that's what Dynamic Multi Frame Generation helps with, but more on that later - <strong>it is instead about delivering the highest possible quality</strong>. This model demonstrates its power through a deeper understanding of game scenes and a more intelligent use of game engine pixel sampling and motion data, delivering output images with improved lighting, sharper visuals (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as demonstrated in an early <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> comparison</a>), and enhanced motion clarity.</p>



<p>We had our very own CEO, Abdullah Saad, attending CES 2026 and checking out the various NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 demos available at the booth. He was particularly impressed by the lighting improvement delivered by the new transformer model in the game <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>, and the NVIDIA rep explained:</p>



<p><em>There's a very technical reason for that. The engine does the math in what's called physical space, which is like how the physics actually operates. It's not thinking in terms of gamma and stuff like that. It's thinking basically in real life math, like the light goes here, this light is at this amount of nits, and then at some point down the pipeline, it gets tone-mapped and ported to your display. The older DLSS, preset K, is accumulating the data at the end of that, so after tone mapping. It's losing some of that data, the highlights for example, and it's accumulating on that. TAA (Temporal AntiAliasing) can also have that problem, but here we move the new one closer to the engine so it's seeing more of what the engine is trying to show as far as the lighting goes, so it's losing less of that highlight detail.</em></p>



<p>In more technical terms, the previous upscaling algorithm worked in logarithmic space to mitigate flickering, but resulted in muted lighting, clipped details, and crushed shadows in high-contrast scenes. Now, DLSS 4.5 Super Resolution trains and infers directly in linear space, the same space used by games, and is thus capable of allowing glowing neon signs and bright reflections to retain their full color range and detail. This could be an indirect been to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-hdr-gaming-interview-veteran-developer-explains-its-sad-state-and-how-hes-coming-to-its-rescue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR gaming</a></strong> under NVIDIA DLSS 4.5.</p>

<p>The other half of the NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 announcement, Dynamic Multi Frame Generation, won't be available publicly before Spring 2026, but it could be tested at the NVIDIA CES 2026 booth. Beyond unlocking <strong>6X mode</strong> (five additional frames rendered apart from the real one), the update will also introduce <strong>an intelligent system capable of targeting your specific display's maximum refresh rate</strong>. </p>



<p>In the CES 2026 demo (featuring <strong>Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2</strong> game), the system was shown targeting the 240Hz of the 1440p display on hand. The NVIDIA rep stated:</p>



<p><em>If you went to a scene where it went up to 300 FPS, you'd see it lowering the multiplier because you'd be generating frames that are just being thrown out, right? This is a smarter way to use it. If you go up to one of the windows, the scene will get a lot lighter. You'll see your frame rate go up, and then it'll start lowering the multiplier because it'll know that you don't need that much frame generation. If you go over here, your frame rate will drop because this is a more intense scene and it's going to start raising the multiplier again.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA also promises <strong>improvements in frame pacing and better accuracy in rendering in-game user interfaces</strong>, as shown in the official video above. The former will be particularly important, although we'll have to wait for its public release to test it. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the popular <strong>DLSS Swapper</strong> tool <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-swapper-version-1-2-3-1-released-with-support-for-dlss-4-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has just been updated to support NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</a>.</p>

Not suitable for persons under 16 years of age.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Brief Outline of the Game</strong></p><p>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</p><p><strong>Content Specific Issues</strong></p><p>This game features depictions of the use of illegal drugs. During a party scene, the player is offered wine and is given the option to take a sip. The player character realizes that she has been spiked from the drink that she sipped on and is experiencing hallucinations. Images on screen become distorted and a scene plays out with the character seeing strange images. A character tells the hallucinating character that she is “tripping balls.” It is then explained that she is high on mushrooms. There are also depictions of strong, realistic violence. In the opening scene, the game recaps the previous games from the series which includes a scene where a girl is shot in the torso before she is then seen lying on the ground with blood seeping through her shirt. Much of the violence in the game is implied; a building is set on fire and people are heard inside screaming for help. This game also contains the use of strong language, including ‘fuck.’ Milder bad language is also present, including ‘asshole,’ ‘piss,’ and ‘shit.’</p><p><strong>Other Issues</strong></p><p>This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items in the form of new outfits and a digital deluxe upgrade, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers, or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are images in the game which may be scary to younger players, including scenes of dead bodies with no blood or injury detail and human skeletons. Some sexual innuendo is found in the game. When the player goes to a party, another character tells them that someone didn’t show up as their “girlfriend thought this was an orgy.” Suicide is referenced in the game frequently, but no depictions are shown.</p></blockquote><p>Thanks, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q6nkau/new_possible_life_is_strange_game_leaked_life_is/" target="_blank">r/GamingLeaksandRumours</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/life-is-strange-reunion-rated-in-europe]]></content:encoded>

                <p>MachineGames is working on a third new Wolfenstein game to follow 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order and 2017's Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. This is according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, both of which said the game is happening but had no other details to share.</p><p>This would be the first new Wolfenstein game since Wolfenstein: Youngblood and the VR game Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, both of which were released in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-dev-hopes-to-return-to-the-franchise/1100-6534556/" data-ref-id="1100-6534556">In September 2025</a>, MachineGames creative director Axel Torvenius said he wanted to continue the story of William "B.J." Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," Torvenius said in a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>If MachineGames is indeed working on a third Wolfenstein game in its trilogy, it could be announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">this month's Xbox Developer Direct </a>or the expected Xbox summer showcase, though these are both just guesses.</p><p>Beyond a possible new Wolfenstein game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Prime Video is producing a live-action Wolfenstein TV series</a>. It's still early days, though, and there is no word on any specifics about the show.</p><p>The Wolfenstein titles take place in an alternate timeline where Germany won World War II after they discovered advanced technology. The Wolfenstein video game series has been around since 1981, and 1992's Wolfenstein 3D from developer Id Software is credited as one of the key games that helped popularize first-person shooters in the '90s.</p>
