			<p>This week, several Polish websites <a href="https://www.gram.pl/news/microsoft-wycofuje-xboxy-w-polsce-konsola-stala-sie-niedostepna-w-sprzedazy#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Xbox Series X consoles were nowhere to be found in stores. These reports sparked rumors that Microsoft would essentially retire from selling the hardware in the European country.</p>
<p>We reached out to Microsoft and received the following comment from a spokesperson:</p>
<p><em>While we expect to have limited Xbox Series X supply in Poland this holiday due to player demand, Xbox Series S consoles will still be available. Players can visit <a href="http://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xbox.com/regions</a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.</em></p>
<p>Fans of the Green team have been increasingly antsy following Microsoft's big policy change around first-party games. More games are getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ported</a> to other consoles (chiefly Sony's PlayStation 5) right away, and there's a growing concern that this, coupled with the consistently low sales for the past couple of years, might eventually persuade Microsoft to just give up on its own console ecosystem and focus on making games for all platforms instead.</p>
<p>It does not seem like there's much to worry about on that front for the time being. At the same time, there's no guarantee that the situation will not change in the future.</p>

While on court, a woman read their Christmas letters to Santa and handed out gifts. One kid, who worked <em>really </em>hard to get good grades this year, wanted a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-the-kotaku-review-1845588904">PlayStation 5</a></span> console. And that’s what the kid got. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can see how happy he is in the video below</a></span>. But that video also claims that after halftime, staff took away the PS5 and replaced it with a jersey. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/national/hornets-apologize/PWWEP5OU5PE76JIMXXOKDX36FM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Boston 25 </em>explained</a></span> that cheerleaders and other people involved in the halftime event were reportedly confused when staff took away the kid’s PS5 gift. Apparently, the child’s uncle, likely the adult in the grey and blue hoodie in the video above, knew ahead of time that the gift would be taken away and failed to share that info with his nephew.</p><p>As you might expect, a team worth billions cheaping out and taking away a kid’s Christmas gift after pretending to give it to him in front of cameras didn’t go over well online. People rightfully called out the team and its staff for the horrible prank, and within 24 hours the Hornets issued an apology. </p><p>On Tuesday, the team said its “on-court skit...missed the mark” and blamed it on “bad decision making and poor communication.” </p><p><em>“</em>Simply put, we turned the ball over and we apologize. We have reached out to the family and are committed to not only making it right but to exceeding expectations,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NickCarboniWCNC/status/1869132751464747392&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NickCarboniWCNC/status/1869132751464747392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the team in a statement shared by reporter Nick Carboni</a></span>. </p><p>“We will be providing the fan with the PS5 that he should have taken home last night along with a VIP experience to a future game. Our goal is and will remain to elevate the guest experience for every person that enters Spectrum Center, and to show our fans how much we appreciate their relentless support.”</p><p>And if you were wondering: The Hornets received karmic justice Monday night after taking away the kid’s PS5. The team went on to lose 121-108 to the Sixers. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sorry, you can’t get this for someone as a last-minute Christmas gift. </p><p>Another interesting piece of tech in this new TV is a wireless box that transmits any connected devices, like a PS5 or DVD player, to the screen without any wires. You just plug your consoles or whatever into the black box at the bottom of the TV and that’s it. Sounds neat and looks nice, but I do wonder how much delay it adds and if I would notice it while playing something like <em>Fortnite</em>. Sounds like something I need to test out! LG, send me one of these transparent future TVs ASAP! Or maybe I can convince <em>Kotaku </em>to buy me one for review purposes.

Ultimate</em>. Gioeli alleges he wasn’t rightly compensated for these and other uses of the song.</p><p>Gioeli says in the lawsuit that he has personally “maintained and registered” the song with licensing agency BMI, and also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/36292721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holds the copyright</a></span> that lists him as the author that holds the rights and permissions for the composition and lyrics. According to the lawsuit, Gioeli says he was only aware “Live &amp; Learn” had been used in the original release of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, and was only clued into all the other times it had been used by a fan in 2024.</p><p>Gioeli is looking to the court for clarity on who owns the masters of the original song and is seeking compensation for all the uses of the song beyond those in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Gioeli confirmed earlier this year that he had signed a deal with Paramount allowing the use of “Live &amp; Learn” in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. He has been in contact with at least two lawyers regarding the dispute, one from Sega who told him he didn’t have rights to the song, and another who allegedly called the song a “joint work,” making Gioeli entitled to “50 percent of Sega’s profits” from the song. The singer’s lawyer says that damages would include $500,000, along with at least another $500,000 for unpaid royalties.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Polygon</em>, Gioeli said he wants to maintain his relationship with Sega and doesn’t want this to sully the memories fans have made with Crush 40’s music.</p><p>“I have no comment other than my desire to maintain the preservation of a long standing beautiful relationship with Sega,” Gioeli said in his statement to <em>Polygon</em>. “I do not want fans to draw conclusions or be disrupted from the beautiful memories we have made collectively with this music. I believe and hope we will come to a peaceful settlement that will be fair and just.”</p><p>Crush 40 have been featured in several <em>Sonic</em> games since the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, having contributed music to games like <em>Sonic Heroes</em>, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, and <em>Sonic and the Black Knight</em>. Though their contributions to the series have become more scarce in recent years, their music has been re-used in several games, including this year’s <em>Shadow Generations</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In theory, it ought to be as good a time as ever to be a gamer on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Classic console emulators have rolled out to the platform for the first time, and they work great. There are strong libraries of non-skeezy mobile games on Apple Arcade and Netflix Games, streaming via Xbox and PlayStation services is continuing apace, and there are even a few AAA console games now running natively on the platform, like Assassin's Creed and Resident Evil titles.</p>
<p>Some of those games need a traditional, dual-stick game controller to work well, though, and Apple bafflingly offers no first-party solution for this.</p>
<p>Yes, you can sync popular Bluetooth controllers from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and 8bitdo with your iPhone, but that's not really the ideal answer—your iPhone isn't a big TV sitting across the room or a computer monitor propped up on your desk.</p>
<p>A few companies have jumped in to solve this with attachable controllers that give the iPhone a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck-like form factor (albeit a lot smaller). There's a wide range of quality, though, and some of the ones you'll see advertised aren't very well made.</p>
<p>There's some debate out there, but there's one that just about anyone will at least put up for consideration: the Backbone One. That's the one I picked for my new iPhone 16 Pro Max, which I have loaded with emulators and tons of games.</p>
<p>Since many folks are about to get iPhone 16s for the holidays and might be in the market for something similar, I figured it'd be a good time to write some quick impressions, including pros and cons. Is this thing worth a $99 price tag? What about its subscription-based app?</p>
<h2>Switching from the Razer Kishi</h2>
<p>Here's some background, real quick: I previously owned an iPhone 13 Pro, and I played a lot of <em>Diablo Immortal</em>. I wanted to try the controller experience with that game, so I bought a first-generation Razer Kishi—which I liked for the most part. It had excellent thumbsticks that felt similar to those you'd find on an Xbox controller, if a little bit softer.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That said, its design involved a back that loosened up and flexed to fit different kinds of phones, but I found it annoying to take on or off because it immediately crumbled into a folding mess. The big issue that made me go with something else, though, was that the controller worked with a Lightning port, and my new iPhone traded that for USB-C. That's a good change, overall, but it did mean I had to replace some things.</p>
<p>The Kishi I had is now discontinued, and it's been replaced with the Kishi V2, which looks... less appealing to me. That's because it ditches those Xbox-like sticks for ones more similar to what you see with a Nintendo Switch. There's less range of motion and less stability.</p>

<p>The Backbone One has similar drawbacks, but I was drawn to the Backbone as an alternative partly because I had enough complaints about the Kishi that I wanted to roll the dice on something new. I also wanted a change because there's a version with PlayStation button symbols—and I planned to primarily play PS1 games in an emulator as well as stream PS5 games to the device instead of a PlayStation Portal.</p>
<h2>Solid hardware</h2>
<p>One of my big complaints about the first-generation Kishi (the folding and flimsy back) isn't an issue with the Backbone One. It's right there in the name: This accessory has a sturdy plastic backbone that keeps things nice and stable.</p>
<p>The PlayStation version I got has face buttons and a directional pad that seem like good miniature counterparts to the buttons on Sony's DualSense controller. The triggers and sticks offer much shallower and less precise control than the DualSense, though—they closely resemble the triggers and sticks on the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons.</p>

<p>I feel that's a big downside. It's fine for some games, but if you're playing any game built around quickly and accurately aiming in a 3D environment, you'll feel the downgrade compared to a real controller.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The product feels quite sturdy to hold and use, and it doesn't seem likely to break anytime soon. The only thing that bugs me on that front is that the placement of the USB-C port for connecting to the phone is in a place where it takes enough force to insert or remove it that I'm worried about wear and tear on the ports on either my phone or the controller. Time will tell on that front.</p>

<h2>There’s an app, but...</h2>
<p>The Backbone One is not just a hardware product, even though I think it'd be a perfectly good product without any kind of software or service component.</p>
<p>There is a Backbone app that closely resembles the PlayStation 5's home screen interface (this is not just for the PlayStation version of the controller, to be clear). It offers a horizontally scrolling list of games from multiple sources like streaming services, mobile game subscription services, or just what's installed on your device. It also includes voice chat, multiplayer lobbies, streaming to Twitch, and content like video highlights from games.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Unfortunately, all this requires a $40 annual subscription after a one-month trial. The good news is that you don't have to pay for the Backbone One's subscription service to use it as a controller with your games and emulators.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone anywhere was asking for a subscription-based app for their mobile game controller. The fact that one is offered proves two things. First, it shows you just how niche this kind of product still is (and transitively, the current state of playing traditional, console-style games on iPhone) that the company that made it felt this was necessary to make a sufficient amount of money.</p>
<p>Second, it shows how much work Apple still needs to do to bake these features into the OS to make iOS/iPadOS a platform that is competitive with offerings from Sony, Microsoft, or even Nintendo in terms of appeal for core rather than casual gamers. That involves more than just porting a few AAA titles.</p>

        <div>
          
          
<h2>The state of iPhone gaming</h2>
<p>The Backbone One is a nice piece of hardware, but many games you might be excited to play with it are better played elsewhere or with something else.</p>
<p>Hit games with controller support like <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>, and <em>Infinity Nikki</em> all have excellent touch-based control schemes, making using a gamepad simply a matter of preference rather than a requirement.</p>
<p>While Apple is working with publishers like Capcom and Ubisoft to bring some hardcore console titles to the platform, that all still seems like just dipping toes in the water at this point, because they're such a tiny slice of what's on offer for PlayStation, Xbox, PC, or even Nintendo Switch players.</p>
<p>In theory, AAA game developers should be excited at the prospect of having iPhone players as a market—the install base of the iPhone absolutely dwarfs all home and handheld consoles combined. But they're facing two barriers. The first is a chicken-and-egg problem: Only the most recent iPhones (iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 16 series) have supported those console AAA titles, and it will take a few years before most iPhone owners catch up.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Emulators like RetroArch (seen here running on an iPhone 16 Pro Max) are the main use case of the Backbone One.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The second is that modern AAA games are immensely expensive to produce, and they (thankfully) don't typically have robust enough in-game monetization paths to be distributed for free. That means that to profit and not cannibalize console and PC sales, publishers need to sell games for much higher up-front costs than mobile players are accustomed to.</p>
<p>So if mobile-first hardcore games are best played with touchscreens, and gamepad-first console games haven't hit their stride on the platform yet, what's the point of spending $100 on a Backbone One?</p>
<p>The answer is emulators, for both classic and homebrew games. For that, I've been pleased with the Backbone One. But if your goal is to play modern games, the time still hasn't quite come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/vote-for-your-favorite-games-of-2024-in-the-ign-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A bracket of 64 titles will crown one ultimate winner.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">From iconic names like Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy to indie sensations like Balatro and Animal Well, 2024 has provided gamers with a variety of incredible experiences. IGN is in the process of picking our game of the year, but now you have the chance to have your voice heard too in the IGN People’s Choice Tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With our partners at Truth, we’ve selected 64 of the best titles of the year to be placed in a bracket and randomly sorted into groups. They’ll go head-to-head, with the winner moving on to the next round and the loser being eliminated. As the rounds progress, the competition will get tougher, until there’s only one title left standing as the fan-voted Game of the Year. If you’re familiar with how March Madness brackets work, it’s the same concept.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Tournament Schedule and How to Vote</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Voting will take place on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/igndotcom/?hl=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN’s Instagram</u></a> starting today, December 18. We’ll post the matchups to our Instagram stories around 3 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. CT / 12 p.m. PT, and you’ll have 24 hours to vote. The 32 winners will move on to the next round, where the process will repeat. Here are the dates when each round will be posted (around the same times listed above), so make sure to check back on our Instagram stories to continue voting for your favorite games:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Round 1: December 18</li><li>Round 2: December 20</li><li>Round 3: December 23</li><li>Quarterfinals: December 27</li><li>Semifinals: December 30</li><li>Finals: December 31</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Which Games Are Grouped Together?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, the bracket placements of the 64 games we selected were randomized. They were split up into four groups, like the regions of March Madness. Group 1 is led by some heavy hitters: Helldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. But they’ll have to go up against breakout indie Animal Well. Plus, three popular sports games: Madden NFL 25, College Football 25, and MLB The Show 24. And you can’t look past the beautiful visuals of Unicorn Overlord and Infinity Nikki.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 2 is led by the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, but it’ll face stiff competition from a trio of RPGs — Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance. There’s also heralded remasters and remakes from Nintendo with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And we can’t leave out the technical marvel Senua’a Sage: Hellblade II, or another standout indie in Lorelai and the Laser Eyes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Group 3 ended up stacked with three games that have been cleaning up during awards season: Astro Bot, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Black Myth: Wukong. They’re joined by an eclectic group of competitors. There’s entries from massive franchises in Star Wars Outlaws and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (which will face off against each other in Round 1). There’s games from other long-running series in Tekken 8 and Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble. There’s the latest version of sports franchises in EA Sports FC 25 and NBA 2K25. But also some notable new IPs with Stellar Blade and Slitterhead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding things out, Group 4 is also full of some big names. First, there’s indie darling Balatro, which has also done very well for itself this awards season. But it’ll have to get through two huge RPG sequels in Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Dragon’s Dogma 2, as well as a popular RPG remake in Persona 3 Reload. And they’ll be up against several family-friendly opponents in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, LEGO Horizon Adventures, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and The Plucky Squire. Not to mention the often overlooked Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown and surprise hit Enshrouded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see, this year is going to be a hotly contested race. So make sure you head over to Instagram to vote for each matchup and help determine which games will move on and which will be sent packing. It’ll all build to a big reveal of the fan voted Game of the Year. Happy voting!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-this-week.1064874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew support is coming. The developers of the digital TTRPG, Riftweaver, announced they would be rolling out more custom features for Game Masters earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting with music</a>. Starting this week, making custom NPCs will be added to their tools.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC Homebrew announcement</h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew update was announced via <a href="https://x.com/FablecraftGame/status/1869417434958205409" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) through the official <em>Fablecraft</em> account. The post was a one minute, forty-seven second video showing the feature in action.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=46B0licP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=o0FY1M-Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video shows one of the features called NPC Copy &amp; Customize. As the name entails, it allows you to take a preexisting NPC statblock, replicate it, then add custom text and images.</p>

<p>The video demonstrates this by taking a Meadow Hound creature and making it appear as one of the developer's dogs, Skipper. Players can give the NPCs custom names, subtitles, background information, description, token size, whether they are friend or foe, and their preferred region.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew feature allows you to import images into the game. The image in question is limited to 10 MB and a JPG or PNG at 1920x 1080 resolution is recommended. The image can be adjusted and cropped in-game once it is uploaded.</p>

<p>There is also a check box that must be hit stating the image adheres to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Terms of Service. Obviously this is in place to prevent bad actors from uploading offensive, inflammatory, or otherwise transgressive images into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=1VvhT2nK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=xFxSVshY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Custom NPCs made in this way or put into their own custom character area of the NPC sidetray, allowing Game Masters to quickly find and utilize their creations.</p>

<p>The feature is one more step towards <em>Fablecraft's</em> intended goal of making a digital RPG where players can enjoy the fantasy of a tabletop experience without in-depth knowledge of a certain RPG system. It's a fantasy so appealing the professional Game Master service <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">StartPlaying</a> partnered with them.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025.1064841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike players in 2025 will have the opportunity to capitalize on an entirely new landscape. Following post-Major roster changes and new rules implemented by Valve, the competitive CS2 scene will feel drastically different compared to years past.</p>



<p>Many of the same players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who dominated the 2024 season</a> will almost certainly do so again in 2025. Obviously you should be watching established greats like donk, m0NESY, ZywOo, and others next year. But rather than highlight the best players of 2024 who will repeat success again next year, we’re going to look at players ready to break into the top echelon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-to-watch-in-2025">Best CS2 Players to Watch in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-malbsmd-samayoa">Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</h3>



<p>With long-time rifler Nikola “NiKo” Kovač set to depart for Falcons, G2 is looking to Argentinian rising star malbsMd to step up another level. malbsMd was brought in from North American roster M80 this past summer and made an immediate impact on G2. He showcased his star capabilities at some of the biggest events of the year, including the recent Shanghai Major. NiKo has big shoes to fill, but with G2 also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly holding on to superstar AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>, malbsMd is in a great position to take a huge leap forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-roland-ultimate-tomkowiak">Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s no shortage of incredible AWPers in CS2, and Team Liquid’s ultimate looks primed and ready to reach that top tier. Liquid grabbed ultimate from the Polish roster of Illuminar Gaming this past year, and outside of IEM Rio and the final BLAST events, he’s been splendid. At his first ever Major, he was a bright spot during Liquid’s playoff run, providing incredible value as both an AWPer and a secondary entry player.</p>



<h3 id="h-dorian-xertion-berman">Dorian “xertioN” Berman</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The current MOUZ lineup is absolutely stacked with young talent, but xertioN gets the nod here. The Israeli 20-year-old player is a prolific main entry player, with an ability to properly utilize utility in a way that’s invaluable to MOUZ. MOUZ made a number of deep playoff runs this year, and won ESL Pro League Season 19, thanks to spectacular play from xertioN. Since his return from a VAC ban, Jimi “Jimpphat” Salo has also been spectacular for MOUZ.</p>



<p>Who else is worth watching when the CS2 2025 season begins?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

		<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance is going to be delisted, Tuque Games and Wizard of the Coast have confirmed. The game will be available until February 24th, 2025 and then will be removed from all digital storefronts on that day. The online servers will also be switched off, though the single player campaign will still be playable for those who own Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Alliance – Official Cinematic Launch Trailer | PS5, PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbATLsaF8iE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the team said, “We will be shutting down (shut down) the Dark Alliance servers on 2/24/2025 and it will no longer be available to purchase starting that day. The base game and all DLC are still available to play in offline single player by anyone who currently owns it.”</p>

<p>In our Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance review, Reuben said, <em>“Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance fails to live up to both the potential of its placement in the D&amp;D canon and the legacy of the Dark Alliance name. As a mediocre-to-good game, depending on whether you’re alone or with friends, the whole experience is sluggish and dull in execution, and sails close to the average tabletop D&amp;D session where you play for four hours and somehow only walk down a single corridor, but without the enjoyment that comes with that experience.”</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-year-2-content-is-planned-for-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-skull-and-bones.1064793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-year-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft plans to release year 2 content for its quadruple A game Skull and Bones.</p>



<p>That’s according to sources who have knowledge of the plans for the pirate action-adventure game.</p>



<p>Year 2 Season 1 is set to kick off sometime early next year with brand-new PvP gamemodes, places of interest (POIs), new world tiers, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also understood that Ubisoft is exploring more premium crossover events, with one source saying that one idea includes a Black Flag crossover event around the time of the release of Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake (codenamed Obsidian). But whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The news that Skull and Bones will be having Year 2 of content might surprise some, as the publisher <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently canceled XDefiant</a>, its free-to-play offering that saw nearly 300 people lose their jobs.</p>



<div><p>However, sources tell me that Ubisoft is fully committed to continuing the game’s support and that the player numbers “might surprise people.” Still, Insider Gaming could not verify the game’s current player count statistics.  At the time of writing, though, Skull and Bones get just shy of a peak of 200 concurrent players in 24 hours on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p><p>The game is currently slashed from its £49.99 price tag to just £20.00&nbsp;on the <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/skull-and-bones/6295077a27efc536e38350a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft store page</a>, with the publisher also offering a 6-hour free demo for those on PC should you wish to try.</p></div>



<p>Earlier this year, Insider Gaming reported that one week after the games release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skull and Bones saw an estimated 850,000 players</a>, which also included those who had played via Ubisoft’s free 8-hour game trial.</p>



<p>What do you think of Skull and Bones nearly a year on? Will you be giving Year 2 content a go? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It lets players dig through their deck quicker and pull the likes of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir to execute the deck's best play, removing some of the random chance that's perhaps the Mewtwo ex deck's greatest flaw.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/vap-1734544859120.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Starmie ex, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">a new Vaporeon variant threatens to make the infamous Misty card even more powerful</a>.

Pidgeot ex, for example, despite being weak to Electric Pokémon like Pikachu, has an ability that works directly against Pikachu ex's.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/pidgeot-1734544909048.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A three Colorless Energy attack does 80 damage plus 20 more for each of its opponent's Benched Pokémon.

A new Tauros card is fairly simple, being a basic Pokémon with 100 HP and a single attack called Fighting Tackle. It does 40 damage for three Colorless Energy, unless its opponent is an ex Pokémon, in which case it does 120 damage.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/tauror-1734544948531.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This won't take down Mewtwo ex in one hit, nor Charizard ex, nor Starmie ex, but is just enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit.

A PS5 was even seemingly given to one young fan attending a Hornets game at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina earlier this week. The NBA team brought the kid out to the court and pretended to give him a PS5 for Christmas before quickly taking it back after the cameras cut away.</p><p>The giveaway was captured on social media by Adam Turner, who shared the video below.

		<p>Lost Soul Aside has re-emerged after quite the silence, and there is a new trailer confirming that the game will be out in 2025 for PS5 and PC. Lost Soul Aside first appeared on the radar back in 2016 for PS4, and was originally set to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/24/lost-soul-aside-becomes-timed-exclusive-on-ps4/">coming out in 2018</a>. The last we heard of the game was in 2021, when it was confirmed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/lost-soul-aside-final-fantasy-style-game-ps5/">Lost Soul Aside would be getting a PS5 release</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3hVP2IEreI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lost Soul Aside has been inspired by the Final Fantasy series as well as other RPGs and action games, with the story centred around the hero trying to save his sister, and all of humankind, in a world that is being invaded by forces from another dimension. It is a single player action-adventure RPG with fast paced combat using weapons and abilities, which will come in handy against the world of interdimensional invaders and bosses.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside is a project from &nbsp;solo developer Bing Yang, who has been building up Lost Soul Aside which would explain why it has taken so long to come close to release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324420/one-billion-users-card-game-social-network-techdirt-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My social network was booming. I had attracted top-tier users: the coveted Trendsetter, the popularity-lured Investor. I had bested server problems and bad press. Then, somebody picked a particularly unlucky card out of the One Billion Users deck I was testing. Sixty seconds later, I had lost it all.</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mmasnick/one-billion-users-the-social-media-card-game">One Billion Users</a> is a new card game from Techdirt and Diegetic Games, and at its best, it lends itself to moments like this. Currently in its last days on Kickstarter, intended to fund a single run of the game rather than a wide release, it’s the latest in a string of projects from the team-up — including the digital games <em>Moderator Mayhem</em> and <em>Trust &amp; Safety Tycoon</em> as well as<em> </em>CIA: Collect It All, a card game built on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/21/17374054/cia-collect-it-all-declassified-training-tabletop-card-game">real CIA training materials</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One Billion Users<em> </em>is a lot less nerdy than any of these. It’s inspired by the relatively simple 1906 racing-themed card game Touring, better known through a popular 1950s adaptation called Mille Bornes.&nbsp;Only, instead of trying to drive the fastest while sandbagging competitors, you’re trying to build the biggest social network while sabotaging everyone else.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A set of blocker, community, influencer, hotfix, and event cards.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The game, for two to four players, involves drawing and playing cards that will either help build your own social platform or stop someone else from growing theirs. The most basic is a “community” card, which represents a number of users joining a platform. Since the goal is to outpace everyone else’s growth, you can also play “blocker” cards (like “low on funds” or “server overload”) on an opponent’s network, either limiting or completely stopping them from putting down community cards. If a blocker is played on you, you can resolve it by playing a “hotfix” card (“server upgrade,” for instance) or sacrificing a certain number of other cards.</p><p>Techdirt founder Mike Masnick says that while mulling a follow-up to the CIA card game, he was inspired by playing Mille Bornes with his family, then discovering its public domain predecessor Touring. The team considered a few different themes — “espionage, cryptocurrency, AI, and even the general worship of tech entrepreneurs,” Masnick says. They settled on social networks, and One Billion Users was born.</p><p>Admittedly, most networks don’t —&nbsp;as far as the public knows — spend a lot of time trying to literally break competitors’ sites. But while the blocker system mostly grew out of its source material, Masnick still says it “generally felt realistic in tone,” particularly as companies try to capitalize on each other’s problems. (Masnick sits on the board of Bluesky, which has recently lured millions of Twitter refugees by doing exactly that.) And in the game’s defense, remember when Facebook and Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents">started sabotaging</a> each other’s friend-finding tools?</p><p>One Billion Users<em>’</em> core formula is very similar to Touring and Mille Bornes — you’re adding users instead of mileage, playing blockers instead of car breakdowns, and resolving them with hotfixes instead of things like spare tires. But the game adds a few major, thematically appropriate mechanics.</p><p>The first big change is a mechanic called “toxicity.” Every community card in your network adds a varying amount of it, and if your ratio of toxicity to users at the end of the game is too high, you’ll be penalized. It also matters occasionally throughout the game: a “toxic culture” blocker, for instance, means you can <em>only </em>add highly toxic community cards to your network.</p><div><p>“Networks in the game pretty quickly develop a kind of culture”</p></div><p>The second is influencers: cards representing big-time users with dedicated communities, which are drawn and automatically handed to the player who meets their condition. Common conditions include joining the biggest or smallest network, but there are more idiosyncratic ones, like the Contrarian, who’s drawn to the most toxic network. Players can steal influencers from each other, essentially conducting the card game version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298963/ninja-shroud-mixer-facebook-gaming-twitch">Microsoft’s Mixer signing Ninja</a>.</p><p>Another added bit of complexity are “event” cards, which either temporarily change the rules of play or require everyone to take an action. That unlucky card above, for instance, forced every influencer to reevaluate which network they were joining… and it turned out, my community no longer served their needs.</p><p>Where <em>Trust &amp; Safety Tycoon</em> is a pretty rigorous (if tongue-in-cheek) attempt to convey how hard running a social network is, One Billion Users is far more impressionistic. Its cards hold some commentary on social media and the tech industry, but its appeal remains very similar to the satisfaction of screwing over other drivers with road hazards. Conversely, if you’ve experienced the frustration of being constantly stalled by hazards in Mille Bornes, One Billion Users makes it easier to fix them — but my play group still frequently got stuck in doldrums.</p><p>My playthroughs of One Billion Users<em> </em>varied heavily based on how the deck was stacked. It was possible to end up with a fun balance of growth and sabotage. It was also easy to end up with a hand stuffed with hotfix cards during numerous rounds where nobody was playing blockers or a bunch of influencer-stealing cards in a game where none of the influencers had yet appeared.&nbsp;Also, nobody I played with wanted to tally its fairly complex points system at the end, including the toxicity penalty. (There’s an optional mechanic that adds extra conditions themed after specific networks —&nbsp;it’s a fun idea, but also <em>even more tallying</em>.) On our internet, whoever signed up the most users won, quality of life be damned.&nbsp;</p><p>One Billion Users<em>’</em> exact rules are still in flux, and it’s possible some of this will change. But ultimately, as a longtime spectator of social media shenanigans, my favorite part was deciding which social network I was building. My influencer-filled stronghold? The golden age of Twitter. Its sad, empty shell? Now I was running X.</p><p>Apparently, I wasn’t the only one doing that. “I find it interesting to see how networks in the game pretty quickly develop a kind of culture,” Masnick says. One of his testers, a high schooler, realized midway through the game that his network was hopelessly and intractably toxic. His response, announced to the rest of the table as he embraced the chaos? “He was ‘going full Reddit.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After that, selected winners will be able to buy the limited-edition figures from January 20-26.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1869299061825691813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/McDonaldsJapan/status/1869299061825691813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A December 18 tweet</a></span> from McDonald’s Japan further confirms the <em>Evangelion </em>collaboration is real. It’s likely to be officially announced in the next 24 hours. </p><p>This latest collab is far from McDonald’s first. Earlier this year, the fast food giant did a large crossover promotion with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yugioh-hello-kitty-mcdonalds-happy-meal-toys-1851325182?_gl=1*i776f9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDU0ODU2Mi4xNDcuMC4xNzM0NTQ4NTYyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yugioh-hello-kitty-mcdonalds-happy-meal-toys-1851325182?_gl=1*i776f9*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDU0ODU2Mi4xNDcuMC4xNzM0NTQ4NTYyLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em> and <em>Hello Kitty</em></a></span>.

McDonald’s crossover promotions tend to be regional and not global, so if you want some of these transforming toys, you’ll need to live in Japan or be prepared to pay a premium on eBay next year. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He can use his Chaos Control and Chaos Shift abilities, which lock enemies and environments in place. These powers can be unlocked by completing Shadow's challenges.</p><p>Players can enter Tails' Challenges to unlock Shadow to use in Adventure mode. There are also six new Shadow-themed statues to collect, a reworked tutorial, and new music tracks.</p><p>Sega celebrated Sonic's favorite anti-hero quite a lot this year.

                <p>The holidays are here, which means imminent panic trying to score the perfect gift and Mariah Carey dominating the airwaves. Now, Carey is possibly adding another notch to her pop-culture-icon crown by taking her Santa catsuit to Fortnite.</p><p>Frequent Fortnite leaker Shiina has revealed that Mariah Carey will be heading to the game as a skin as part of the upcoming Winterfest event, donning her "All I Want For Christmas Is You" apparel. Along for the sleigh ride will be Snoop Dogg and Shaq--the latter whom was just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shaq-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526822/" data-ref-id="1100-6526822">added a few months back</a>--also wearing festive looking to get players in the Christmas spirit.</p><p>Additional leaks have suggested that with the outfit, Mariah will also have emotes and bonus animations such as defrosting from an ice block, which stems from a joke the star eventually embraced and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporated into her own socials</a> during this time of the year.</p><p>The 2024 Winterfest is set to kick off on December 20, running through January 7. Players are expecting to unlock Mariah after the downtime for the v33.11 update ends. Epic Games has not given any official timeline on when you can access the Songtress, so players will have to keep their eyes peeled this week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-already-profitable-says-gsc-investor-and-it-might-be-adapted-to-netflix/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a few days after the debut of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl that over a million units of the game had already been sold. That is in addition to all the PC and Xbox users playing it through Game Pass. The game was in development for a very long time, though, raising questions about its&nbsp;profitability.</p>
<p>However, GSC Game World investor Maksym Krippa told <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes Ukraine</a> that STALKER 2 is actually already profitable, despite the company's expense of 'tens of millions of dollars' for development and marketing. Moreover, Krippa also revealed that talks are underway with Netflix for a potential adaptation. The game would join a growing list of game adaptations making it to the small and big screen, as film and TV production companies realize the intrinsic potential of the largest game franchises.</p>
<p>On TV, the most successful adaptations have been The Last of Us on HBO and Fallout on Amazon Prime Video. Twisted Metal and Like a Dragon: Yakuza got mixed receptions in their debut seasons, while Resident Evil and Halo have already been canceled after one and two seasons, respectively.</p>
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog movies and Uncharted have recently been successful in theaters, though the real blockbuster was The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> all records for a film adaptation. On the other hand, the Borderlands movie was absolutely terrible in terms of box office revenue and reception alike.</p>
<p>Let's hope the STALKER 2 film or TV, if it does happen, is a quality one. Meanwhile, GSC Game World continues to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-0-3-delivers-more-crash-and-bug-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> the game with updates. There's a lot more on the way, including modding tools, multiplayer, DLCs, and more enhancements to the experience. The Ukrainian developer is committed to supporting the latest entry in its flagship series for a long time.</p>
